<P>
   (Phoenix) - Arizona doesn't commit enough dollars to programs
for children learning English, and it shoves them into classrooms
with teachers unprepared to help them, a federal judge in Tucson
decided this week.
</P>
<P>
   However, U.S. District Judge Alfredo Marquez stopped short of
ruling that the AIMS graduation test discrimi nates against
students who don't speak English well.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's court order says the state has violated civil rights
and equal education opportunity laws, but it doesn't specify a
timetable for cor recting them or exactly how that would be carried
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, for years the state hasn't supported LEP
(limited-English pro ficient) programs like it should,'' said Tim
Hogan of the Arizona Center for Law in the Public Interest, which
sued on behalf of a Nogales mother in 1992. ``The state's going to
have to get to work here. There needs to be more resources to give
kids a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Department of Education officials agree that more funds are
needed, and they welcome the debate that the ruling surely will
bring, spokes woman Patricia Likens said. They also are ``gratified
to see students will still have the opportunity to meet the
standards on AIMS,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan said he may file another suit against the AIMS test now
that the first batch of results is out. Marquez heard testimony on
the test back in August, when no results were avail able. Recent
scores show that some groups of minority students did indeed turn
in lower scores than Whites.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joe Eddie Lopez hopes Mar quez's decision will provide a
boost to his bill, which would increase funding for limited-English
students from $162 per student to $621.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we have the decision, I don't see any other obstacle
in going forth,'' said Lopez, a Phoenix Demo crat.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 1242 would increase English as a Second Language
fund ing from $18 million a year statewide to $40 million. The bill
also would address a shortage of qualified ESL teachers by
establishing a $1 million block grant to reimburse tuition for
teachers who go back to school for bilingual-education training.
</P>
<P>
   Judge's decision or not, the Lopez bill could face problems
because the Legislature is in the middle of a two-year budget cycle
and reportedly only has about $36 million to appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez doesn't buy Republican reve nue projections and believes
the Legislature should avoid setting spending limits until updated
reve nue figures come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we wait until the end of the session, we will find there is
suffi cient money to take care of this need, as well as others,''
Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 11 years since the state analyzed the cost of
educating chil dren who speak limited English. State education
officials acknowledge that the money set aside for such students
should be at least three times as much as it is. The difference
falls to local school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $361 million spent to teach students English in the
1997-98 school year, $106 million came from federal funds and $15
million from state coffers. The rest, $240 million, came from
grants, donations, deseg regation money or contributions by public
and private entities. But state officials caution that it's unclear
whether the school districts spent the $240 million just on
language acqui sition programs.
</P>
<P>
   School districts say teaching in two languages requires double
the mate rials, and because there aren't enough teachers trained to
educate such students, districts sometimes go without.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been devastating if he (Marquez) had ruled
against this,'' said Hilda Carr-Gaona, bilin gual-education
director at Phoenix's Wilson Elementary School, where 62 percent of
students speak limited English.
</P>
<P>
   ``All districts will be happy about this,'' Joan Mason of the
Phoenix Union High School District said about the ruling. ``All
teachers need to take responsibility for these stu dents.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards, Marquez said
there wasn't relevant evidence to convince him that it should be
shelved.
</P>
<P>
   In August, a research professor at Arizona State University's
College of Education testified that more His panic and Black
students do worse on the Stanford 9 standardized test than their
White counterparts, based on scores from the Phoenix Union
district.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, however, said Phoenix's demographics are different
from those of Nogales, where the lawsuit originated in 1992.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ Titans running back Eddie George wasn't born on a
mountaintop in Tennessee, and he isn't king of the wild frontier,
but he is becoming a legendary figure in the Volunteer State.
<TEXT>
<P>
   George, who won the Heisman Trophy at Ohio State, is one victory
away from winning a Super Bowl ring if the Titans manage to upset
St. Louis at the Georgia Dome on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I run all the hills, lift all the weights and
sacrifice so much time _ to play in the Super Bowl,'' George said
at media day Tuesday. ``I'd play on concrete to be in a Super
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   To borrow a line from former Houston Oilers coach Bum Phillips,
if George isn't in a class by himself, it doesn't take long to call
roll.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was describing Earl Campbell, the greatest player in
franchise history. George has become the franchise's
second-greatest running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie's special, there's no doubt about that,'' said Titans
general manager Floyd Reese, who drafted George in 1996. ``He's
such a hard worker. He's tough. He plays hurt. He doesn't get
frustrated against eight- and nine-man fronts. And he's become a
pretty darn good receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Oilers didn't draft George because of his hands,
although he has been an excellent two-way threat with the Titans.
His legs are his bread and butter.
</P>
<P>
   In playoff victories over Buffalo, Indianapolis and
Jacksonville, the 6-3, 240-pound George has averaged 118 yards
rushing and 26.6 carries. If he rushes for 67 yards against the
Rams, he will break Campbell's franchise playoff record of 420.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth season, George ran for 1,304 yards, generated a
career-high 1,762 yards rushing and receiving, scored 13 touchdowns
and earned his third consecutive trip to the Pro Bowl. He joined
Campbell, Eric Dickerson and Barry Sanders as the only players in
NFL history to rush for more than 1,300 yards in each of their
first four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans are 20-5 when George rushes for at least 100 yards,
including 9-1 this season.
</P>
<P>
   In his first three seasons, George was notorious for being a
fast starter and a slow finisher. He reversed that trend this
season. Over the last 11 games, George has carried 224 times for
1,027 yards, including five 100-yard performances, for an average
of 4.6 yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   This week is a good time to reflect on the 1996 draft and the
wheeling and dealing done byReese in his crowning achievement as a
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   They were still in Houston in April 1996, and they wanted what
coach Jeff Fisher called a ``franchise running back, a big-time
player who could absorb punishment and wear down defenses in the
fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers had the ninth pick in the first round. In his boldest
move, Reese traded down with Oakland into the 17th spot and
acquired second-and fourth-round picks. Then, Reese dealt defensive
tackle Glenn Montgomery and that 17th pick to move up to the 14th
spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers selected George with the 14th pick. They used the
second-round choice on offensive tackle Jason Layman and the
fourth-round pick on offensive tackle Jon Runyan.
</P>
<P>
   Layman is a bust. He's on the team but doesn't start. The 6-7,
320-pound Runyan has developed into a premier offensive tackle who
is a major reason George is so effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you make a move like that, you do your homework,'' said
Rich Snead, the Titans' director of player personnel, who is in his
sixth year with the organization. ``We called around to try to
figure out what teams were looking for in front of us and behind
us. Floyd had a pretty good idea that we could move back up and get
Eddie.''
</P>
<P>
   When Reese traded up to the 14th spot, George had to slip by New
Orleans. The Saints needed a running back, but coach Jim Mora
selected cornerback Alex Molden.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wonder why Eddie was still available on the 14th
pick,'' Snead said. ``Well, people tend to overanalyze. Sometimes,
we just look for things to pick at.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Indianapolis combine in February '96, there were three
knocks on George: 1) He had gotten fat on the post-Heisman banquet
circuit; 2) he had a shoulder injury that could require surgery;
and 3) he couldn't catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to Ohio State and talked with (coach) John Cooper,''
Snead said. ``He told us that Eddie had no flaws. He said he'd
never said that about a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know what? He was right.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, George has become his club's emotional leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie's a big, powerful back,'' Runyan said. ``For a lineman,
it's good to know you've got a great runner like Eddie behind you.
He's a good guy to be around, too. It's not like he's one of the
quiet guys in the huddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only does he lead by example during the week and on Sundays,
but he has become more vocal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just say what I feel at the time, what's in my heart,''
George said. ``If something needs to be said, I'll say it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a rookie, I didn't say anything. We had guys like
Bruce Matthews and Cris Dishman. They would have told me to shut up
and run the ball. Over time, I became a veteran, and my role
evolved into leadership.''

BACKSTABBERS IN THE WORKPLACE SHOULD BE CONFRONTED FACE TO FACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   Backstabbing _ actually or figuratively
_ is a cowardly act.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most common workplace questions is how to deal with
backstabbers. The answer involves recognizing the stabber's
inherent cowardice.
</P>
<P>
   When you become aware that someone is undermining your efforts
or saying wrong or negative things about you behind your back, your
best defense is to confront the person directly.
</P>
<P>
   Direct confrontation requires courage. Many of us would rather
take flight than fight. Many others would rather suffer silently
and hope the nemesis goes away. Neither strategy works well.
</P>
<P>
   A backstabber wants direct confrontation even less than you do.
That knowledge becomes your strength. The best strategy is to tell
the backstabber to his or her face that you're aware of what's
going on, you want an explanation and you want it to stop.
</P>
<P>
   The backstabber may deny wrongdoing. If so, be prepared to tell
exactly what you know and how you know it. Don't be shy about
revealing your sources. If the backstabber knows others see the
problem, he or she will have lost what a bully needs most _
admiring support.
</P>
<P>
   The backstabber also may confess. If so, try to continue the
discussion so you understand the motivation. You may get insight
into insecurities or problems that may have been threatening the
backstabber's career. Make it clear you do not intend to be his or
her victim.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the response, tell the backstabber that the practice
must not continue. If it does, promise that you will take it to his
or her boss. It doesn't matter whether you intend to carry out the
threat; you're going for the scare tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims have trouble seeing a backstabber as a coward. They
see a malevolent person intent on prospering at others' expense, no
matter how it's done. Remember this: Cowards can be evil, but
they're still cowards.
</P>
<P>
   Confront them. They may be embarrassed or intimidated enough to
quit.

GOALIES AREN'T HELPING DUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Craig Hartsburg isn't happy, Guy Hebert is not
pleased, Dominic Roussel isn't satisfied, and the Mighty Ducks
aren't winning.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the trio's frustration? It's quite simple, the
Anaheim goalies haven't been making the crucial saves at the
critical moments during a 3-10-2 slide that has seen the Ducks fall
from sixth to 10th in the Western Conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made some mistakes over the past 15 games, but our
goaltending hasn't been very good,'' said Hartsburg, who decided
now is the time to challenge a goaltending tandem that has allowed
3.6 goals a game since Dec. 19 after allowing only 2.15 through
first 34 games. ``Up until this stretch it was a big part of our
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love our goalies, we have a great tandem, but they have to
be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as some of the highest strung athletes on a hockey team,
goalies are often spared criticism by coaches. But Hebert and
Roussel are easy-going types as goalies go. They didn't bat an eye
when Hartsburg's comments were relayed to them as they prepared for
tonight's game against the New York Islanders at The Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I was concerned, I was thinking the same thing,''
said Roussel, who is 0-2-1 and has allowed 13 goals in his last
three starts. ``My record is good (5-3-2), but my goals against
average (2.98) and save percentage (.893) aren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to reach a higher level and I'm working on that
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know (Hartsburg) is unhappy, but he's not as unhappy as I
am,'' said Hebert moments later. ``I don't think I'm playing
terrible, I'm just not playing to the level I'm accustomed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert was being touted as a possible all-star in early
December. Now he's being called out by his coach, who knows that
Anaheim's playoff chances could be riding on the shoulders of the
slightly built goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert realizes such expectations come with the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my mom found out I wanted to be a goalie she said `you
must want to be the hero or the goat,''' said Hebert with a grin.
``But I said `no, I just want to be the hero, forget the other
stuff.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, both Hebert and Roussel have seen both sides of
the spectrum. Hebert was brilliant in a recent win over St. Louis,
but he has allowed his share of soft goals, including two long
shots in a loss to Florida and one in last Saturday's heartbreaking
defeat in San Jose. Roussel shut out the Sharks in San Jose on Dec.
26 before slumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly comes with the territory,'' Hebert said of the
scrutiny. ``It's like a pitcher or a quarterback, you can't afford
to have a bad night.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially since the Ducks figure to be in a playoff dogfight
the rest of the season. It means coming up with a big save to cover
up teammate's mistake and limiting the amount you make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hockey isn't a perfect game,'' said Hartsburg. ``There are
going to be mistakes and right now that's where a guy like Guy can
help us . . . making a save.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert certainly has shown he can perform in pressure
situations. The Ducks' No. 1 goaltender since the beginning, Hebert
has 148 wins and 24 shutouts in an Anaheim uniform. He led the
Ducks to the playoffs in 1996-97, and again last season when he had
a career year (31 wins, 2.42 GAA, .922 save percentage and six
shutouts).
</P>
<P>
   ``I live with it every day of my career,'' Hebert said of the
pressure. ``You want to make the difference. You don't want to let
anybody down, not Paul (Kariya), Teemu (Selanne), Jason Marshall,
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg, who joked that he'd never want his son to play
goalie, said he has no doubts that Hebert and Roussel can do the
job, and that he's not trying to point fingers at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need everybody to play their best,'' he said. ``It's
not a matter of blaming anybody, it's about finding solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lots of confidence in them, if they have the same last
third of the season as they did first third we will be fine.''

NO SEPARATION OF SPORT AND STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Does standing up to Bud Selig, the nerdish
baseball commissioner, prove George W. Bush is a match for, say,
Saddam Hussein, the murderous Iraqi dictator?
</P>
<P>
   Does Bush's old-school approach to America's pastime stamp his
credentials as a conservative?
</P>
<P>
   Does Bush's performance as managing general partner of the Texas
Rangers from 1989 to 1998 say !ital!anything!off! about his
qualifications to be president of the United States?
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor seemed to suggest as much after his victory
in the Iowa caucuses Monday, opening night of the presidential
nominating season.
</P>
<P>
   CNN interviewer Larry King noted that Bush had been the only
major-league owner who voted against admitting wild-card teams to
the playoffs. ``Goes to show I stick to my principles,'' Bush
replied. ``And that's the kind of president I'm going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   To which King might have replied (but didn't): Are you also
going to be the kind of president who'd trade Sammy Sosa for Harold
Baines? (Bush recently called that Rangers-Cubs deal the biggest
mistake of his professional life.)
</P>
<P>
   The point here is not to make fun of George W. Bush. Or Harold
Baines.
</P>
<P>
   The point is to note yet another example of an unsettling trend
in American public life: These days you can hardly tune in a
political network without hearing about sports. These days you can
hardly tune in a sports network without hearing about politics.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who watch sports to escape from the real world,
or follow politics to escape from sports, this is bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson wears a lapel pin on nationally
televised games to promote his former New York Knicks teammate Bill
Bradley's presidential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson asks Super Bowl players to wear
American-flag stickers on their helmets to protest Georgia's flag,
which incorporates the Confederate flag. The NFL says that would
violate league rules.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson protests the firing of Ray Rhodes as the Green Bay
Packers' head coach, submitting that Rhodes was dismissed because
he's African-American, not because the Packers had their worst
record in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   A women's group in England protests Mike Tyson's upcoming fight
there, arguing he should be barred from the country because of his
1992 rape conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Maradona, the Argentina soccer great, praises ``the dignity of
the Cuban revolution'' and visits with Fidel Castro after arriving
in Havana to undergo treatment for cocaine addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Braves reliever John Rocker, whose neck is bigger than
his skull, offends everybody except his fellow American white
males.
</P>
<P>
   And Selig, feeling obligated to respond to Rocker's outburst,
orders him to undergo psychological testing. It's such an unlikely
solution to Rocker's problem, the commissioner achieves the
distinction of looking like a loser in a contest with mindless
hatred.
</P>
<P>
   For a sports fan or a political junkie, the mind races.
</P>
<P>
   The sports-politics overlap is not exactly new. The issue of
race spanned the past century. Muhammad Ali is an icon of the
boxing (ital)and(end ital) political worlds. Professional athletes
like Bradley, Jack Kemp and Jim Bunning have gone on to political
stardom. Richard Nixon drew up plays for the Washington Redskins
(who vetoed them).
</P>
<P>
   We've always thought politics do have a particular place in
sports, when politics are intrinsic to the event. Cold War tension,
for example, enhanced the significance of the United States' ice
hockey team's 1980 Olympic upset of the Soviet Union, made it a
triumph for our way of life.
</P>
<P>
   But what we're seeing now is politicians taking advantage of
sports' popularity and athletes' celebrity to publicize their
causes, the way they've been using Hollywood stars for years.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson admits he is daring the NBA to try to stop him from
wearing the Bradley pin, hoping to start a controversy that would
draw attention to his man's campaign. Our wish would be that the
NBA would stop him. If a coach can wear a Bradley button on his
suit, wouldn't the same freedom-of-expression principle allow
Shaquille O'Neal to sew an Al Gore patch on his jersey?
</P>
<P>
   Where would that lead? To the possibility that entire teams will
be divided by politics? To John Rocker wearing a patch promoting
!ital!his!off! beliefs? To Jesse Jackson trying to influence the
racial makeup of a team's roster?
</P>
<P>
   We also wish politicans would think twice about whether coaches
and athletes are the most flattering representatives. Do you want a
man whose sneakers are manufactured in a Third World sweatshop
discussing labor policy, a man who performs in a publicly financed
stadium touting fiscal conservatism, or a man who plays in the
Staples Center talking about the widening gap between rich and
poor?
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have to decide if they want to mix with athletes,
and athletes have to decide if they want to mix with politicians.
</P>
<P>
   It comes down to whether you'd want your cause associated with
guys who have scratched and clawed their way to victory, who play
fast and loose with the rules to win at any cost, and who spend
much of their working days in their underwear?
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the athletes... &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the bars had closed in Des Moines on Monday night, while
their supporters were still cheering or staring glumly into cans of
Diet Coke, the candidates in America's presidential election were
already in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Their planes were touching down at ghostly, snowbound airports
across New Hampshire in the early morning, where eager supporters
were welcoming them to the next task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   And so, for another four years, the Iowa caucuses are over. It
is hard not to feel a sense of anti-climax and even absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   This event, which has been built up into one of the defining
political moments of the American political season, has, in the
end, produced few surprises, done little to upset the political
applecart and left everyone standing (bar the hapless Republican
Senator Orrin Hatch).
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, there has been a blandness about the political
season so far that turns off even the more politically aware. It is
fashionable to ignore politics: there are, it might seem, no
fundamental differences on show.
</P>
<P>
   There is George W. Bush with his compassionate conservatism, and
Al Gore with his practical idealism, neither of them battle cries
calculated to thrill the heart and send the blood pounding in the
ears.
</P>
<P>
   Gush and Bore have somehow seemed destined to meet in an
election since birth. Both are in their early fifties, with perky,
tough and presentable wives; one was at Harvard, one at Yale; one
is a Methodist, one a Baptist _ it almost doesn't matter which is
which.
</P>
<P>
   Neither faced huge problems in winning by sizeable majorities in
Iowa; whatever happens in New Hampshire, neither looks in much
peril of escaping their party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   They are, it is true, the establishment candidates, sons of
political families. And that, it seems, was what the voters wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Though the candidates of the Christian right did better than
expected in Iowa, there was no Pat Robertson this year to charge
into the political stockyard, and though Pat Buchanan is around, he
looks unlikely to do much damage to anyone except himself.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, the only choice is Bill Bradley, a Senate
retread like Gore, and his star is dimming.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the voters backed establishment candidates _ and
probably will continue to do so _ says a lot about the two parties,
but also about the country.
</P>
<P>
   There is a widespread sense of contentment in the U.S. across
the middle class, and a desire to make sure that the economic boom
of the last eight years _ which will become the longest on record
next week _ doesn't stall before they can cash in their AOL shares.
</P>
<P>
   The polls show that people are concerned about morals, values
and a sense of something lost spiritually, so they want solidity
and character. But that doesn't mean that there aren't some
fundamental issues out there, waiting to be grasped; and the
candidates show some signs of tackling them, in an early-morning
kind of way. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The divide between the parties was very clear on the central
issue of how to handle prosperity. Like laboratory rats, the
Republicans are trained to react to this particular buzzer by going
for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The main field of conflict leading up to Iowa was over tax, with
each of the candidates taking a different approach to the same
question.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain and Bush differ over how much, and that in turn
conceals a wider difference about what the scope is for using the
surplus and who should benefit, but the principle is the same:
slash tax rates and hand the money back.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats want to prop up America's ailing and failing
health-care system. If you think the British system has problems,
then for God's sake don't look over the Atlantic for answers.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the Democrats want to expand health-care coverage, with
Bradley planning to spend more. Once the other candidates have gone
and the general election is under way, the outlines of a Gore-Bush
conflict _ tax cuts versus health care _ become clear. This isn't a
small issue, even if one disregards the sums in question _ hundreds
of billions of dollars. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   There is a great divide between the worlds of Gore and Bush,
once one gets over the fact that they are socially all but
indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   Bush comes from a tradition of Northeastern self-reliant
capitalism _ the family's Yankee side _ and a Texas-flavored
corporatism.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the government is there to execute people, arm the
Texas rangers and keep the world generally safe for what passes for
private enterprise, once one disregards tax breaks for the
petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, George W. believes in charitable endeavor and
what are now called ``faith-based organizations,'' his father's
``thousand points of light.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's heritage is the South of the civil-rights struggle, but
also the Great Society and (before that) the Tennessee Valley
Authority (Franklin Roosevelt's ``New Deal'' hydroelectricity
project).
</P>
<P>
   His world is built on the idea of reinventing government, but
with equal stress on both words: he wants to use government to do
things, and health care is just one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bill Clinton, Gore is a centrist Democrat who prefers to
use government to steer rather than to command, and whose
preference is for market solutions; but he still sees a role for
government.
</P>
<P>
   He was widely pilloried for claiming to have invented the
Internet, but the fact is that he seized on it quickly and early
and promoted government action to help create the information
super-highways that would make it a reality. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Internet is a telling issue. Gore is concerned that
sales over the Web, which are free of sales tax, will lead to a
massive collapse of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the real world, we cannot ignore the fact that our
democracy thrives in a federal system in which state and local
governments derive one-third of their revenue from sales taxes. Put
yourself in the position of governors and mayors. I do not think
that we can just stiff them as they contemplate a potential fiscal
catastrophe,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sees the same problem but prefers to leave it to the
market. ``I support the moratorium on Internet taxation. And I'll
support it for another three to five years, until we know,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard people on this stage say that e-commerce is going
to help mom-and-pop business on the town squares all across
America. They may be right. I don't know, and neither do you, and
so therefore I think it makes sense to extend the moratorium.''
That helps crystallise an issue, but also a style of governance. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just as it is fashionable to deride politics in general, it is
almost universally acknowledged that Iowa is the wrong place to
start an election.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot to be said in favor of this; but it must be
remembered that though the state is unrepresentative of the United
States in general, it is close to the major battlefield of 2000.
That will be the strip of states that extends from the Midwest to
the Northeast: Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   It was the white middle class and working class in these old
rust-belt states that gave Ronald Reagan the White House, because
their industries were collapsing and their cities were decaying and
they wanted change; and they gave it back to the Democrats when, at
the beginning of the 1990s, they were still down.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't enough just to talk about the politics of contentment
in America in the year 2000 and write the November elections off.
</P>
<P>
   This contentment has not been easily won, and there are
different strands to it _ the desire to see the boom continue, the
knowledge that it makes new departures possible, the fear that
prosperity is undermining other values, the environment and a sense
of order.
</P>
<P>
   All of those issues remain up for grabs this year. The
candidates will target the new politics of contentment through
polls, carefully crafted ads, the right color of suit and the
correct choice of music. But they are also tackling it through
ideas _ ideas that were road-tested in Iowa. &QL;

THIS SUPER BOWL IS HISTORICALLY DEFICIENT 
</HEADLINE>

 By LAURA VECSEY

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Super Bowl Resolution No. 1:
</P>
<P>
   Find a diehard Tennessee Titans fan who has waited his or her
entire life to watch the Titans play for all the marbles.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl Resolution No. 2:
</P>
<P>
   Find a long-suffering St. Louis Rams fan who has waited his or
her entire life for the glorious day in which the Rams _ _ the St.
Louis variety _ play for all the marbles.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there are no Titans or Rams fans who have waited their
entire lives for this moment?
</P>
<P>
   As the late, great Gilda Radner used to say: Never mind.
</P>
<P>
   One thing did seem certain Tuesday, when the NFL trotted out
both teams for the ritual Super Bowl Media Day:
</P>
<P>
   This is going to be a tough sell, this Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't like the '90s _ when Super Bowls were contested by
dynasties such as the Cowboys and 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   No, given the transient nature of this year's participants, it
takes a truly valiant effort to even care about a matchup that has
all the history and tradition of an Internet start-up company.
</P>
<P>
   From the NFC, we have the Rams. They hail from St. Louis by way
of Cleveland, Los Angeles and Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   And from the AFC, the Titans of Tennessee. Or more specifically,
the Titans of Nashville by way of Memphis and Houston _ and let's
put a special emphasis on Houston, since the roots, now dug up,
were deepest there.
</P>
<P>
   You remember, don't you? Bum Phillips? Earl Campbell? Warren
Moon? Powder blue uniforms? The way the Oilers would always lose in
the playoffs to Buffalo, and then skulk back to Texas, wondering
why their luck never changed?
</P>
<P>
   Now, if the Titans were still the Oilers, and still came from
Houston, that would be something to relate to. A team with a
history. A team with a past, a place.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Titans are running from the past. It's as if
they're trying to shed who they once were in order to downplay
their hideous, three-year trek _ one that landed them in a new
stadium in a smaller, different city hundreds of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a part of me that regrets us moving,'' said Titans
offensive lineman Bruce Matthews, a 16-year veteran who has played
for only one team ... sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Matthews was the only Titans player who continually
referred to his team as the ``Titans-slash-Oilers.'' He's a man
with a past, a past he's proud of.
</P>
<P>
   ``The move to Nashville was really a hard sell for me. It took
me awhile to even accept the situation and let me tell you, when I
first found out they were going to move the team, I was hot,''
Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't want to leave. Now I live there in the
off-season and I know how many people come up to me and wish us
success. We had some great times in Houston. It didn't work out,
but just by the sheer number of people who come up to me, I know
(the fans in Houston have) an allegience that's tough to see die.
The Oilers were there for 30-something years. It's hard to let it
go, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is a nation on the move. Political candidates, zippy
e-commerce, money-hungry sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' owner, Georgia Frontiere, made a slight spectacle of
herself last Sunday after her team won the NFC title. She admitted
she did not know that the Super Bowl was going to be played in the
Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, a sense of geography is not the strong suit among
some of the NFL ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Titans-slash-Oilers have insight into what it takes
to get over the big hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say that moving from town to town, not having a true
home-field advantage, not having regular fans there for us, did
instill in us a certain toughness,'' Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team, we're battle-tested. And I think those
disadvantages turned out to be a important force on the team
because it forced players into buying into what the coaches had to
say,'' Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   Quite an interesting recipe for the making of Super Bowl teams,
no?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the bars had closed in Des Moines on Monday night, while
their supporters were still cheering or staring glumly into cans of
Diet Coke, the candidates in America's presidential election were
already in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Their planes were touching down at ghostly, snowbound airports
across New Hampshire in the early morning, where eager supporters
were welcoming them to the next task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   And so, for another four years, the Iowa caucuses are over. It
is hard not to feel a sense of anti-climax and even absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   This event, which has been built up into one of the defining
political moments of the American political season, has, in the
end, produced few surprises, done little to upset the political
applecart and left everyone standing (bar the hapless Republican
Senator Orrin Hatch).
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, there has been a blandness about the political
season so far that turns off even the more politically aware. It is
fashionable to ignore politics: there are, it might seem, no
fundamental differences on show.
</P>
<P>
   There is George W. Bush with his compassionate conservatism, and
Al Gore with his practical idealism, neither of them battle cries
calculated to thrill the heart and send the blood pounding in the
ears.
</P>
<P>
   Gush and Bore have somehow seemed destined to meet in an
election since birth. Both are in their early fifties, with perky,
tough and presentable wives; one was at Harvard, one at Yale; one
is a Methodist, one a Baptist _ it almost doesn't matter which is
which.
</P>
<P>
   Neither faced huge problems in winning by sizeable majorities in
Iowa; whatever happens in New Hampshire, neither looks in much
peril of escaping their party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   They are, it is true, the establishment candidates, sons of
political families. And that, it seems, was what the voters wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Though the candidates of the Christian right did better than
expected in Iowa, there was no Pat Robertson this year to charge
into the political stockyard, and though Pat Buchanan is around, he
looks unlikely to do much damage to anyone except himself.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, the only choice is Bill Bradley, a Senate
retread like Gore, and his star is dimming.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the voters backed establishment candidates _ and
probably will continue to do so _ says a lot about the two parties,
but also about the country.
</P>
<P>
   There is a widespread sense of contentment in the U.S. across
the middle class, and a desire to make sure that the economic boom
of the last eight years _ which will become the longest on record
next week _ doesn't stall before they can cash in their AOL shares.
</P>
<P>
   The polls show that people are concerned about morals, values
and a sense of something lost spiritually, so they want solidity
and character. But that doesn't mean that there aren't some
fundamental issues out there, waiting to be grasped; and the
candidates show some signs of tackling them, in an early-morning
kind of way. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The divide between the parties was very clear on the central
issue of how to handle prosperity. Like laboratory rats, the
Republicans are trained to react to this particular buzzer by going
for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The main field of conflict leading up to Iowa was over tax, with
each of the candidates taking a different approach to the same
question.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain and Bush differ over how much, and that in turn
conceals a wider difference about what the scope is for using the
surplus and who should benefit, but the principle is the same:
slash tax rates and hand the money back.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats want to prop up America's ailing and failing
health-care system. If you think the British system has problems,
then for God's sake don't look over the Atlantic for answers.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the Democrats want to expand health-care coverage, with
Bradley planning to spend more. Once the other candidates have gone
and the general election is under way, the outlines of a Gore-Bush
conflict _ tax cuts versus health care _ become clear. This isn't a
small issue, even if one disregards the sums in question _ hundreds
of billions of dollars. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a great divide between the worlds of Gore and Bush,
once one gets over the fact that they are socially all but
indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   Bush comes from a tradition of Northeastern self-reliant
capitalism _ the family's Yankee side _ and a Texas-flavored
corporatism.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the government is there to execute people, arm the
Texas rangers and keep the world generally safe for what passes for
private enterprise, once one disregards tax breaks for the
petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, George W. believes in charitable endeavor and
what are now called ``faith-based organizations,'' his father's
``thousand points of light.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's heritage is the South of the civil-rights struggle, but
also the Great Society and (before that) the Tennessee Valley
Authority (Franklin Roosevelt's ``New Deal'' hydroelectricity
project).
</P>
<P>
   His world is built on the idea of reinventing government, but
with equal stress on both words: he wants to use government to do
things, and health care is just one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bill Clinton, Gore is a centrist Democrat who prefers to
use government to steer rather than to command, and whose
preference is for market solutions; but he still sees a role for
government.
</P>
<P>
   He was widely pilloried for claiming to have invented the
Internet, but the fact is that he seized on it quickly and early
and promoted government action to help create the information
super-highways that would make it a reality. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Internet is a telling issue. Gore is concerned that
sales over the Web, which are free of sales tax, will lead to a
massive collapse of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the real world, we cannot ignore the fact that our
democracy thrives in a federal system in which state and local
governments derive one-third of their revenue from sales taxes. Put
yourself in the position of governors and mayors. I do not think
that we can just stiff them as they contemplate a potential fiscal
catastrophe,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sees the same problem but prefers to leave it to the
market. ``I support the moratorium on Internet taxation. And I'll
support it for another three to five years, until we know,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard people on this stage say that e-commerce is going
to help mom-and-pop business on the town squares all across
America. They may be right. I don't know, and neither do you, and
so therefore I think it makes sense to extend the moratorium.''
That helps crystallise an issue, but also a style of governance. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just as it is fashionable to deride politics in general, it is
almost universally acknowledged that Iowa is the wrong place to
start an election.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot to be said in favor of this; but it must be
remembered that though the state is unrepresentative of the United
States in general, it is close to the major battlefield of 2000.
That will be the strip of states that extends from the Midwest to
the Northeast: Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   It was the white middle class and working class in these old
rust-belt states that gave Ronald Reagan the White House, because
their industries were collapsing and their cities were decaying and
they wanted change; and they gave it back to the Democrats when, at
the beginning of the 1990s, they were still down.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't enough just to talk about the politics of contentment
in America in the year 2000 and write the November elections off.
</P>
<P>
   This contentment has not been easily won, and there are
different strands to it _ the desire to see the boom continue, the
knowledge that it makes new departures possible, the fear that
prosperity is undermining other values, the environment and a sense
of order.
</P>
<P>
   All of those issues remain up for grabs this year. The
candidates will target the new politics of contentment through
polls, carefully crafted ads, the right color of suit and the
correct choice of music. But they are also tackling it through
ideas _ ideas that were road-tested in Iowa. &QL;

KEARSE BEATS ODDS ON, OFF FIELD

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apparently, diamonds are a Freak's best friend, too.
</P>
<P>
   When Jevon Kearse, the Tennessee Titans' dazzling defensive end
who goes by the nickname ``The Freak,'' showed up for Super Bowl
XXXIV Media Day at the Georgia Dome Tuesday, he was wearing a newly
purchased symbol of his brilliant rookie season around his neck:
</P>
<P>
   A 3-inch, diamond-dominated silver cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got it last night,'' Kearse said with a shrug and a
smile. ``It's a nice-looking piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearse's newest trinket _ he also was wearing a
diamond-and-silver bracelet and huge diamond-stud earrings _ was
enough to leave even the hippest of the hip envious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a little sparkle, but that thing is major,'' said
Tyrese, the host of MTV Jams, who was wearing a silver-and-diamond
cross that looked like a Cracker Jack prize by comparison. ``The
budget is a little bigger on his end.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything has been coming up big for Kearse this season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite sliding to the Titans with the 16th pick in the first
round of the draft last April because too many teams considered him
a 'tweener _ too small to play defensive end, too big to play
linebacker _ Kearse led the AFC with a rookie-record 14{ sacks, was
voted to the Pro Bowl and is playing in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in after playing linebacker in college, I had no idea
I'd have this type of impact,'' Kearse admitted, when he often
stopped in mid-sentence to marvel at the moment and the swirl of
activity around him. ``I thought I was going to have to come off
the bench or be a third-down rusher. But I fared pretty well, and I
think I'm only going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearse doesn't just feel fortunate to be preparing to play in
the Super Bowl on Sunday, he knows he is lucky even to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Fort Myers, Fla., one of seven children raised by
a single mother, Lessie Mae Green. Before he was 21, five of his
male relatives had been shot and killed _ including his father,
Joseph Kearse Sr., who was killed eight months before Kearse was
born by a masked gunman in a pool hall; his grandfather, George
Kearse, who was murdered outside his home; and three years ago, his
younger half-brother, Demetris Green, who was killed in a drive-by
shooting in the housing project where the family lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up like that pretty much made me stronger,'' he said.
``I learned how to accept responsibility early because I had to
grow up fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearse wears a tattoo on his left arm to remember his
half-brother and bears the scars on his heart from losing his
grandfather, an uncle and a cousin, as well as the father he never
knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm on the field, I tell myself that the guy lining up
across from me could be the guy that shot my brother,'' Kearse
said.
</P>
<P>
   It also is on the football field where Kearse found the
discipline and determination to escape the life that claimed his
relatives and was constantly beckoning him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just made sure I got into the things that were important to
me _ school, football,'' he said. ``I was just determined not to
let the other temptations distract me.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Kearse is the only member of his family to graduate
from high school, and he is one semester shy of earning a degree
from the University of Florida in sociology.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is where Kearse picked up the nickname that remains so
appropriate _ The Freak.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teammates started calling me that,'' he said. ``They said
it was because I was making plays I shouldn't have been making.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Freak, as in freak of nature. He stands 6-foot-4 and
estimated his weight at 253 pounds. He looks even leaner, probably
because he has 4 percent body fat. He can run 40 yards in 4.41
seconds, has a 40-inch vertical jump and an 86-inch wingspan from
the tip of the long fingers on his right hand to the tip of the
long fingers on his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   But that's also Freak as in what Kearse is able to do on the
football field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jevon does the kind of things that can't be coached, that make
you go, `Wow,' '' Titans coach Jeff Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``Woe,'' as was the case in his first matchup with St. Louis
tackle Fred Miller in the Titans' 24-21 victory over the Rams on
Oct. 31. In a statement-making performance, Kearse harassed Miller
into six false starts, drew a holding penalty and also collected a
sack.
</P>
<P>
   If Miller allows Kearse to have another Freak-out performance
Sunday, the Rams once again will be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely would say it was my worst game, because I really
feel I let my team down,'' Miller said of that first game against
Kearse. ``I know a highlight of this game will be watching us
battle it out again. . . . I wasn't intimidated by him last time.
Unfortunately, things just didn't work out the way I wanted them to
against Jevon. He possesses a lot of tools and has a lot of
athleticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Difficult to stop? Obviously. Unstoppable? Not quite. Not yet,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In the Titans' victory over Jacksonville on Sunday in the AFC
Championship game, Jaguars tackle Leon Searcy limited Kearse to one
tackle and one assist and did not allow him to lay so much as one
long finger on Jacksonville quarterback Mark Brunell. The Jaguars
did give Searcy help at times by using a tight end to assist in
blocking Kearse, but for the most part Searcy handled him _
literally and figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   On several occasions, Searcy did what one would expect a
315-pound Pro Bowl tackle to do with an undersized rookie _ he
simply tossed Kearse to the turf.
</P>
<P>
   It was a difficult day for Kearse. But then he has survived
worse and more lasting hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up like I did, it definitely made me stronger and able
to overcome adversity,'' Kearse said, flashing a smile to match the
brilliance of the gaudy cross hanging from his neck. ``I was
determined that what happened to other members of my family didn't
happen to myself.''

L.A. SCHOOL BOARD VOTES DOWN BELMONT PROJECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Rejecting a last minute plea from interim
Superintendent Ramon C. Cortines, the Los Angeles school board
voted Tuesday to abandon the environmentally troubled Belmont
Learning Center, bringing a stunning end to the scandal over the
construction of the nation's costliest high school.
</P>
<P>
   The board's 5-2 vote to kill Belmont came moments after Cortines
suddenly asked for a 60-day delay on the fate of the $175 million
complex to allow him to gather more facts.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent's eleventh-hour retreat touched off
pandemonium in the board room, packed with inner-city students in
favor of completing the campus.
</P>
<P>
   But Cortines' words were not enough to sway a majority of the
board.
</P>
<P>
   Following a 15-minute recess, the board came back into public
and defiantly approved a motion to scrap Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   The action also called for Los Angeles Unified School District
administrators to solicit bids for the tainted downtown property,
and come back within 60 days with detailed plans for alternative
sites for a downtown campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not safe for anyone's children, it's not safe for
faculty; it's not safe for anyone,'' said board member Valerie
Fields. ``I wouldn't want my grandchildren to go there, I wouldn't
want to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The community is entitled to know what the decision is,
instead of being strung along for another four to five years,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Fields, board members Genethia Hayes, Caprice Young,
Julie Korenstein, and David Tokofsky voted to dump the partially
completed school, which sits atop a dangerous oil field. Board
members Victoria Castro and Mike Lansing dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Castro immediately asked for an inquiry into whether members of
the majority illegally consulted with each other during the brief
pause in action to ensure they had the four necessary to pass the
motion.
</P>
<P>
   The board majority agreed that the health and safety concerns
posed by explosive methane gas and deadly hydrogen sulfide at the
35-acre Belmont property made it too dangerous and expensive to
complete the school.
</P>
<P>
   Padlocked since last November, Belmont sits on a vacant lot in a
low-income Latino community. The neighborhood has been promised a
new high school for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a band of former administrators and highly paid
consultants designed the enormous complex to feature the state's
largest high school, a shopping mall, public housing and acres of
parkland.
</P>
<P>
   No one conducted adequate environmental tests before
construction began in 1997, despite repeated warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Tuesday's vote, Cortines said he was struggling
with his earlier recommendation to walk away from Belmont. The
superintendent had publicly backed completing the school until last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so taken back that I wasn't able to fix Belmont,''
Cortines said Tuesday morning. ``But you cannot avoid these types
of decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a minimum of $60 million to complete it, but by the time
it's all over, you know and I know, that it's going to really be
$100 million, $125 million out of the general fund,'' Cortines
said. Unlike most school construction projects, LAUSD has paid for
the construction of Belmont out its general operating fund, rather
than through state and local bond money.
</P>
<P>
   The general fund is the same pool of money that the district
uses to buy classroom supplies and pay teacher's salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the public comment portion of Tuesday's meeting,
Cortines heard several pleas from students from the current Belmont
High School.
</P>
<P>
   He also was attacked by county Supervisor Gloria Molina for
making a recommendation to the school board ``without all of the
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   In a last-ditch effort to save Belmont, members of an
independent citizens commission, which narrowly advised the school
board last October to finish the school, charged district officials
withheld key evidence about the true cost of making Belmont safe.
</P>
<P>
   The commission members argued new expert testimony demonstrates
that the cost of eliminating environmental hazards at Belmont is
four to five times less than the $60 million figure used by
district representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines made his dramatic bid to put off the board's decision
after Castro, who represents the Belmont attendance area, noted
that the district administrators had failed to report back to the
board on alternative sites for Belmont and conduct a cost analysis
of the project, despite orders to do so in July.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines, who officially took over as superintendent only ten
days ago, said he was unaware of the previous request.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has never been shared with me, and I believe that for
this administration and staff to not have reported to the board in
a timely manner ... is an error and doesn't keep with the integrity
that I heard about this evening,'' he said.

 STATION CASINOS iNC. LOST $2.4 MILLION IN ABORTED BID FOR (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Station Casinos Inc.
gambled and lost $2.4 million in its aborted bid to buy the
Flamingo Hilton Casino in Kansas City.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That one-time cost, mostly for legal expenses, was reported in
Station's fourth-quarter and year-end earnings statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas-based Station reported its 10th consecutive quarter of
record cash flow _ $239.6 million in net revenue from its casinos
in Nevada and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings per share were listed at 35 cents before deductions for
$137.4 million in extraordinary losses. That resulted in a net loss
of $75 million, or $1.80 per share.
</P>
<P>
   For the fiscal year that ended Dec. 30, revenue was up 11
percent from 1998 to $942.5 million. The company reported an annual
loss of $44.75 million, or a loss of $1.14 per share after all
extraordinary deductions.
</P>
<P>
   The year's largest expense was the fourth-quarter, $125.2
million write-down of the book value of Station's St. Charles, Mo.,
casino, dropping the property to around $165 million, Chief
Financial Officer Glenn C. Christenson told industry analysts
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the write-down didn't presage a closing or sale of the
property, which has seen flat revenue since the four-boat Riverport
casino complex opened in March 1997. Christenson said the
write-down more correctly valued the property ``when you look at
the cash flow generated vis-a-vis the investment we have there.''
</P>
<P>
   Expansion and reconstruction work at St. Charles was halted in
late 1997, and Christenson offered little hope Tuesday that the
project will resume.
</P>
<P>
   Also not part of the company's announced capital spending plans
for 2000 is a proposed parking garage for Station Casino Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   Station did announce a $55 million expansion plan for its Texas
Station property in Las Vegas, including a 60-lane bowling alley,
an expanded gambling floor for 350 additional slot machines, and a
40,000-square-foot meeting and banquet hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Las Vegas locals market is where our focus is and will
continue to be,'' said Chief Executive Frank Fertitta III.

SHEDDING LIGHT ON A LARGE GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   No matter how good things get in
America, they're never good enough to discourage those who insist
on finding dark linings in even the brightest clouds.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest such exercise in lugubriosity has generated much
media attention recently by revealing a widening income gap between
high-income Americans and those further down the socioeconomic
ladder despite nearly a decade of U.S. prosperity and growth.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the statistics are flawed; the numbers are there for
all to see.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with studies revealing the uneven benefits of a
strong economy, however, is the questions they raise: How should a
society react to these revelations? Does any thinking person
believe equal results are supposed to be assured in the context of
any human endeavor?
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is the faulty assumptions many Americans may
make because the studies fail to deal with the results in a more
informative fashion. One such assumption would be that those at the
bottom of the ladder are stuck there forever, despite numerous
studies over the years showing the U.S. economy providing
extraordinary income mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Quite often, those toward the bottom of income groupings are
retirees, college students and immigrants getting their start in
entry-level jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 study by the Urban Institute found that during any given
year 25 percent to 40 percent of those in any given income group
left it by moving either up or down, according to an analysis by
Investor's Business Daily. The study also showed that over a
nine-year period 60 percent changed income brackets.
</P>
<P>
   If the purpose of this sort of research is to tweak the national
conscience and thus encourage public policy responses, the most
honest response would be to abandon much of the policy forged over
the past 35 years or so. Those who decry what the income gap
figures show and yearn for more income equality must acknowledge
that whatever's needed isn't what's already been tried.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government alone has spent more than $5 trillion
trying to improve the lot of the economically disadvantaged, and
income and poverty figures consistently indicate that government
has reached the limits of what it can accomplish by redistributing
income.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, a more rational government response would seem to be
policies that make it easier for those at the bottom to participate
in wealth creation. One example of how this could be done would be
creation of a bifurcated Social Security system allowing for a
portion of employer-employee payroll taxes to be invested in
private, individually guided retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best response, however, would be a more reasoned
view of the situation. A television commentator discussing the
Great Depression recently seemed pleased to explain how the
horrific downturn of the '30s substantially narrowed the wealth gap
between the plutocracy and the hoi polloi. He offered the view
without a hint that he appreciated the terrible price most of
America's working folk must have paid for this meaningless gain in
economic equality.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed in the context of the current boom, is there any sane
American who would welcome a return to hard times if it could but
narrow the widening income gap?

MAVERICKS SHOW LOTS OF FIGHT IN WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Life, liberty and the pursuit of ``The Worm'' took a
peculiar twist for the Mavericks last night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Could these Mavericks be too brash for Dennis Rodman, the
``Worm'' in question?
</P>
<P>
   Their take-no-prisoners attitude certainly wore thin on the
Golden State Warriors, who lost one of the two on-court skirmishes
_ and the war _ during the Mavericks' 117-103 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Michael Finley served as the catalyst with two 11-point
quarters in the first half and delivered his best impersonation of
the irreverent Rodman by involving himself in both on-court
altercations. The Mavericks are considering signing for the rest of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys did a good job of getting in there and letting them
know that we're not going to take that,'' said Mavericks center
Sean Rooks, who received one of the three technical fouls assessed.
``You can't let anybody come in and do whatever they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley made 12 of his 19 shots from the field en route to a
team-high 30 points, in addition to his 10 assists and two steals.
Finley's first-half performance helped the Mavericks extend their
lead by as many as 20 points before intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The frustrated Warriors emerged from their dressing room for the
second half fighting mad.
</P>
<P>
   Warriors forward Mark Davis and Mavericks center Shawn Bradley
werethe night's first combatants with 6:52 remaining in the third
period. The two became entangled near the top of the key, and the
shoving escalated into a fracas.
</P>
<P>
   Davis threw his arms around Bradley's waist and lifted the
Mavericks' 7-foot-6 center from the floor before dumping him onto
the court. Finley separated the two before any exchange of punches,
but Bradley and Davis were both ejected. Bradley scored 15 points
and had a season-high 12 rebounds in 21 minutes before his
ejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's stepping up,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson said. ``He's
been more aggressive lately, and I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, Nelson must have been ecstatic as the game went
on.
</P>
<P>
   Warriors guard Vonteego Cummings undercut point guard Steve Nash
as the latter appeared to be on his way toward an uncontested
layup. Nash fell to the floor hard, and Finley again intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Nash received a technical for his involvement in the fray, but
officials ejected Cummings for the flagrant foul with 1:20
remaining in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a victim of some flagrant fouls the past couple of
years,'' said Mavericks forward Cedric Ceballos, who contributed 18
points and eight rebounds. ``Those things shouldn't happen. I don't
know if they were frustrated or what. There are a lot of men out
here trying to make a living for themselves and their families.
There's no reason to get taken out like that over two points.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, the free-agent forward the franchise covets for his
rebounding skills, likely would have been impressed by the
Mavericks' spunky performance.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson relished it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy with the way the team stuck up for one
another out there when we got in a confrontation,'' Nelson said.
``That means we're coming around a little bit.''

THE NEXT BISTATE TAX SHOULDN'T BE USED FOR THE CHIEFS AND ROYALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK BABSON  
 c. 2OOO Kansas City Star   TOPEKA, Kan. _ Bistate II took its first
baby steps last week in Topeka. One can only hope it topples over
and can't get back up _ at least in its current form.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though collection of the first bistate cultural sales tax
continues through March 2002, elected officials in Topeka and
Jefferson City, Mo., are working to modify the original enacting
legislation to get the ball rolling for a successor tax.
</P>
<P>
   A bill introduced in the Kansas House would pave the way for
funds raised through future bistate taxes to be used for sports
activities or facilities _ that means stadiums. Similar legislation
is expected in Missouri. Current wording excludes stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of you who approved the initial tax to fund the
renovation of Union Station and building of the Science City
museum, I voted to approve a bistate cultural tax. No matter how
much you might love the Chiefs and the Royals, they don't fit my
definition of culture. Entertainment, yes; businesses, yes;
culture, no.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that entertainment and business are bad; not
at all. But bistate money shouldn't be used to help the Chiefs or
the Royals any more than it should have been used to help retain
the FFA convention or the NCAA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that bistate money be used for J.C. Nichols
to upgrade the Country Club Plaza or for Hallmark Cards to upgrade
Crown Center _ and it shouldn't be. The same should go for the
Chiefs and Royals.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not moved by the fear talk I'm already hearing about how the
Royals and Chiefs might leave Kansas City, Mo., if improvements
aren't made to Arrowhead and Kauffman stadiums. The FFA and NCAA
took what they considered to be better offers and left town. The
Royals and the Chiefs, and the hockey Blades for that matter, might
someday do the same. Kansas City should do everything it can to
retain these teams, but the bistate tax shouldn't be part of the
equation.
</P>
<P>
   Bistate II, which thinks nothing of asking Kansans to help pay
for Missouri sports facilities, also does nothing to put Kansans on
the same footing when it comes to access to tickets at those
facilities. As long as Jackson Countians get special treatment in
that area, there's no reason for Johnson Countians to come to the
rescue.

   (Phoenix) - Steven Eric Townsend, 41, worked off a ``to-do''
list the day he was to meet the 12-year-old girl he had been
chatting with over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The last item on his list: ``Make love to Heather.'' He allotted
four hours.
</P>
<P>
   But Heather turned out to be a Phoenix police officer, and Town
send was arrested on Oct. 16, 1998, and charged with at tempted
sexual conduct with a minor.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Tempe man was sentenced to a year in jail and
lifetime probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could do more,'' says Brad Astrowsky, a lawyer with
the Maricopa County Attorney's Office who prosecuted Townsend.
</P>
<P>
   Although other states have laws against luring a child for sex
over the Internet, Arizona laws haven't kept up with the fast pace
of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Pedophiles have, though.
</P>
<P>
   That terrifies state Attorney General Janet Napolitano, who is
pushing legislation to make it a crime to lure a child for sex
online as part of the Computer Crimes Act of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is slated to be heard in committee Wednesday at the
state Capitol. Napolitano and Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley
plan to testify in its favor.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, when police posing as kids online arrange to meet
adults to have sex, the most they can charge someone with is at
tempted sexual contact with a minor, a Class 3 felony, punish able
by probation or up to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation calls for stiffer penalties, still
being debated. All this is new for police and prosecutors. Crimes
against children on the Internet didn't exist until 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But just since June of 1998, Romley's office has handled 59
cases of child pornography and more than a dozen of men luring
children, boys and girls, for sex over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``These predators are coming right into these children's homes
via the computer,'' Romley says.
</P>
<P>
   Few parents would let strange men into their children's bed
rooms, but they might as well when they hook up a computer in
there, Astrowsky says.
</P>
<P>
   He is on leave from the County Attorney's Office, working at the
U.S. Department of Justice teach ing attorneys nationwide how to
best prosecute these cases. On the second day of the 11th annual
Child Abuse Prevention Confer ence in Mesa on Tuesday, social
workers, teachers and police offi cers learned in graphic detail
how Phoenix police officers track people online who have a sexual
interest in children.
</P>
<P>
   The largest annual gathering of child advocates in the state,
the conference addresses the most pressing topics facing peo ple
who work with children.
</P>
<P>
   Astrowsky said predators have a menu of children to choose from
on the Internet because the kids often fill out ``user profiles''
with their name, age and hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   Predators simply e-mail a child, striking up a relationship in
the long hours after school.
</P>
<P>
   They write of wanting to buy things for the children and want
ing to take them places, As trowsky says. They give them attention
they don't get from their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, predators ask ques tions like, ``Is there anything
you are curious about? You know you can ask me anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, they send pornography to desensitize the child to later
advances, Astrowsky says. They promise toys and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   These vile courtships, As trowsky says, can take weeks, even
months. Eventually, the predator asks to meet the child.
</P>

relationship with a 14-year-old girl, eventually arranging a visit.

alcohol. They had sex, and he dropped her off near home.

<P>
   Hurst was charged with four counts of sexual conduct with a
minor on May 3 but pleaded guilty to two counts and was sentenced
to eight years in prison on Oct. 29.

CHANDLER TO GET INTEL CHIP PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN SIDENER AND CHRIS FISCUS  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Intel Corp. said Tuesday it will build a $2 billion
chip-fabrication plant in Chandler, a big endorse ment of the
future of personal computers and the company's ties to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is being designed to use cutting-edge technologies to
crank out Intel's fastest personal computer chips when it begins
production next year. The move comes in the face of predictions
that the PC will be replaced by simpler Internet appliances, mo
bile computers and Web TV. But PC sales are projected to grow for
the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two thirds of their total reve nues are from computers,'' said
Tony Massimini, an analyst with Semico Research in Phoenix.
``They're taking care of the cow that's bringing the milk.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel is prepared to break ground on the plant after the
Chandler City Council votes on the company's application Feb. 10.
Chip-fabrication plants typically take two years or longer to
build, but Intel wants to have this one open next year.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, called a fab in industry jargon, would add 1,000 jobs
to the Phoenix area economy in five to eight years, Intel said.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech jobs such as those in the new fab are coveted by
economic development officials across the country, primarily be
cause they come with above-average salaries. Intel said the average
wage for its Arizona employees, including bonuses, was $56,000 last
year. Its total payroll here last year was $882 million.
</P>
<P>
   The new fab, No. 22, will position Intel to re-establish itself
as the sole producer of the fastest PC chips and will strengthen
its dominance of chip manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Advanced Micro De vices temporarily had the fastest
chip on the market. While having the fastest chip is important for
marketing, Intel remains the world's largest chip manufac turer
because of its superiority in manufacturing, Massimini said. Intel
is developing technology to use 12-inch silicon wafers. The largest
wafers used in production today are 8 inches in diameter. The
larger wafers produce more than twice as many chips as the 8-inch
versions. More chips per wafer means faster production and lower
cost per chip.
</P>
<P>
   Massimini said the high-end chips will probably start out in
work stations and servers, but quickly end up in home comput ers.
The chips, expected to be more than twice as fast as today's
fastest, will end up running more powerful software for the home
user, Massimini said.
</P>
<P>
   The plant will open using 8-inch technology and then make the
transition into the 12-inch wafers. Two other new technolo gies _
making circuits smaller and replacing aluminum connec tions with
copper _ will allow chips to get faster without get ting bigger,
while using less power.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Mike Feibus of Scotts dale's Mercury Research said
construction of the new fab makes sense in light of projected
demand for PC chips. Intel is increasing production in existing
plants to meet the high demand for its chips. But that has no
bearing on the decision to build the new fab, Feibus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't react to shortages,'' he said. ``This is longer
term. It's an investment in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The new plant would solidify Chandler as a premier site within
Intel. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company employs about 8,000
people here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an investment of major proportions,'' Chandler Mayor Jay
Tibshraeny said.
</P>
<P>
   Fab 22 will join two other Intel fabs in Chandler, Fabs 6 and
12. Fab 12 is one of the company's most modern facilities and is
producing its top-line Itanium chip. &QL;

RELENTLESS PRESSURE LIFTS LONGHORNS PAST 'HUSKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nebraska came into the Erwin Center last night
with one of the hottest players in the Big 12 and a glass-crashing
teammate who had pulled down 54 rebounds in five conference games.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Kimani Ffriend, the Cornhuskers' 6-foot-11 transfer
center who has been named Big 12 newcomer of the week three times
in January, nor forward Steffon Bradford were factors last night.
What the Cornhuskers didn't come south with proved a major
difference in 17th-ranked Texas' 82-55 victory before 11,242.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska was without guard Cookie Belcher, one of the league's
top players who is on a medical redshirt while rehabilitating
ligament damage in his shooting hand. Taking due note, the
Longhorns started pressuring the 'Huskers' backcourt from the
opening tip. And after about nine minutes, Texas' guard-driven
press squeezed the 'Huskers off the court.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns broke to a 27-5 offensive avalanche from an 18-all
deadlock at 11:14, forcing 14 first-half turnovers that keyed the
highest scoring half of the season and a 45-23 edge at the break.
Texas (13-5) would stretch that lead to 71-33 with 8:32 to play in
pushing its Big 12 record to 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Texas pulled off 16 steals and produced a 28-turnover game by
the 'Huskers (9-10, 2-4), netting 32 points off Nebraska miscues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing was points off turnovers,'' Texas coach Rick
Barnes said. ``That was the difference in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, who had 21- and 19-rebound games against nonconference
opponents, had only three last night and an inconsequential
team-high 13 points. Ffriend scored 12 and had five blocked shots
in 27 minutes, but he attempted only six shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, really impressed,'' Nebraska coach Danny Nee said.
``Their man-to-man pressure is the best we've seen this year, and
we've played Arizona. The pressure they can put on the perimeter is
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thought the matchup was between Kimani and Steffon
and Gabe \R Muoneke\S and Chris \RMihm\S, but I could see on film
that guard play was going to be a key and it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Mihm and guard Lawrence Williams paced Texas' scoring with 14
points each. Muoneke scored 12 and led all rebounders, tying a
career high with 14. Williams, who sank four of five 3-point shots,
also helped key the defense with five steals and had three assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guards were definitely the difference in the game,''
Muoneke said. ``They picked it up on defense and made it hard for
them. And Lawrence Williams stepped up and played the way we know
he can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams had his best all-around game since returning from an
injury in December, seven games into the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting a long time for this,'' Williams said. ``I
knew it would eventually happen, and I felt tonight would be the
night because I've been having good practices and I felt it would
carry over.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska got off only 53 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were getting the ball down low at the start of the game,
but once we started making some baskets and were able to get out in
the open court and press, we did a great job with ball pressure and
disrupting the game in a lot of ways,'' Barnes said. ``Obviously,
Lawrence played a great game. I think as a team, we're starting to
figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado (11-7, 2-4) comes into the Erwin Center on Saturday.

FAMILIES GRIEVE VICTIMS KILLED IN FIERY COLLISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT STEARNS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. _ A hard and
unreconciled grief hung over the Ozarks on Tuesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the 10 fatalities in Sunday afternoon's fiery 24-car
collision on Interstate 29 north of Kansas City, Mo., three were
from Springfield, two from Branson, and two went to college at
Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the grief for the friends and families of the dead
was the knowledge that death ripped apart so many lives brought
together by love:
</P>
<P>
   - The love of Larry and Meredith Bass, which filled a
Springfield home they made while raising three sons.
</P>
<P>
   - The love of Mark and Casey Bass, the Basses' oldest son and
daughter-in-law, who were at the brink of starting their own
family.
</P>
<P>
   - The new love of teen-age college students Sara McGaha and Jay
Wetzel.
</P>
<P>
   - And the love divided after 37 years because Linda Haen made a
trip with two good friends _ the elder Basses _ and left her
husband Charles Haen at home in Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of disbelief still pervaded discussions by seven by
their loved ones, two days after the accident and a day after
officials confirmed the names of the dead. Many spoke of them in
the present tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to pretend they're missionaries,'' said Kellie
Pappas, the best friend of Mark and Casey Bass. ``They're in
another country. That's why they're not here. It's not real.''
</P>
<P>
   On Southwest Baptist's campus in Bolivar, north of Springfield,
McGaha's suitemates still expect to see the couple walking together
hand in hand, as they had so often since they began dating in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I see someone with red hair, I think it's Sara,''
said Missy Sackett. ``Every time I see a red-striped jacket, it's
like, `There's Jay.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And Charles Haen, married to Linda Haen more than 37 years,
wandered his Springfield house in a daze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of lost,'' Charles Haen said in a barely audible
voice. ``Everything you...I'm just lost.'' A family broken
</P>
<P>
   The tap on the door came about 1:30 a.m. Monday, Darren Bass
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Missouri state trooper, with heartbreaking news: His
parents, Larry and Meredith Bass, and his older brother Mark Bass,
along with Mark's wife, Casey, had all been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The four had been returning from an Amway convention in Omaha,
Neb., along with Linda Haen.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Bass, 25, sat in his parents' living room in Springfield
on Tuesday, still trying to cope with what had befallen his
close-knit family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unreal,'' he said. ``Something you read about but don't
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the Basses were a remarkable family _
personally and professionally.
</P>
<P>
   Larry and Meredith Bass raised three boys and seemed to be
everyone's favorite parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I really liked about them is how they
related to their adult children,'' said Sharon Wilkins, a family
friend of 25 years who lives in a townhouse just up the road from
the elder Basses.
</P>
<P>
   Laughter constantly filled the Bass home, where pictures of
children, in-laws and grandchildren lined the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Darren, his wife, Kari, and their two children lived with Larry
and Meredith while the young couple looked for a house.
</P>
<P>
   And Mark and Casey would drive 45 miles from Branson every
Sunday to attend church with the whole Bass family at Central
Assembly of God in Springfield and then spend the day at his
parents' house.
</P>
<P>
   ``This family is as close as any family I've ever seen,'' said
David G. Watson, their pastor. ``They all sat on the same pew. It
was a marvel.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey Bass, who was married to Mark in 1996, fit right in with
her energy and vivaciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was it,'' said Pappas. ``She was Meredith the Second. They
shared clothes, jewelry, everything. They were like sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark, 28, and Casey, 24, had been college sweethearts at Evangel
University. They met in the school choir, married before she
graduated and had announced in their Christmas letter that they
were going to try to have children this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bass family's love and compassion extended beyond their
immediate family. Larry Bass, a prominent psychologist who served
Springfield's upper crust, often would take Watson aside at church
and give him some money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd notice a family in need,'' Watson said. ``He'd ask me to
give the money to them, anonymously. He would give, quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   And the family could always be counted on in times of trouble,
Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were so steady,'' Wilkins said. ``If they were here,
they'd be steadying everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, their friends try to cope without the people who would be
most helpful during this type of tragedy _ the Basses themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some are in denial. Some keep busy. All say their faith will
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's true now,'' Wilkins said. ''I'm just grateful that
I knew them, and that I knew them for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Haen, like her good friends Larry and Meredith Bass, loved
helping people.
</P>
<P>
   And she had a unique perspective in her job as a speech
pathologist: She herself had overcome a speech impediment, said
Wilkins, an old friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had such tremendous admiration for her,'' Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Haen, 59, was the mother of two grown children. They flew to
Springfield on Tuesday to be with their father, a physician.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Haen was as worried about the surviving Bass sons as he
was about his own family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to have an impact on those two boys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Darren Bass, the oldest surviving son of Larry and
Meredith, he wonders how to explain the family's loss to his own
5-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands they're dead,'' Darren Bass said. ``But I don't
think he understands the permanence of it. We don't understand.
We're not trying to understand. We're just trying to cope.''
</P>
<P>
   A funeral for all four Basses will be Friday at 1 p.m. at
Central Assembly of God Church in Springfield. Scholarship funds
have been set up in honor of Mark and Casey Bass at Evangel
University and in honor of Larry and Meredith Bass at Southwest
Missouri State University, where Larry Bass taught.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements for Linda Haen have not yet been completed.
Power of first love
</P>
<P>
   Sara McGaha and Jay Wetzel were in the best kind of love: first
love.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of love, friends of the couple recalled Tuesday, that
consists of talks that ran for hours and kisses that went on for
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, friends since they both arrived at Southwest Baptist
University in September, began dating in October.
</P>
<P>
   In the dining hall, he often ate with one arm around her _
meaning the right-hander would eat with his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He smiled all the time,'' said Jessica Phillips, a friend of
both.
</P>
<P>
   Most nights before curfew, you could find him waiting in the
lobby of her dormitory _ men are only allowed in the women's rooms
one day a month _ perched eagerly on one of the orange-velvet arm
chairs. Her friends nicknamed the lobby ``Jay's Room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me she had never wanted to marry someone before,''
said her roommate, Holly Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   The two were driving back to school after a five-week Christmas
break. Wetzel, from North Dakota, had picked up McGaha at her
Nebraska home.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Gardner, a Southwest Baptist student from McGaha's
hometown, saw her at dinner at their pastor's house a few days
before the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``She couldn't wait to get back here,'' Gardner said. ``She just
glowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Classes began as scheduled Monday. But now, McGaha's friends are
packing up her belongings in Room 107 of Leslie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   McGaha's presence, though, still permeates the room.
</P>
<P>
   A vase of dried roses on her desk. The giant stuffed Tigger she
won in a carnival game. A note on her computer reminding her to
``Pick Up Paycheck.'' Another note on an index card taped to the
wall, urging her to ``Live each day to the fullest, get the most
from each hour, each day and each age of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   The school will hold a memorial service for McGaha and Wetzel
tonight. Grief counselors are available to the students.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, many of McGaha's friends are experiencing
the death of a loved one. Even as they try to come to grips with
the tragedy, they say they believe their faith will see them
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the perfect couple,'' Rhodes said. ``And they still
are. They're in a better place now.''

MISSOURI CANDIDATES DIFFER IN RESPONSES TO COURT RULING ON CAMPAIGN
DONATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 BC- KC-CAMPAIGN-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ Some contenders
for statewide office in Missouri said Tuesday that they planned to
take the unusual step of returning money to contributors.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The announcements followed Monday's Supreme Court decision that
reinstated a 1994 law setting a limit of $1,075 on campaign
contributions for statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joe Maxwell of Mexico, Mo., who is seeking the Democratic
nomination for lieutenant governor, said he planned to return 40
donations totaling about $30,000 and challenged his rivals to do
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contribution limits exist because money overpowers the
democratic process,'' he said. ``We are challenging individuals to
give it back.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure had been struck down by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in mid-1998, a ruling that essentially removed any
ceiling on political contributions and set off a wave of donations
much bigger than $1,075.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is now political rather than legal: whether to
keep the contributions that everyone agrees were legal at the time
or return them and possibly win credit for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon said Monday that individual
candidates had to make refund decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Three other candidates for statewide office said they also
planned to return contributions. Three more said they were
considering the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But others were less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Kenney of Lee's Summit, Mo., who is seeking the GOP
nomination for lieutenant governor, said he ``has no intention at
all'' of returning contributions in excess of the restored limits
because the donations were legal at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Kenney received four contributions of $25,000 from Leggett &AMP;
Platt and a $50,000 contribution from CNS Corp. The Republican, who
has $510,000 in his campaign treasury, also jabbed Maxwell by
saying he was the first contender for lieutenant governor to take
contributions that exceeded the limits the Supreme Court restored
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the two leading candidates for governor, Democrat
Bob Holden and Republican Jim Talent, said the two had no plans to
return any contributions. But there was interest in the idea by
several contenders for the four other statewide offices being
contested this year.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Gracia Backer, a New Bloomfield, Mo., Democrat and
one of Maxwell's rivals for the nomination, said she would probably
return $1,500 in contributions she received over the reinstated
limits. But Backer said Maxwell's comments were opportunistic and
questioned why he ever took donations that exceeded the limits.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell, who said he had $250,000 in his campaign treasury, said
he did so because ``we didn't want to run a race with our hands
tied behind our backs.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Charles County Executive Joseph Ortwerth, who is seeking the
GOP nomination for lieutenant governor, said Tuesday that
candidates should return any contributions that exceeded $1,075.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for state treasurer, Democrat Kelvin Simmons of
Kansas City Tuesday distributed copies of three checks totaling
$1,929 that he said he returned because they exceeded the restored
limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all the candidates should do the same,'' said Simmons,
a member of the Kansas City, Mo., Council.
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate for treasurer, Democratic Rep. Scott Lakin of
Kansas City, said he was considering whether to return about $7,000
in donations that exceeded the reinstated limits. Democrat Nancy
Farmer of St. Louis, another contender for treasurer, said she had
received one donation of $5,000 and would return it if other
candidates followed the same policy.
</P>
<P>
   Among other contenders for state treasurer, Democratic state
Rep. Brian May of St. Louis said he had no plans to return
contributions. Republican Todd Graves, who is Platte County
prosecutor, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates for secretary of state, Democratic House Speaker
Steve Gaw of Moberly and Republican Rep. Matt Blunt of Springfield,
said they had no plans to return contributions. Gaw has $240,316 in
his campaign treasury, and Blunt has $282,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the contest for attorney general, Nixon told reporters he did
not accept contributions of more than $1,075 after the state law
was struck down by the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sam Jones, former associate circuit judge in Lawrence
County and candidate for attorney general, said he collected one
contribution of $5,000 after the limits were struck down. Jones and
several other candidates said they were awaiting direction from the
Missouri Ethics Commission, which is supposed to enforce the
state's campaign finance law.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's office advises the commission, and he said Monday that
candidates must decide for themselves whether to return political
donations.
</P>
<P>
   But Commission Chairman Robert Gardner. Mo., of Sedalia, Mo.,
said Tuesday that panel members would have to review the court
decision before deciding how it should be interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has scheduled another meeting Friday on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The panel did approve new contribution ceilings that were
adjusted for inflation, which is required by state law. The maximum
for statewide candidates is now $1,125, up from $1,075, and $550
for state Senate candidates, up from $525. The ceiling for
candidates for state representative remained at $275 because of a
quirk in the formula used to revise contribution limits.

CENSUS PREPARES FOR BIG JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Census Bureau is
gearing up to take a snapshot of America 2000, its largest-ever
project, but officials are worried they won't be able to recruit
enough qualified workers to do the job right.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A robust economy with low unemployment has the government agency
scrambling for recruits; it's even willing to offer more money and
to accept lower scores on its application test.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no place are we where we want to be'' in recruiting
workers, said Debra Peebles, census spokeswoman for the six-state
region that includes Missouri and Kansas. ``We are in dire
straits.''
</P>
<P>
   A shortage of people-counters is a new wrinkle in this decennial
exercise that has become increasingly controversial. Resistance to
answering the census has grown in recent decades, and the method of
counting has become a political issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the Constitution says it has to be done every 10 years. And
the census, accurate or not, remains the basis for apportioning
seats in Congress as well as allocating more than $180 billion in
federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Participating in the census is in the individual's own
self-interest,'' the bureau says.
</P>
<P>
   The official count date is April 1. Local organizers rallied
Tuesday at Union Station to raise awareness and recruit workers.
</P>
<P>
   The three area census offices need to hire a total of 4,500
temporary employees. Nationwide, the Census Bureau has more than
800,000 jobs to fill. Regional officials declined to say how far
behind they are.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs pay from $9 to $13.50 an hour, much higher than minimum
wage, but they have no future. Most positions are for enumerators,
workers who will knock on the doors of those who do not send their
census questionnaire in by mail. Those end in July.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters are focusing on students and retirees. The census
also is working with minority organizations, local governments and
job-placement centers to fill the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of the country they are even recruiting outside
movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 million census questionnaires have been printed
and either a short form or a long form will be mailed to every
known residential address in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, everyone would fill out the form and mail it back. But
in 1990 the Census Bureau calculated the response rate was just 65
percent. That's why enumerators are sent into the field to collect
data in person.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are hoping for a better response this time, but are
prepared for a return rate of just 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the 1970s, we know, fewer people are returning the
forms,'' said Peebles. ``More people are anti-government. Prior to
that people felt it was their civic duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Although compliance is required by law, the Census Bureau says
it will not prosecute anyone who refuses to answer the questions.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, especially undocumented aliens, fear the
information will be used against them. But census information about
individuals, by law, cannot be given to any other government
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Some minority groups, even those with members who have
citizenship or other legal status, also can be difficult to count.
Language problems can lead to fear and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau estimates the Hispanic population was
undercounted by 5 percent in 1990, but leaders of that community
think the real figure was 10 to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want that to happen this time around,'' said Cris
Medina, director of the Guadalupe Center. ``We know that affects
how political districts are drawn. It affects public funds from
federal programs for public schools, public health clinics, public
housing, Head Start centers and other essential services our
community needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Data from the $4 billion census project also will form the basis
for many grant applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to know the characteristics of the population
being served,'' said Steve Lebofsky of the Kansas City planning
department. ``Not just for grants that go to the city itself, but
also a lot of nonprofit groups rely on grants.''
</P>
<P>
   To boost participation and reach a more accurate count, the
Census Bureau for the first time will buy advertising. The agency
will spend $185 million, the biggest chunk going for television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be right up there with Burger King and McDonald's on
the prime-time airwaves,'' Peebles said.
</P>
<P>
   Two counts
</P>
<P>
   Because of political haggling over how to conduct the census,
the bureau in effect will conduct two counts this year _ a
traditional head count and a statistical projection.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court last year ruled the agency must conduct a
traditional count for the purpose of apportioning the 435 seats in
the House of Representatives among the states. That process will be
inaccurate because it inevitably will miss millions of the
estimated 274 million population.
</P>
<P>
   But census director Kenneth Prewitt said the agency will
continue to use sampling to paint a truer picture of the nation.
That data will be used to redraw Congressional district lines
within states and to allocate federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Sampling means making projections from a smaller database. To do
that, about one-sixth of households will receive a 53-question form
that asks about income, marital status, education and even plumbing
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans will receive a short form with eight questions,
including age, sex and race.
</P>
<P>
   But the race question is more complicated than before. In a move
away from rigid categories, Americans for the first time may check
more than one box. Golfer Tiger Woods, for example, could claim
Asian, black, American Indian and white ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   The change in the race question will produce a more detailed
picture of the population but also a more complicated one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you cannot compare the censuses,'' said Peter Eaton,
professor and director of the Center for Economic Information at
the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   As with everything else, census 2000 has gone high-tech.
Enumerators will carry clipboard computers to enter their data.
Four collection stations around the country that will tally
mailed-in questionnaires will employ scanners that can read
handwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials say such advances, on top of sophisticated
sampling techniques, will ensure the best and most secure results.
Eaton, a statistician, is ready to believe them.
</P>
<P>
   Given the diversity of the American public, Eaton said, ``I
think we will get a fairly remarkably good picture.''

MORE DELAYS POSSIBLE FOR RUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last week the NCAA requested additional
information from UCLA about suspended forward JaRon Rush,
potentially delaying the resolution of a case that has lasted six
weeks and cost Rush 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA forwarded the supplemental information Friday and is hoping
for _ but not expecting _ a ruling this week or next.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very complicated case, the most complicated I've ever
been involved in,'' UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis said. ``The
institution and the NCAA can't agree on some of the facts at this
point. (The NCAA has) conducted supplemental interviews with some
of the people we've already interviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   If the penalty is severe _ school officials believe Rush could
be suspended for the season or forfeit his eligibility entirely _
UCLA will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Rush violated an NCAA rule by accepting $200 from L.A. sports
agent Jerome Stanley; that's clear.
</P>
<P>
   But the NCAA must determine if Rush also violated rules by
accepting cash and/or merchandise from former AAU coach Myron
Piggie, who's under federal investigation for fraud and tax
evasion.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, the NCAA must answer two questions:
</P>
<P>
   - Did Piggie and Rush have what the NCAA calls a ``pre-existing
relationship?'' If they knew each other before Rush was a
recruitable athlete, then cash exchanges might not violate
amateurism rules.
</P>
<P>
   - What was the source of Piggie's money? If it came from Kansas
booster Tom Grant, the AAU team's general manager, then Rush has a
case. Two years ago, the NCAA determined that Grant and Rush had a
pre-existing relationship, which enabled Grant to pay for Rush's
high school education with no amateurism repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA recently suspended Rush's brother, Kareem, a Missouri
freshman, for 14 games for Piggie-related violations that aren't as
severe as Rush's. Kareem's penalty was reduced to nine games on
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Hines update: Junior guard Rico Hines is not expected to play
Thursday at Oregon State because of a sprained big toe. He is
questionable for Saturday's game at Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Hines, who has started the last three games, is averaging four
points and 2.4 rebounds in 17.8 minutes.

<P>
   HONG KONG _ As a college classmate of Microsoft's Bill Gates and
its new chief executive, Steven Ballmer, I have long harbored some
pride in our distant association and shamelessly name-dropped on
more than one occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as a frustrated user of Microsoft products, I cannot help
but wish that Microsoft were broken up into two companies.
</P>
<P>
   One company would continue to be the guardian of Microsoft
Windows, which controls more than 90 percent of the market for the
operating-system program that is required on every computer.
</P>
<P>
   The other company would compete fairly and squarely in the
marketplace for software applications, by making better products
for word processing, e-mail and other applications.
</P>
<P>
   I use the computer for e-mail, word processing and browsing the
Internet. I do not do desktop publishing, spreadsheets, financial
or scientific analysis or anything else fancy. But I have three
computers at home, and I am now shopping for a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   I used to have two computers, a desktop for my children and a
laptop for traveling. Then one day last year, my daughter came home
in tears over unfinished homework.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that her school had just switched to using
Microsoft's Word 97 word-processing program. We only had on our
home computers the older Word 6.0 program that I also used at my
office. The Word 6.0 program was incapable of deciphering documents
that had been typed in Word 97.
</P>
<P>
   That night, I took my daughter to the local store and discovered
that Microsoft's products were bundled in such a way that we had to
buy the entire Office 97 suite of programs, including Excel and
Powerpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Office 97 required much more computer memory than was
on my computer, as well as more hard-disk space and a faster CPU.
We ended up buying a new computer, which, of course, meant a sale
of Windows for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, my office installed a new e-mail program, Microsoft
Outlook 98. With the Outlook program loaded, my laptop, which I
rely on during frequent business trips, began to crash regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The program required more computer memory than I had on my
laptop. I had to explain to my clients that my computer just wiped
out their e-mails. That is why I am now shopping for my fourth home
computer, which means another sale of Windows for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   It does not take a Harvard education to figure out that
Microsoft will make more money by selling bigger and more bloated
software that requires much more computer memory than is necessary.
This strategy forces its customers to buy new computers, thereby
selling more copies of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, Microsoft announces more top-heavy versions of its
software that render obsolete its customers' existing computers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft and the cheerleading PC magazines that depend
on it for advertising have trumpeted the fact that Microsoft's new
Office 2000 will be ``backward compatible'' with Office 97, many
features of Office 2000 will not be usable without the user also
getting the new Windows 2000 operating system.
</P>

<P>
   HONG KONG _ As a college classmate of Microsoft's Bill Gates and
its new chief executive, Steven Ballmer, I have long harbored some
pride in our distant association and shamelessly name-dropped on
more than one occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as a frustrated user of Microsoft products, I cannot help
but wish that Microsoft were broken up into two companies.
</P>
<P>
   One company would continue to be the guardian of Microsoft
Windows, which controls more than 90 percent of the market for the
operating-system program that is required on every computer.
</P>
<P>
   The other company would compete fairly and squarely in the
marketplace for software applications, by making better products
for word processing, e-mail and other applications.
</P>
<P>
   I use the computer for e-mail, word processing and browsing the
Internet. I do not do desktop publishing, spreadsheets, financial
or scientific analysis or anything else fancy. But I have three
computers at home, and I am now shopping for a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   I used to have two computers, a desktop for my children and a
laptop for traveling. Then one day last year, my daughter came home
in tears over unfinished homework.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that her school had just switched to using
Microsoft's Word 97 word-processing program. We only had on our
home computers the older Word 6.0 program that I also used at my
office. The Word 6.0 program was incapable of deciphering documents
that had been typed in Word 97.
</P>
<P>
   That night, I took my daughter to the local store and discovered
that Microsoft's products were bundled in such a way that we had to
buy the entire Office 97 suite of programs, including Excel and
Powerpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Office 97 required much more computer memory than was
on my computer, as well as more hard-disk space and a faster CPU.
We ended up buying a new computer, which, of course, meant a sale
of Windows for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, my office installed a new e-mail program, Microsoft
Outlook 98. With the Outlook program loaded, my laptop, which I
rely on during frequent business trips, began to crash regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The program required more computer memory than I had on my
laptop. I had to explain to my clients that my computer just wiped
out their e-mails. That is why I am now shopping for my fourth home
computer, which means another sale of Windows for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   It does not take a Harvard education to figure out that
Microsoft will make more money by selling bigger and more bloated
software that requires much more computer memory than is necessary.
This strategy forces its customers to buy new computers, thereby
selling more copies of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, Microsoft announces more top-heavy versions of its
software that render obsolete its customers' existing computers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft and the cheerleading PC magazines that depend
on it for advertising have trumpeted the fact that Microsoft's new
Office 2000 will be ``backward compatible'' with Office 97, many
features of Office 2000 will not be usable without the user also
getting the new Windows 2000 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Some early reports have concluded that Windows 2000 may need as
much as 156 megabytes of computer memory in order to run smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   If the programmers at Microsoft who write the applications
software were separated from the division that sells Microsoft's
cash cow, Windows, then perhaps they would be free to write better,
more innovative (and smaller) applications software.
</P>
<P>
   They might also improve on the Word word processing and Outlook
e-mail programs, which many will agree are among the most
bug-ridden, crash-prone and poorly thought-out software on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking up Microsoft could also result in the shares of the
separated companies being worth more in the aggregate than the
original Microsoft shares. That would make the shareholdings of Mr.
Gates and Mr. Ballmer even more valuable.
</P>

Microsoft's shareholders and, not least of all, the class fund for
our upcoming 25th college reunion. &QL;

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IF these had been the Iowa caucuses, the Rockets would have been
Orrin Hatch, with hardly a shot, a vote or a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   They put up so many bricks in the first half, you might have
thought they'd taken it upon themselves to construct their own new
arena.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the first quarter was over, there was more reason to
check for a pulse than any sign of a six-game winning streak. And
still, they led by two points.
</P>
<P>
   That's how winnable it was. That's how vulnerable were the
previously red-hot Timberwolves, ready to be trapped and skinned
and hung around a neck on a chilly evening.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets could never get their engine to turn over, could
never find the spark, could never do the something, anything that
would turn it into a fire until it was far, far too late. And Steve
Francis knew just who to be down on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Too harsh, to be sure. Too much of the responsibility for a
horrid shooting night and all-around lackluster offensive
performance to be borne by those young and talented shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the burden that comes with the job. His job, at
least, of point guard and savior.
</P>
<P>
   Stevie Franchise does not want to be known as Stevie Franchise.
At least, not now, not so soon. Not when every time out on the
floor still brings many brand new experiences and brand new faces.
</P>
<P>
   We see him darting down the floor on the fast break, like a deer
running through the forest and never brushing a single tree, and
winding up all the way at the hoop for a layup. We see him elevate
above the rim to catch those alley-oop passes. We see him find his
path to another rim-rattler blocked off by Minnesota's Kevin
Garnett, come back down to the floor and then whip a wraparound
pass by Rasho Nesterovic for a perfect feed to fellow rookie Kenny
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   We see all of those things, and we sometimes forget he is still
just 41 games old in this league, exactly one half of a season into
a career that should be both long and brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   We see all of those things, and we sometimes don't remember he
is just 22 years old and still a little green and ripening on the
vine. There are nights when all rookies just learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't aggressive enough,'' Francis said. ``I wasn't
aggressive enough. I don't like saying that this is my team, and I
don't say it. You won't ever hear me say it. That's all from the
media and other players. I heard an old quote from Hakeem
(Olajuwon) the other day. He said, `No one player is the team.' I
think I'll have to remind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know that it is up to me to get everybody involved and
into the offense and make it easier for the whole team.''
</P>
<P>
   Except the whole team was struggling with its shooting. Just one
game after scoring a season-high 24 points, Matt Bullard scored
zero. Shandon Anderson went 0-for-5 on the night. Olajuwon was
3-for-8. Pig Miller was 0-for-1. And as a group in the first
quarter, the Rockets were only 6-for-22 and never could pull their
wagon out of that ditch.
</P>
<P>
   Francis wound up a respectable 7-for-17 with 24 points and four
assists. But those numbers were deceiving because he was not able
to get himself or anybody else untracked until the fourth quarter,
when the Wolves' lead was too big to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I had anything at all,'' Francis said. ``I
wasn't able to be the spark for anybody else tonight because I
didn't have a spark myself. I'll take the blame, because I didn't
work out (with weights) the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? I don't know. Just didn't feel like it, I guess. I got
lazy. Blame me. It won't happen again, though. I won't let it. I
can't let it. Too many people depending on me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a tremendous pressure to perform at such a high level
every night, and it's why the ones who can and do are the great
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Francis knows that, and it's where he wants _ and expects _ to
go.
</P>
<P>
   What he needs to learn is timing and tempo. He has to learn when
to stoke the fires of his teammates and when to carry the load all
by himself. He has to be able to read each night and each situation
differently and know which side of his personality is required to
get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   The Allen Iverson comparisons are not accurate just because both
of them can fill up the hoop. Francis is a true point guard. He
understands the position and what is required. As you move up the
ladder, you must take in different things at every level, and what
he needs now is more games, more time to learn. But at the midterm,
he is certainly at the head of the class.
</P>
<P>
   The winning streak is history. Time to start another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my team,'' said the reluctant Stevie Franchise. ``But
it is my responsibility.''

   HONG KONG _ Jeff Bezos, founder of Internet shopping giant
Amazon.com, was portrayed in Time magazine's Person of the Year
issue for 1999 as a sort of a giddy, giggly Santa. But in the legal
arena Mr. Bezos has been behaving a lot more like Scrooge.
</P>
<P>
   His company has tangled in lawsuits with the retailer Wal-Mart,
The New York Times, a feminist bookstore in Minneapolis, a Web site
in Greece and, most recently, its archenemy in the bookselling
business, Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon recently obtained a court injunction against Barnes &AMP;
Noble prohibiting it from offering on its Web site,
Barnesandnoble.com, a shopping feature called the ``Express Lane.''
</P>
<P>
   This feature allowed customers to buy an item on-line with one
click of the mouse, without having to re-enter shipping and billing
information every time they buy. If a customer had previously
entered credit card and address information, he or she would not
have to do it again with every new order.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon was able to obtain a U.S. patent in September on this
``one-click'' shopping feature. So for the next 17 years any Web
site that allows its customers to order items in one step could be
infringing Amazon's patent, and might be sued for damages or
ordered to stop by the court.
</P>
<P>
   In granting the injunction, Federal Judge Marsha Pechman, whose
district encompasses Amazon's hometown, Seattle, said that Barnes &AMP;
Noble must devise an alternative system for its customers to order
on-line.
</P>
<P>
   She said that if Barnes &AMP; Noble had been allowed to offer the
one-click shopping feature during the 1999 holiday season, Amazon
``would likely lose market share and customers.''
</P>
<P>
   This case reveals fundamental flaws in the American patent
system that threaten to stunt the growth of the Internet and
e-commerce in their vulnerable infancy.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's patent, entitled ``Method and System for Placing a
Purchase Order Via a Communications Network,'' is so overly broad
that it does not pass the laugh test.
</P>
<P>
   This is characteristic of numerous patents granted by the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office. Such patents are carving up huge
swathes of Internet, e-commerce and software development, by
staking these as private property that can be legally monopolized.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce lawsuits are starting to proliferate in the United
States. For example, Pitney-Bowes, a postage meter company,
recently sued Stamps.com and E-Stamp for infringing its patent for
printing stamps using printers connected to personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com, founded by a patent factory called Walker Digital
that has more than 200 patents pending, sued Microsoft's Expedia
for infringing its patent for on-line hotel pricing and booking
service.
</P>
<P>
   Such lawsuits will undoubtedly multiply in the future,
especially as more so-called ``submarine patents'' surface.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the patent systems in most countries, patent applications
in the United States are generally secret until the patent has been
granted.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Amazon applied for its patent in 1997 (an eon ago
in Internet time), but the patent was granted and its existence
made known only in September.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble accused Amazon of purposely delaying the
application process so that the patent was issued just before the
1999 holiday season. In the past there have been numerous patent
holders who surfaced years or even decades after their inventions
were commercialized. They can then literally conduct legal
blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, under the new Inventors Protection Act of 1999
passed by the U.S. Congress in November, patent applications that
have also been filed abroad will now be required to be published 18
months after application.
</P>
<P>
   The new law makes many much-needed reforms, but numerous defects
and loopholes remain in the 210-year old U.S. patent system that
will keep lawyers busy well into the next millennium. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Snowbound and short of bureaucrats, the federal
government was declared closed on Tuesday as the capital city
hardened into an icy still life, out of bounds to all but the
hardiest pedestrians and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate all the white stuff since we don't have it,''
declared Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, speaking as a
delighted but cautious Mississippian. He yielded to the storm and
cut off the government's legislative deliberations soon after the
executive branch closed.
</P>
<P>
   The executive branch had first tried a partial work day under
the ``liberal leave'' option that lets workers try to get to work
or not. But this was abandoned in favor of an outright shutdown as
the driving snows intensified after dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Government offices will remain closed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   More than a foot of snow was measured in outlying suburbs where
many of the 250,000 federal workers live. The snow shutdown on
Tuesday, the first in four years, cost an estimated $60 million in
lost labor.
</P>
<P>
   The storm stunned the capital as it moved up the East Coast and
crimped all but emergency government services in much of its path.
</P>
<P>
   At least six deaths were attributed to the storm, three in
traffic accidents in the Carolinas, two due to exposure in South
Carolina and a fatal heart attack suffered by a 58-year-old Staten
Island man while shoveling snow. In addition, a 5-year-old girl in
Massachusetts was missing and feared dead after falling into an icy
river on her way to school.
</P>
<P>
   The storm stopped Philadelphia's new mayor, John F. Street, from
delivering his first budget address as he took to the streets to
deal instead with his first snow emergency.
</P>
<P>
   In Delaware the legislative session was canceled, while in North
Carolina Gov. James B. Hunt declared a general emergency after
accumulations of more than 18 inches in the worst-hit areas. ``This
is a dangerous storm and should be treated as such,'' he warned as
utility workers described hurricanelike damage.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, about 200 motorists had to be rescued from
snowdrifts that paralyzed Interstate highways. More than 200,000
homes were reported without utility power along the Carolinas'
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful, but it took us by surprise,'' said Karen
Duncan in York County, S.C., speaking from her new home that was
left heatless after 10 inches of snow socked the region.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of ad hoc measures, a visiting Chinese military
delegation here resorted to taking the Metro subway rather than a
motorcade to reach a high-level meeting with officials at the
Pentagon. In a racier spirit, children freed from school in the
snow-encrusted South Carolina Midlands improvised sleds from the
boogy boards that they normally ply at the resort area's
beachfronts.
</P>
<P>
   Eight hours of snowfall enforced a mood of small-town serenity
upon the capital, exemplified at the Senate barbershop where two
barbers showed up despite the shutdown. They quietly snipped away,
talking about the weather with a few equally adventurous customers.
``Nobody told me not to work,'' a barber explained, speaking on the
same condition of anonymity that seems to mark even the most
larksome day at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The only other activity in sight was a stakeout by reporters and
photographers outside Room 410 in the Cannon House office building.
Reporters slouched in a corridor clot of wintry mufti, awaiting the
visiting Cuban grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez, the schoolboy
refugee at the heart of the custody struggle raging between Havana
and Miami's Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't touch the snow; we only walked on it,'' one of the
grandmothers replied when the news conference, like most
discussions here on Tuesday, finally got around to asking about the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton talked of it at a news conference at which he
pledged federal aid for the buried areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad you all got here,'' he told reporters, beaming as he
added, ``I thought school was canceled today.''
</P>
<P>
   Work went forward on Clinton's final State of the Union address,
to be delivered on Thursday. There was play, too, when Joe
Lockhart, the president's spokesman, could not resist the drifts
outside the West Wing and divided the staff for a snowball fight,
insurgents against incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Blustery, icy snow lashed the capital Mall at midday when
Derrick Wooley, 22, talked three friends into venturing with him to
experience the very first snowfall of his life. ``I love it,'' he
said, chewing on some snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I find it makes me thirsty stomping around in it,'' said
Wooley of Monterey, La., a new legislative intern at the American
Association of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions had left the city expecting a storm less intense and
later in arriving. The capital awoke to deep drifts and impassable
roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody involved in this would have preferred a longer lead
time,'' conceded Dr. Louis Uccellini, director of the National
Center for Environmental Prediction, as the capital shifted to its
preferred mode of post-mortem critique even before the snows
ceased.

   THAILAND-MYANMAR (Ratchaburi, Thailand) _ On their hijacked bus,
the 10 Burmese gunmen squabbled about where they wanted to go to
take hostages. Once they chose to seize a hospital here, the gunmen
seemed unsure what to do. Twenty-four hours after their adventure
began, this strange and inept band was dead, shot by Thai troopers
who stormed the hospital just before dawn and freed hundreds of
traumatized but unharmed patients, doctors and nurses. By Seth

<P>
   U.N.-CONGO (United Nations) _ Elusive and unpredictable,
President Laurent Kabila is hitting the media circuit, and his
message is clear: He has been vilified to keep the burnish on his
Rwandan and Ugandan allies, who won the approval of Washington when
they brought an end to genocide in 1994 and went on to help Kabila
overthrow the Zairean dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko. They are now his
enemies, and he wants the world to know why. By Barbara Crossette.

   IOWA-CAUCUSES (Des Moines, Iowa) _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
finished first in Monday's Iowa caucuses because he put together an
alliance of pragmatists and moralists, winning the support of
nearly all the participants in the Republican gatherings who said
they were looking for a winner and a significant share of those who
said moral values swayed their decision. Vice President Al Gore
prevailed in the Democratic caucuses in large part because he was
the overwhelming choice of trade-union members and their relatives
and of those who said they had a favorable impression of President
Clinton as a person _ not quite half the total. But those with a
negative view of the president preferred Gore's rival, former Sen.

Coke costs as little as 70 yen (67 cents), or 40 percent less. That
price gap is at the heart of a complex civil case soon to be heard

Today's model is no longer Ford's assembly line but the quick

required reading at the business schools. Manufacturers in every

ZAMBRANO: MATTHAEUS NEW YORK-BOUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO   
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ New York-New Jersey coach Octavio Zambrano
returned from Spain recently after his much anticipated
face-to-face meeting with German standout Lothar Matthaeus.
</P>
<P>
   Matthaeus, you may recall, had indicated through German
newspapers that he was reconsidering his move to Major League
Soccer after the MetroStars' firing of vice president and general
manager Charlie Stillitano.
</P>
<P>
   Matthaeus was wooed to MLS by Stillitano and former MetroStars
coach Bora Milutinovic, and he felt betrayed when both were canned.
</P>
<P>
   He was also upset with Zambrano, who promised a face-to-face
meeting when he was hired in December but had never delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not be taken to the MLS in handcuffs,'' Matthaeus said
Jan. 15. ``I must seriously consider whether things can continue
between me and this club.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Matthaeus, Zambrano promises that the
league's foreign marquee attraction for 2000 will report to the
team March 10 as planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our meeting couldn't have gone any better,'' said Zambrano.
``I went to Spain with doubt about his commitment and with a little
bit of apprehension after the comments he made to the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I came out of that meeting with two unequivocal facts:
One, he is coming to America for sure. And two, Lothar Matthaeus is
not the kind of player that can play in a (shoddy) situation. He's
an intense guy, he's not coming here for a vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a release, Matthaeus indicated he would fulfill his
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``All misunderstandings have been resolved,'' said the
38-year-old German footballer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Matthaeus is sort of like the Michael Jordan of Germany, meaning
everything he says is dissected and scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   He's also a player who carries a big influence on the clubs he
plays for and is not afraid to criticize a coach publicly.
</P>
<P>
   With all that considered, Zambrano said his meeting with
Matthaeus was very direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear everything that he had said through the German
papers, but I wanted to look him in the face and hear it from
him,'' said Zambrano. `` `Do you want to come or do you not want to
come?' That's kind of the way I dealt with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cleared everything up, but he was still a little bothered
that no one had contacted him when these changes were made and I
take some responsibility for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano scoffs at the idea that Matthaeus was genuinely upset
with him. Matthaeus had wanted to meet Zambrano earlier and said he
didn't have a phone number for his new coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never an issue until Stillitano got fired,'' said
Zambrano. ``When Charlie fired Bora and I came on everything was
fine. Lothar understood that I had a lot of work to do and that I
was coming into a difficult environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Charlie was fired, that's when (Lothar) brought up the
other stuff about (not meeting) me. But I give him the benefit of
the doubt, the league could have called him and I could have called
him to explain the changes and none of that happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was the core of his complaint and we could have
prevented a lot of this stuff had we just picked up the phone,''
Zambrano said.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy striker Carlos Hermosillo, traded from Necaxa to Club
America, indicated to La Opinion reporter Rigoberto Cervantes that
he is not returning to the MLS and plans to finish his career in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   With Hermosillo staying in Mexico, this leaves Galaxy coach Sigi
Schmid with an interesting scenario on the front line.
</P>
<P>
   Since MLS will not replace Hermosillo with another foreign
allocated player, it is up to the Galaxy to sign a lesser-known
discovery player, or give young strikers Marvin Quijano (Rio Hondo
College) or Seth George (UCLA) an opportunity to start alongside
Cobi Jones and Clint Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid was impressed with Iran striker Khodadad Azizi, who
assisted Iran's only goal in a 1-1 tie against the U.S. earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Azizi's contract with F.C. Cologne of Germany has expired, and
Azizi would be a perfect fit in Los Angeles, where he could draw
3,000 to 5,000 Iranian fans to the Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if MLS does sign him, Schmid isn't optimistic the league
would allocate him to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy defender Robin Fraser rejoined the U.S. National team
after recovering from a broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser suffered the injury when was knocked from behind by D.C.
United's Roy Lassister during the Galaxy's 2-0 loss to United in
the MLS championship match in November.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser missed the U.S. National team's training camp in
Claremont recently, but now he has joined teammates Cobi Jones and
Greg Vanney in Florida, preparing for Saturday's friendly in Chile,
available on pay-per-view for $19.95 at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Another solid defender, D.C. United's Eddie Pope, missed the
training camp in Claremont and the U.S. match with Iran because of
his recent marriage and honeymoon, but now he is back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be able to add two experienced players who can
help organize our defense,'' said U.S. head coach Bruce Arena.
``Eddie is a player who will play an important part in the National
team this upcoming year and Robin is coming off a tremendous league
season in 1999.''

PRADA'S TACTICS OUTDUEL AMERICA ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ In a duel that showcased tactical savvy
and a gambler's demeanor, the Prada Challenge from Italy led San
Francisco's America One around every mark of the course on
Wednesday to take a 1-0 lead in the five-of-nine-race final round
of the Louis Vuitton Cup. The winner will face Team New Zealand in
next month's America's Cup match.
</P>
<P>
   But the race was hardly a one-sided affair.
</P>
<P>
   The early advantage, in fact, went to America One's Paul Cayard,
who coerced the Italians into a prestart tactical error that could
have had disastrous consequences. With minutes to go before the
starting gun, in a controlling position just astern, Cayard forced
Prada to sail beyond the committee boat and away from the starting
line.
</P>
<P>
   When America One tacked back for the line with about a minute to
go, Prada followed close behind. Under the racing rules, however,
the Italian boat, as the overtaking boat, was obliged to stay well
clear of America One's transom. When the two boats were overlapped,
Cayard timed his move perfectly and gently swung his stern just
enough to tap Prada's bow.
</P>
<P>
   The on-the-water umpires immediately called a foul on Prada,
meaning that sometime during the course of the race the Italians
would need to perform a 270-degree penalty turn to exonerate
themselves for the infraction. To do so, and keep their chances
alive, they would need to establish at least a 20- to 30-second
cushion over America One. In the fluky, shifty, 9 to 14 knots of
breeze pulsing over the Hauraki Gulf, it appeared to be a tall
order.
</P>
<P>
   But the Prada tactician, Torben Grael, an Olympic gold medalist
and former Star-class world champion, kept his wits. And on the
first windward leg he put on a sailing clinic, nailing two critical
wind shifts _ first from the left, then from the right _ that
enabled Prada to open a 25-second lead over America One at the top
mark of the course.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians and Americans showed similar boat speed on the
first downwind leg, but Prada performed a flawless spinnaker drop
while America One struggled, and opened its lead to 33 seconds
while both boats trimmed their sails and headed back upwind.
</P>
<P>
   Prada needed to extend its lead in order to negotiate the
penalty turn, and it did so on the third of the course's six legs.
Rather than cover America One, Grael and Prada gambled and extended
to the right, where they found better wind pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's more pressure to the right,'' said Cayard,
whose lament was picked up by an onboard microphone. America One
soon tacked for the fresher breeze, but Prada had already gained
the necessary advantage. Upon approaching the mark, it completed
the flawless turn and rounded 25 seconds ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Little changed over the next two legs, with Prada sailing
conservatively and maintaining a comfortable advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But Cayard and America One were not finished, and on the final
downwind leg to the finish line the San Franciscans went into full
attack mode. Cayard and his crew, showing a tad more speed in the
fading afternoon breeze, closed within a boat length of the
Italians with a mile to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians, however, would not crack. Matching America One
jibe for jibe,they took Race 1 by a final margin of 24 seconds.

For their next trick, the Rockets thought they would go ahead and
spot the Minnesota Timberwolves three quarters. They rolled along
as if they could not be beaten, adding a greater degree of
difficulty to their streak.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As much as the Rockets pine for a new arena, they proved Tuesday
night that the Compaq Center rims can take a beating. So, it
seemed, could they.
</P>
<P>
   They allowed the Timberwolves to knock them around for three
quarters, then got close enough to lament a few big plays and
painful calls.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than in the last three minutes, they were beaten in
the first three quarters, their six-game winning streak ending with
a 92-84 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a little bit on our high horse and rode it too much,''
Rockets forward Walt Williams said. ``It wasn't until the fourth
quarter we really started playing. We looked up at the score and
felt, `We're about to lose the game. We've got to play.' Playing a
good team, you can't wait until you're down 17 points and decide to
try to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't there today. No intensity. No shooting. No
rebounding.''
</P>
<P>
   They had seemed to reach the point of no return when they made a
move. The Rockets had suffered through their worst shooting half of
the season, following Sunday's Heat-burning shooting by making just
12 of 40. Through three quarters they had made just 20 of 59 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Bullard, who had six treys Sunday, had taken just two
shots. Through three quarters, Steve Francis, who had keyed the
Rockets' six-game run, had made just four of 13. Shandon Anderson
had missed all five of his attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon looked more like himself, scoring eight points.
But in his fourth game back from hernia surgery, he played just 21
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditioning was very poor,'' Olajuwon said. ``I see how
far behind I am. I have new respect for basketball. The only way to
get in shape for basketball is to play basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   And with Rockets misses clanging around the arena, they were
unable to get the offensive rebounds they had grabbed consistently
when there were fewer misses to chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't shoot the ball well, it's hard to win against
good teams,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``We missed
inside shots. We missed open outside shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our intensity level was what we needed to beat a
good team playing well, as evidenced by the fact we shot 39 percent
and got nine offensive rebounds. There were a lot of misses out
there we just didn't get. That's been a trademark of ours since we
started winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Minnesota's Kevin Garnett and Terrell Brandon were on
fire, combining to make 24 of 41 shots to score 27 and 26 points,
respectively. Garnett seemed capable of getting shots whenever
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's larger than life,'' Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say he is a 7-footer (officially 6-11),'' Rockets forward
Kenny Thomas said, ``but I think he's about 8 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets made a late kick, however, and found themselves with
an inexplicable chance. Thomas, who made seven of 11 shots for 17
points, hit a jumper. Francis made three free throws. And after a
Garnett miss, Francis stepped back for an 18-footer to pull the
Rockets within five, as close as they had been since the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets even seemed to get the stop they needed when Joe
Smith and Malik Sealy missed. But Sealy stripped the ball from
Anthony Miller and the ball was ruled to have gone out of bounds
off Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy quickly nailed a trey to push the lead back to eight. But
Cuttino Mobley, who made six of 10 shots for 18 points, answered
with a 3-pointer of his own. Garnett hit a jumper, but Francis was
fouled and made two free throws to bring the Rockets back to within
five.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rockets down to their last chances, though, Thomas was
called for an offensive foul for setting a moving pick with 1:21
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought back and got a horrible call,'' Tomjanovich said.
``The guy (Garnett) pushed him, and Kenny tried to avoid (bumping
Brandon), and I don't think he hit the guy anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Thomas, ``He pushed me a little bit. I was trying to
establish myself. I know he's skinny, but anybody can be pushed
trying to set their feet up and set a pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith quickly pushed the Timberwolves' lead back to eight when
he spun to a lefthanded jumper in the lane, drawing a foul for a
three-point play with 1:05 left.
</P>
<P>
   Francis (24 points) made two free throws. But Garnett clinched
the win with 35.6 seconds left when he swished a jumper with a foot
on the 3-point line for a 90-82 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Those last few moments might have ended the Rockets' rally. But
they knew the first 36 minutes had left them with no margin for
error and cost them their winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have that fire,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I don't
understand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As good as everybody's feeling, that's human nature. People
start patting you on the back. To really make it and to keep a
streak alive, you just have to overcome human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling guys we couldn't come out feeling good about
ourselves. We had to have that hungry attitude. We just need to get
that back.''

FOUR AMERICANS WALTZ INTO THE SEMIFINAL ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ They have yet to exchange big shots at
the Australian Open, yet Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi are already
exchanging big compliments. And as they prepare to face each other
for the 29th time, it is difficult for those who have watched their
games and personalities mature over the last decade to disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre's playing as well as you can play,'' Sampras said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete's one of the greatest big-situation, big-match players
who have ever played the game, and his record certainly shows
that,'' Agassi said. ``Every time we're playing, it's at a stage of
the tournament when he's probably the least vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   They will play again on Thursday night in the semifinals, a
round earlier than usual. But then that is nobody's fault but
Sampras'. He is in Agassi's half of the draw only because he
finished last year ranked No. 3 after missing several months
because of weariness and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, for a change, was the consistent presence and force,
winning the French Open, reaching the final at Wimbledon and then
winning the U.S. Open. But if he is to reach his fourth straight
Grand Slam final, he will have to change his recent luck against
the less expansive man who has long been his measuring stick at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras holds a 17-11 career advantage and defeated Agassi in
all four matches they played that mattered in 1999; his only loss
came in the round-robin segment of the year-end ATP Tour
Championship, which he ended up winning by defeating Agassi in the
final.
</P>
<P>
   In the other men's quarterfinals, to be played on Wednesday,
Nicolas Kiefer, the No. 4-seeded player from Germany, will face No.
12 Magnus Norman of Sweden, and No. 2 Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia
will face unseeded Younes el-Aynaoui of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   While Agassi looks as fit and focused as he ever has in his
14-year career, the key to the semifinal may not be whether he
maintains his eerily high standard but whether Sampras can keep
serving superbly on a court that is quicker than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Pete controls his own destiny with his serve,'' Chris
Woodruff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre is playing unbelievable tennis, but if Sampras serves
like he can serve, I think Sampras will win,'' Hicham Arazi said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff and Arazi were the unseeded players Sampras and Agassi
beat in straight sets on Tuesday in the quarterfinals. Agassi
dismissed Arazi, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2, in 1 hour 32 minutes and handled
the varied pace and moods the flamboyant Moroccan conjured up with
the same brutally efficient and frequently spectacular ease with
which he handled Mark Philippoussis' enormous power in the fourth
round. Sampras was nearly as brilliant in his 7-5, 6-3, 6-3 victory
over Woodruff, a gifted baseliner from Knoxville, Tenn., who was
playing in his first Grand Slam quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
   Though Woodruff picked on Sampras' traditionally weaker backhand
side, Sampras held firm and, for the second straight match, got
well over 60 percent of his first serves in play.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Australia Day, this nation's annual celebration of
independence, Tuesday felt more like the Fourth of July at
Melbourne Park. While Agassi and Sampras were winning in straight
sets, two other Americans, Jennifer Capriati and second-seeded
Lindsay Davenport, were doing the same, and they will now face each
other in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Capriati beat Ai Sugiyama of Japan, 6-0, 6-2.
Davenport was overwhelming again in a 6-1, 6-2 defeat of Julie
Halard-Decugis on Tuesday. But Davenport, a 23-year-old who took a
lengthier but surer path to tennis success, accepts and agrees that
Capriati should be the emotional favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great: one of the best stories that women's tennis has
had, regardless of the younger girls coming up,'' Davenport said.
``I mean, when I was 13, she turned pro, and she was one of my
idols for about a year because she did so well, and I wasn't even
near that level when I was 13 or 14.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati has not reached a Grand Slam semifinal since the 1991
U.S. Open, when she was 15, but since hiring Harold Solomon as her
coach last spring she has regained her fitness and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   In the other women's semifinal on Thursday, Conchita Martinez
will face top-seeded Martina Hingis. A finalist here in 1998,
Martinez put her increasingly unusual heavy topspin forehand to
fine and frequent use on Wednesday to defeat Yelena Likhovtseva,
6-3, 4-6, 9-7. Likhovtseva upset Serena Williams, last year's U.S.
Open champion, in the fourth round, but Martinez was not nearly as
charitable as the error-prone American teenager.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis defeated Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, 6-1, 6-1, in
Wednesday's other quarterfinal. It was Hingis's 13th consecutive
victory over the Spanish baseliner, and Martinez cannot be expected
to fare much better. She has lost to Hingis seven times a row
without winning a set and the fact that she played nearly two hours
longer on Wednesday will not help her cause. ``Hopefully she's
going to be a little sore tomorrow,'' Hingis said. ``I'm going to
make her run.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
His nickname is ``Da Kid,'' but make no mistake about it,
Minnesota's Kevin Garnett is definitely Da Man in the NBA these
days.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Garnett, a 7-foot forward who can play a variety of positions
for the Timberwolves, has progressed from Exhibit A for every kid
who wanted to jump from high school to the pros, as Garnett did in
1995, to the next big thing in the NBA after Michael Jordan's
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   He proved that much (again) Tuesday night when he put up 27
points, 12 rebounds and six assists to lead the Timberwolves to a
92-84 victory over the Rockets before 15,094 at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   The win extended the Timberwolves' win streak to five games, and
16 of 19, and snapped the Rockets' win streak at six games.
</P>
<P>
   And if you needed another clue as to why the Rockets went down
in flames, it was Mr. Garnett, with the jumper, at the top of the
key.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rockets trying to rally, it was Garnett who knocked
down a 23-foot jumper with 35.6 seconds left to put Minnesota up
90-82 and end any hopes of a Houston comeback.
</P>
<P>
   But, typical of Garnett, he just shrugged off the shot as
nothing more than part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up at the clock and saw that I had seven seconds
(remaining),'' he said. ``I saw that I had a little piece of the
court in a semi-isolation. I knew the clock was running down, and
seeing the guys were being overplayed, they were sort of looking at
me like, `It's all yours.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So got my stuff together, knew what I wanted to do, and I did
it. It was a great win for the Timberwolves tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Garnett also shrugged off the technical he got for jawing with
Kenny Thomas with 3:50 remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was frustrated,'' said Minnesota coach Flip Saunders of
Garnett. ``He had taken a few hits, so he got frustrated. We got
just eight free throws, so I think he felt he was getting hit and
wasn't getting the call.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidenced by his performance, the Rockets had no answer for
Garnett, but few teams do. Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich started
Matt Bullard on Garnett, but he should have been named Matt
Bullseye for the way Garnett was shooting over him.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you stop Garnett?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you start out with, `Our Father, who art in heaven,'''
said Tomjanovich, laughing. ``Really, you can't stop a guy like
that. He can do so many things on the court. You just hope he's
having an off game.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the puzzle of Kevin Garnett, who can shoot 3-pointers,
put the ball on the floor like a guard and play the middle like the
7-foot player he is.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he's an anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   And he's an anomaly in other ways as well. In an age when young
superstars know little about the history of the game and have even
less respect for that history, Garnett is a basketball buff who
recently apologized to Karl Malone for having more All-Star votes
than the Utah veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as these guys are here, they're always going to have
that certain respect,'' Garnett said. ``They're always going to
have that certain fire. As long as they're still putting on a
jersey, I think everyone is still going to have a certain amount of
respect to those guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until they're sitting in their rocking chairs at midcourt and
finally say, `I'm done with it,' I think that then and only then
will they finally be gone. But they'll still be around in spirit.
You can't ever replace the great ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised by those rules (of respect). When you're raised
like that, those are the rules you go by. That's why I double Dream
(Hakeem Olajuwon). He's my favorite player. I don't think he even
knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   He does now.
</P>
<P>
   And the feeling is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is unbelievable,'' Olajuwon said. ``To have a man that
tall, over 7 feet, who can do all those things. He can put the ball
on the floor and dribble, and he can shoot from the outside. And
you can't block his shot. He can do so many things on the court. He
is a unique player.''

JUDGE ALLOWS MURDER TRIAL OF 4 OFFICERS TO BE TELEVISED  
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add District of Columbia in 4th graf.)  
(mk) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trial of the four New York City police officers charged with
killing Amadou Diallo will be televised, a state judge ruled
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Justice Joseph C. Teresi of state Supreme Court
in Albany, N.Y., who is presiding over the case, ruled that a 1952
statute banning cameras in New York courtrooms was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   He also referred to the relocation of the trial, already a
source of contention, from the Bronx to Albany. ``The denial of
access to the vast majority will accomplish nothing but more
divisiveness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No appeal of the justice's ruling is expected, so without a
higher court ruling, the future of the New York statute beyond this
courtroom remains undecided. The state is one of only three, along
with Mississippi and South Dakota, plus the District of Columbia,
that ban all recording and broadcasting of trials. Legal experts
said that the decision would not be binding on any other state
judges, but could be an influential precedent for them to cite on
similar motions.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is sure to provide fodder for the debate over
cameras in courtrooms. News organizations and First Amendment
lawyers have long argued that it is unconstitutional to bar
cameras, and that televised trials give the public a better
understanding of the judicial process.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of televised trials point to examples like the
O.J. Simpson criminal trial in Los Angeles to argue that cameras
create a circuslike atmosphere. Some defense lawyers say they
believe the cameras infringe on the rights of their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection, which will not be televised under the ruling, is
scheduled to begin on Monday in the Diallo case, in which four
officers are charged with murder and reckless endangerment. Their
lawyers have not disputed that the officers killed Diallo, an
unarmed street vendor, in a hail of 41 bullets in the Bronx on Feb.
4, but have indicated that the officers believed he had a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The motion to allow the case to be televised was filed by the
Courtroom Television Network, which will serve as the pool camera
for other networks seeking to televise parts of the trial. The
cable network, which broadcasts trials nationally with commercial
sponsorship, plans to cover the entire trial.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, one of the lawyers who filed the motion on behalf
of Court TV, said he believed it was the first time in the state or
country that a judge had ruled that a ban on cameras in the
courtroom was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The determination that cameras ought to be allowed in this
case at the very beginning of the 21st century has symbolic impact
as well,'' Abrams said. ``It was anachronistic for New York state _
the media capital of the country _ to be one of the few states to
have a flat ban on cameras in its courtrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a 10-year experiment that ended in 1997, civil and
criminal trials were permitted to be televised in New York state.
Among the defendants whose trials were televised were Joel
Steinberg, who was convicted of beating his illegally adopted
daughter to death, and Colin Ferguson, who was convicted in 1995 of
murdering six passengers on the Long Island Rail Road.. Legislators
cited the Simpson trial, among other reasons, when they refused to
renew the camera experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Four New York state judicial reports found that the presence of
cameras in the courtrooms had not impeded the administration of
justice and recommended allowing such coverage. Forty-seven states
make some provision for cameras in the courtroom. Television
coverage of all federal court proceedings is effectively banned.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Teresi strongly criticized the state
Legislature for allowing that experiment to lapse, calling it ``a
monument to politically created procrastination and inaction.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   News organizations had little reason to expect a friendly
decision from Teresi, who had earlier denied their request to
unseal some motions in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very significant that this particular trial judge would
permit the trial to be broadcast in the face of the Legislature's
very recent rejection of cameras in the courtroom and given this
particular case,'' said Steven Zeidman, the director of the Fund
for the Modern Courts, a nonpartisan monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Anne Williams, the justice who was to preside over the
trial in the Bronx, had previously rejected a motion by the
Regional News Network to televise the trial. In apparent deference
to her ruling, Teresi said that the Court TV motion was different
because it had been brought under the U.S. Constitution as well as
the New York state constitution, and because of ``the change of
circumstances since that decision, namely the change of venue.''
</P>
<P>
   His ruling was unequivocal. ``There is no doubt that the First
Amendment of the United States Constitution requires that all
criminal trials must be open to the press and public, absent
compelling and clearly articulated reasons for closing such
proceedings,'' he wrote. But he was careful to state that he was
not saying that there was an absolute right to televise all
proceedings; rather, he said, an absolute ban was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers accepted the decision. ``If the judge believes
this is a case that should be televised in the interest of justice,
I can't argue with that,'' James J. Culleton, the lawyer for
Officer Richard Murphy, said. His client, he said, was very happy
with the decision. ``Once he testifies, the public will learn that
his actions were both reasonable and justified,'' Culleton said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen C. Worth, one of the lawyers for Officer Edward
McMellon, said of his client: ``He appreciates as do I that a
public viewing of this entire trial is in his best interest.'' But
Worth added that his client was concerned about having his picture
repeatedly broadcast, fearing for his and his family's safety.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Reed, a spokesman for the Bronx district attorney, said
that office favored televising trials as a rule, and particularly
in this case. ``When the location of the trial is 150 miles from
the community where the alleged crime was committed, cameras are
that much more necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision seems to reflect a growing consensus in New York's
legal community that cameras should be permitted in courtrooms.
Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye has generally favored cameras in the
courtroom, but officials said Tuesday that it would be
inappropriate for her to comment on a pending matter.

   In the Diallo case, the state attorney general, Eliot L.
Spitzer, had declined to defend the statute against Court TV's
motion. Tuesday, his spokesman, Scott Brown, said, ``We're very
pleased that there will be cameras in the court because we feel
it's an important part of instilling public confidence in the
judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   But Teresi's decision in the Diallo case could fall if a media
organization moved to televise another trial, and an appellate
court with jurisdiction over Teresi's court ruled that the statute
was indeed constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Zeidman of the court monitoring group noted that the
justice had a difficult task in balancing the education of the
public with the defendants' right to a fair trial. Indeed, for the
defense witnesses, the prospect of a nationwide television audience
could have the unsettling effect of making reluctant witnesses even
more so.
</P>
<P>
   But under the rules that were in effect when the state's 10-year
experiment in televising trials ended, and which Teresi indicated
would again be applicable, some witnesses _ although not the
defendants _ may request that their images not be televised.

<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Neither fatigue nor a snow-packed Nor'easter
could stop White House contenders from trekking through this
sparsely populated state Tuesday as the presidential spotlight
shifted from Iowa to New Hampshire.
<P>
   Fresh off their victories in Monday's caucuses, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore arrived here in hopes of
delivering a knockout punch to their competitors next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for a few hours to go to the State of the Union
Address, I'm going to be here every minute of every hour of every
day,'' Gore told an enthusiastic crowd of high school students.
</P>
<P>
   One week before the New Hampshire primary, the race could hardly
be any tighter or the stakes any higher. The outcome will shape the
race as it heads toward March 7, when California and 15 other
states hold primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, the parties will hold back-to-back debates as
candidates and residents alike brace for a week of nonstop
politicking. The events will be broadcast on national television
starting at 7 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   Although puny in relation to an electoral giant like California
_ New Hampshire has only slightly more registered voters than Santa
Clara County _ thousands of journalists have already descended on
the state, their number held in check only by a major winter storm,
which left scores of reporters stranded in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   With its emphasis on door-to-door campaigning, its contrarian
reputation and fierce independence, New Hampshire provides Democrat
Bill Bradley and Republican John McCain their best chance of
scoring victories over the front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   The final week before the nation's first primary could also
foment a do-or-die frenzy for several candidates, some of whom have
spent millions of dollars and many months campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain or Bradley loses New Hampshire _ it's over. Kaput,''
said Chip Griffin, a New Hampshire-based political consultant not
associated with any campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a longshot candidate for the GOP
nomination, was expected to drop from the race Wednesday after his
poor showing in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley arrived from Iowa before sunrise _ hours ahead of the
snow _ and began his day at a high school in southern New
Hampshire, where students patiently sat through an hourlong event,
even though they were told the school would close because of the
weather as soon as the assembly was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are tired of misrepresentation in political campaigns
to pursue a personal agenda, if you are tired of what you have seen
in the last decade in this country, then you can send a message,''
Bradley said to a mass of television cameras and a crowd of
students mostly too young to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley hopes his nonpolitician appeal, and his emphasis on
health care, campaign finance reform and economic assistance to the
poor, will play well in a state where he is still well remembered
from his days as a basketball star.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also spent his morning at a high school, telling the
pumped-up crowd of teenagers that not only is New Hampshire better
off today than it was seven years ago, but under a Gore presidency,
it would become better yet.
</P>
<P>
   In a telling sign of Gore's advantage among the party
establishment, the highest-ranking local official on stage with
Bradley was Alvirne High School's student body vice president. Gore
was joined on stage and introduced by New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spent Tuesday at town hall meetings, repeatedly telling
reporters that Bush's first-place finish in Iowa would have little
effect in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, released a new TV commercial highlighting what
he views as one of his strongest credentials _ his electability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe my compassionate, conservative vision can unite
America and win the White House,'' Bush says in the 30-second spot.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of the primary schedule, New Hampshire has a
disproportionate influence over who the next president will be.
That has been a matter of pride for Granite State voters since
1952, when New Hampshire gained its first-in-the-nation primary
status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good not just for New Hampshire, but for the whole
country,'' said Steve Duprey, chairman of the state's Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are more involved, more thoughtful,'' Duprey said,
noting that a turnout of more than 70 percent is customary. ``The
primary is part of the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshirites do seem to be more engaged in politics than do
folks almost anywhere else in the country. One reflection of that
involvement is the state's House of Representatives, which, with
408 members, is one of the largest legislative bodies in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But critics contend that the demographics of the state _ which
is 98 percent white _ skew the outcome of the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester resident Peter Leonard readily acknowledges the lack
of minorities. Leonard used to be homeless. Now he sits in the New
Hampshire House of Representatives, representing downtown
Manchester. His office is located in a local tavern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine is one of the only districts with any color,'' Leonard
said.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever its quirks, Duprey and others say there is a real
advantage in starting the process of selecting a president in a
small state.
</P>
<P>
   ``A less known, less well-funded candidate has a shot,'' he
said, noting the success of Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Bill Clinton
in 1992. ``They couldn't compete in a place like California.''
</P>
<P>
   As a tangible sign of the state's political intimacy, Duprey
made his comments from a car phone on the state's main freeway as
he was passed by Gore's vice presidential entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Though conservative, New Hampshire is a much different state
than Iowa, which held the nation's first caucuses Monday. Taxes,
health care and education are the dominant issues in New England,
as compared with agriculture and abortion. Independents outnumber
Republicans and Democrats here.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire is a bastion of independent thinking,'' Bradley
said Tuesday in an appeal to voters who can cast ballots in either
the Democratic or Republican contest. ``Nobody tells them what to
do. They make up their own minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked last week what he thought of New Hampshire and Iowa's
inordinate influence, Bush joked that he would have to ``wait and
see the outcome'' before making that judgment.

 HEARST CORP. SWEETENS DEAL IN EXAMINER SALE  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Hearst Corp. put the San Francisco Examiner
up for sale again Tuesday _ this time with a printing plant,
delivery trucks and other physical assets _ in a bid to overcome
antitrust objections about its proposed purchase of The San
Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst offered to buy The Chronicle in August for an estimated
$660 million and simultaneously put its own Examiner up for sale.
But the original deal included only the Examiner's name and
circulation list, which led to charges that the deal was a sham.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the deal has been bogged down by a Justice
Department antitrust review, objections from city officials and a
private lawsuit whose goal is to preserve two newspapers in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to respond to the criticisms that the (previous)
terms of sale were inadequate,'' said Tim White, publisher of the
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   White said Justice Department officials reviewed the new sale
offer before it was made. But he declined to predict whether the
Justice Department and other government agencies will allow the
Chronicle deal to proceed if no one steps forth by the February 15
deadline Hearst set for ``expressions of interest'' from potential
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Barnett, a law professor at the University of California
at Berkeley and newspaper antitrust expert, said the deadline could
be extended, but ``if Hearst adheres to the conditions (of the new
sale offer), it implies that Justice will sign off on the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, The Chronicle and the Examiner have maintained
separate editorial staffs while sharing ownership of the San
Francisco Newspaper Agency, which handles production, ad sales,
printing and distribution for both papers. Under this joint
operating agreement, which expires in 2005, the two papers have
enjoyed a government-sanctioned monopoly and split revenues and
expenses 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's daily circulation is 456,742 and the Examiner's
is 107,129. The two papers produce a combined Sunday edition.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Hearst, based in New York, offered to sell a printing
plant in San Francisco _ one of three used to produce the two
newspapers _ about 100 delivery trucks and any ``additional
assets'' a prospective buyer might request. But it exempted its
profit-sharing arrangement under the JOA.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the new offer would require the buyer to print The
Chronicle each night at the San Francisco plant until Hearst could
replace that printing capacity. That probably would prevent the new
owner from immediately switching the Examiner from evening to
morning circulation, where it would meet the Chronicle head-on.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the firms rumored to have been interested in the
Examiner, including Ted Fang's Independent newspaper in San
Francisco and San Jose-based Knight Ridder Inc., could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Singleton, whose Alameda Newspaper Group publishes the
Oakland Tribune and other newspapers, issued a statement saying he
``has no interest in purchasing the San Francisco Examiner under
any circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   P. Scott McKibben, publisher of the Oakland Tribune and
president of ANG, said nothing could tempt his company to buy an
afternoon paper with a circulation under 115,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything that could be done up to and including a
profit split with Hearst over the remaining course of the JOA
contract that would make me feel better about recommending to buy
the Examiner,'' McKibben said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's new sale offer was termed ``inadequate'' by Joseph M.
Alioto, the attorney representing San Francisco political figure
Clint Reilly, who has filed suit to block Hearst's takeover of the
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto said Hearst should be required to sell its half of the
joint operating agreement as part of any sale of the Examiner.
``They cannot eliminate the JOA for purposes of achieving a
monopoly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown, who with Rep. Nancy Pelosi and City Attorney
Louise Renne has campaigned to keep San Francisco a two-newspaper
town, issued a statement Tuesday expressing hope that the new terms
``will prompt stronger interest in producing a viable buyer for the
Examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Michael Yaki, who has also voiced a desire to keep
two newspapers in San Francisco, said he would ask Hearst to give
the city attorney's office a copy of the new Examiner sales
document so the city can determine whether it is a good-faith
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to at least create the environment for competition,''
Yaki said, adding that ``if no such competition comes forward we
have to seriously review our options and see if we've done all we
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff members at the Examiner, who have worked in limbo for
months, crowded into the newspaper's conference room about noon, as
publisher White outlined the new terms and job guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Examiner staff member Michael Dougan said White reiterated
Hearst's pledge that anyone who was not offered substantially the
same job, at the same pay, by a new buyer would be able to get a
job at the Hearst-run Chronicle. But when Examiner staff members
asked whether they could turn down such comparable jobs if they
preferred to work for the Chronicle, White said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no wailing or gnashing of teeth,'' Dougan said.
``But there was concern about that.''
</P>
<P>
   White also met Tuesday with union leaders representing the 2,300
printing, distribution, production and advertising staff of the San
Francisco Newspaper Agency to offer them similar job guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Hall, a Chronicle reporter and union official who was at
the meeting, said that although the tone was cordial, union
officials made it clear that they would insist that any new buyer
honor the union contracts in place at both papers.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper analyst John Morton said he doubted that the new
assets being offered would make the Examiner more attractive and
that they might even make it less desirable because the new owner
would have to pony up for the Examiner's 40,000-square-foot office
building at 110 Fifth St. and the eight-acre, 22-unit printing
plant in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Morton was unwilling to estimate what the Examiner might be
worth under the new sale terms, but Scott Smithers, an executive
with Divco West Properties, a San Jose real estate investment firm,
estimated the Examiner's main building is worth ``in the low
$200s'' per square foot. That works out to roughly $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   McKibben, the ANG president, said he did not know what a
printing plant would fetch, other than to say it would cost
``double-digit millions.'' He estimated the 100 delivery trucks
might cost $30,000 each, or $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still unclear is what will happen February 15 if no buyer steps
forth. White, at the Examiner, said Hearst cannot predict whether
the Department of Justice will allow the Chronicle deal to proceed,
or whether the city or some other agency might intervene even if
the government removed its objections. The Reilly lawsuit also
remains a wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst officials apparently are prepared to move quickly if the
legal roadblocks are removed. One newspaper union official said
that at a meeting Tuesday union leaders were told that if no buyer
emerges by February 15, Hearst will try to complete the Chronicle
purchase within 24 to 48 hours.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco Fire Department is out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   According to official documents leaked to this reporter, the
department spent a whopping $53,428 on firefighter salaries last
year, and more than $200 on horseshoeing!
</P>
<P>
   Wait, on closer inspection, I see the document is the
department's budget for the fiscal year 1902-03.
</P>
<P>
   The F.D. not only paid a horseshoer $99, but squandered an
additional $14.25 on horseshoeing supplies. What were those spoiled
steeds wearing? Bruno Magli?
</P>
<P>
   The document was leaked by Armond Saucci, who was walking past
City Hall many years ago, saw workers tossing leather-bound
journals into the trash and rescued the Fire Department's 1902-03
Financial Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Had they known what was coming four years down the road, fire
officials in '02 probably would have spent more than $470 on hoses
and hydrants.
</P>
<P>
   ONLY IN S.F.: The delegate caucus selection was held last Sunday
for Nancy Pelosi's 8th Congressional District, and of the six
delegates for Al Gore's camp, five are gay.

   AT THE BALLET, one thing I love is that guys in the audience
aren't afraid to take fashion risks. Why should only the women get
to wear double-take designer duds?
</P>
<P>
   At Monday night's gala season opener, one man was in a vintage
tux that Benjamin Franklin might have worn to his junior prom.
Another man wore a black tuxedo pantskirt, the offspring of a
romantic encounter between culottes and keep-on-truckin'
bell-bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   It's a vain and zany fashion fest on opening night, but it's
also the gathering of the folks who foot the ballet bills and help
make the city a City. Culturewise, man does not live by 49ers
football alone.
</P>
<P>
   A JAGUAR growling down the road in the East Bay, license plates
``4 MY PMS.''
</P>

   CRAZY CRAB, pick up the white courtesy phone:

<P>
   The Oakland A's have a job posted on their Web site for a
``backup mascot.'' Previous mascot experience is highly desired.
</P>
<P>
   Also patience, since you will spend your time hunkered under the
grandstands in a sweltering woodchuck suit waiting for Stomper the
Elephant to sprain his trunk.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of creature are the A's looking for? Considering the
tenuous state of the team's future in Oakland, maybe a lame duck.
Or a dodo.
</P>
<P>
   THE CHEFS at Jack's Restaurant and John's Grill were informed by
boss John Konstin that they are being sent to CIA training.

   CONCERNED CITIZENS continue to send suggestions for the fate of
the Doggie Diner head.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kelly says put it on top of the SPCA building. Ah, but that
begs the question: Why hasn't the SPCA been involved in this case
all along?
</P>
<P>
   Several folks apparently held an ESP conference call and decided
the best home for the Doggie head is somewhere at the Giants' new
ballpark, because, says Jeff Sobul, ``What could be more American
than baseball and hot dogs?''
</P>
<P>
   Other than the Declaration of Independence, nothing.

 U.S. TO SCALE BACK ROADS IN FORESTS  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ U.S. Forest Service Chief Michael Dombeck said
in a speech Tuesday in San Francisco that the era of ambitious
road-building in national forests is over, and he announced that a
new proposal to close roads will be released in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dombeck also cited the value of national forests as watershed
and said that water may supplant timber as the most precious
natural resource found on federal forests.
</P>
<P>
   His statements to the Commonwealth Club of California indicate
that the service is moving toward a new philosophy of forest
management, one that emphasizes recreation and habitat protection
over large-scale logging and other ``extractive'' uses.
</P>
<P>
   During his luncheon speech, Dombeck noted that the 383,000 miles
of roads that crisscross national forests and grasslands were once
considered essential for implementing the agency's ``multiple use''
concept of encouraging logging, mining, grazing and recreation.
</P>
<P>
   But public sentiment has changed in recent years, Dombeck said.
``We're moving from an era where roads were a capital improvement
to now, when they're considered a liability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roads in national forests have been blamed for contributing to
soil erosion, landslides, reduced water quality in rivers, blockage
of salmon spawning grounds and degradation of wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for closing roads is monetary. The Forest
Service's budget includes enough money to maintain only about 17
percent of its roads, said Dombeck, so it is proceeding with a new
plan that could ultimately result in the closure of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an $11 billion road maintenance backlog,'' he said.
``Essentially, we have more roads than we can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Forest Service declared an 18-month moratorium on
road-building, as Dombeck said, ``to get a timeout.'' In the next
few weeks, he said, the agency will release a draft management
policy on roads.
</P>
<P>
   The policy will direct forest supervisors to meet with local
officials to determine which Forest Service roads are crucial to
regional transportation needs, said Dombeck. In the end, he said,
there will be fewer roads.
</P>
<P>
   But Dombeck emphasized that some roads will not only be kept
open, but improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 1.7 million tourists on National Forest Service
roads a day,'' he said. ``That's up tenfold from 1950. Providing
efficient (recreational) access to national forests is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Dombeck said road decommissioning and maintenance will provide
much-needed work to rural communities hit hard by recent logging
restrictions designed to protect endangered species such as the
spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Watson, California/Nevada regional director for the
Wilderness Society, said he is optimistic that the Forest Service
is about to initiate significant changes in its road rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strong roadless policy would represent a seismic shift,'' he
said. ``I believe it is the intent of the service and that it is
what the majority of the American people support.''
</P>
<P>
   Dombeck also said federal forests are becoming increasingly
important for the pure water they supply to the nation's reservoirs
and aquifers, and that it is consequently important to manage such
lands as watersheds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forested lands comprise about one-third of the nation's land
area and supply about two-thirds of the total U.S. runoff,'' he
said. ``National forests are the largest single source of runoff in
the continental United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Dombeck said more than 3,400 communities, with 60 million
residents, rely on national forest lands for their drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the value of fisheries and river recreation or the
reduction in filtration costs to municipalities because forests are
so clean, Dombeck said, the basic annual value of water on national
forest lands is $3.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While his agency is moving away from many types of logging
practices, added Dombeck, timber harvesting will remain a part of
the service's focus. Maintaining forest health often requires
selective cutting, the removal of nonnative flora and prescribed
burning, he said _ even in areas containing old-growth timber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you need to do things (in old-growth areas) such as
thinning overstocked stands,'' Dombeck said. ``But we are moving in
the direction of not cutting any old-growth trees.''

 STATE CRIME DROPS 15% IN 9 MONTHS  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Major crime in the state dropped almost 15 percent
during the first nine months of 1999, Attorney General Bill Lockyer
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are for crimes reported between January and
September of 1999, compared with the same time period the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   While crime fell in all major categories, homicides showed the
least decline, with just a 4.5 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were still 1,060 homicides,'' Lockyer said in his annual
State of Public Safety address. ``That's four murders a day. That's
not an acceptable result. We need to keep working to bring that
down.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, the crime index dropped 13.6 percent, but
there were more homicides _ up from 41 to 46. The crime index
combines numbers from homicides, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated
assault, burglary and motor vehicle theft.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer said there are five main factors that influence crime,
including two _ the economy and demographics _ that law enforcement
cannot influence.
</P>

   ``When people have jobs and are making a decent wage, they are
less likely to commit crimes,'' he said. But demographics will
start working against law enforcement starting next year, Lockyer
said, when the number of 18- to 30-year-old men starts to increase.
</P>
<P>
   The three other factors that influence crime are detention,
prevention and apprehension. Lockyer said California has done
plenty on detention and now must focus on other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 20 years in the Legislature, I voted for more than 2,000
additional years of penalties,'' he said. ``We have very tough
sentences in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer said he hopes to help local law enforcement with more
resources, to step up the efforts to serve outstanding warrants and
to increase the use of forensic evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea is to make it more likely that someone who
commits a crime is caught,'' he said. ``I think apprehension should
be our No. 1 priority. It is the No. 1 neglected aspect of crime
fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   On the prevention side, Lockyer said he wants to focus on
stopping youths from getting involved in crime in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best early intervention system we have is a healthy
family,'' he said.

<P>
   The eastern face of the mountain is avalanche terrain. There are
no trees to anchor the snow. A screaming wind picks up even more
snow from the mountain's far side and deposits it onto a bulging
cornice that threatens to crack under its growing weight.
</P>
<P>
   The slope of this mountain in Davos, Switzerland, is steep _ 40
degrees. To ski it after a heavy snowstorm, you would have to be
either exceptionally unwise or an avalanche researcher. Four of the
latter _ Bob Brown, Ed Adams, Jim Dent and Karl Birkeland, of
Montana State University _ are making plans to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Their destination is a plywood shack in the protective embrace
of a small rock outcropping _ directly in the path of an avalanche.
The structure is 9-by-6 feet, enough room, barely, for two
scientists (the rest retreat to the edge of the slide path), an
array of instrumentation, a gas-powered generator and one rather
nervous journalist.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men will ski to the top of the ridge, hoist four
pounds of explosives on a pulley out over the crown of the slope,
and light the fuse, sending vast amounts of snow down on his
colleagues' heads.
</P>
<P>
   Why do researchers risk their lives like this? In part, because
few other jobs require one to ski through some of the planet's most
reliably gorgeous scenery. And although there is an inescapable
sense that the danger itself is appealing, they do it to save
lives. The more that is known about the dynamics of avalanches, the
easier it becomes to accurately predict where, and how far, they'll
tumble.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a big avalanche to kill people _ the vast
majority of deaths occur in slides that run no farther than 200
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche debris is nothing like the airy, fresh-fallen snow of
skiers' dreams. The snow crystals in the debris pile left by an
avalanche are packed together so densely that they feel like
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The snow that buries the typical victim is only 50 percent air,
as opposed to fresh snow, which is 80 percent air. You cannot move
_ or even expand your chest to breathe _ let alone dig your way
free.
</P>
<P>
   Suffocation is the means to the end in two-thirds of avalanche
deaths. The remaining third die from the trauma of being flung
against boulders and trees at speeds of up to 80 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims are done in by their own breath, which condenses
and then freezes on their faces, forming an ice mask that slowly
cuts off what little air remains. Only one avalanche burial victim
in four lives to remember it ...
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Car four of the Davos Cable Car holds the regular assortment of
brightly hued skiers and teen-age snowboarders. But one man carries
no skis. It's Martin Schneebeli, the resident snowpack structures
expert, commuting to the field research area of the Swiss Federal
Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research in Davos.
</P>
<P>
   The research area is a series of cold labs at the top of a
mountain directly above the town.
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters of the way up the mountain, Schneebeli, my guide
for the day, points out a patch of snow checkered with deep square
pits. These snow pits are the basic tools of avalanche prediction.
</P>
<P>
   The layers visible on the walls of the pits reveal the history
of the past few months' snowfalls. To determine avalanche risk,
forecasters visually assess these layers to ascertain the stability
of the resulting snowpack.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of avalanche prediction, weather calls the shots.
Spring thaws can weaken the bonds that form between crystals as the
snow melts and refreezes, paving the way for deadly, heavy, wet
snow avalanches.
</P>
<P>
   A strong sun will melt surface snow, which then refreezes at
night into an icy crust, off of which the next layer of snow can
easily slip.
</P>
<P>
   A similar slippery and fragile snow layer is something called
``surface hoar'' _ essentially a morning frost on top of the snow
that gets buried by more snow.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing top billing in the rogues' gallery of weak layers is a
wily meteorological entity known as ``depth hoar.'' In early
winter, when the ground is still warm, heated and moistened air
rises through the snow and cools into a layer of angular,
recalcitrant, depth-hoar crystals _ pretty to look at, but weak as
kittens.
</P>
<P>
   In a 32-degree Fahrenheit room in the Institute's field station,
researchers Charles Fierz and Thorsten Baunach create depth hoar in
a box to determine how quickly it grows under various snow and
weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In the corner are 12 cardboard Chiquita banana boxes filled with
snow. Fierz scoops some of it into a sieve and hands it to Baunach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we make a snowfall!'' Baunach says, grinning like a kid.
He shakes the sieve over a box to recreate inside the lab what has
been happening outside for the past 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Like a picky head chef, Fierz points to lumps in the mound of
sifted white: ``Try double sifting,'' he suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Fierz and Baunach will take snow samples from their boxes every
12 hours, as the snow's temperature rises from minus 4 to 30
degrees Fahrenheit. The snow is shallow _ only about 2.5 inches.
The shallower the snow, the steeper the temperature gradient
between the ground-warmed bottom (being played, in this case, by a
heated metal plate) and the air-chilled top of the snow. The warm
air rises, cools quickly and becomes frost crystals.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the shack, Ed Adams and Karl Birkeland are busy with
shovels, clearing space in the snow to lay down equipment that will
log the snow's temperature as the avalanche passes.
</P>
<P>
   I ask Adams what would happen if the avalanche let go on its own
while we were out here.
</P>
<P>
   ``See those flats?'' Adams points down the slope. ``You'll end
up down there.'' Brown sticks his head out of the shack. ``But
first, you'll have to go through those trees. That'll beat you up
real bad.''
</P>
<P>
   I ask Jim Dent what it's like in the shack during an avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gets grayer,'' he says. ``I like to stick my hand out
into the avalanche as it goes by. It's like putting your hand into
a river.''
</P>
<P>
   He tells me that if I want a good view, I should climb up onto a
platform nailed to a tree 100 yards downhill and 30 feet to the
side of the slide path. So I do. From my perch, I watch Adams ski
up to the top, his backpack bulky with explosives. Then two other
researchers ski off to the side, much farther to the side than my
tree.
</P>
<P>
   The path from Adams to me looks like a straight line.
Apparently, the avalanche turns as it flows downhill. I try not to
think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Five, four, three, two ... A tumble of choppy white emerges from
beneath the bomb's sooty smoke cloud: Avalanche!
</P>
<P>
   Having only seen the slow-motion rendition of an avalanche, I'm
shocked at how fast it is. By the time the slide passes me, it has
spread and flattened itself out, becoming a rippling disturbance in
the snow. It's as though something had gotten under the mountain's
skin.
</P>
<P>
   There's an eerie quality to the sight: fallen snow, something
I've always thought of as stationary and benign, suddenly come to
life.
</P>
<P>
   Back up at the shack, Adams sits in the rubble, holding a
thermometer in the snow like a concerned mother. Brown is shaking
his head. He had hoped a 15-inch layer would break loose and slide.
It was considerably smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The snow set up too much,'' he says. ``It was too warm.''
</P>
<P>
   He sounds like a chef assessing a failed souffle. But Brown has
high hopes for another big slide before the season ends. It's late
February now, so he figures he's got one more shot at it. Or it's
got one more shot at him.

   ``Can't move,'' said Rita, the new intern, after examining her
latest patient. ``Twenty-three-year-old Chinese male. Says his
brother has the same problem sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Her face scrunched up. She was stumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had it before?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever hear of familial periodic paralysis?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.'' She frowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither had I until my first case seven years ago. Pretty odd,
but very real.''
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of Mendelian diseases, so called because
they are passed from parent to child in much the same way Gregor
Mendel's pea plants inherited traits such as color, height and
wrinkly pods.
</P>
<P>
   The periodic paralyses, a group of genetic diseases, are
autosomal dominant, so a child with one affected parent has a 50-50
chance of acquiring the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Although the conditions are not common _ they occur in roughly
one in 100,000 people _ certain ethnic groups have a higher
frequency of the mutations that cause them.
</P>
<P>
   Rita and I strolled over to her patient, Mr. Chang. On the way,
Karen, our translator, joined us.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't move his legs,'' Karen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since when?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning. Says he ate too many pancakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times has he stopped moving before?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four. Where he comes from in China, he says,
everybody has it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as he said, Mr. Chang couldn't lift his legs. His reflexes
_ ankle and knee jerks _ had disappeared as well. But his toes
betrayed a faint wiggle. The rest of his exam was completely
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Something was going wrong in Mr. Chang's ion channels. Millions
of them, staggeringly intricate in design and function, dot certain
cell membranes, and Mr. Chang's muscle cells weren't about to move
unless his nerves prompted their ion channels to spring open like
molecular sluice gates.
</P>
<P>
   For the channels to work, the cells must reach a certain
internal electrical charge. Only then will they let sodium and
calcium rush in and potassium rush out. This flow of ions
kick-starts the contractile proteins actin and myosin.
</P>
<P>
   Each type of ion channel allows only one particular ion, whether
potassium, sodium or calcium, to pass through. And each type of
channel opens at a different voltage. Yet the channels must act in
flawless harmony each time you so much as blink an eye.
</P>
<P>
   The key to restoring Mr. Chang's mobility was to create
conditions in the blood that would help the cells reach the
electrical charge they needed to fire. Getting his potassium to a
normal level would do the trick. But we had to act fast.
</P>
<P>
   Although the paralysis is usually partial and transient, I had
seen how quickly it could turn complete. Once I was on duty with an
attending physician who recognized the syndrome but then got busy
and didn't get around to checking the patient's potassium levels.
After a few hours, the nurse rushed over, shouting that the patient
wasn't breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Two anesthesiologists came charging down to intubate him. The
respirator assisted his failing diaphragm while we pumped potassium
down a nasogastric tube. He recovered, but it was a close call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check his K,'' I told Rita. ``There are two versions of
periodic paralysis, one associated with low potassium, the other
high. If you give potassium to a high, you can really paralyze
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So we wait for the lab results,'' Rita said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes the potassium go up or down?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows. High-carbohydrate meals do stimulate insulin
secretion, which can push potassium into cells. But most of us
don't end up paralyzed after a binge at International House of
Pancakes,'' I explained.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chang's potassium came back a startlingly low 1.5. Normal is
3.5 to 5 milliequivalents per liter. We gave him some potassium to
drink and sat back to watch.
</P>
<P>
   These strange paralytic conditions have been described for
nearly a century. Patients can often learn to prevent attacks by
avoiding strenuous exercise, which can cause swings in potassium
levels, and eating foods that are either high or low in potassium.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the new tools of molecular biology, researchers have
begun to tease out the genetic origins of diseases like the
periodic paralyses.
</P>
<P>
   A landmark 1990 study of a large family with a tendency toward
hyperkalemic (high-potassium) periodic paralysis helped identify
the mutation responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers decided to take a look at the gene that encodes the
sodium channel in muscle. By comparing the gene in family members
with and without the condition, they found the key difference. The
mutant gene causes one wrong amino acid to be inserted in the
proteins that form the channel, and that misfit amino acid causes
the channel to malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, a similar slight change in the gene encoding
the calcium channel in muscle was linked to hypokalemic
(low-potassium) paralysis. But no one yet knows how it
malfunctions, nor how a defective calcium channel could cause low
levels of potassium in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   And other questions about the disorder remain. Why are men
affected three times more often than women? Why do some people with
the gene never show symptoms?
</P>
<P>
   Despite what we know about the genetics of the periodic
paralyses, the origins of the disease are far from fully
understood. For instance, just when the molecular details of
hypokalemic paralysis appeared locked up, researchers discovered a
family with normal calcium channels who still had symptoms of the
disease. The family's problem was caused by a different mutation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even when the disease is caused by the same mutation, it can
provoke dramatically different degrees of illness.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after his first dose of potassium, Mr. Chang lifted
his legs. We gave him another slug, and soon he was strolling about
the emergency room, none the worse for his episode of paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Rita got ready to discharge Mr. Chang.
</P>
<P>
   ``See if he would like to try acetazolamide,'' I told her.
``It's a diuretic that seems to help by preventing potassium
shifts. And one more thing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him to lay off the pancakes.''

<P>
   ``Can't move,'' said Rita, the new intern, after examining her
latest patient. ``Twenty-three-year-old Chinese male. Says his
brother has the same problem sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Her face scrunched up. She was stumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had it before?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever hear of familial periodic paralysis?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.'' She frowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither had I until my first case seven years ago. Pretty odd,
but very real.''
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of Mendelian diseases, so called because
they are passed from parent to child in much the same way Gregor
Mendel's pea plants inherited traits such as color, height and
wrinkly pods.
</P>
<P>
   The periodic paralyses, a group of genetic diseases, are
autosomal dominant, so a child with one affected parent has a 50-50
chance of acquiring the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Although the conditions are not common _ they occur in roughly
one in 100,000 people _ certain ethnic groups have a higher
frequency of the mutations that cause them.
</P>
<P>
   Rita and I strolled over to her patient, Mr. Chang. On the way,
Karen, our translator, joined us.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't move his legs,'' Karen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since when?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning. Says he ate too many pancakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times has he stopped moving before?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four. Where he comes from in China, he says,
everybody has it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as he said, Mr. Chang couldn't lift his legs. His reflexes
_ ankle and knee jerks _ had disappeared as well. But his toes
betrayed a faint wiggle. The rest of his exam was completely
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Something was going wrong in Mr. Chang's ion channels. Millions
of them, staggeringly intricate in design and function, dot certain
cell membranes, and Mr. Chang's muscle cells weren't about to move
unless his nerves prompted their ion channels to spring open like
molecular sluice gates.
</P>
<P>
   For the channels to work, the cells must reach a certain
internal electrical charge. Only then will they let sodium and
calcium rush in and potassium rush out. This flow of ions
kick-starts the contractile proteins actin and myosin.
</P>
<P>
   Each type of ion channel allows only one particular ion, whether
potassium, sodium or calcium, to pass through. And each type of
channel opens at a different voltage. Yet the channels must act in
flawless harmony each time you so much as blink an eye.
</P>
<P>
   The key to restoring Mr. Chang's mobility was to create
conditions in the blood that would help the cells reach the
electrical charge they needed to fire. Getting his potassium to a
normal level would do the trick. But we had to act fast.

<P>
   Here's a dilemma for the 21st century: You're a TV starlet with
a PG reputation who's yearning to go R. What's a girl to do?
</P>
<P>
   If pinup calendars and Playboy centerfolds used to be the
answer, today there's another way to for the countless litters of
sex kittens running around Hollywood to get the message across. If
you're willing to risk going risque, men's magazines are more than
happy to snap you _ topless or in lingerie, if you please _ and put
you on the cover, followed by an inside interview.
</P>
<P>
   A little T&AMP;A, followed by a Q&AMP;A, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an abundance in Hollywood of girls at the same
level,'' said Elizabeth Schulte, special projects editor for
Details. ``We get bombarded with requests. Once a girl has a series
on WB, I get a phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that sells best for us is to show famous or
up-and-coming girls who are identified with a certain role and
image, and then get them a little sexier than what the public's
used to,'' said Jim Kaminsky, co-editor of Maxim. ``Take (December
cover girl) Lara Flynn Boyle. She plays a buttoned-down character
on `The Practice,' but I think she wanted to let people know she's
very pretty and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The holy grail of the men's magazine covers is to get a girl
who's interested in changing her image in a sexier light,'' said
Andy Clerkson, editor of Stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Melissa Joan Hart syndrome. The popular young star
of the hit TV show `Sabrina the Teenage Witch' drew both extensive
criticism (including threats of being fired) and widespread
attention for her appearance on Maxim wearing little and striking
numerous provocative poses.
</P>
<P>
   A few brickbats aside, this new marriage of convenience is
proving to be a win-win situation for everyone involved. These
fledgling young starlets get seen before the ravenous eyes of
hundreds of thousands (sometimes over a million) of young men,
including casting directors and entertainment executives.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jack Wright, executive editor of Gear, his March
issue will feature a prominent actress who's ``much bigger than
Melissa Joan Hart,'' and who hopes to shed her sweet,
girl-next-door image.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fed up with the treatment on the other magazines that
continued the goody-two-shoes image,'' Wright said. ``So we came to
her rescue _ the cover image will be a huge leap from the character
she plays on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, chivalry isn't Wright's main motive. Magazines often
find their newsstand sales soaring _ Maxim delivers approximately 1
million at newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   And while it's too still early to determine whether this month's
Details cover girl, Selma Blair (of ``Cruel Intentions'' and
``Zoe'' fame), will sell more than January stunner Mena Suvari (the
dream girl of ``American Beauty''), magazine editors say Alyssa
Milano, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar can be
counted as reliable best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as magazines vie for the same pool of actresses to get
undressed, editors say they differentiate themselves in the way
they depict them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Maxim, you basically cut off the head and attach a new
one on the same bikini-clad body,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   But while vamping the girls up (sometimes, at their insistence)
will certainly sell more copies, opinions vary as to how far they
should go. While an editor might fight to get the young lady in
lingerie or swimsuits, the publicist might offer her in a halter
top or other semi-revealing, but semi-respectable, outfits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases they (publicists) understand what we're trying
to do very well, and they let us do want we want,'' Kaminsky said.
``Other times it requires a negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, publicists try to fight the sexiness,'' Wright
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Details, under editor Mark Golin, has been trying to
strike a balance between showing beautiful actresses in a sexy
manner to increase circulation, but not too far-out to alienate
upscale fashion advertisers, as well as publicists.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Details, it's about a latent sexiness,'' Schulte said.
``Our reader has a little more class. With a lot of these girls,
this is the second or third cover and they're just starting out in
their careers. With a blatantly sexy pinup, it could ruin their
careers. They can get pigeonholed in a category as a pinup girl
instead of an actress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's about how comfortable the client is,'' said
Leslie Sloane-Zelnik of BWR in New York, and the publicist for such
actors as Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rebecca Gayheart, Shannen Doherty
and Gretchen Mol. ``I love all of the magazines, I think they're
great for different projects. But while I thought the Lara Flynn
Boyle cover was very sexy, it was also bit scary and maybe a little
overboard. It was a bit Playboy-ish. If the actress wants to do
that, then it's up to her.''

<P>
   Her first film was the Japanese cult hit ``The Crazy Family,''
in which she played a crazed pop star. That performance quickly led
to a recording contract and real-life pop stardom.
</P>
<P>
   By age 22, Kudoh had released 11 major albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least, I think it's 11,'' says Kudoh, now 27. ``I've lost
count.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, she abandoned acting entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that actors didn't sing, and singers didn't act,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   But parts in Jim Jarmusch's ``Mystery Train,'' Kayo Hatta's
``Picture Bride'' and an Australian black comedy called ``Heaven's
Burning'' lured her back to the movies _ and brought her to the
attention of American casting agents.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she snagged Hollywood's ultimate part for an Asian
female: Hatsue in the hot new film ``Snow Falling on Cedars,''
directed by Scott Hicks (``Shine'') and costarring Ethan Hawke.
</P>
<P>
   Kudoh plays the lost love Hawke is still pining for when
Japanese-American relations turn sour in Puget Sound, Wash., during
World War II. (The film is adapted from David Guterson's
best-selling 1994 novel.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected I would get cast in an American studio
film,'' Kudoh says. ``I had just gotten married, and I didn't want
to work in a foreign country. But after I read the book on a
camping trip, I decided I must be in the film. I sent a video
audition, even though I knew it was a long shot.''
</P>
<P>
   After auditioning for Hicks, Kudoh read with would-be co-star
Ethan Hawke, who told her not to be nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was very, very, very nervous,'' she says, laughing.
``When we made the film, I discovered he is a total gentleman, very
quiet. And he really loves Uma! He's always expecting her call.''
</P>
<P>
   Kudoh may release a record in the U.S. next year, but she's not
sure about her next acting move. She thinks she might have been
spoiled by ``Snow Falling on Cedars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very poetic film,'' she says. ``I haven't read a script
in two years as good. So I'll wait for another part that talks to
me.''

   Youki Kudoh isn't exaggerating when she says she's the Madonna

<P>
   The biggest beauty pageant this side of Miss Universe can be
found on the Internet, thanks to the recent explosion in Web sites
selling cosmetics, toiletries and fragrances.
</P>
<P>
   To entice shoppers away from traditional beauty haunts, the
sites are piling on the extras, like free gift wrapping, free
shipping, gift with purchase, advice columns and on-line magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The downside to this modern method of shopping is obvious: no
sampling or spritzing to test the colors, textures and fragrances.
But the convenience can't be beat.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the newest options for the virtual beauty
junkie.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beauty.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a staggering product selection, you'll find a
number of hot makeup brands here, from Anna Sui to Face Stockholm.
And the site has several celebrity experts doling out advice, like
model/cosmetics entrepreneur/rock-star wife Iman, makeup artist
Kevyn Aucoin and hairstylist Sally Hershberger.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beautyjungle.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may be a jungle out there, but that's no reason not to look
your best. For the time-starved, this site has more than 75 brands,
from department store names to drugstore staples. Extras include
on-line beauty advisers and a sleek, info-packed magazine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beautyscene.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking to upgrade your man's beauty routine? Hide his Ivory
soap and start surfing here for no-nonsense skin-care lines like
eShave, Heavy Duty, Joey New York, Peter Thomas Roth and Cellex-C.
His skin will look great and he won't mind displaying the unisex
packaging in his bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bluemercury.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dominated by indie brands like T. LeClerc, Fresh, Aesop, Red
Flower, Nars and Antonia's Flowers, this site is the beauty
equivalent of the Sundance cable channel. For the holiday season,
look for the site's gift sets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Eve.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beer of the Month Club? Forget it. How about ordering Eve.com's
``Year of Beauty,'' in which a different product from the likes of
Carolina Herrera and Perlier is shipped each month throughout 2000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gloss.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're into aromatherapy or color therapy, surf no further.
Tony &AMP; Tina and Philosophy, both major proponents of making
customers feel better through fragrance and color, offer a wide
range of their products here, from lipstick to bubble bath.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Indulge.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to fashion accessories like pashmina pajamas and
Selima glasses, this site has products for head-to-toe pampering,
from Mason Pearson brushes to Diamancel foot files.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ingredients.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exclusive retailer for ingredients.com toiletries, which
boast a variety of benefits. Green tea scent spray relaxes,
lavender body lotion soothes, peppermint foot balm invigorates and
the St. John's wort candle just might light up your life.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jasmin.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Know someone who collects perfume bottles? Jasmin.com, the site
devoted exclusively to fragrances, has a Baccarat bottle filled
with Shalimar, plus limited editions of Joy, Royal Doulton and
Lucien Lelong's Pour Femme.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sephora.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This virtual version of the French emporium has an enormous
selection of beauty booty, but it's also a stellar source for
candles, like its transparent gel candles, available in a
kaleidoscope of colors.
</P>
<P>
   New offerings include Tocca's candle collection.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Spacadet.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This adorable low-budget site, run by New York esthetician
Jillian Ratensperger, is great for small gifts, like Loofah Loafers
and Sniff decorated tissues. And for those who have been naughty
rather than nice _ a bar of soap and a washcloth from Dirty Girl. &QL;

<P>
   The eastern face of the mountain is avalanche terrain. There are
no trees to anchor the snow. A screaming wind picks up even more
snow from the mountain's far side and deposits it onto a bulging
cornice that threatens to crack under its growing weight.
</P>
<P>
   The slope of this mountain in Davos, Switzerland, is steep _ 40
degrees. To ski it after a heavy snowstorm, you would have to be
either exceptionally unwise or an avalanche researcher. Four of the
latter _ Bob Brown, Ed Adams, Jim Dent and Karl Birkeland, of
Montana State University _ are making plans to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Their destination is a plywood shack in the protective embrace
of a small rock outcropping _ directly in the path of an avalanche.
The structure is 9-by-6 feet, enough room, barely, for two
scientists (the rest retreat to the edge of the slide path), an
array of instrumentation, a gas-powered generator and one rather
nervous journalist.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men will ski to the top of the ridge, hoist four
pounds of explosives on a pulley out over the crown of the slope,
and light the fuse, sending vast amounts of snow down on his
colleagues' heads.
</P>
<P>
   Why do researchers risk their lives like this? In part, because
few other jobs require one to ski through some of the planet's most
reliably gorgeous scenery. And although there is an inescapable
sense that the danger itself is appealing, they do it to save
lives. The more that is known about the dynamics of avalanches, the
easier it becomes to accurately predict where, and how far, they'll
tumble.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a big avalanche to kill people _ the vast
majority of deaths occur in slides that run no farther than 200
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche debris is nothing like the airy, fresh-fallen snow of
skiers' dreams. The snow crystals in the debris pile left by an
avalanche are packed together so densely that they feel like
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The snow that buries the typical victim is only 50 percent air,
as opposed to fresh snow, which is 80 percent air. You cannot move
_ or even expand your chest to breathe _ let alone dig your way
free.
</P>
<P>
   Suffocation is the means to the end in two-thirds of avalanche
deaths. The remaining third die from the trauma of being flung
against boulders and trees at speeds of up to 80 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims are done in by their own breath, which condenses
and then freezes on their faces, forming an ice mask that slowly
cuts off what little air remains. Only one avalanche burial victim
in four lives to remember it ...
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Car four of the Davos Cable Car holds the regular assortment of
brightly hued skiers and teen-age snowboarders. But one man carries
no skis. It's Martin Schneebeli, the resident snowpack structures
expert, commuting to the field research area of the Swiss Federal
Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research in Davos.
</P>
<P>
   The research area is a series of cold labs at the top of a
mountain directly above the town.
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters of the way up the mountain, Schneebeli, my guide
for the day, points out a patch of snow checkered with deep square
pits. These snow pits are the basic tools of avalanche prediction.
</P>
<P>
   The layers visible on the walls of the pits reveal the history
of the past few months' snowfalls. To determine avalanche risk,
forecasters visually assess these layers to ascertain the stability
of the resulting snowpack.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of avalanche prediction, weather calls the shots.
Spring thaws can weaken the bonds that form between crystals as the
snow melts and refreezes, paving the way for deadly, heavy, wet
snow avalanches.
</P>
<P>
   A strong sun will melt surface snow, which then refreezes at
night into an icy crust, off of which the next layer of snow can
easily slip.
</P>
<P>
   A similar slippery and fragile snow layer is something called
``surface hoar'' _ essentially a morning frost on top of the snow
that gets buried by more snow.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing top billing in the rogues' gallery of weak layers is a
wily meteorological entity known as ``depth hoar.'' In early
winter, when the ground is still warm, heated and moistened air
rises through the snow and cools into a layer of angular,
recalcitrant, depth-hoar crystals _ pretty to look at, but weak as
kittens.
</P>
<P>
   In a 32-degree Fahrenheit room in the Institute's field station,
researchers Charles Fierz and Thorsten Baunach create depth hoar in
a box to determine how quickly it grows under various snow and
weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In the corner are 12 cardboard Chiquita banana boxes filled with
snow. Fierz scoops some of it into a sieve and hands it to Baunach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we make a snowfall!'' Baunach says, grinning like a kid.
He shakes the sieve over a box to recreate inside the lab what has
been happening outside for the past 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Like a picky head chef, Fierz points to lumps in the mound of
sifted white: ``Try double sifting,'' he suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Fierz and Baunach will take snow samples from their boxes every
12 hours, as the snow's temperature rises from minus 4 to 30
degrees Fahrenheit. The snow is shallow _ only about 2.5 inches.
The shallower the snow, the steeper the temperature gradient
between the ground-warmed bottom (being played, in this case, by a
heated metal plate) and the air-chilled top of the snow. The warm
air rises, cools quickly and becomes frost crystals.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the shack, Ed Adams and Karl Birkeland are busy with
shovels, clearing space in the snow to lay down equipment that will
log the snow's temperature as the avalanche passes.
</P>
<P>
   I ask Adams what would happen if the avalanche let go on its own
while we were out here.
</P>
<P>
   ``See those flats?'' Adams points down the slope. ``You'll end
up down there.'' Brown sticks his head out of the shack. ``But
first, you'll have to go through those trees. That'll beat you up
real bad.''
</P>
<P>
   I ask Jim Dent what it's like in the shack during an avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gets grayer,'' he says. ``I like to stick my hand out
into the avalanche as it goes by. It's like putting your hand into
a river.''
</P>
<P>
   He tells me that if I want a good view, I should climb up onto a
platform nailed to a tree 100 yards downhill and 30 feet to the
side of the slide path. So I do. From my perch, I watch Adams ski
up to the top, his backpack bulky with explosives. Then two other
researchers ski off to the side, much farther to the side than my
tree.
</P>
<P>
   The path from Adams to me looks like a straight line.
Apparently, the avalanche turns as it flows downhill. I try not to
think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Five, four, three, two ... A tumble of choppy white emerges from
beneath the bomb's sooty smoke cloud: Avalanche!
</P>
<P>
   Having only seen the slow-motion rendition of an avalanche, I'm
shocked at how fast it is. By the time the slide passes me, it has
spread and flattened itself out, becoming a rippling disturbance in
the snow. It's as though something had gotten under the mountain's
skin.
</P>
<P>
   There's an eerie quality to the sight: fallen snow, something
I've always thought of as stationary and benign, suddenly come to
life.
</P>
<P>
   Back up at the shack, Adams sits in the rubble, holding a
thermometer in the snow like a concerned mother. Brown is shaking
his head. He had hoped a 15-inch layer would break loose and slide.
It was considerably smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The snow set up too much,'' he says. ``It was too warm.''
</P>
<P>
   He sounds like a chef assessing a failed souffle. But Brown has
high hopes for another big slide before the season ends. It's late
February now, so he figures he's got one more shot at it. Or it's
got one more shot at him.

for the day, points out a patch of snow checkered with deep square
pits. These snow pits are the basic tools of avalanche prediction.
</P>
<P>
   The layers visible on the walls of the pits reveal the history
of the past few months' snowfalls. To determine avalanche risk,
forecasters visually assess these layers to ascertain the stability
of the resulting snowpack.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of avalanche prediction, weather calls the shots.
Spring thaws can weaken the bonds that form between crystals as the
snow melts and refreezes, paving the way for deadly, heavy, wet
snow avalanches.
</P>
<P>
   A strong sun will melt surface snow, which then refreezes at
night into an icy crust, off of which the next layer of snow can
easily slip.
</P>
<P>
   A similar slippery and fragile snow layer is something called
``surface hoar'' _ essentially a morning frost on top of the snow
that gets buried by more snow.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing top billing in the rogues' gallery of weak layers is a
wily meteorological entity known as ``depth hoar.'' In early
winter, when the ground is still warm, heated and moistened air
rises through the snow and cools into a layer of angular,
recalcitrant, depth-hoar crystals _ pretty to look at, but weak as
kittens.
</P>
<P>
   In a 32-degree Fahrenheit room in the Institute's field station,
researchers Charles Fierz and Thorsten Baunach create depth hoar in
a box to determine how quickly it grows under various snow and
weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In the corner are 12 cardboard Chiquita banana boxes filled with
snow. Fierz scoops some of it into a sieve and hands it to Baunach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we make a snowfall!'' Baunach says, grinning like a kid.
He shakes the sieve over a box to recreate inside the lab what has
been happening outside for the past 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Like a picky head chef, Fierz points to lumps in the mound of
sifted white: ``Try double sifting,'' he suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Fierz and Baunach will take snow samples from their boxes every
12 hours, as the snow's temperature rises from minus 4 to 30
degrees Fahrenheit. The snow is shallow _ only about 2.5 inches.
The shallower the snow, the steeper the temperature gradient
between the ground-warmed bottom (being played, in this case, by a
heated metal plate) and the air-chilled top of the snow. The warm
air rises, cools quickly and becomes frost crystals.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the shack, Ed Adams and Karl Birkeland are busy with
shovels, clearing space in the snow to lay down equipment that will
log the snow's temperature as the avalanche passes.
</P>
<P>
   I ask Adams what would happen if the avalanche let go on its own
while we were out here.
</P>
<P>
   ``See those flats?'' Adams points down the slope. ``You'll end
up down there.'' Brown sticks his head out of the shack. ``But
first, you'll have to go through those trees. That'll beat you up
real bad.''
</P>
<P>
   I ask Jim Dent what it's like in the shack during an avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gets grayer,'' he says. ``I like to stick my hand out
into the avalanche as it goes by. It's like putting your hand into
a river.''
</P>
<P>
   He tells me that if I want a good view, I should climb up onto a
platform nailed to a tree 100 yards downhill and 30 feet to the
side of the slide path. So I do. From my perch, I watch Adams ski
up to the top, his backpack bulky with explosives. Then two other
researchers ski off to the side, much farther to the side than my
tree.
</P>
<P>
   The path from Adams to me looks like a straight line.
Apparently, the avalanche turns as it flows downhill. I try not to
think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Five, four, three, two ... A tumble of choppy white emerges from
beneath the bomb's sooty smoke cloud: Avalanche!
</P>
<P>
   Having only seen the slow-motion rendition of an avalanche, I'm
shocked at how fast it is. By the time the slide passes me, it has
spread and flattened itself out, becoming a rippling disturbance in
the snow. It's as though something had gotten under the mountain's
skin.
</P>
<P>
   There's an eerie quality to the sight: fallen snow, something
I've always thought of as stationary and benign, suddenly come to
life.
</P>
<P>
   Back up at the shack, Adams sits in the rubble, holding a
thermometer in the snow like a concerned mother. Brown is shaking
his head. He had hoped a 15-inch layer would break loose and slide.
It was considerably smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The snow set up too much,'' he says. ``It was too warm.''
</P>
<P>
   He sounds like a chef assessing a failed souffle. But Brown has
high hopes for another big slide before the season ends. It's late
February now, so he figures he's got one more shot at it. Or it's
got one more shot at him.

<P>
   ``Can't move,'' said Rita, the new intern, after examining her
latest patient. ``Twenty-three-year-old Chinese male. Says his
brother has the same problem sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Her face scrunched up. She was stumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had it before?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever hear of familial periodic paralysis?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.'' She frowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither had I until my first case seven years ago. Pretty odd,
but very real.''
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of Mendelian diseases, so called because
they are passed from parent to child in much the same way Gregor
Mendel's pea plants inherited traits such as color, height and
wrinkly pods.
</P>
<P>
   The periodic paralyses, a group of genetic diseases, are
autosomal dominant, so a child with one affected parent has a 50-50
chance of acquiring the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Although the conditions are not common _ they occur in roughly
one in 100,000 people _ certain ethnic groups have a higher
frequency of the mutations that cause them.
</P>
<P>
   Rita and I strolled over to her patient, Mr. Chang. On the way,
Karen, our translator, joined us.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't move his legs,'' Karen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since when?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning. Says he ate too many pancakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times has he stopped moving before?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four. Where he comes from in China, he says,
everybody has it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as he said, Mr. Chang couldn't lift his legs. His reflexes
_ ankle and knee jerks _ had disappeared as well. But his toes
betrayed a faint wiggle. The rest of his exam was completely
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Something was going wrong in Mr. Chang's ion channels. Millions
of them, staggeringly intricate in design and function, dot certain
cell membranes, and Mr. Chang's muscle cells weren't about to move
unless his nerves prompted their ion channels to spring open like
molecular sluice gates.
</P>
<P>
   For the channels to work, the cells must reach a certain
internal electrical charge. Only then will they let sodium and
calcium rush in and potassium rush out. This flow of ions
kick-starts the contractile proteins actin and myosin.
</P>
<P>
   Each type of ion channel allows only one particular ion, whether
potassium, sodium or calcium, to pass through. And each type of
channel opens at a different voltage. Yet the channels must act in
flawless harmony each time you so much as blink an eye.
</P>
<P>
   The key to restoring Mr. Chang's mobility was to create
conditions in the blood that would help the cells reach the
electrical charge they needed to fire. Getting his potassium to a
normal level would do the trick. But we had to act fast.
</P>
<P>
   Although the paralysis is usually partial and transient, I had
seen how quickly it could turn complete. Once I was on duty with an
attending physician who recognized the syndrome but then got busy
and didn't get around to checking the patient's potassium levels.
After a few hours, the nurse rushed over, shouting that the patient
wasn't breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Two anesthesiologists came charging down to intubate him. The
respirator assisted his failing diaphragm while we pumped potassium
down a nasogastric tube. He recovered, but it was a close call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check his K,'' I told Rita. ``There are two versions of
periodic paralysis, one associated with low potassium, the other
high. If you give potassium to a high, you can really paralyze
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So we wait for the lab results,'' Rita said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes the potassium go up or down?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows. High-carbohydrate meals do stimulate insulin
secretion, which can push potassium into cells. But most of us
don't end up paralyzed after a binge at International House of
Pancakes,'' I explained.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chang's potassium came back a startlingly low 1.5. Normal is
3.5 to 5 milliequivalents per liter. We gave him some potassium to
drink and sat back to watch.
</P>
<P>
   These strange paralytic conditions have been described for
nearly a century. Patients can often learn to prevent attacks by
avoiding strenuous exercise, which can cause swings in potassium
levels, and eating foods that are either high or low in potassium.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the new tools of molecular biology, researchers have
begun to tease out the genetic origins of diseases like the
periodic paralyses.
</P>
<P>
   A landmark 1990 study of a large family with a tendency toward
hyperkalemic (high-potassium) periodic paralysis helped identify
the mutation responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers decided to take a look at the gene that encodes the
sodium channel in muscle. By comparing the gene in family members
with and without the condition, they found the key difference. The
mutant gene causes one wrong amino acid to be inserted in the
proteins that form the channel, and that misfit amino acid causes
the channel to malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, a similar slight change in the gene encoding
the calcium channel in muscle was linked to hypokalemic
(low-potassium) paralysis. But no one yet knows how it
malfunctions, nor how a defective calcium channel could cause low
levels of potassium in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   And other questions about the disorder remain. Why are men
affected three times more often than women? Why do some people with
the gene never show symptoms?
</P>
<P>
   Despite what we know about the genetics of the periodic
paralyses, the origins of the disease are far from fully
understood. For instance, just when the molecular details of
hypokalemic paralysis appeared locked up, researchers discovered a
family with normal calcium channels who still had symptoms of the
disease. The family's problem was caused by a different mutation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even when the disease is caused by the same mutation, it can
provoke dramatically different degrees of illness.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after his first dose of potassium, Mr. Chang lifted
his legs. We gave him another slug, and soon he was strolling about
the emergency room, none the worse for his episode of paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Rita got ready to discharge Mr. Chang.
</P>
<P>
   ``See if he would like to try acetazolamide,'' I told her.
``It's a diuretic that seems to help by preventing potassium
shifts. And one more thing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him to lay off the pancakes.''

 &HT;    Bradley not hurting party yet
 &HT;    By Martin Gottlieb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Here's the real meaning of the Iowa caucuses: If
the pattern continues, Al Gore wins not only the Democratic
nomination but the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   That conclusion arises from a look at the predictive scheme to
which this column returns every time there's an election: Allan
Lichtman's 13 keys to presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 keys are simple yes-no questions which are pretty good
predictors individually. Taken together, Lichtman claims, they tell
you the outcome, whether you otherwise know it or not, of every
presidential election in the 140-year history of the current
two-party system.
</P>
<P>
   If six or more of the keys reflect well upon the chances of the
party that does not have the presidency, that party will win.
</P>
<P>
   Well, right now five keys favor the Republicans: the incumbent
party has experienced major scandal, has achieved no major change
in the nation's policy direction in the current presidential term,
has no major foreign policy achievement to point to, is not
fielding an exceptionally charismatic
</P>
<P>
   candidate for president and is not putting up the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, six of the thirteen keys clearly favor the
re-election of the Democrats: there is no recession in the election
year; the economy has been growing well in the past four years,
compared to the average of the previous eight; the Democrats have
made net gains in the U.S. House over the
</P>
<P>
   past two elections; the administration has no major foreign
policy failure charged to it; the country is not experiencing civil
disorder; and the Republicans are not putting up a charismatic
candidate, either.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves two keys which cannot yet be ``turned.'' If either
goes to the Republicans, they win. One asks whether there is a
major third party candidacy, like Ross Perot's in 1992. If there
is, the Republicans get the key, because that's an indication of
the kind of unrest that suggests unhappiness with the incumbents.
However, the candidacy must not be a
</P>
<P>
   splinter from the challenging party, as, say, Pat Buchanan's
would be.
</P>
<P>
   So far, this key doesn't seem to be turning for the GOP, but it
might.
</P>
<P>
   The other unaccounted for key asks this: Does the incumbent
party have a closely contested fight for its nomination? Closely
contested is roughly defined as more than a third of the delegates
at the national convention voting against the party's choice on the
first ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley got about a third of the votes in the Iowa
caucuses. If he continues to run at that level, he will get less
than a third of the votes at the convention _ if, indeed, the
nomination isn't done by acclamation on the first ballot _ because
the winner in some states gets a disproportionate
</P>
<P>
   number of delegates, and because the delegates who aren't
selected in primaries (but by virtue of office, say a seat in
Congress) will rally around the nominee presumptive.
</P>
<P>
   The divided-party key is, standing alone, the best of all the 13
keys as a predictor. For example, in modern history, every time an
incumbent party has had a tough fight for the nomination, it has
lost the general: the Democrats in 1980 and 1968; the Republicans
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   None of the keys asks whether there is a divisive fight in the
challenging party. A presidential elections is, as the keys
suggest, primarily a referendum on the performance of the incumbent
party. Incumbent-party division suggests that the party is not
entirely comfortable with its own record, in which case, the public
outside the party is likely to be a great
</P>
<P>
   deal less comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it. Don't ask whether Al Gore is personable
enough or a good enough candidate to beat George W. Bush; don't ask
whether the Clinton scandals have tainted Gore and would make him
weaker in the general than Bradley; don't ask whether Bush has so
much money that nobody can beat him;
</P>
<P>
   don't ask how Gore can overcome the lead in the polls that Bush
has had in their match-ups for many months; don't ask whether
Bush's likable personality and something-for-everybody ideology
(''compassionate conservatism'') is the magic formula for success.
</P>
<P>
   Ask whether Bradley has something going for him in the rest of
the country that he didn't have in Iowa.
</P>

 &HT;    Stop the whirl, get in step
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ I had planned the perfect evening, the stuff of
which memories are made, so of course things were bound to go
desperately wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I was taking my 17-year-old nephew, Scott, to dinner and the
theater _ a fancy restaurant on the river and a production of ``My
Favorite Year,'' starring several of his high School buddies. What
a perfect opportunity to introduce Scott to the fine dining and
high culture with which we adults habitually surround ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   The tragic flaw in my plan turned out to be the alternator on my
1989 Toyota Corolla. As I sailed down Dorothy Lane in Kettering, my
car died. Suddenly. Completely.
</P>
<P>
   That was depressing enough, but it wasn't the most depressing
thing. The most depressing thing was the reaction of my fellow
motorists. Not so much the scores who ignored my plight _ how many
times had I done the same thing myself? _ as the ones who became
enraged by it. Drivers honked, scowled, zoomed around me. An SUV
driver passed on the right by driving on yards and sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   My faith in humanity stood ready to plummet lower than the stock
market in '29, when he appeared, a good Samaritan in sweatpants. He
helped me to back my car into a nearby driveway and even offered to
push my car across four lanes of traffic to the UDF parking lot.
``This is a job for a tow truck,'' I insisted.
</P>
<P>
   What would become of us if there were no people like my rescuer?
If nobody had the time, or the patience, to lend a hand to those
who have fallen out of step?
</P>
<P>
   I could identify with the drivers who hadn't stopped, pressed
for time or concerned with safety. But I couldn't understand what
made people so angry, so impatient.
</P>
<P>
   Or could I? How many times had I become impatient with those who
had fallen behind, broken down?
</P>
<P>
   Had I never ignored someone calling out to me on the street _
only to find, in more than a few cases, they were telling me I had
dropped my hat or gloves?
</P>
<P>
   Had I never felt resentment at picking up a colleague's workload
when he had the bad timing to be stricken with the flu on deadline?
</P>
<P>
   Had I never lost patience with my children when they fell out of
step?
</P>
<P>
   Hmm, well, this morning comes to mind. My son sat at the table
for 20 minutes without touching his breakfast _ a fact I discovered
only as we were on our way out the door.
</P>
<P>
   I tossed the bagel to Alec like a lethal Frisbee. ``Eat your
breakfast or you'll never watch TV again for the rest of your
life!'' I barked.
</P>
<P>
   My yelling, he rebuked, was not improving his appetite. So
naturally, I yelled some more. ``I wasn't yelling until I found out
you didn't eat your breakfast!''
</P>
<P>
   Never one to miss an opportunity for the dramatic, Alec sniffed,
``When you yell at me, it's like I'm at the edge of a cliff, and
instead of helping me back up, you're pushing me off.''
</P>
<P>
   That made me laugh _ a step in the right direction. I finally
stopped yelling, and Alec finally started nibbling his bagel.
</P>
<P>
   Things have a way of turning out in the end, if you'll only be
patient. My car was on the road again the day after it broke down,
and my nephew chauffeured me to the Victoria Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Scott and I never made it to the fancy restaurant that
freezing-cold night, but Subway never tasted so good. And young
singers and dancers never sounded so good.
</P>
<P>
   Scott beamed and cheered for his old classmates. They sparkled,
they dazzled, they never fell out of step.
</P>
<P>
   But if they had, I like to imagine we would have cheered them
all the same.

 &HT;    Speech impediments
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Is it true that you can't yell fire in a crowded
theater?
</P>
<P>
   I was trying to pick the brains of Justice Nathan L. Hecht who
has served on the Texas Supreme Court for a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   Hecht not only has impressive legal credentials, he also has a
degree in philosophy from Yale University and is a member of the
Texas Philosophical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a candidate for another term on the Supreme Court,
Hecht also seemed to be an ideal candidate to answer my question
about Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes' famous 1919 ruling that people
can't yell fire in a crowded theater.
</P>
<P>
   This expression is often used to argue that not all speech is
protected by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared to me that citizens are not prohibited by the U.S.
Constitution from yelling fire in a crowded theater, only that they
must be responsible for their words.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if you yelled fire in a crowded theater after
spotting a fire, you might be hailed as a hero rather than a
constitutional scofflaw.
</P>
<P>
   Or if you yelled fire in a crowded theater and everyone knew you
to be a nut, it might be a situation of no harm, no foul.
</P>
<P>
   Hecht said Holmes was giving an example that not all speech is
protected if it harms other citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Later I learned that what Holmes actually wrote in the 1919
Schenck vs. the United States case was: ``The most stringent
protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely
shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic. . . . The question
in every case is whether the words are used in such circumstances
and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger
that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has
a right to prevent.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes was writing for the majority in upholding the
imprisonment of Charles Schenck, a Philadelphia socialist who
published 15,000 pamphlets protesting U.S. involvement in World War
I and urging resistance to the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent Supreme Court decisions in 1957 and 1969 severely
limited the narrow 1919 Schenck decision and the nation's
lamentable sedition laws.
</P>
<P>
   The 1957 decision held that the government must prove that
defendants advocate specific violent and forcible overthrow of the
government. The 1969 decision held that the First Amendment
protected citizens even if they advocated unlawful conduct ``unless
it is directed toward inciting or producing imminent lawless action
and is likely to incite or produce such action.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution often must be interpreted as a battle between,
or among, competing constitutional protections. For instance,
speech expressed as pornography or in solicitation of someone to
commit a crime is not protected.
</P>
<P>
   Hecht also recognized the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings that flag
burning is an expression of free speech protected by the First
Amendment. A person burning a flag could be charged with creating a
fire hazard or other applicable laws, but not for the expression of
an odious opinion.
</P>
<P>
   That could change, of course, if the nation outlaws speech
expressed in burning the nation's flag by amending the U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Hecht explained that decisions hold campaign donations as free
speech, but only in small amounts.
</P>
<P>
   He also talked about cases that limit the free speech
protections of abortion protestors, but also only in small amounts.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court now is considering the constitutionality
of an 8-foot free speech zone for Colorado abortion protesters.
</P>
<P>
   It's odd that constitutional protections can be determined by
the English system of weights and measures.
</P>
<P>
   Like yelling fire in a crowded theater, rights have limits. The
justices decide where you draw the line.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several of my pine trees lost their tops during an ice storm.
Can the trees be saved?
</P>
<P>
   A: If a big section of the top of a pine tree or a significant
part of the main stem has broken out, you probably don't have many
choices other than taking the tree out, said David Moorhead,
professor of forestry at the University of Georgia Warnell School
of Forest Resources.
</P>
<P>
   All the pine resin that will come out as a result of the injury
``sends an open invitation to bark beetles,'' he said. Bark beetles
fly in, bore through the tree's bark, and lay eggs under the bark.
The larvae form feeding galleries and introduce a fungi called blue
stain, which results in the tree drying out and eventually dying.
</P>
<P>
   If you also have damaged hardwoods, the news isn't as bad. They
aren't quite as sensitive to insect attacks and are a bit more
durable, Moorhead added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has there ever been an American secretary-general of the
United Nations?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Only seven men, all foreign-born, have served as
secretary-general: Trygve Lie of Norway, 1946-53; Dag Hammarskjold
of Sweden, 1953-61; U Thant of Burma (now Myanmar), 1961-71; Kurt
Waldheim of Austria, 1972-81; Javier Perez de Cuellar of Peru,
1982-91; Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt, 1992-96; and Kofi Annan of
Ghana, 1997-present.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a news item saying Stevie Wonder might regain his
eyesight. Do you have any information about this? When was he born,
and how long has he been without sight?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wonder (birth name: Stevland Judkins Morris) was born
prematurely on May 13, 1950, in Saginaw, Mich. While some sources
say he has been blind since birth, others say since shortly after
birth. In a New York interview published Sept. 16, 1974, Wonder
told writer Henry Edwards that he has a dislocated nerve in one eye
and a cataract on the other. He said the condition ``may have
happened from being in the incubator too long and receiving too
much oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   It was reported widely in early December that Wonder had been
talking with eye surgeon Mark Humayun of Johns Hopkins University's
Wilmer Eye Institute about a procedure that involves implanting a
thin microchip into a person's retina. The prosthesis, intended
mainly for people who once had sight, uses light and images to
stimulate electrodes that send impulses to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the people who have been fitted with the chip have been
able to pick out only shapes and letters. Doctors hope to develop
more sensitive chips that could allow the blind to read newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Wonder's severe eye disease, the new procedure may
not benefit him, said a Wilmer spokeswoman. Even if he isn't a good
candidate for the chip, Wonder says he's thrilled that people are
talking about it, because it could speed the search for better
technology to help the blind.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read somewhere how the world's population would be broken
down by place of origin, language and other factors if it were
reduced to 1,000 people. Can you print that data?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the World Village Project, the ``village'' would
have 584 Asians, 124 Africans, 95 Eastern/Western Europeans, 84
Latin Americans, 55 Russians, 52 North Americans, 4 Australians and
2 New Zealanders.
</P>
<P>
   The people would have difficulty communicating because 165 would
speak Mandarin, 86 English, 83 Hindi, 64 Spanish, 58 Russian and 37
Arabic, with the rest made up of people speaking Bengali,
Portuguese, Indonesian, Japanese, German, French and 200 other
languages.
</P>
<P>
   Broken down by religion, there would be 329 Christians, 178
Moslems, 167 non-religious, 132 Hindus, 62 Buddhists, 45 atheists,
3 Jews and the remainder ``other.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 330 would be children, and only 60 would be older than 65.
Twenty-eight new babies would be born each year, and 10 people
would die every year.
</P>
<P>
   Other tidbits: 200 people would control 75 percent of the
wealth; 70 would own automobiles; fewer than 10 would have a
college education.

</P>
<P>
   Q: Considering all the flap in South Carolina over the flag
flown over the state Capitol, take a look at the Arkansas flag.
Doesn't it have the Stars and Bars?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The design of the Arkansas state flag incorporates a
diamond shape with 29 stars. It doesn't resemble the Stars and
Bars, which was adopted in 1861and whose design had a circle with
seven stars representing the original Confederate states. Nor does
it resemble the Confederate battle flag _ the ``Southern Cross'' _
whose stars, in an X shape, represented 11 states and the secession
governments in Kentucky and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas state flag has the word Arkansas, with one star
above and three below, and 25 stars surrounding the diamond shape.
The diamond, as stated in the 1913 act of the state Legislature
which adopted the design, signifies that Arkansas is the only U.S.
state in which diamonds are found. The 25 stars in the border
signify that Arkansas was the 25th state to enter the union.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Garth Brooks mentioned on TV the other night that his mother
was ``up in heaven.'' When did she die? I didn't know anything
about it.
</P>
<P>
   A: Colleen Carroll Brooks, 70, died of throat cancer Aug. 6 at
Oklahoma City's Deaconess Hospital after undergoing months of
chemotherapy, radiation treatment and surgeries. She had been
hospitalized in California, where the country singer and other
family members had been spending the summer, but in late July she
was transferred back to Oklahoma. She was a resident of Edmond,
Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Her family, including husband Raymond, daughter Betsy and sons
Kelly, Mike, Jim, Jerry and Garth, and Garth's wife, Sandy, had
virtually camped in a room reserved for hospital staff during the
last days of the 70-year-old woman's fight.
</P>
<P>
   The former Colleen Carroll was a country singer herself in the
1950s. Like son Garth, she recorded under the Capitol Music label.
She also appeared regularly on Red Foley's ``Ozark Jubilee.''
</P>
<P>
   Garth Brooks' 1998 single ``It's Your Song'' was dedicated to
his mother. He said at the time that he wished his mother knew her
impact on his life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend has bet me that the first Super Bowl was not in
1967, as I and several other friends believe. What do you say?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your friend may have a trick up his or her sleeve. Many
sources, including the book ``First Facts,'' say the first Super
Bowl, between the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs, was
played on Jan. 15, 1967. But ``Total Football/The Official
Encyclopedia of the National Football League,'' says the official
name of that event was the AFL-NFL World Championship Game. The
first official Super Bowl, according to the encyclopedia, was Super
Bowl III, in 1969, between the New York Jets and Baltimore Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who, or what group, established the placement of the
International Date Line, and why does it run a zigzag course?
</P>
<P>
   A: World Book Encyclopedia explains that the location of the
date line was established through general practice of the larger
nations of the world.
</P>
<P>
   It follows the 180th meridian for most of its distance between
the North Pole and the South Pole. But it deviates eastward through
the Bering Strait to avoid dividing Siberia, and then deviates
westward to include the Aleutian Islands with Alaska. South of the
Equator, another eastward deviation allows certain island groups to
have the same day as New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Such a zigzag course prevents differences in date within
countries or between islands. For example, the northeastern corner
of Siberia extends nearly 10 degrees east of the 180th meridian. If
the date line followed the meridian exactly, this little corner of
Siberia would have a date different from the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Leo Buscaglia, who has sold millions of books and tapes on
love and relationships, died not long ago. I read nothing about
survivors. Considering that his specialty was giving advice about
relationships, did he not have a family?
</P>
<P>
   A: He wasn't married. A Newsweek article published May 9, 1983,
said Buscaglia never married because of his peripatetic lifestyle.
``I'd have to be a husband, and father, in absentia, and I don't
want to do that,'' he explained to the interviewer. When he died on
June 12, 1998, Buscaglia was survived by a sister, Marge Macagno,
of San Marino, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently saw part of a movie titled ``Flying Misfits,'' and
was reminded of the old TV series ``Black Sheep Squadron.'' Weren't
they quite similar?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. They had the same subject _ World War II Marine flying
ace Maj. Gregory ``Pappy'' Boyington and his Black Sheep Squadron _
and much of the same cast.
</P>
<P>
   The TV series, first titled ``Baa Baa Black Sheep,'' was shown
under that name from September 1976 to August 1977, when it was
dropped from the NBC lineup. The network revived it that December
1977 when most of the new 1977-78 series failed to attract
sufficient viewers and NBC ran short of programming. It was
retitled ``Black Sheep Squadron.'' The last telecast was Sept. 1,
1978.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Conrad starred as Boyington in the TV series and in
``Flying Misfits,'' which was produced in 1976. Other cast members
in both productions included Dana Elcar, Dirk Blocker and James
Whitmore Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The real Boyington, who died in 1988 at age 75, was credited
with shooting down 28 Japanese planes. His squadron shot down
nearly 100 Japanese planes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: According to a question on a trivia card from Genus III,
Japanese Lt. Hiroo Onoda did not discover that World War II was
over until Feb. 24, 1974. Do you know anything about this?
</P>
<P>
   A: The exact date seems to be in question, but the substance of
the item is correct. According to Facts on File (1974), it was
March 10, 1974, when a search party found Onoda on the Philippine
island of Lubang. He had been missing since the end of World War
II. During the time he was in hiding in the jungles, he allegedly
killed seven islanders he mistook for enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Onoda, 52 at the time he was discovered, had been the object of
several searches over the years, starting in 1954. He came out of
hiding only after his wartime commander showed him a copy of
Emperor Hirohito's 1945 surrender order and convinced him that the
war indeed was over.
</P>
<P>
   Onoda was flown to Manila on March 11, 1974, and presented his
sword in formal surrender to President Ferdinand Marcos. Onoda
returned to Tokyo the next day. In 1996, Onoda made a return visit
to Lubang and was greeted by a cheering crowd of several hundred
people.

<P>
   Q: It has been reported that Michael Skakel, accused killer of
Martha Moxley in 1975 in Connecticut, was the nephew of Robert F.
Kennedy. Wasn't he actually the nephew of Ethel Kennedy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Michael Skakel, 39, is the son of Rushton Skakel, brother of
Ethel Kennedy. It is correct to call him the nephew of either or
both Ethel and Robert Kennedy. The suspect surrendered Jan. 19 to
authorities in Greenwich, Conn., after a warrant was issued for his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We went to Memphis for one of B.B. King's shows during the
year-end holidays. We heard that his wife had suffered a stroke and
was hospitalized, but we didn't see anything about it in the news.
We didn't know he was married. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The person who apparently suffered a stroke was not his wife.
King _ birth name Riley B., but nicknamed B.B. for ``Blues Boy'' _
was married and divorced twice, the second time in the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who collapsed outside a Memphis club about 10 p.m.
Dec. 31 was identified by the Memphis Commerical Appeal as Mary
Rogers, ``a close friend'' of King's. The newspaper said King
performed his show as scheduled that evening. The hospital was
unable to provide any information about the woman who collapsed,
saying she either was not a patient there, or had requested no
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who decides what celebrities get a star on the Hollywood Walk
of Fame? Do those chosen have to pay?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce's Walk of Fame Committee
reviews nominations made by Hollywood's entertainment trade
publications and print and broadcast media.
</P>
<P>
   No one ``buys'' a star, said Ana Martinez-Holler of the chamber,
but sponsors _ such as fan clubs and radio or TV stations _ pay a
fee of $15,000 per star. The fee covers the cost of removing a
blank star, engraving it with the celebrity's name and reinstalling
it, and is used for repairs and maintenance for the Walk. It also
pays for the ceremony when the star is unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   The Walk of Fame, one of the city's prime tourist attractions,
lines both sides of Hollywood Boulevard from Gower to La Brea, and
both sides of Vine Street from Yucca to Sunset. It encompasses five
acres, with bronze stars embedded in pink terrazzo surrounded by
charcoal terrazzo squares.
</P>
<P>
   The first star placed in the Walk on Feb. 9, 1960, and was for
actress Joanne Woodward. There now are more than 2,000 stars, with
one or two added per month.
</P>
<P>

for details.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would I be able to go to a Federal Reserve bank to purchase
or service bonds?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Most Federal Reserve Banks have not provided walk-in
purchase or servicing of savings bonds for some time, said
spokesman Pierce Nelson in Atlanta. That service was ended at all
Federal Reserve banks on Aug. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Series EE bonds or series I bonds can be purchased at most local
commercial banks, Nelson said. These banks will accept payment for
bonds, and then will forward the payment to the Federal Reserve
Bank of Richmond, from which the bonds will be issued and mailed to
the owner within 15 days. Most commercial banks also can exchange
series E and EE bonds for series HH bonds, he added, but these
banks don't issue the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   More information about savings bonds is available from the
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 804-697-8370.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I thought ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' was a live
broadcast, but an article stated that a Tuesday night program was
taped the previous Saturday. Have I been fooled or what?
</P>
<P>
   A: The program is taped before a live audience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I once read about a device for cars that helps locate them in
case of theft. Where can I get information?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be referring to LoJack. It uses a hidden transmitter
in the vehicle that sends out a coded signal when activated. After
the owner reports that a vehicle equipped with the device has been
stolen, police use a special tracking system to pick up the
vehicle's signal and follow it so it can be recovered. Some vehicle
location systems make use of tracking satellites that can locate
the vehicle's position almost anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   For information on dealers selling and installing LoJack, visit
the company's Web site _ www.lojack.com _ or call 1-800-698-8022.
Several other companies also make vehicle location systems; auto
dealers can provide information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported on a drug being produced by
ViroPharma Inc. that may cure viral meningitis and the common cold.
The article said the drug probably would be out sometime this year.
It also said the company was publicly traded. I did a computer
search for the stock symbol, but couldn't find it. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's VPHM (Nasdaq).
</P>
<P>
   The article, by the way, didn't say the drug _ pleconaril _
definitely would be out this year. It said ViroPhamra is sponsoring
two large studies, due out in the spring, that will determine
whether the drug works well enough to win Food and Drug
Administration approval.
</P>
<P>
   As the article said, the FDA requires large, carefully designed
experiments to compare the medicine with standard care before
giving its approval to put it on the market. If the studies turn
out as ViroPharma hopes, the company will seek immediate approval
to sell the drug. With speedy FDA review, a liquid form of
pleconaril could be on the market by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about Mother Love, who was fired
recently as host of the syndicated TV talk show ``Forgive or
Forget''?
</P>
<P>
   A: In an interview with the New York Post, Mother Love _
identified by the TV Talk Shows Web site as the former radio
personality Jo Anne Hart _ said she was reeling from the shock of
it. Surprisingly, however, she defended the right of Twentieth
Television, the show's syndicator, to make whatever changes it
deemed necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset. I was hurt. I was in tears. I was devastated,''
she told the Post. But she added: ``This is a business, and you
cannot tell people how to conduct their business. I've been let go
before, because that's the nature of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   She is being replaced on ``Forgive and Forget'' by actress Robin
Givens. Asked to give her opinion of Givens, Mother Love declined
to comment, saying only, ``That would be unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother Love said she plans to get back on the air someday,
either on TV or radio. ``I am a talk show host,'' she said.
``That's what I do. That's what I am good at.'' And her message to
fans was this: ``I just want everybody who watched the show, who
believed in Mother Love, to keep believing and keep dreaming and
always know like I tell them: Miracles do happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article reported that California has the dirtiest air of
any state in the nation, based on the breaching there of federal
eight-hour health standards 1,217 times in 1999. What state has the
cleanest air?
</P>
<P>
   A: Seven states had ``no exceedances'' of the standards, said
Angie Farleigh of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, the
environmental organization that assembled air quality data. They
were Alaska, Hawaii, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Oregon
and Wyoming.

<P>
   Q: How much does it cost to operate gas logs in a fireplace? I
know there are several variables.
</P>
<P>
   A: Rates per therm may vary according to your gas marketer, so
you'll have to do some calculations yourself, using information on
your monthly statement by your gas marketer.
</P>
<P>
   But Millicent Hunter, Atlanta Gas Light Co. spokeswoman,
provided some numbers that should help. If your fireplace is
vented, gas burns at one therm per hour; if unvented, less than 1/4
therm per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners also frequently ask the cost of operating a gas
lantern. A two-mantle gas lantern uses 154 therms of gas per year,
Hunter said, which amounts to 1/3 therm per day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several recent articles have reported that Martin Luther King
Jr. was named for the German theologian Martin Luther. I remember
reading in a book that MLK Jr. was not christened Luther, and that
name was taken later. What did the L. stand for originally?
</P>
<P>
   A: It wasn't the middle name, Luther, that was changed. It was
the first name, from Michael to Martin, said Robert Vickers,
spokesman for the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent
Social Change in Atlanta. The change came in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Luther King Jr. was born Jan. 15, 1929, to the Rev.
Michael Luther King, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church,
and Alberta Christine Williams King. In its 1957 edition, Current
Biography explained that when young ``Mike'' was 6, his father told
him about Martin Luther, the great leader of the Reformation.
``From now on, you and I are going to be named Martin Luther
King,'' his father said at the time, as related in an article by
Ted Poston in the New York Post on May 13, 1956.
</P>

   ``I know that I shared my father's admiration for Martin
Luther,'' Martin Luther King Jr. is quoted as saying. ``I know that
I have been deeply influenced by Luther, from the point of view of
both his thinking and his moral courage. But there have been other
great influences in my life also. Among religious leaders, I would
name Jesus of Nazareth and Mahatma Gandhi. Philosophers: Plato,
(Georg Wilhelm Friedrich) Hegel, (Immanuel) Kant and E.S.
Brightman. Theologians: (Friedrich Daniel Ernst) Schleiermacher,
(Paul) Tillich and (Reinhold) Niebuhr.''

 &HT;    Draft-day pass leaves GMs Kearse-ing
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the days leading up to last spring's NFL draft,
Floyd Reese had Rich McKay, the Tampa Bay general manager, on the
phone. Reese was going fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers were drafting 15th, Reese's Tennessee Titans
16th. And the Titans general manager already had his man. In his
mind, if not in one of his uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Reese was so intent upon landing a standout defensive lineman
who could contribute immediately that he was prepared to offer the
Bucs an extra seventh-round draft pick if the two teams could swap
places.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know y'all want an offensive lineman,'' Reese offered the
bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' McKay replied, ``I want a defensive lineman.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese's heart sank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went, `Oh, my God,' '' Reese recalled. ``Then, he said he
wanted Anthony McFarland of LSU. I said, `Thank you very much,
goodbye.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McFarland did not receive any NFL rookie of the year votes. He
never started a single game. He played about one series a game.
</P>
<P>
   Jevon Kearse, on the other hand, played a lot. You could say he
contributed. You could also say that 19 games into his NFL career,
he is a bona fide, legitimate superstar. After one season in which
he was tabbed Defensive Rookie of the Year with 14 1/2 sacks and
became the first AFC rookie defensive end to be named a Pro Bowl
starter, he is being likened to Lawrence Taylor. Decent company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complete honor. I see it as being a person who can take
over a game,'' Kearse said Tuesday of the comparison. ``He has the
whole game in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice going, Tampa Bay. While Kearse could someday have his Hall
of Fame bust cast, McFarland played like a bust. Not to pick on the
Bucs, however.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen other NFL teams also passed on Kearse, a University of
Florida specimen who could be called the Randy Moss of 1999. In
fact, Kearse might have gotten Minnesota to this Super Bowl if
Vikings Coach Denny Green hadn't stubbornly insisted on taking
quarterback Daunte Culpepper, a luxury for that defensively
strapped team.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, three of those 14 teams took quarterbacks for need, but
four defensive players were taken before the overlooked Kearse.
They are good defensive players, too, except for McFarland.
</P>
<P>
   Washington took cornerback Champ Bailey. The Lions passed and
grabbed Southern Cal linebacker Chris Claiborne. Baltimore tabbed
Arizona's Chris McAlister.
</P>
<P>
   And after the Bucs nabbed McFarland, the Titans practically
giggled when they took Kearse, a 6-foot-4-inch, 252-pound defensive
lineman who played so many positions in college that a teammate
dubbed him ``The Freak.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a nickname that Kearse is entirely comfortable with
because, as he says, ``I see myself as a freak of nature doing
stuff out of the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust me, there is nothing ordinary about this specimen with the
4.43-second speed in the 40-yard dash and the 86-inch wingspan and
the 4 percent body fat and hands so large they measure 12 inches
from his outstretched thumb to the tip of his little finger.
``They're monstrous,'' Reese said of Kearse's hands. ``They're like
Hakeem's (Olajuwon).''
</P>
<P>
   When the Titans timed him in shuttle drills, Kearse produced
times for NFL-caliber defensive backs, a position he wouldn't mind
playing someday.
</P>
<P>
   His explosion off the ball, his ability to evade double teams,
his hip flexibility and change of direction are unmatched.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Kearse left school a year early when he became involved
with an agent from whom he accepted money, but he also was a member
of the National Honor Society and lacks just a semester's work
toward his sociology degree.
</P>
<P>
   He's repaid his mother, Lessie Mae Green, with a car and a house
for all the odd jobs she maintained to support seven children.
Jevon is the only one to graduate from high school.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee saw something special in this 23-year-old Fort Myers,
Fla., native who had persevered despite all manner of hardship. His
father was shot and killed in a pool hall before Jevon was born.
His grandfather and three other relatives also were murdered. One
brother, J.J., remains in prison, convicted of armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   What's a beefy offensive tackle to overcome en route to the
quarterback when Jevon Kearse has been beset by tragedy and
obstacles his entire life?
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kearse is as flashy off the field as on, adorned with a
pair of three-carat diamond stud earrings, a sparkling,
diamond-encrusted cross at the end of a heavy chain and a thick
silver bracelet with gold inlay.
</P>
<P>
   All just a few trinkets he picked up last week from his favorite
Miami jeweler.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse certainly shines on the field as well. It was there that
he forced an NFL-high 10 fumbles and that he induced St. Louis
offensive tackle Fred Miller into six false starts and a holding
penalty when the Titans handed the Rams their first loss of the
season on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's a good player,'' Miller, a former Baylor Bear, said
of Kearse. ``It's very rare that you see a guy that has the type of
speed that he has. The quickest guy I've probably faced, though, is
Baltimore linebacker Peter Boulware.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than the quarterbacks, Kearse easily could be the biggest
factor in Sunday's game, especially if Miller starts having
flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   As Jevon advised, ``Check out the Freak on Sunday.''

 &HT;    SUPER bowls for any occasion
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It begins with breakfast. Cereal in a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   On to lunch. Tortilla soup or salad. In a bowl, of course.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner, it's back to the bowl again. This time filled with
pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Before bed, the bowl may see action one more time, piled with
ice cream or popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   America has gone bowling _ at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Bowls, which fulfill the casual concept of one-dish eating, are
convenient, minimalist and user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food served in bowls is unintimidating and homey, inviting and
ready to be consumed. Everything in the bowl is conveniently
chopped, minced, or sliced into bite-size morsels, with the
exception of noodles, and they're so much fun to eat, who cares if
they need to be twirled and slurped?'' writes Elizabeth Simon in
the ``Bowlfood Cookbook'' (Workman, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   When her co-author, Lynne Aronson, opened an eatery in Manhattan
called Lola Bowla, she served all the food in bowls _ deep and
narrow, shallow and wide, small and big.
</P>
<P>
   Today's diners like that. At restaurants diners get pasta in a
bowl, or custom-designed pho, salads or stir fries. At home, they
continue the concept, moving bowls to the front of the cabinet for
frequent use.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Kartiganer, former executive chef at Tocai, is a bowl fan.
When he and his wife got a blown-glass bowl for a wedding present,
it quickly became a favorite, intimate container for dinner for
two, filled with pasta, salad or stir fries.
</P>
<P>
   Bowls do not demand tables. They're just as at home on a couch
in front of a TV, on a pillow in bed or in a lap in a swing. With
their curved sides, foods stay inside better than a plate,
enhancing their portability.
</P>
<P>
   Bowls are stylish but comfy. Warm and welcoming.
</P>
<P>
   As Simon notes, ``They say, `Good stuff inside, sit down and
enjoy.'''
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR
</P>
<P>
   By the spoonful
</P>
<P>
   _ For your kids or pet-loving friends, serve a noodle dinner in
a dog bowl. They'll howl. (That's a new dog bowl, of course.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Fill small pottery bowls with mashed potatoes and hand
everyone spoons _ the ultimate comfort-food experience.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use those pot-style onion soup bowls for Asian noodles. The
lip is perfect for resting chopsticks or spoons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Assorted tea cups and saucers or mugs make clever bowls for
brothy soups. _ ``Bowlfood Cookbook'' (Workman, $12.95)
</P>
<P>
   Before you bowl
</P>
<P>
   _ Lifestyle stores report that the soup/pasta bowl is currently
very popular because it is so versatile. Good for salads, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ If buying new bowls, choose solid colors. They go with just
about everything.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know your
</P>
<P>
   care quotient. Some bowls go into dishwashers and microwave
ovens. Some don't.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deep and narrow bowls may be a trendy look, but large and
shallow is easier to eat from.

<P>
   Beef Pho (Noodles)
</P>
<P>
   This is the Vietnamese equivalent of chicken soup. You can get
it at numerous noodle shops in Austin or make your own. The
fragrant stock is infused with cinnamon, anise and ginger. Eat it
as the Vietnamese do _ at any time of day.
</P>
<P>
   Beef stock:
</P>
<P>
   3 1/4 pounds of beef shinbones or oxtails, preferably with meat
and marrow
</P>
<P>
   16 cups water
</P>
<P>
   4 shallots, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   6 slices fresh ginger (about the size of a quarter), peeled and
smashed lightly with the flat side of a knife
</P>
<P>
   4 stars anise
</P>
<P>
   2 cinnamon sticks
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces thin flat rice stick noodles (pho), softened in hot
water, cooked until just tender, rinsed under warm water, and
drained
</P>
<P>
   1 lime, cut into 6 wedges
</P>
<P>
   1 hot red or green chile pepper, thinly sliced into rings
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound boneless beef sirloin, trimmed of fat and gristle and
cut into paper-thin slices about 1 1/2 inches square
</P>
<P>
   2 cups bean sprouts, rinsed and drained
</P>
<P>
   Garnishes:
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup minced scallion greens
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro
</P>
<P>
   1 cup Thai basil or sweet basil leaves, shredded
</P>
<P>
   In a large pot, combine the beef stock ingredients and bring to
a boil. Turn down the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 1 1/2
hours, skimming any impurities and fat from the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Strain the broth into another large pot. Remove all meat from
the bones, and cut into thin slices; discard the bones and the
stock seasonings. Skim any fat from the surface of the stock. Add
the fish sauce and black pepper and keep warm over low heat.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the noodles among six soup bowls. Put the lime wedges on
a small plate and put the chile pepper in a small bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Add the cooked sliced beef, the sirloin and bean sprouts to the
hot soup, bring to a boil and cook until the sirloin loses its pink
color, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Skim the surface to remove any
impurities.
</P>
<P>
   Ladle the beef, bean sprouts, and broth over the noodles.
Sprinkle the scallions, cilantro and basil on top. Serve with the
lime slices and chile pepper for seasoning. Serves 6.

</P>
<P>
   Tortilla Soup
</P>
<P>
   This is my most requested soup recipe served at the Old Post
Office Cafe in Comfort, 40 miles north of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   6 cooked chicken breasts or
</P>
<P>
   1 stewing hen, cooked, deboned and broken into bite size pieces,
reserve broth
</P>
<P>
   4 cloves fresh minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   4 medium yellow onions, diced
</P>
<P>
   4 cans (10 ounces) stewing tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 cans (10 ounces) Rotel tomatoes with green chiles
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chili powder
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 teaspoons ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   6 quarts water
</P>
<P>
   4 chicken bouillon cubes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch fresh chopped cilantro or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Grated Monterey Jack cheese
</P>
<P>
   Chopped avocados for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Corn tortillas, cut into 1/2 strips and deep-fried for garnish
</P>
<P>
   In a large stock pot add garlic, onion, stewing tomatoes, Rotel
tomatoes, chili powder, cumin, salt, pepper, water, and 4 chicken
bouillon cubes. Bring to boil, reduce heat; simmer about 45
minutes. Add cooked, chopped chicken meat. Let mixture cool about 1
hour; add chopped cilantro. Store covered in refrigerator overnight
allowing flavors to blend. This is very important, since the soup
will taste totally different the next day. When ready to serve,
remove desired portion of soup base from the refrigerator. (If you
are not planning on using the entire soup base, this is the time to
divide the remaining soup into containers for the freezer.) While
soup base is heating, deep-fry tortilla strips.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, pour about 1 to 2 cups of soup base in a serving bowl,
add a handful of grated Monterey Jack cheese, several pieces of
chopped avocado and desired amount of fried tortilla strips. Serve
immediately to prevent the chips from getting soggy.

 &HT;    You can boost kids' calcium even without milk
 &HT;    By Julie Bonnin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You can't skim a health magazine without reading
about calcium _ who needs it, how to find it. Most kids aren't
getting enough, according to the National Institutes of Health. But
food sources recommended for boosting calcium intake invariably are
dairy products: milk, yogurt, cheeses and ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   So where does that leave people who are lactose-intolerant or
allergic to dairy, as well as vegans and others who've eliminated
or reduced dairy from their diet for all kinds of reasons?
</P>
<P>
   Bone-dry (pun intended).
</P>
<P>
   Supplements abound, but taking them more than once a day gets
old (experts say the body can't absorb more than 500 milligrams at
a time). And those made for children typically provide a small
fraction of what they need.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, more manufacturers are bolstering foods with added
calcium. It's also found naturally in some veggies and nuts that
may surprise you.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Food labels refer to calcium content by percent of the
federal recommended daily allowance (RDA) of 1,000 milligrams of
calcium. But some kids and adults require more or less than that,
so calculate accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few good sources of calcium:
</P>
<P>
   _ Skinner calcium-added pastas. Rotini and spaghetti have been
dubbed snails and worms at my house, and are often eaten as a side
dish. The toddler likes it plain, as well as with sauce and
meatballs; the 4-year-old gourmand requires a splash of olive oil
on his. A three-quarter cup serving provides 30 percent of the RDA.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cereals. Seems like every trip to the cereal aisle elicits a
new brand with added calcium. The heavyweight is Product 19, with
60 percent of the calcium RDA, followed by Total, with 30 percent
(dry). These aren't kid favorites, but are great for making cereal
bars and other sweet treats that both kids and adults love.
Additionally, lots of cereals marketed to kids _Cheerios, Kix,
Fruit Loops, Lucky Charms, etc. _ now have 10 percent or 15 percent
added calcium (dry).
</P>
<P>
   _ Calcium-added juices. Tropicana, Minute Maid and others offer
orange and grapefruit flavors in family-sized containers with 30
percent to 35 percent of the daily calcium allowance. Most
juice-box varieties offer calcium in lesser amounts, though Gerber
Graduates brand offers 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tofu. From 220 to 400 milligrams, depending on the brand.
</P>
<P>
   _ Almonds. 100 milligrams in a quarter-cup serving.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

<P>
   Q: Several of my pine trees lost their tops during an ice storm.
Can the trees be saved?
</P>
<P>
   A: If a big section of the top of a pine tree or a significant
part of the main stem has broken out, you probably don't have many
choices other than taking the tree out, said David Moorhead,
professor of forestry at the University of Georgia Warnell School
of Forest Resources.
</P>
<P>
   All the pine resin that will come out as a result of the injury
``sends an open invitation to bark beetles,'' he said. Bark beetles
fly in, bore through the tree's bark, and lay eggs under the bark.
The larvae form feeding galleries and introduce a fungi called blue
stain, which results in the tree drying out and eventually dying.
</P>
<P>
   If you also have damaged hardwoods, the news isn't as bad. They
aren't quite as sensitive to insect attacks and are a bit more
durable, Moorhead added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has there ever been an American secretary-general of the
United Nations?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Only seven men, all foreign-born, have served as
secretary-general: Trygve Lie of Norway, 1946-53; Dag Hammarskjold
of Sweden, 1953-61; U Thant of Burma (now Myanmar), 1961-71; Kurt
Waldheim of Austria, 1972-81; Javier Perez de Cuellar of Peru,
1982-91; Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt, 1992-96; and Kofi Annan of
Ghana, 1997-present.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a news item saying Stevie Wonder might regain his
eyesight. Do you have any information about this? When was he born,
and how long has he been without sight?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wonder (birth name: Stevland Judkins Morris) was born
prematurely on May 13, 1950, in Saginaw, Mich. While some sources
say he has been blind since birth, others say since shortly after
birth. In a New York interview published Sept. 16, 1974, Wonder
told writer Henry Edwards that he has a dislocated nerve in one eye
and a cataract on the other. He said the condition ``may have
happened from being in the incubator too long and receiving too
much oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   It was reported widely in early December that Wonder had been
talking with eye surgeon Mark Humayun of Johns Hopkins University's
Wilmer Eye Institute about a procedure that involves implanting a
thin microchip into a person's retina. The prosthesis, intended
mainly for people who once had sight, uses light and images to
stimulate electrodes that send impulses to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the people who have been fitted with the chip have been
able to pick out only shapes and letters. Doctors hope to develop
more sensitive chips that could allow the blind to read newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Wonder's severe eye disease, the new procedure may
not benefit him, said a Wilmer spokeswoman. Even if he isn't a good
candidate for the chip, Wonder says he's thrilled that people are
talking about it, because it could speed the search for better
technology to help the blind.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read somewhere how the world's population would be broken
down by place of origin, language and other factors if it were
reduced to 1,000 people. Can you print that data?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the World Village Project, the ``village'' would
have 584 Asians, 124 Africans, 95 Eastern/Western Europeans, 84
Latin Americans, 55 Russians, 52 North Americans, 4 Australians and
2 New Zealanders.
</P>
<P>
   The people would have difficulty communicating because 165 would
speak Mandarin, 86 English, 83 Hindi, 64 Spanish, 58 Russian and 37
Arabic, with the rest made up of people speaking Bengali,
Portuguese, Indonesian, Japanese, German, French and 200 other
languages.
</P>
<P>
   Broken down by religion, there would be 329 Christians, 178
Moslems, 167 non-religious, 132 Hindus, 62 Buddhists, 45 atheists,
3 Jews and the remainder ``other.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 330 would be children, and only 60 would be older than 65.
Twenty-eight new babies would be born each year, and 10 people
would die every year.
</P>
<P>
   Other tidbits: 200 people would control 75 percent of the
wealth; 70 would own automobiles; fewer than 10 would have a
college education.

</P>
<P>
   Q: Considering all the flap in South Carolina over the flag
flown over the state Capitol, take a look at the Arkansas flag.
Doesn't it have the Stars and Bars?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The design of the Arkansas state flag incorporates a
diamond shape with 29 stars. It doesn't resemble the Stars and
Bars, which was adopted in 1861and whose design had a circle with
seven stars representing the original Confederate states. Nor does
it resemble the Confederate battle flag _ the ``Southern Cross'' _
whose stars, in an X shape, represented 11 states and the secession
governments in Kentucky and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas state flag has the word Arkansas, with one star
above and three below, and 25 stars surrounding the diamond shape.
The diamond, as stated in the 1913 act of the state Legislature
which adopted the design, signifies that Arkansas is the only U.S.
state in which diamonds are found. The 25 stars in the border
signify that Arkansas was the 25th state to enter the union.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Garth Brooks mentioned on TV the other night that his mother
was ``up in heaven.'' When did she die? I didn't know anything
about it.
</P>
<P>
   A: Colleen Carroll Brooks, 70, died of throat cancer Aug. 6 at
Oklahoma City's Deaconess Hospital after undergoing months of
chemotherapy, radiation treatment and surgeries. She had been
hospitalized in California, where the country singer and other
family members had been spending the summer, but in late July she
was transferred back to Oklahoma. She was a resident of Edmond,
Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Her family, including husband Raymond, daughter Betsy and sons
Kelly, Mike, Jim, Jerry and Garth, and Garth's wife, Sandy, had
virtually camped in a room reserved for hospital staff during the
last days of the 70-year-old woman's fight.
</P>
<P>
   The former Colleen Carroll was a country singer herself in the
1950s. Like son Garth, she recorded under the Capitol Music label.
She also appeared regularly on Red Foley's ``Ozark Jubilee.''
</P>
<P>
   Garth Brooks' 1998 single ``It's Your Song'' was dedicated to
his mother. He said at the time that he wished his mother knew her
impact on his life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend has bet me that the first Super Bowl was not in
1967, as I and several other friends believe. What do you say?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your friend may have a trick up his or her sleeve. Many
sources, including the book ``First Facts,'' say the first Super
Bowl, between the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs, was
played on Jan. 15, 1967. But ``Total Football/The Official
Encyclopedia of the National Football League,'' says the official
name of that event was the AFL-NFL World Championship Game. The
first official Super Bowl, according to the encyclopedia, was Super
Bowl III, in 1969, between the New York Jets and Baltimore Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who, or what group, established the placement of the
International Date Line, and why does it run a zigzag course?
</P>
<P>
   A: World Book Encyclopedia explains that the location of the
date line was established through general practice of the larger
nations of the world.
</P>
<P>
   It follows the 180th meridian for most of its distance between
the North Pole and the South Pole. But it deviates eastward through
the Bering Strait to avoid dividing Siberia, and then deviates
westward to include the Aleutian Islands with Alaska. South of the
Equator, another eastward deviation allows certain island groups to
have the same day as New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Such a zigzag course prevents differences in date within
countries or between islands. For example, the northeastern corner
of Siberia extends nearly 10 degrees east of the 180th meridian. If
the date line followed the meridian exactly, this little corner of
Siberia would have a date different from the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Leo Buscaglia, who has sold millions of books and tapes on
love and relationships, died not long ago. I read nothing about
survivors. Considering that his specialty was giving advice about
relationships, did he not have a family?
</P>
<P>
   A: He wasn't married. A Newsweek article published May 9, 1983,
said Buscaglia never married because of his peripatetic lifestyle.
``I'd have to be a husband, and father, in absentia, and I don't
want to do that,'' he explained to the interviewer. When he died on
June 12, 1998, Buscaglia was survived by a sister, Marge Macagno,
of San Marino, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently saw part of a movie titled ``Flying Misfits,'' and
was reminded of the old TV series ``Black Sheep Squadron.'' Weren't
they quite similar?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. They had the same subject _ World War II Marine flying
ace Maj. Gregory ``Pappy'' Boyington and his Black Sheep Squadron _
and much of the same cast.
</P>
<P>
   The TV series, first titled ``Baa Baa Black Sheep,'' was shown
under that name from September 1976 to August 1977, when it was
dropped from the NBC lineup. The network revived it that December
1977 when most of the new 1977-78 series failed to attract
sufficient viewers and NBC ran short of programming. It was
retitled ``Black Sheep Squadron.'' The last telecast was Sept. 1,
1978.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Conrad starred as Boyington in the TV series and in
``Flying Misfits,'' which was produced in 1976. Other cast members
in both productions included Dana Elcar, Dirk Blocker and James
Whitmore Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The real Boyington, who died in 1988 at age 75, was credited
with shooting down 28 Japanese planes. His squadron shot down
nearly 100 Japanese planes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: According to a question on a trivia card from Genus III,
Japanese Lt. Hiroo Onoda did not discover that World War II was
over until Feb. 24, 1974. Do you know anything about this?
</P>
<P>
   A: The exact date seems to be in question, but the substance of
the item is correct. According to Facts on File (1974), it was
March 10, 1974, when a search party found Onoda on the Philippine
island of Lubang. He had been missing since the end of World War
II. During the time he was in hiding in the jungles, he allegedly
killed seven islanders he mistook for enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Onoda, 52 at the time he was discovered, had been the object of
several searches over the years, starting in 1954. He came out of
hiding only after his wartime commander showed him a copy of
Emperor Hirohito's 1945 surrender order and convinced him that the
war indeed was over.
</P>
<P>
   Onoda was flown to Manila on March 11, 1974, and presented his
sword in formal surrender to President Ferdinand Marcos. Onoda
returned to Tokyo the next day. In 1996, Onoda made a return visit
to Lubang and was greeted by a cheering crowd of several hundred
people.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: It has been reported that Michael Skakel, accused killer of
Martha Moxley in 1975 in Connecticut, was the nephew of Robert F.
Kennedy. Wasn't he actually the nephew of Ethel Kennedy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Michael Skakel, 39, is the son of Rushton Skakel, brother of
Ethel Kennedy. It is correct to call him the nephew of either or
both Ethel and Robert Kennedy. The suspect surrendered Jan. 19 to
authorities in Greenwich, Conn., after a warrant was issued for his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We went to Memphis for one of B.B. King's shows during the
year-end holidays. We heard that his wife had suffered a stroke and
was hospitalized, but we didn't see anything about it in the news.
We didn't know he was married. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The person who apparently suffered a stroke was not his wife.
King _ birth name Riley B., but nicknamed B.B. for ``Blues Boy'' _
was married and divorced twice, the second time in the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who collapsed outside a Memphis club about 10 p.m.
Dec. 31 was identified by the Memphis Commerical Appeal as Mary
Rogers, ``a close friend'' of King's. The newspaper said King
performed his show as scheduled that evening. The hospital was
unable to provide any information about the woman who collapsed,
saying she either was not a patient there, or had requested no
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who decides what celebrities get a star on the Hollywood Walk
of Fame? Do those chosen have to pay?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce's Walk of Fame Committee
reviews nominations made by Hollywood's entertainment trade
publications and print and broadcast media.
</P>
<P>
   No one ``buys'' a star, said Ana Martinez-Holler of the chamber,
but sponsors _ such as fan clubs and radio or TV stations _ pay a
fee of $15,000 per star. The fee covers the cost of removing a
blank star, engraving it with the celebrity's name and reinstalling
it, and is used for repairs and maintenance for the Walk. It also
pays for the ceremony when the star is unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   The Walk of Fame, one of the city's prime tourist attractions,
lines both sides of Hollywood Boulevard from Gower to La Brea, and
both sides of Vine Street from Yucca to Sunset. It encompasses five
acres, with bronze stars embedded in pink terrazzo surrounded by
charcoal terrazzo squares.
</P>
<P>
   The first star placed in the Walk on Feb. 9, 1960, and was for
actress Joanne Woodward. There now are more than 2,000 stars, with
one or two added per month.
</P>
<P>
   If you're online, check http://chamber.hollywood.com/walkoffame
for details.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would I be able to go to a Federal Reserve bank to purchase
or service bonds?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Most Federal Reserve Banks have not provided walk-in
purchase or servicing of savings bonds for some time, said
spokesman Pierce Nelson in Atlanta. That service was ended at all
Federal Reserve banks on Aug. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Series EE bonds or series I bonds can be purchased at most local
commercial banks, Nelson said. These banks will accept payment for
bonds, and then will forward the payment to the Federal Reserve
Bank of Richmond, from which the bonds will be issued and mailed to
the owner within 15 days. Most commercial banks also can exchange
series E and EE bonds for series HH bonds, he added, but these
banks don't issue the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   More information about savings bonds is available from the
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 804-697-8370.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I thought ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' was a live
broadcast, but an article stated that a Tuesday night program was
taped the previous Saturday. Have I been fooled or what?
</P>
<P>
   A: The program is taped before a live audience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I once read about a device for cars that helps locate them in
case of theft. Where can I get information?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be referring to LoJack. It uses a hidden transmitter
in the vehicle that sends out a coded signal when activated. After
the owner reports that a vehicle equipped with the device has been
stolen, police use a special tracking system to pick up the
vehicle's signal and follow it so it can be recovered. Some vehicle
location systems make use of tracking satellites that can locate
the vehicle's position almost anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   For information on dealers selling and installing LoJack, visit
the company's Web site _ www.lojack.com _ or call 1-800-698-8022.
Several other companies also make vehicle location systems; auto
dealers can provide information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported on a drug being produced by
ViroPharma Inc. that may cure viral meningitis and the common cold.
The article said the drug probably would be out sometime this year.
It also said the company was publicly traded. I did a computer
search for the stock symbol, but couldn't find it. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's VPHM (Nasdaq).
</P>
<P>
   The article, by the way, didn't say the drug _ pleconaril _
definitely would be out this year. It said ViroPhamra is sponsoring
two large studies, due out in the spring, that will determine
whether the drug works well enough to win Food and Drug
Administration approval.
</P>
<P>
   As the article said, the FDA requires large, carefully designed
experiments to compare the medicine with standard care before
giving its approval to put it on the market. If the studies turn
out as ViroPharma hopes, the company will seek immediate approval
to sell the drug. With speedy FDA review, a liquid form of
pleconaril could be on the market by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about Mother Love, who was fired
recently as host of the syndicated TV talk show ``Forgive or
Forget''?
</P>
<P>
   A: In an interview with the New York Post, Mother Love _
identified by the TV Talk Shows Web site as the former radio
personality Jo Anne Hart _ said she was reeling from the shock of
it. Surprisingly, however, she defended the right of Twentieth
Television, the show's syndicator, to make whatever changes it
deemed necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset. I was hurt. I was in tears. I was devastated,''
she told the Post. But she added: ``This is a business, and you
cannot tell people how to conduct their business. I've been let go
before, because that's the nature of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   She is being replaced on ``Forgive and Forget'' by actress Robin
Givens. Asked to give her opinion of Givens, Mother Love declined
to comment, saying only, ``That would be unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother Love said she plans to get back on the air someday,
either on TV or radio. ``I am a talk show host,'' she said.
``That's what I do. That's what I am good at.'' And her message to
fans was this: ``I just want everybody who watched the show, who
believed in Mother Love, to keep believing and keep dreaming and
always know like I tell them: Miracles do happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article reported that California has the dirtiest air of
any state in the nation, based on the breaching there of federal
eight-hour health standards 1,217 times in 1999. What state has the
cleanest air?
</P>
<P>
   A: Seven states had ``no exceedances'' of the standards, said
Angie Farleigh of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, the
environmental organization that assembled air quality data. They
were Alaska, Hawaii, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Oregon
and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The complete PIRG information can be viewed online at
www.pirg.org/reports/enviro/smog/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much does it cost to operate gas logs in a fireplace? I
know there are several variables.
</P>
<P>
   A: Rates per therm may vary according to your gas marketer, so
you'll have to do some calculations yourself, using information on
your monthly statement by your gas marketer.
</P>
<P>
   But Millicent Hunter, Atlanta Gas Light Co. spokeswoman,
provided some numbers that should help. If your fireplace is
vented, gas burns at one therm per hour; if unvented, less than 1/4
therm per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners also frequently ask the cost of operating a gas
lantern. A two-mantle gas lantern uses 154 therms of gas per year,
Hunter said, which amounts to 1/3 therm per day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several recent articles have reported that Martin Luther King
Jr. was named for the German theologian Martin Luther. I remember
reading in a book that MLK Jr. was not christened Luther, and that
name was taken later. What did the L. stand for originally?
</P>
<P>
   A: It wasn't the middle name, Luther, that was changed. It was
the first name, from Michael to Martin, said Robert Vickers,
spokesman for the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent
Social Change in Atlanta. The change came in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Luther King Jr. was born Jan. 15, 1929, to the Rev.
Michael Luther King, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church,
and Alberta Christine Williams King. In its 1957 edition, Current
Biography explained that when young ``Mike'' was 6, his father told
him about Martin Luther, the great leader of the Reformation.
``From now on, you and I are going to be named Martin Luther
King,'' his father said at the time, as related in an article by
Ted Poston in the New York Post on May 13, 1956.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I shared my father's admiration for Martin
Luther,'' Martin Luther King Jr. is quoted as saying. ``I know that
I have been deeply influenced by Luther, from the point of view of
both his thinking and his moral courage. But there have been other
great influences in my life also. Among religious leaders, I would
name Jesus of Nazareth and Mahatma Gandhi. Philosophers: Plato,
(Georg Wilhelm Friedrich) Hegel, (Immanuel) Kant and E.S.
Brightman. Theologians: (Friedrich Daniel Ernst) Schleiermacher,
(Paul) Tillich and (Reinhold) Niebuhr.''

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Ever hear of llanddrog fair cakes? You
would have if you had clicked your computer mouse at
http://soar.berkeley.edu/recipes/.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe archive has more than 66,800 recipes on file, some
as obscure as the fair cakes, which are Welsh pastries, and others
as common as chili.
</P>
<P>
   Computer sites can answer food or kitchen questions, locate
recipes and solve your dining predicaments. With the Internet,
you've got a global kitchen, cooking experts and restaurant guides
literally at your fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Net cooks'' know that learning how to search and navigate is
the e-ticket to finding recipes and restaurants online. Like
everything on the Web, the variety of food and dining information
is overwhelming, and varies from four-star to downright dismal.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics of cooking are the best of what the Web offers: At
certain sites, you can change a soup recipe for four to one for 40,
and leave out the onions, then print it out in extra-large type for
Aunt Freida in about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Recipes are where things get fuzzy. At some sites open to any
cook who wishes to post, recipes range from authentic and accurate
to simply wrong all around. We visited a variety of food-related
sites, and picked the best. Be careful, though _ surfing food sites
can be addictive. One good thing: they're calorie-free.

to menu planning for parties, thousands of recipes and wine and
beverage sites. Find cooking schools, magazines, newspaper food
articles, out-of-print cookbooks or vintage kitchen utensils. Learn
how to cook with solar heat, make sugar-free candy, cook for a pet
or for a camping trip. They can even help you make tonight's dinner
with their ``surf for supper'' page of daily menus. Dozens of
message boards and links to newsletters and other cooks bring the
cooking world into your home.

   One of the oldest food sites and a recipe-rich one, this lists
recipes and articles from Bon Appetit and Gourmet as well as from
celebrity authors. It offers several links to other sites, and has
a guide to stemware and etiquette, metric conversions of recipes
and a search engine for vintage cookbooks. The recipe files are
vast, with more than 10,000 entries, and cover several years of the
archives of the big magazines.

   If you're new to cooking, take heart _ so is this guy. A retired
bond broker from Wall Street threw in the towel and moved to Utah
with his family. He uses his Web site as an informal cooking
school. He's smart, and so is his site that can help a new cook
muddle through a recipe, or a veteran who needs some ideas. A food
dictionary is available, and plenty of recipes that are categorized
logically. He also speaks in layman's terms, not foodese. Bravo!
One of the nifty links from his site is the Food Museum. It's a
must-see, especially if you're interested in food history.

   Unless your spaceship just landed, you've seen the burgundy
Zagat guides to restaurants and hotels in bookstores and airport
shops. Now they're on the Web. Call up a guide for a city to find a
restaurant, and its rating by everyday diners _ not critics. You'll
also get food prices, menu items and in some instances, a virtual
video of the dining room. Zagat soon will make all their guides
available on the Web, but major cities are already there. Their
hotel guides also are listed. Just remember to take your laptop
wherever you go, and you'll have a restaurant at the ready.

</P>
<P>
   The mother of all recipe sites (note that it does not take the
www command). From gourmet to downright weird creations, they're
here.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities can overwhelm. With more than 900 recipes for
chili, how do you choose?
</P>
<P>
   Here is the best part of the site: You can refine your search to
bring up a recipe to your specifications. So: chili, white, beans,
chicken narrowed our search to a more manageable 39 chili recipes.
</P>
<P>
   The site's organized neatly; you can choose a recipe by its
category (appetizer, meat, bread, etc.) or its country of origin.
Then there's the generic search: Just plug in a name or word in a
recipe title, and sit back.
</P>
<P>
   We especially like the categories for dietary restrictions.
Dishes for diabetics and food allergy sufferers abound.
</P>
<P>
   The link to the Food Web Ring can take you through cyberspace
dining, too; if you ever get through the recipes, check it out.
</P>
<P>
   _ www.finecooking.com
</P>
<P>
   A classy and informative site from a magazine publishing company
that does great work (the Taunton Press). Lessons here are
first-rate. Currently on the site is a video that teaches correct
knife-sharpening techniques. An entire portion of the site is
dedicated to food science. Get answers to questions like, ``Why is
it unsafe to eat raw cookie dough?'' and ``Does marinating really
tenderize meats?'' The same thorough attention is given to
ingredients _ should you use starch or not in cheesecakes? _
choosing and using fresh foods, rating gadgets and equipment and
plenty of recipes. A number of links to other sites are here, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ www.foodtv.com
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is the site set up by the Food TV Network, a channel
of round-the-clock cooking shows. But it's great: You get good food
advice and recipes, and you don't have to listen to even one
``Bam!'' For those not familiar with the cooking channel, the names
here may not mean much. But recipes from the shows as well as
archives, cooking tips from experts, informative articles about
food and more links make it comprehensive. We especially like their
daily menus in practical categories: meatless, hedonistic, easy,
light and others. And yes, their TV schedule is on here, too.
Bookmark this one.
</P>
<P>
   SURFING TURF
</P>
<P>
   _ Search using the format specified by the site you're visiting.
Not all recipe sites are logical. Some categorize recipes, others
just throw you into an alphabet and let you figure it out. So for
oatmeal-raisin bread, do you search bread, or oatmeal or raisin
bread? (Hint: Try all three.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Cooking newsgroups, e-mail lists and e-newsletters let you
participate in talks with other cooks. Beware, however, that you
can receive up to 100 messages a day from some of the boards. Ask
the moderator how many posts are made daily before you sign up. For
a list of these types of boards, go to www.kitchenlink.com and
check out their link to Newsgroups, Forums and Mailing Lists.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many food sites are commercial, or have links to companies
that will send out e-mail to their participants. If you don't like
spam _ the Internet kind _ don't post or ask questions or register
with those sites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some of the larger sites that link to hundreds of others,
kitchenlink.com, for instance, may not be updated, and they could
turn up broken links. If so, you'll get the message ``404: Not
found.'' ``Nettiquette'' says you should e-mail the Web master of
the site.
</P>
<P>
   WORTH A CLICK:

<P>
   _ Check out the ``weird and extraterrestrial'' recipes at

same site, you can find recipes to make your own shampoo and beauty
products. ``Bath cookies'' make a fun gift for cooks.

whereby you try to link the actor to almost everyone in Hollywood
through one flick or another. It was ``rock, scissors, paper.''
``On three,'' he instructs, as his brother and I pause, clenched
fists poised over open palms. Smack, smack, WHAM! Kevin and Loretta
(``scissors''), 1. Michael (``paper''), 0. And with that, I've
reassured them both that I won't dredge up the dreaded Six Degrees
game again. Interview with the brothers who are doing concerts now.

complete with saloon, hotel, golf course and landing strip. On Feb.

the flawed Olympic City of 1996. Shuttling about town Tuesday in
brand new coaches (a far cry from the relics and rattletraps used

 Editors note: Psst! Read the latest? If not, you haven't
read  HotStuff, the San Francisco Chronicle's weekly roundup of
great 
 new home-and-garden items and places to visit.   HOT STUFF: Pianos Offer More Than a Pretty Face  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Like it or not, pianos often are seen as pieces of
furniture. After all, they tend to take up a lot of room.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether you have budding pianists in the family or you are
looking for a conversation piece, Tibor and Tara Szabo of &UR; The &LR; 
 &UR; Music Szalon &LR;  can find the right piano to match your musical and
aesthetic needs.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, they have sought out and restored rare and antique
pianos by prominent European makers such as B &LR; o &LR; sendorfer, Erard,
Bechstein, Gaveau and Pleyel. They specialize in pre-1940 art-case
pianos with artistically designed cabinets ranging in style from
Napoleon III to Art Nouveau.
</P>
<P>
   The Szabos employ highly skilled local restorers; one of their
technicians has restored a piano belonging to Beethoven. Tibor
Szabo says that before restoration, the beauty of the wood is often
hidden under layers of grime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterward you get the natural color back,'' he says. ``It
becomes so beautiful. It's very similar to antique furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Such rare and carefully tended instruments do not come cheap,
but they can cost less than the ubiquitous modern pieces with
machine-sprayed synthetic coatings.
</P>
<P>
   A restored French-polished piano, with a gorgeous sheen from
layer after layer of hand-applied shellac, would start at $25,000,
while a Louis XVI by Parisian maker Erard could top $200,000. But
Szabo insists ``most people can find their dream piano for under
$100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The pictured B &LR; o &LR; sendorfer grand piano ($75,000), accompanied by
the Szabos' son, Andrei, is made of Brazilian rosewood and probably
was built in Vienna in 1853.
</P>
<P>
   The Music Szalon imports only 15 to 20 pianos a year. It keeps
some pianos in stock, while others are custom ordered. Restoration
takes four to six months, so it's best to plan ahead.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Music Szalon, located in Pacific Heights in San &LR; 
 &LR; Francisco, is open by appointment. Call (415) 771-8798 or &LR;   &LR; visit &LR; 
www.musicszalon.com.

 &UR; Vessel Sinks Transform the Bath &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
In a move that may reveal more about modern American culture than
most people would prefer, bathrooms increasingly are being
transformed from private rooms where mundane rituals are performed
into glistening showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Vessel sinks are helping deepen that transformation. Amid the
bewildering variety of such sink bowls, some of the most striking
are by Southern California's  &UR; Alchemy Glass &AMP; Light &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Alchemy vessel sinks fairly glow with gold and platinum, which
are combined in a complex interaction with glass and heat guided by
master craftspeople.
</P>
<P>
   But they aren't merely objets d'art to be admired from a
distance. Though they shriek at the touch of cleansing products
containing grit, these vessels can endure heavy use and shrug off
most abuse other than assault with metal objects.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Platinum Sink'' (pictured above), made with real platinum,
sits on a cast bronze pedestal, while the ``Velvet Cienega''
(pictured below right) is on a nickel wall mount. The vessels are
shaped round (18 by 51/2 inches) or oval (19 by 16 by 41/2 inches).
</P>
<P>
   Confident homeowners can install the plumbing and fixtures
themselves, though the manufacturers recommend that experts at
least be consulted.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Vessel sinks range from $1,500 to $4,000, and stands range &LR; 
 &LR; from $800 to $2,000, depending on materials. For more &LR; 
 &LR; information, visit  &LR; www.alchemy-glass.com.

 Editors note: The San Francisco Chronicle rounds up the best
of  the unusual for home and garden in this regular feature, Off
the 
 Wall.   OFF THE WALL: Getting a Head in Bowling  
   
   
 By Holly Ocasio Rizzo  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  If you've always wanted to make heads roll, now
you can _ but you'll have to bowl to do it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And do it you will with the Skull ball from bowling-equipment
maker Ebonite. The clear ball features a replica human skull
inside. Its intention: outrageous fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowling has declined from 60 million participants to about 50
million participants today, and it's getting older as bowlers
age,'' says Bob Reid, Ebonite's vice president of marketing. The
decline sent shivers through the industry, which did not want to
contemplate its death.
</P>
<P>
   So the bowling industry dug up solutions. To attract younger
blood, bowling alleys now call themselves ``bowling centers,'' and
they've installed laser lights, cosmic light shows and big sound
systems especially for rock 'n' roll bowling.
</P>
<P>
   Ebonite sought out flashy new equipment for such bowling
centers. Its researchers set to work developing a clear resin that
could enclose anything stuck into it. The result was a
limited-edition series called Fun Ball, including the Skull ball; a
Tai Chi ball bearing yin and yang symbols; and multicolored,
striped Zebra balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro shops tell me they're excited about seeing new customers
come in to look at the Skull ball,'' Reid says.
</P>
<P>
   After perfecting the method for making clear bowling balls,
Ebonite is considering what to add to the line. Perhaps a rolling
snow globe, company spokesman Bryan LeMonds suggests.
</P>
<P>
   A new ball will be needed after the 8,000 Skull balls run out.
But whose skull is it anyway? ``Oh,'' Reid says, ``it's just a
skull.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. Has anybody seen Elvis lately?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHERE TO FIND IT
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; The Skull ball costs $140-150 and is available from Ebonite
dealers. See the Fun Ball line and a complete dealer list at
Ebonite's Web site,  &LR; www.ebonite.com &LR; .

</P>
<P>
   TO WRITE ``RELEASE 3.0''
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES SYNDICATE
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK, Jan. 18, 2000 -- Esther Dyson, one of the world's
foremost authorities on emerging digital technology, is writing
``Release 3.0,'' an every-other-week column for The New York Times
Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Release 3.0,'' available in English and Spanish, charts the
impact of technology on daily life, and on the world's social,
political and financial fabric.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this column to be full of 'for instances' -- a running
commentary on the wonderful, alarming, funny, curious things that
technology leads to,'' Dyson says. ``It won't tell you what
products to buy or how to use the technology, but I hope it will
make you think about it -- to examine your own choices, to consider
the consequences on politics, business, education.''
</P>
<P>
   The title ``Release 3.0'' follows Dyson's practice of naming her
projects like new computer-product iterations: Release 1.0, the
highly influential monthly newsletter Dyson has edited for nearly
20 years, and ``Release 2.0: A Design for Living in the Digital
Age'' (Broadway, $26) published in 1997 and translated into 20

   ``Esther Dyson's word on something is what computer industry
insiders everywhere wait for,'' Joan Nassivera, executive editor of
the Syndicate, says. ``She has a well-deserved reputation as a
critic, a seer and a matchmaker who brings together the pioneers
who are creating the future.''

   Wired magazine called Dyson a ``one-woman think-tank.'' Fortune
magazine named her one of the 50 most influential women in American
business.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson is chairman EDventure Holdings, a New York City-based
research firm specializing in emerging technologies worldwide.
EDventure publishes Release 1.0 and stages two annual conferences,

<P>
   Fluent in Russian, Dyson has taken special interest in
technology development in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson chairs the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers, a gatekeeper for the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of an English physicist and a Swiss mathematician,
Dyson graduated from Harvard with an economics degree in 1974.
Recently she wrote that she has ``devoted her life to discovering
the inevitable and promoting the possible.''
</P>
<P>

including Mikhail Gorbachev, Salman Rushdie and Martha Stewart.

   How many airline miles have you earned and let expire unused?
How many times have you bought something with a rebate, but never
cashed in? How many times have you bought something with a
money-back offer and junked it without taking the trouble to get
your money back?
</P>
<P>
   You're not alone. Companies are piling up billions in
unfulfilled liabilities and consumers are losing out on billions of
make-goods that could be theirs -- if they only bothered.
</P>
<P>
   In her new `Release 3.0'' column today, Esther Dyson discusses a
Web venture that aims to help consumers ``bother'' about those
unclaimed rebates and make-goods.

   Here's the release The New York Times put out last week:
</P>
<P>
   ESTHER DYSON, TECHNO AGE THINKER,
</P>
<P>
   TO WRITE ``RELEASE 3.0''
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES SYNDICATE
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK, Jan. 18, 2000 -- Esther Dyson, one of the world's
foremost authorities on emerging digital technology, is writing
``Release 3.0,'' an every-other-week column for The New York Times
Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Release 3.0,'' available in English and Spanish, charts the
impact of technology on daily life, and on the world's social,
political and financial fabric.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this column to be full of 'for instances' -- a running
commentary on the wonderful, alarming, funny, curious things that
technology leads to,'' Dyson says. ``It won't tell you what
products to buy or how to use the technology, but I hope it will
make you think about it -- to examine your own choices, to consider
the consequences on politics, business, education.''
</P>
<P>
   The title ``Release 3.0'' follows Dyson's practice of naming her
projects like new computer-product iterations: Release 1.0, the
highly influential monthly newsletter Dyson has edited for nearly
20 years, and ``Release 2.0: A Design for Living in the Digital
Age'' (Broadway, $26) published in 1997 and translated into 20
languages. (The paperback edition, published in 1998, is ``Release
2.1.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Esther Dyson's word on something is what computer industry
insiders everywhere wait for,'' Joan Nassivera, executive editor of
the Syndicate, says. ``She has a well-deserved reputation as a
critic, a seer and a matchmaker who brings together the pioneers
who are creating the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Wired magazine called Dyson a ``one-woman think-tank.'' Fortune
magazine named her one of the 50 most influential women in American
business.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson is chairman EDventure Holdings, a New York City-based
research firm specializing in emerging technologies worldwide.
EDventure publishes Release 1.0 and stages two annual conferences,
PC Forum in the United States and High-Tech Forum in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Fluent in Russian, Dyson has taken special interest in
technology development in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson chairs the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers, a gatekeeper for the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of an English physicist and a Swiss mathematician,
Dyson graduated from Harvard with an economics degree in 1974.
Recently she wrote that she has ``devoted her life to discovering
the inevitable and promoting the possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyson joins a distinguished roster of Syndicate columnists,
including Mikhail Gorbachev, Salman Rushdie and Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times Syndicate distributes more than 70 special
features, from The New York Times and other sources, to 2,000
clients in 80 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Among contributors to the Syndicate: Discover, The Economist,
Slate and Technology Review; and the Financial Times, International
Herald Tribune and Le Monde.

 &HT;    AN UNFINISHED AGENDA: PROPOSALS FROM 1999 STATE OF THE UNION
 &HT;    With story slugged UNION, an advance for Thursday's State of the
Union address.
 &HT;    EDs: This can be used as a standalone sidebar or as material for
a graphic.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here are the major proposals, and what happened to
them, from President Clinton's 1999 State of the Union address:
</P>
<P>
   Put Social Security ``on a sound footing for the next 75 years''
</P>
<P>
   Plan: Invest a portion of the surplus revenue in private
businesses and commit 60 percent of federal surplus to Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Outcome: Private investment idea abandoned, but other parts of
the plan introduced late last year. Republicans introduced
competing proposals. No votes taken.
</P>
<P>
   Secure Medicare for at least two decades
</P>
<P>
   Plan: Seek bipartisan reforms of Medicare and use part of the
federal surplus to prop up the program.
</P>
<P>
   Outcome: The president rejected a bipartisan proposal led by
Sen. John Breaux, D-La. No administration plan introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Provide prescription drugs benefits through Medicare
</P>
<P>
   Plan: Offer the benefit for the elderly of all income levels.
</P>
<P>
   Outcome: Republican leaders criticized the plan as too big.
Democrats tried unsuccessfully to pass more modest plans. The issue
moved high on the agenda for both parties for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universal'' individual retirement savings accounts
</P>
<P>
   Plan: Use more than 11 percent of the federal surplus to
establish ``USA'' savings accounts, with a percentage matched by
federal dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Outcome: No formal action in Congress. Clinton renewed the
proposal, making it part of his tax relief plan.
</P>
<P>
   Assistance to families who care for the elderly
</P>
<P>
   Plan: A tax credit of $1,000 for the aged, ailing or disabled
and the families who care for them.
</P>
<P>
   Outcome: A similar measure was included in the Republican-led
tax cut bill, which Clinton called excessive and vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   An ``Education Accountability Act'' to require school districts
to meet federal standards
</P>
<P>
   Plan: States must fix or close failing schools, hire qualified
teachers and end social promotion or else lose federal education
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Outcome: Partial action. Congress approved $35.7 billion for
education, almost $1 billion more than the president sought,
including $134 million in new funding for failing schools. Strict
new federal mandates to states were not included.
</P>
<P>
   Hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size in primary
schools
</P>
<P>
   Plan: A second-year ``installment payment'' toward reaching the
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Outcome: Congress approved $1.3 billion for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Patients' ``bill of rights'' for health insurance plans
</P>
<P>
   Plan: Guarantee the right to be informed of all medical options,
to see a specialist, and to be treated at the nearest emergency
room.
</P>
<P>
   Outcome: House and Senate passed separate versions that could be
reconciled and sent to the president this year.
</P>
<P>
   A stronger ``safety net'' for farmers
</P>
<P>
   Plan: Crop insurance reform and income assistance to ``bring
prosperity back to the family farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Outcome: Congress approved $8.7 billion in emergency assistance,
but the president presented no comprehensive agriculture reform
package.
</P>
<P>
   Solve the Y2K ``bug''
</P>
<P>
   Plan: Calls for states and local governments to join with
federal effort to fix computer problems related to the change into
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Outcome: The new year arrived almost glitch-free after the
administration spent $8.5 billion to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Authority for the president to negotiate international trade
agreements
</P>
<P>
   Plan: Renew the long-standing negotiating powers, which Congress
allowed to expire in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Outcome: No action, amid strong opposition from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Africa trade agreement
</P>
<P>
   Plan: Lower trade barriers and increase ties between the United
States and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Outcome: House and Senate passed separate versions that will
require major changes to reconcile.
</P>
<P>
   Ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
</P>
<P>
   Plan: Signed by Clinton in 1997, the treaty would ban nuclear
weapons testing.
</P>
<P>
   Outcome: Rejected by the Senate Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Stronger gun controls
</P>
<P>
   Plan: Restore the five-day waiting period for buying a handgun
</P>
<P>
   Outcome: Senate and House have passed differing forms of
legislation. A joint conference has so far been unable to reach a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reform
</P>
<P>
   Plan: Endorses a ban on unrestricted ``soft'' money donations to
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Outcome: Stalled. Bipartisan legislation passed in the House but
failed in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Hate crimes prevention law
</P>
<P>
   Plan: Legislation to make violence a federal crime when it is
based on race, religion, ancestry, gender, or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Outcome: Legislation approved in the Senate, stalled in the
House.

 &HT;    Tackle something hot off the grill for the big party
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While stews, soups and big pots of chili are still stalwarts of
a cozy winter kitchen, more and more people are braving the
elements to capture the great taste of grilled foods year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Two polls indicate that 43 percent to 49 percent of Americans
enjoy grilling in the winter. Not only do we like to grill with a
chill, but a survey sponsored by grill manufacturer Weber found
that 30 percent will grill in a snowstorm and an amazing 20 percent
just pull on their grilling mitts to brave sleet and ice.
</P>
<P>
   If you are among those who still store the grill after Labor
Day, you may want to see what you've been missing. And Super Bowl
season is the perfect time to give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   ``The savory taste of grilled foods is wonderful year-round, and
grilled meats are perfect for a testosterone-packed day of football
watching,'' says Robin Kline, a culinary professional and director
of the Pork Information Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Kline suggests choosing a hearty favorite like country-style
pork ribs, best cooked slowly over indirect heat. Commercial breaks
are the perfect time to check their progress and brush on zesty
Jalapeno-Peach Sauce (see recipe, H10). Country-style ribs are cut
from the rib end of the pork loin, so they have more meat per bone
than spareribs and baby back ribs, to satisfy big appetites.
</P>
<P>
   Inside are some tips and Web sites to help you out, and outside,
if you decide to take the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   WINTER GRILLING TIPS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If the day is very cold and windy, it could increase cooking
time, so plan accordingly. Avoid grilling in high winds. A sunny
winter day with no wind should not affect cooking time.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When using a charcoal grill, always grill with the vents open
to ensure that they are unobstructed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Position grill on a clear surface and as near the door as
possible to avoid running back and forth in the cold. Clear the
path between grill and door.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Have all food prepped and ready to grill. Chop all the
vegetables and make all the sauces or marinades. Map a plan for
when things need to go on and come off the grill. Planning will
minimize the amount of time you spend outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use the indirect cooking method to prepare large cuts of meat
such as large roasts, legs of lamb, whole chickens and turkey. In
this method, the grill lid is closed for the entire cooking time.
This ``no-peek'' method is perfect for wintertime, as it lets you
stay indoors longer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't grill in the evening without outdoor lights.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't use regular gloves or mittens as grilling mitts _ they
may not be heat-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't leave serving platters outside while the food cooks.
Leave them inside until you need them.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Never grill indoors, in a garage, or in other enclosed areas
because of the risk of fire and fumes.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Wheat germ balls make filling snack
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cathy Brody wants to make wheat germ balls for her children but
hasn't found a recipe like one she used in a middle school home
economics class. They included peanut butter and wheat germ, and
she says they were a ``good, nutritious snack.''
</P>
<P>
   A search of the archives here turned up a similar-sounding
recipe published in 1993. Called Vitamin Balls, it packed the
additional nutritional benefits of soy milk powder, carob powder
and honey.
</P>
<P>
   Online we found a recipe at www.iVillage.com that sounds more
like dessert but might also be good for you. There's no peanut
butter, but it's packed with raisins, bound with cream cheese and
rolled in crushed peanuts and coconut. If one or more of those
flavors doesn't suit, you and the kids might enjoy experimenting
with substitutes.

<P>
   Requests
</P>
<P>
   Walnut fudge, pecan fudge or butterscotch fudge. Phyllis Flory's
e-mail question said she doesn't remember what it was called, but a
friend used to make a confection with light brown sugar and it
tasted like See's candy fudge. Does anyone have that recipe?
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Weaver wonders by e-mail if anyone has held onto a hot
open-face sandwich recipe she clipped from a housekeeping-type
magazine in the 1960s. She remembers how it was assembled, but not
how the ground beef was seasoned. French bread was spread with
softened butter and a thin layer of the ground beef, then topped
with sliced American cheese and fresh tomato slices before being
baked.

 &HT;    Cook on Sundays, eat well all month
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gourmet _ or just plain good _ eating doesn't have to wait for
special occasions. After all, you deserve more than carryout or
food from a frozen cardboard box each night. And so does your
family. We know everyone is busy, especially during the week. But
with well-planned cooking sessions on Sunday afternoon, you can
enjoy big, family-style Sunday dinners and then some fast and
fabulous meals during the week. Taking a cue from a new cookbook,
``Cooking for the Week,'' by Diane Morgan, Dan Taggart and Kathleen
Taggart (Chronicle Books, $18.95), we offer a menu here for a month
of Sundays, and all the days in between.
</P>
<P>
   JAN. 30
</P>
<P>
   Spaghetti and meatballs
</P>
<P>
   Make double batches of spicy tomato sauce and meatloaf mixture.
Put half the meatloaf in a loaf pan, wrap tightly and freeze until
midweek. With the remaining, make meatballs. Combine with sauce and
spaghetti and you'll have a Super Bowl crowd-pleaser. Put one quart
of sauce in the refrigerator and two quarts in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   JAN. 31
</P>
<P>
   Meatball subs
</P>
<P>
   Take leftover meatballs and nest them in hoagie rolls. Spoon
tomato sauce over the meatballs and then blanket with slices of
mozzarella cheese. Wrap each sandwich with aluminum foil and heat
in a 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   February
</P>
<P>
   1Vegetarian pizza
</P>
<P>
   Take Sunday's tomato sauce, thicken it with a bit of tomato
paste or spice it up with an extra dash of crushed red pepper.
Spread on a homemade or store-bought pizza crust, top with
mushrooms, chopped green pepper and chopped onion (or your other
favorite veggies), sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and bake.
</P>
<P>
   2 Meatloaf
</P>
<P>
   and mashed potatoes
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, bake the meatloaf. While it's cooking, make a hearty
portion of mashed potatoes (you want leftovers). As soon as the
meatloaf comes out of the oven, put trimmed asparagus on a cookie
sheet, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and stick under
the broiler for 4 minutes. Heat some tomato sauce to spoon over the
meatloaf.
</P>
<P>
   3Potato cakes
</P>
<P>
   and green salad
</P>
<P>
   Combine 2 cups mashed potatoes with one large beaten egg. Stir
in 6 tablespoons of flour. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of grated onion,
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram, salt and pepper to taste. Drop by
heaping spoonfuls into a heavy skillet with 1/8-inch of hot
vegetable oil. Flatten with spoon and fry on each side for 1
minute. Top with poached egg if desired. Serve with green salad.
</P>
<P>
   4Shrimp braised in oil
</P>
<P>
   Cookbook author Mark Bittman calls this a flavor bath. Combine
1/3 cup olive oil and 4 cloves of sliced garlic in a 10-inch
skillet over medium heat. When the garlic begins to sizzle, add 1
teaspoon each of cumin and paprika. Increase heat to medium-high
and add 2 pounds of medium shrimp. Stir and cook until shrimp are
pink. Serve over rice.
</P>
<P>
   5 Pork chops, macaroni
</P>
<P>
   and cheese and spinach
</P>
<P>
   For a comfy Saturday night feast, make macaroni and cheese in a
large casserole dish (save half for Sunday). Broil or fry some pork
chops and steam some spinach.
</P>
<P>
   6 Roast chicken
</P>
<P>
   Roast two chickens (save one), steam two bunches of broccoli
(save one); reheat mac and cheese. Make a double recipe of your
favorite drop biscuit recipe with 1/2 cup of chopped fresh herbs
(put 8 in the freezer). Finish with raspberry ice cream: Puree 2
(10-ounce) packs of frozen raspberries, 2 cups of cream and 1/4 cup
of confectioners' sugar. Freeze 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   7 Biscuit-topped chicken pie
</P>
<P>
   Remember the chicken pot pies of yore? Here's a quickie version
that's delicious. Combine chopped chicken with carrots, mushrooms
and a cream sauce. Pour into a casserole dish and top with the
leftover herbed biscuits. Heat and eat.
</P>
<P>
   8 Linguine with broccoli
</P>
<P>
   Toss some linguine with olive oil, steamed broccoli from Sunday
and crumbled blue cheese. For an extra layer of flavor, add toasted
pecans. Simply spread pecans on a baking sheet and heat at 350
degrees for 5-7 minutes. Serve with a crisp white wine.
</P>
<P>
   9 Asian chicken salad
</P>
<P>
   Toss together shredded green lettuce, chicken chunks, broken
Ramen noodles and sesame seeds (black if you can find them).
Drizzle with a store-bought Asian dressing or combine 1 tablespoon
each of soy sauce and rice vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, 2
teaspoons of sesame oil and 1/4 cup of vegetable oil.
</P>
<P>
   10 Flank steak
</P>
<P>
   and baked sweet potatoes
</P>
<P>
   Marinate two flank steaks (about 1 3/4 pounds each) in 1/2 cup
soy sauce, 1/2 cup rice vinegar, 1/3 cup honey, 2 teaspoons ground
pepper and 3 tablespoons minced fresh ginger. Broil 6 minutes on
each side. Reserve one and slice the other, and serve with roasted
red peppers and baked sweet potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   11 Steak wraps
</P>
<P>
   Wrap up slices from the second flank steak broiled Thursday
along with leftover roasted red peppers in large flour tortillas.
Optional additions are salsa, guacamole, sliced onions, shredded
lettuce and sour cream.
</P>
<P>
   12 BBQ and Brunswick stew
</P>
<P>
   Pick up a few pounds of barbecue and a couple of quarts of
Brunswick stew and invite the neighbors over for an impromptu
Saturday night visit. Don't forget the coleslaw and extra sauce.
</P>
<P>
   13 Roasted leg of lamb
</P>
<P>
   Celebrate Valentine's Day early with a romantic meal featuring a
roasted leg of lamb and root vegetables and chocolate cheesecake.
To roast veggies, gather 2-3 each of carrots, potatoes, turnips,
parsnips and sweet onions. Peel, cut into 1-inch chunks and toss in
vegetable oil. Spread on baking sheet and bake at 400 degrees for
35-45 minutes until tender. (Reserve 2-4 cups.)
</P>
<P>
   14 Lamb couscous
</P>
<P>
   Retrieve a quart of the tomato sauce from the freezer and thaw.
Combine with lamb, diced vegetables, chickpeas and spices and stew.
Then serve over a fluffy bed of couscous. Share the rest of the
chocolate cheesecake with your favorite Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   15 Roasted vegetable soup
</P>
<P>
   Take 4 cups of the leftover roasted root vegetables and puree in
a food processor with 2 1/2 cups chicken or vegetable stock and 1/2
cup of heavy cream or milk. Add salt, pepper and dried herbs such
as thyme and oregano to taste. Warm over low heat until hot. Serve
with breadsticks or croutons. Or make grilled cheese sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   16 Lamb and pita sandwiches
</P>
<P>
   Spread cream cheese on one side of a pita pocket and your
favorite store-bought chutney on the other. Then stuff with thin
slices of lamb and red onions and finish with shredded lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   17 Order a pizza
</P>
<P>
   Put your feet up, kick back and order a pizza for home delivery.
You deserve a night off. But try something new, like a white pizza
with garlic, olive oil and several white cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   18 Sesame-soy glazed salmon
</P>
<P>
   Whisk together 1/4 cup each of soy sauce, lime juice and sesame
oil and brush on 6 salmon fillets (about 4 ounces each). Broil 3-5
minutes on each side, depending on thickness. Reserve two; serve
the other four with steamed or stir-fried vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   19 Fettuccine with salmon and pesto
</P>
<P>
   Flake the additional two salmon fillets and combine with cooked
fettuccine, cooked green peas and store-bought pesto sauce. Pair
with a crusty bread and a glass of wine.
</P>
<P>
   20 Roasted turkey breast with white bean stew
</P>
<P>
   A roasted turkey breast can go a long way. Tonight, put a couple
of thick slices on top of a hearty white bean stew. Then, in honor
of the observance of George Washington's birthday Monday, make some
cherry crumb squares.
</P>
<P>
   21 Bean and Bacon Soup
</P>
<P>
   Most of the work for tonight was done Sunday. Puree leftover
bean stew with milk and then heat with cooked bacon, garlic and
herbs. Crusty bread, a green salad and cherry crumb squares round
out the meal.
</P>
<P>
   22 Turkey Caesar salad
</P>
<P>
   Go light tonight with a turkey Caesar salad. Combine leaves of
romaine lettuce with croutons and strips of turkey. Then toss in a
store-bought Caesar dressing or combine 3/4 cup of buttermilk, 1/4
cup low-fat mayonnaise, 1/2 teaspoon anchovy paste and a dash of
lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce. Sprinkle with Parmesan
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   23 Turkey tetrazzini
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, noodles, cream sauce and green peas. Ummm. Comfort food.
This leftover recipe takes a little longer than some others, but
it's worth it. It makes a hearty amount, so freeze the leftovers
for another winter night.
</P>
<P>
   24 Veggie omelet
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, why not make a veggie three-egg omelet? Spinach and
mushrooms are a good combo. Or try salsa and cheddar. Serve with
toast and green salad. (Have any romaine lettuce left over from
Tuesday?)
</P>
<P>
   25 Pasta with Italian sausage
</P>
<P>
   Pull the last quart of tomato sauce from the freezer. Brown some
crumbled Italian sausage and drain. Combine sausage with the tomato
sauce and heat. Toss with rigatoni and garnish with grated pecorino
romano.
</P>
<P>
   26 Steak and baked
</P>
<P>
   potatoes
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, go classic. If you've never pan-fried a steak in a
searing hot iron skillet give it a try (but turn the smoke alarm
off first). Don't forget the butter, sour cream and chives for the
baked potatoes. (Bake extra for Sunday.)
</P>
<P>
   27 Roast pork tenderloins
</P>
<P>
   Use your favorite dry rub on 2 pork tenderloins (about 1 pound
each) and roast. Serve with steamed brussels sprouts and twice
baked potatoes. Scoop out the flesh of the potatoes baked Saturday
and mix with 2 tablespoons butter and 1/2 cup each of milk and sour
cream. Season to taste. Bake the shells 20 minutes at 400 degrees,
then fill and bake 10 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   28 Pork fried rice
</P>
<P>
   Steam rice (enough for 6 cups) and chop carrots, celery and
peppers. In a wok or skillet, scramble 2 eggs and set aside. Then
stir-fry the vegetables in hot oil; add 2 tablespoons of dry
sherry, then add the rice and stir for about 3 minutes. Next add
slices of roast pork and chopped green onion and stir for 1 minute.
Add the eggs and a dash of soy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   29 Tuna melt
</P>
<P>
   Make a tuna melt with your favorite tuna salad and white cheddar
or Monterey Jack cheese. Sandwich and grill in a skillet until the
cheese melts. Or pull the turkey tetrazzini from the freezer, thaw
and heat.

 &HT;    Double-duty day eases the rest of the week
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the plan. Cook a nice Sunday dinner. But when you are
roasting one chicken, roast another for the next couple of nights.
When you steam broccoli, steam an extra bunch to toss with pasta or
include in a stir-fry the next night.
</P>
<P>
   For guidance, we followed ``Cooking for the Week'' by Diane
Morgan, Dan Taggart and Kathleen Taggart (Chronicle Books, $18.95).
We follow their menus almost to the letter with the roast chicken
and turkey. Other ideas we borrowed from the book are the flank
steak, Asian dressing, linguine with broccoli, turkey Caesar salad,
pork tenderloin and stir-fried rice. So if you are intrigued by
this idea, pick up the book. It offers 13 weekly menu plans.
</P>
<P>
   We tried to take the concept and apply it to other things we
love, like spaghetti and meatballs or leg of lamb. You can do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   One bit of advice: Set aside the reserve portions first, so
you'll have insurance for another meal and also practice good
portion control. And take care to store foods properly. Wrap
tightly and store in airtight containers in the refrigerator or
freezer. It's best to use leftovers from the fridge within three
days.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis here is on fresh foods and good cooking. But for
those who really view the kitchen as a foreign country or who find
themselves extremely pressed for time, try substituting some
convenience items. Boboli pizza crusts, pre-sliced mushrooms, fully
cooked smoked pork chops and precooked chicken breasts can all work
in some of the recipes and suggestions. Give it a try this month
and we bet you'll rediscover dinnertime.
</P>
<P>
   SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Spicy Tomato Sauce
</P>
<P>
   Makes 16 cups Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 1 hour,
25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This is a double recipe that makes 4 quarts of tomato sauce, so
plan to freeze at least 2 quarts and use throughout the month. We
promise you'll enjoy it more than sauce from a jar _ and it's
better for you because you can control the salt and other
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 medium onions, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   12 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons dried marjoram
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons dried crushed red pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 (28-ounce) cans Italian-style tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 cups canned crushed tomatoes with added puree
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   Heat oil in heavy, large saucepan over medium heat.
</P>
<P>
   Add onion, garlic, oregano, basil, marjoram and crushed red
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Cover and cook until onion is translucent, stirring
occasionally, about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add remaining ingredients; simmer gently, uncovered, until sauce
thickens and measures 16 cups total, breaking up tomatoes with
spoon and stirring occasionally, about 1 hour, 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   To store: Cool slightly. Cover and refrigerate or freeze. _ From
Bon Appetit, March 1999

   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Meatloaf/Meatballs
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 meatloaf (6 servings) and 2 dozen meatballs
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 1 hour to 1 hour, 10 minutes for meatloaf;
</P>
<P>
   10 minutes for meatballs
</P>
<P>
   This is a double recipe from ``Every Night Italian'' by Giuliano
Hazan (Scribner, $25). Half of it should be put into a loaf pan and
wrapped tightly with plastic wrap and then aluminum foil; the half
recipe used for meatballs is served with spaghetti one night,
hoagies the next.
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 cups finely chopped yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   6 slices white bread
</P>
<P>
   1 cup diced celery
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup hearty red wine
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds ground beef
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds ground veal
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds ground pork
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons fresh marjoram leaves or
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons fresh oregano or 1 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Melt butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add
chopped onion and saute until it turns a rich golden color. Remove
the crusts from the bread and chop into small pieces and set aside.
When the onion is ready, add the celery and continue sauteing until
it begins to color. Add the red wine and let it bubble for about 30
seconds to let the alcohol evaporate. Add the chopped bread, stir a
few times, then remove from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, mix the beef, veal, pork, marjoram, oregano and
thyme. Lightly beat the eggs and add to the mixture. Add the
contents of the skillet and season with salt and pepper. Mix very
well, preferably with your hands, so that all ingredients,
especially the bread, are evenly distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the mixture. Transfer half to an 8- or 9-inch loaf pan.
Wrap tightly and freeze until a day before you plan to use. (Then
transfer to refrigerator until ready to bake. To bake, preheat oven
to 350 degrees and bake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   With the other half, take heaping scoops of the meatloaf mixture
and form into balls. Then broil the meatballs about 5 minutes,
turn, and broil for another 5 minutes. Toss with cooked spaghetti
and tomato sauce. Reserve 8 for meatball sub sandwiches.

<P>
   Roast Chicken With Lemon, Garlic and Fresh Rosemary
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings (with one chicken reserved) Preparation time:
10 minutes Cooking time: 1 hour, 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This simple preparation yields two juicy birds, one for tonight
and one for chicken potpie and Asian chicken salad.
</P>
<P>
   2 whole fresh chickens (4 1/2 to 4 3/4 pounds each)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 2 lemons (quarter and reserve squeezed
</P>
<P>
   lemons)
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, halved lengthwise
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   6 sprigs fresh rosemary, each about 3 inches long
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Remove sacks of giblets from the
chickens. Freeze the necks, hearts and gizzards for stock; fry
liver for a four-legged friend. Pull out and discard any large fat
deposits from the cavities of the chickens. Trim any loose skin and
trim off the tails. Pat dry with paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   Line a large roasting pan with aluminum foil for easy cleanup,
unless the pan is nonstick. Place a roasting rack or large wire
cake rack in the pan. In a small saucepan, melt the butter. Add the
lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper. Heat through.
</P>
<P>
   Set chickens on the roasting rack, breast side up. Place 3
rosemary sprigs and 4 lemon quarters in each cavity. Brush the
seasoned butter on the birds, coating them well. Place the roasting
pan in the lower half of the oven and roast, basting every 20
minutes, until the juices run clear when a sharp knife is inserted
into the joint between the body and thigh, or when an instant-read
thermometer registers 170 degrees inserted at the same point, about
1 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the chickens from the oven, baste again and cover loosely
with aluminum foil. Leave 1 chicken to cool completely. Let the
other chicken rest for 10 minutes, then carve and serve. Cut the
completely cooled chicken in half, wrap each half well, and store
in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. _ From: ``Cooking for the
Week'' by Diane Morgan, Dan Taggart and Kathleen Taggart (Chronicle
Books, $18.95)

<P>
   Biscuit-Topped Chicken Pie
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 15 minutes Cooking time: 30
minutes
</P>
<P>
   This is reminiscent of old-fashioned chicken potpie, but so easy
since the chicken and biscuits are already cooked. (If you missed
it on the calendar, we call for making drop biscuits with fresh
herbs the night before and reserving 8 for this recipe.)
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups chicken stock or canned low-salt chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1 medium carrot (4 ounces), peeled, cut in half lengthwise, then
cut into 1/8-inch-thick slices
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 small yellow onion (about 4 ounces), peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces white mushrooms, quartered
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup heavy (whipping) cream
</P>
<P>
   1/2 roast chicken, skinned, meat cut from bones and cut into
1/2-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup minced fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   8 frozen herbed drop biscuits
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Set four 12-ounce ramekins on a
baking sheet, or use an 8-cup baking dish about 2 inches deep.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1-quart saucepan, bring the stock or broth to a simmer. Add
the carrots and cook until crisp-tender, about 10 minutes. Using a
slotted spoon, transfer the carrots to a plate and turn off heat
under the stock or broth.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a 10-inch saute pan or skillet, melt the butter
with the oil over medium heat until the butter foams. Add the onion
and saute until it begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the
mushrooms and saute until they just begin to brown, about 3 minutes
more. Sprinkle the flour over the onion-mushroom mixture and stir
to dissolve. Immediately add the stock or broth, bring to a simmer
and stir until smooth and thickened, about 2 minutes. Add the
cream, stir to blend and bring to a simmer. Add the chicken,
carrots and parsley, bring to a simmer, then add salt and pepper.
Remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the chicken mixture among the ramekins or spoon it into
the baking dish. Place 2 frozen biscuits on top of the chicken
mixture in each ramekin or arrange the 8 on top of the baking dish.
Bake for 12 minutes, or until heated through. Serve immediately. _

   Generous 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup good-quality commercial balsamic
</P>
<P>
   vinegar, divided use
</P>
<P>
   1 (5- to 7-pound) bone-in leg of lamb, trimmed of all surface
fat
</P>
<P>
   2 medium red onions, cut into 1-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup herbed Sicilian black olives or Kalamata olives
</P>
<P>
   2 cups dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   If possible, season the lamb a day ahead and refrigerate it
overnight; if not, do this a couple of hours ahead of baking. Mince
together fresh basil, pancetta, rosemary leaves (not the stems) and
garlic. Blend in oil, dried basil, salt, pepper and 2 tablespoons
balsamic vinegar. Make about 20 deep, wide slits all over the lamb
and stuff with all but 3 tablespoons of the mixture. Rub the rest
over the meat. Lightly cover and refrigerate until 30 minutes
before roasting.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spread the onions, rosemary
branches and olives in a shallow roasting pan (a half-sheet pan is
ideal). Set the lamb on them. Roast 20 minutes. Pour 1/4 cup of the
remaining balsamic and 1 cup of the wine over the meat. Roast 1
hour, basting often. Add another 1/2 cup wine. Roast 20 minutes, or
until meat reaches 130 degrees on an instant-read thermometer for
medium rare.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the lamb to an ovenproof platter. Keep warm in the
turned-off oven, leaving the door open. Set the roasting pan (or
transfer the contents to a large saucepan) over two burners. Stir
in the remaining 2 tablespoons balsamic. Over high heat, boil and
stir until thick and syrupy, 10 minutes or more. Add the remaining
1/2 cup wine and boil down by two-thirds, another 10 to 15 minutes,
then stir in the water. Simmer and stir until the sauce is
rich-tasting, about 2 minutes. Discard the rosemary. Keep the sauce
warm.
</P>
<P>
   Thinly slice the lamb, arranging the pieces around the leg and
moisten with the pan sauce, onions and olives. Serve hot. _ From

   What's Valentine's Day without chocolate? This dense cheesecake
will satisfy that craving for two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   Crust:
</P>
<P>
   Cooking spray
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder,

</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Filling:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds cream cheese at room
</P>
<P>
   temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 cup ( 1/2 pint) heavy (whipping) cream
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup bourbon whiskey
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   Topping:
</P>
<P>
   12 perfect pecan halves
</P>
<P>
   2 cups (1 pint) sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder for dusting
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Spray a 9-inch springform pan
with vegetable-oil cooking spray.
</P>
<P>
   To make the crust: In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar
together with a wooden spoon or an electric mixer until light and
fluffy. In a small bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa, cornmeal, salt and
nutmeg together. Mix into the butter mixture until blended. Using
your fingers, press the mixture evenly into the bottom of the
springform pan. Set the pan on a square of aluminum foil and pull
it snugly around the pan's sides to prevent butter from leaking out
of the pan (do not skip this step). Set in a baking pan and bake
for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven, leave the foil-wrapped pan in
the baking pan, and reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   To make the filling: While the crust is baking, combine the
cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl and beat until the mixture
is light and thoroughly blended. Beat in the eggs, one at a time,
just until incorporated. In a 1-quart saucepan, combine the cream
and chocolate and cook over medium-low heat, stirring with a
heatproof spatula, until the chocolate is completely melted (or
melt the chocolate with the cream in the microwave). Add the
bourbon, vanilla, nutmeg and salt to the chocolate mixture. Pour
into the cream cheese mixture, add the cornstarch and beat until
the batter is completely smooth. Pour into the prebaked crust.
</P>
<P>
   Bake at 350 degrees until the top center of the cheesecake just
barely appears liquid when the pan is gently jiggled, 50 to 60
minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 20 minutes; leave
the oven on.
</P>
<P>
   To make the topping: Spread the pecans on a baking sheet and
toast for 5 minutes; remove from the oven. In a medium bowl, whisk
the sour cream, sugar and vanilla together. When the cheesecake has
cooled for 20 minutes, gently spread the sour cream mixture over
the top, smoothing with a spatula. Return the pan to the oven for 5
minutes, then remove. Gently press the pecans around the top of the
cake about 1 inch inside the edge, positioned like numbers on a
clock to mark the 12 slices. Let cool for 2 hours. Insert a
toothpick in the center of cheesecake and gently cover it with
plastic wrap _ the toothpick will hold the plastic wrap off the top
of the cheesecake to preserve its beauty. Refrigerate for at last 6
hours, or preferably overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Before serving, put the cocoa in a small fine-meshed sieve and
gently tap it while holding it over the cheesecake to dust the top
attractively. To serve, run a knife around the inside of the rim to
loosen the cheesecake, then unlatch the rim to remove carefully.

</P>
<P>
   Roasting a turkey breast is even easier than roasting a chicken,
and one large breast can help make several meals.
</P>
<P>
   1 whole (double) turkey breast
</P>
<P>
   (4 1/2 to 5 pounds)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Leaves from 3 sprigs fresh rosemary (each about 3 inches long),
minced
</P>
<P>
   Leaves from 3 sprigs fresh thyme, minced
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Trim any visible fat from the
breast and discard the neck if included. Pat the breast dry with
paper towels. Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil for easy
cleanup, or use a nonstick pan. Place a roasting rack in the pan
and set the breast on the rack (optional).
</P>
<P>
   In a glass measuring cup, combine the lemon juice, olive oil,
salt, pepper, rosemary and thyme. Pour the mixture inside and over
the breast, coating it well. Set the turkey breast skin side up.
Place the roasting pan in the lower third of the oven. Roast the
turkey breast, basting every 20 minutes, until the juices run clear
when a sharp knife is inserted into the thickest part of the
breast, or when an instant-read thermometer, inserted in the same
spot and not touching bone, registers 165 degrees, about 1 1/4 to 1
1/2 hours. Remove the turkey breast from the oven, baste again,
cover it loosely with aluminum foil and let rest for 10 minutes
before carving and serving.
</P>
<P>
   Cut 1 to 2 generous slices per serving and set the remaining
turkey breast aside to cool. Wrap the reserved turkey breast well
and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. _ From ``Cooking

   6 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   2 serrano chiles or 1 jalapeno chile, seeded and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 cups chicken stock or 2 cans (14 1/2 or 16 ounces each)
low-salt chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1 (14 1/2-ounce) can crushed tomatoes in juice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary leaves, or 2 teaspoons dried
rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1 red bell pepper (6 to 8 ounces), roasted, seeded and cut into
medium dice
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup minced fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   Pick over the beans, discarding any rocks or shriveled beans,
and rinse in a colander. Chop half of 1 onion, half of 1 carrot and
all the celery. In a 4-quart or larger saucepan over medium heat,
heat the olive oil and saute the chopped vegetables until soft but
not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the beans, garlic, chiles, stock
or broth, tomatoes and juice and rosemary. Bring to a boil over
medium-high heat, then reduce heat to a gentle simmer and cover.
Cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the remaining onions into 1-inch wedges. Cut the remaining
carrots into 1/2-inch rounds. Add the onions and carrots to the
pot. Cook until the beans are tender but not mushy, about 30
additional minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the bell pepper to the beans. Add salt and pepper. Ladle 1
to 1 1/2 cups stew into each of 4 wide soup plates or bowls and top
each portion with a little parsley. Cover and refrigerate the

   Any of your favorite preserves will work with this recipe, and
these bar cookies are even better if they sit overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Crust:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Topping:
</P>
<P>
   2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups unpacked light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened, cut into small
pieces
</P>
<P>
   Filling:
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cups cherry preserves (beaten smooth with a mixer or a
spoon)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   To make the crust: In a large bowl, combine the butter with the
flour until you get a doughlike consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Spread crust evenly into an ungreased 9-by-13-inch baking pan.
Use a large piece of waxed paper to firmly and evenly press down
crust. Bake the crust for 15 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool
completely, 30-40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the crust is cooling, prepare the topping: Mix the flour
and brown sugar. Using a pastry cutter, cut in the butter until the
mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   When the crust is cool, gently and evenly spread the cherry
preserves over the crust, leaving 1/4-inch edge all around.
Sprinkle crumbles generously over the preserves (it will seem like
more than you think you need). Bake an additional 15-20 minutes
until golden brown. Allow to cool to room temperature, or
overnight, before cutting and serving. _ From: ``The Magnolia

</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking
dish. In a 10-inch saute pan or skillet, melt the butter over

smooth and thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the cream, then the
remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, the pepper, rosemary, thyme and
nutmeg. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Stir in the turkey and
peas, heat through and remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   Put the pasta in the prepared dish and spoon the turkey mixture
over. In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs and Parmesan.
Sprinkle evenly over the sauce. Bake, uncovered, until heated
through and bubbly, about 20-25 minutes. Preheat broiler and
quickly brown the top of the casserole. Serve half the casserole
immediately and set the rest aside to cool. Cover the reserved
casserole with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to

<P>
   DALLAS _ Saving time and working smart were the common threads
among new products rolled out at the International Builders' Show
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Ovens that cut cooking time by 50 percent or more without
sacrificing flavor, refrigerators that chill fruit and meat at
different temperatures and networked appliances that can be
controlled through the Internet promise to make life easier.
</P>
<P>
   Visions of the flashing 12:00 on the VCR spring to mind, but
these newfangled devices are geared to the computer-savvy society
we've become.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking will eat up less of our time with new technology that
combines light, heat and microwaves. Almost all the major
manufacturers have a version of the quick-cooking oven, and while
the technology varies, the general design of the appliances follows
a similar premise. All are about the size of microwaves, and each
version has a number of preset cooking cycles and a programmable
database for storing the cook times on favorite recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ Accellis 5XP by Jenn-Air: Hot air and microwave energy combine
to cook food in as little as one-fifth the time of a conventional
oven. Lasagna cooks in nine minutes, compared with 50 minutes in a
regular oven. Cooks can bake, broil, roast, crisp, microwave or
defrost.
</P>
<P>
   The oven will calculate cooking times for foods, such as fresh
fish or meat, that don't come with cooking instructions. The
self-cleaning oven will let the user know when it needs to be
cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested retail: $3,500. Available: spring. Information:
www.accesllis.jennair.com or (800) 499-0116.
</P>
<P>
   _ GE Advantium oven: Using halogen lights as its heat source,
the Advantium cooks in about one-fourth the time of a conventional
oven. The three 1,500-watt bulbs generate heat that penetrates the
food.
</P>
<P>
   No preheating is required, and the oven also works as a
microwave.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested retail: $1,299 for above-range model; $1,699 for wall

   REFRIGERATORS
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerators with freezers on the bottom continue to gain
popularity. People access the refrigerator seven to 10 more times
frequently than the freezer compartment, says Amana spokeswoman
Callista Gould.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense, then, to make it easier on the back by putting
the freezer at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   More manufacturers are showing two 36-inch refrigerators
installed side by side to look like one gigantic cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Some specific refrigerator introductions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Whirlpool Conquest: Side-by-side refrigerators always have
posed space challenges on the freezer side. This unit addresses the
problem by moving the ice maker to the top of the freezer and
placing the ice bucket in the door.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested retail: starting at $1,800. Available: May.

   KITCHEN SINKS
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners make major investments in their kitchens and baths,
and no part of the rooms is taken for granted. The sink is no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   Colors are becoming more prevalent and more sophisticated.
Kohler introduced earthy tones in its kitchen sink line, and colors
such as Roussillon red and sunlight in the upscale Dolce Vita
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Jacuzzi and Ann Sacks showed off vessels that look more like
artistic bowls than a place to wash your hands. With materials
ranging from thick glass to marble, the vessel selection is
expanding to suit all tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Sinks of note:
</P>
<P>
   _ Kohler Pro TaskCenter: The 60-inch wide, triple-basin sink is

&HT;     HOUSE OF THE FUTURE COMBINES OLD FEATURES, TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TRACY HOBSON LEHMANN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRISCO, Texas _ Forget Rosie the Robot rolling between the
refrigerator and oven; the true house of the future makes George
Jetson's digs seem like something from the Flintstone era.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine rolling out of bed and setting your routine in motion
with the touch of a button. The bathroom light comes on, as do all
the lights on your path to the kitchen, where the coffee is already
brewing.
</P>
<P>
   Leave a light on downstairs? Click it off through controls on
the television. No need to worry about setting the sprinkler
system. It's connected to sensors in the attic that measure radiant
heat, so the house knows when the lawn needs water.
</P>
<P>
   It all happens in the new American Home 2000, a show house built
for the International Builders' Show that wrapped up earlier this
week in Dallas. Set in a north Dallas corporate community, the
future has arrived in the form of a 4,500-square-foot house costing
$975,000.
</P>
<P>
   It sits in the shadows of the headquarters for the J.C. Penney
Co. Inc., Fina Oil and Chemical, and others, and builders and
developers know the corporations cycle executives for three- to
five-year stays. So the French colonial-style home clearly is not
for an average homebuyer. But it does offer a glimpse of home
trends in the early 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to learning the technospeak that accompanies the
automated house, the homeowner of the future will need to learn the
modern-house lexicon. Forget the family room; it's now the leisure
room. The breakfast room becomes the cafe, and what we once dubbed
the game room is now the imagination room. And what 21st-century
house could be without an Internet alcove? There's an official home
office and two other spaces that could be used for secondary work
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Versatility, says architect Don Evans, is the key to the New
American Home 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The imagination room, for example, can be used as a hobby room,
a playroom or a second home office. With a fold-down desk,
refrigerator drawers and a blackboard painted on one wall, the room
offers a little something for everyone. The garden suite, equipped
with its own kitchen and bath, can serve as mother-in-law quarters,
housing for a boomerang kid or an apartment for a nanny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house is 100 percent flexible for whomever the buyer might
be,'' says Evans, of the Evans Group in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of flexibility, designer Susan Orlie of
Arlington used double-duty furniture, such as a round office table
that can be used for dining. All the fabrics in the public rooms
coordinate so seating can be pulled in from other spaces to
accommodate a crowd. The house centers around the family, Orlie
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a house that says, `Let's congregate here,''' she
says. ``It's not `Where are we going out for dinner,' but `Who can
we invite over.'''
</P>
<P>
   While the whole family can gather in the leisure room, those who
slip into the adjoining kitchen won't miss out on the action. Even
someone in the library loft can catch a view of the family below.
When privacy is desired, the master suite and two upstairs bedroom
suites offer a retreat.
</P>
<P>
   That personal space is the wave of the future, says Joan
McCloskey, executive building editor for Better Homes &AMP; Gardens
magazine. ``People want rooms where you can exhale, a decompression
room.''
</P>
<P>
   At the New American Home 2000, the solitude can come from a soak
in the oversized tub or from an indulgent shower with five
showerheads. The homeowners don't have to worry about using all the
hot water: The master bathroom has two 50-gallon water heaters to
keep it supplied.
</P>
<P>
   Physically, the house centers around the oasis, a courtyard
encircled by the oversized two-story dwelling. Expansive windows in
the parlor look out onto the covered veranda and the water wall
that flows into the small heated pool.
</P>
<P>
   A fireplace, grill and television make the outdoor area perfect
for entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Evans designed the courtyard concept to provide outdoor space
while maintaining privacy in the confines of a small lot. However,
the enclosed space of about 1,000 square feet promises to be
stifling with no breeze to stir the air on sultry summer nights.
</P>
<P>
   It does flood the interior of the house with natural light.
``You can go into every room without turning on a light,'' the
architect notes.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the courtyard design, the house doesn't look like a
fortress. Ample windows, a front porch and a deck on the front of
the house bolster the curb appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception is that people want to live in a cocoon, a
secure place,'' says builder Bob White of Custom Homes Group in
Dallas. But the neotraditional movement fueled by baby boomers
calls for front porches so people see their neighbors. ``The oasis
has the flexibility that you can live in a secure space, but
porches so you can live outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The house is also traditional in its use of materials and
colors. Residents will find comfort in the familiar and natural
textures of stone and wood and in the textural fabrics. Pastel
walls, such as the pale lime green in the master suite, were chosen
for their soothing qualities. Sky blue accents the master suite and
contrasts with light wood cabinetry in the imagination room.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is in largely unseen areas that the New American Home 2000
departs from tradition, though the second-floor wiring closet
offers a peek at the brains of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite television and music are directed through the house
from the small closet. Security devices allow the homeowner to
click into the house from a television or personal computer to see
if doors or windows are open. Appliances will alert the owner if
they are using more energy than usual or if it's just time for a
service call.
</P>
<P>
   The technology package, IBM's Home Director, and the appliances
that work with it, contributed about $40,000 to the price,
according to White. The house is protected by a lightning rod to
protect the house in an 80-foot radius, and the system has a
battery backup.
</P>
<P>
   But, the builder says, the homeowner doesn't need to be a
computer genius to be the master of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criteria we've set for this is that you must be able to
teach a 55-year-old person to operate it within one hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology and building materials combine to make the house a
model of energy efficiency. White guarantees that energy bills in
the house will not exceed $190 per month for 10 years. Compare that
with the average $500 monthly energy costs at White's Dallas home
of comparable size.
</P>
<P>
   The low energy bills might not make up for the almost $1 million
price tag, but it is one less thing for the harried corporate
executive to worry about.

MIKE TYSON'S ONE-RING CIRCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Emanuel Steward's legendary steamy gym in the basement
of the Kronk Recreation Center in Detroit had nothing on the
overstuffed ballroom at Grosvenor House Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched into a room that would have made Mississippi seem
balmy in August by comparison, Mike Tyson, a phalanx of handlers
and hangers on, and so many reporters and photographers they had to
be moved in shifts so all could get a glimpse of Tyson shared one
thing: perspiration, which ran in rivers down Tyson's wide back
even before he picked up a jump rope and went to work.
</P>
<P>
   The moment he skipped his first step, the rivers turned into a
torrent, covering his back, chest, and legs in a glistening sheen
that made him seem even more cut and crushing than normal. He only
enhanced that image when he proceeded to pound the hand pads and
rib pads worn by assistant trainer Stacy McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   What impression Tyson will make Saturday night when he faces
Julius Francis in his first fight since the debacle in Las Vegas
against Orlin Norris last October remains to be seen, however, as
do so many other things about this controversial former heavyweight
champ.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to showtime on Showtime over the past two years,
the 33-year-old Tyson failed to live up to his billing. He lost two
straight to Evander Holyfield, looked dreadful before stopping
Frans Botha with one punch in the fifth round after having not won
a single minute of the bout to that point; and then came a
one-round no contest against Norris that resulted from a punch
thrown several seconds after the bell that sprained Norris's knee
and numbed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   That late punch is what made Tyson an early arrival here. Nevada
Athletic Commission officials urged him to ``take his act on the
road.'' So Shelly Finkel, Tyson's erstwhile promoter and adviser,
settled on a fight at the MEN Arena in Manchester. Lennox Lewis's
manager Panos Eliades convinced Finkel to opt for the 21,000-seat
MEN rather than the 75,000-seat Millenium Stadium in Cardiff,
Wales, explaining that the Wales venue would look like a barn with
only 15,000 spectators in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   What Eliades didn't realize was that, unlike his fighter _ a
rather nondescript heavyweight champion _ Mike Tyson always draws a
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis returned in triumph as the first Brit to own the
undisputed heavyweight title in 102 years, witnesses said there
were about 15 people were at Heathrow Airport to greet him. When
Tyson showed up last Sunday, without a title or much left of his
fearsome reputation after fighting just 28 rounds in the last eight
years and losing more than half of them (to Holyfield and Botha),
more than 1,000 people were there to mob him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his appraisal, Tyson said diplomatically but also
cattily: ``If I say I'm bigger than Lennox Lewis, I'm bragging; if
(promoter) Frank Warren says it, he's a sensible business man.''
</P>
<P>
   Hype and hysteria are the business Tyson has always been in, and
that has not changed since he left the colonies to fight in
England. He caused a near riot in the predominantly black section
of Brixton Friday when, against the advice of local politicians, he
walked down the same street Muhammad Ali and Nelson Mandela had
trod and had to be whisked into a police station for his own
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The same has been true on his daily 5 a.m. jogs in Regents Park
and whenever else he has tried to move about. There are pictures in
the papers, headlines in the tabloids, and hysteria in the streets.
In other words, it's been a typical Mike Tyson road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hired some music guys to work with us with the ticketing
and arrangements,'' Finkel said Tuesday. ``They said this has been
bigger than when Michael Jackson came here. They said at Heathrow
they'd never seen anything like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have sold 75,000 tickets if we had them. The
intensity of this is beyond my expectations. I never thought it
would be this big. It's become like Beatlemania.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be stretching it, but certainly it's been wild even
in these final days of madness for Tyson leading up to what is
expected to be an anticlimactic moment or two in a boxing ring with
Francis.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Francis wouldn't be considered much less of an opponent
than poor Julius, who will receive $550,000 for this ritual
execution at the alter of Tyson mania. He is here not to be
competitive. That would be considered an added attraction. Rather,
Francis is merely a lamb being led to a slaughter designed to
create the same kind of Tyson frenzy in the United States that is
gripping England.
</P>
<P>
   It's questionable whether the scheme will be successful. Tyson
seems to be a slower form of his once formidable self. His hands
move but not with the same snap; his legs move but not with quite
the same speed. Hence, he gets hit now and therefore opponents are
no longer frozen in terror even before the fights begin.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson understands all this because he has been at the center of
it since 1985, the year he turned professional. Since then his life
has had more drama than a daily soap opera. The journey to England
is only the latest in a series of steps, missteps, countersteps,
and follish steps, but it appears to have been a step that is
paying off, at least Tuesday afternoon in a jammed ballroom in a
posh London hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Whether there is an ultimate payoff for Tyson's latest escapade,
however, is anyone's guess. Which is what still makes him so
compelling even in his decline.

SEA ROWER MURDEN NOW FOCUSED ON URBAN CHALLENGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHAMPTON, Mass. _ Adventure of a lifetime? Tori Murden
certainly hopes not. A challenge? Indeed, but nothing compared to
the really important stuff. Worthwhile? Only as a vehicle to better
understand human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it matters so much that a woman sailed alone
across the Atlantic Ocean,'' said the 36-year-old Murden, who on
Dec. 3 became not only the first woman but also the first American
to row across the Atlantic after 82 days of battling hurricane
headwinds, unspeakable exhaustion and bone-deep loneliness. ``The
more important adventures are the urban adventures. There are
things people say just are not possible. By testing limits out
there as an individual, I feel more comfortable testing limits
here, as part of a community.''
</P>
<P>
   Murden was back at her alma mater on Monday for the first time
since her historic journey, the featured speaker at Smith's
All-College Meeting, which traditionally kicks off the second
semester. A 1985 graduate of Smith, Murden learned to row on
Paradise Pond, and competed on varsity crew before going on to earn
a master's degree from Harvard Divinity School and then a law
degree from the University of Louisville. She is on extended leave
as development director of the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville,
an educational institution focusing on Ali's goals of tolerance,
conflict resolution, and self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's finished now,'' Murden said of her voyage. ``I can get on
with more important things.''
</P>
<P>
   Murden's inner drive to bring social justice to those who have
been denied goes back to her childhood, when she saw, day in and
day out, the cruelty toward her mentally-handicapped brother Lamar,
now 40. ``My relationship with him made me see so many other people
in the same situation,'' said Murden, who is Lamar's legal
guardian. While at Harvard, she was a chaplain at Boston City
Hospital, counseling AIDS patients and the elderly (``I was like
24, so there was a certain amount of faking it involved,'' said
Murden. ``But I really loved it'') and worked at the Cambridge
Multi-Service Center for the Homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Always strengthened by the outdoors and never lacking a knack
for adventure _ she once rode her bike home to Louisville from
Smith, and says the only thing that would shock her parents is if
she showed up for Christmas in a black velvet dress _ Murden got
serious about both when spent a college summer at the National
Outdoor Leadership School in Alaska, where she learned to climb
mountains. While climbing in Bolivia, she heard of a cross-country
ski expedition to the South Pole, and coaxed a leave from Harvard
to become the first woman and first American, on Jan. 17, 1989, to
ski to the geographic South Pole, a journey of 750 miles. After the
trip, Murden wrote a thesis entitled ``The Best of Both Worlds, The
Theology of Adventure,'' in which she first set down her belief
that the vital adventures needed to take place back in the cities,
finding new ways to help the disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   Without finding the ``direct path'' to social justice she had
hoped to discover at Harvard, Murden got her degree in 1989 and
went back to her native Louisville to look for it in law school.
(``I didn't find it there, either,'' Murden said.) Meanwhile, she
hooked up with fellow rower Louise Graff, a friend from high school
days, to row competitively in events mostly in the Midwest. When
the two heard about the 1997 Atlantic Rowing Race, they entered as
the only American team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have signed up to do a solo race,'' said Murden.
``I don't have a personality, honestly, that is that grandstanding.
I signed up to race with a partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Murden was already ill, possibly from food poisoning, when the
pair set off from the Canary Islands on Oct. 12, 1997. A day later,
they were towed back to Tenerife, where Murden was hospitalized for
several days before they set out again. A few days later, they
called it quits when their boat's electrical system failed, but
Murden vowed the dream was not dead.
</P>
<P>
   That thwarted effort led to an offer from Sector Sport Watches,
an Italian company that sponsors athletes wanting to test the
limits of human endurance. Would Murden be interested in attempting
a solo crossing on the most difficult route, west to east from
North Carolina to France? She was, and took off on June 14, 1998,
in the same boat. That trip ended on Sept. 7 after 85 days and
2,600 nautical miles, after Hurricane Danielle capsized the
self-righting American Pearl 11 times within 24 hours, savagely
hurling Murden around inside the 4x6 1/2-foot watertight sleeping
compartment until she was so battered and bruised she couldn't go
on.
</P>
<P>
   It was that trip, technically a failure, that brought Murden her
biggest success. After her satellite communications were knocked
out little more than a week after she began, Murden had no way of
knowing that Danielle was about to strike and no way to call for
help except to deploy an emergency distress beacon. After capsizing
five times the morning of Sept. 5, Murden crawled out on deck to
deploy the beacon, but suddenly stopped when she saw the full fury
of the storm. She could not, she realized, ask people to risk their
lives for her. It was at that moment she found what she had been
looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose to place myself out there,'' Murden told the
spellbound students gathered in John M. Greene Hall, ``and must
accept the consequences.'' Not deploying that beacon until the
weather cleared, she said, despite the boat flipping six more
times, ``was the hardest thing I've ever done. What I learned from
that failure . . . is that justice is like honor. It is the person
who brings honor and justice to his or her activities. The ocean
taught me that justice comes from within.''
</P>
<P>
   When the chance came last year to finish what she had started,
this time on the gentler east-to-west route, Murden quickly took
it. On Sept. 13, she departed the Canary Islands in her 23-foot
boat, equipped with a satellite telephone (at $3 a minute) and
water-resistant laptop computer that worked throughout. This time,
when Hurricane Lenny abruptly changed course and headed straight
for her, she knew what to expect and how long it would last.
Capsizing only once, she weathered the storm and landed in
Guadeloupe on Dec. 3, greeted by family, friends, and her fiance,
Charles ``Mac'' McClure, to whom she had proposed over that same
satellite phone in mid-journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I'd better say yes, because Lenny was coming,''
joked McClure, who had helped Murden build her boat. ``It gave her
a little more incentive to get finished.'' They were married on
Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Murden said she plans to spend the next decade focusing on the
urban adventure, addressing the challenges of poverty and
distressed neighborhoods slowly and steadily, one stroke at a time,
until solutions are found.

   ``I come back to civilization and I see all the people we've
left behind: the homeless, disturbed teenagers, the poor, and
recognize that as a society we will not truly arrive if we continue
to leave those people behind,'' Murden said. ``Rowing 12 hours a
day, there's plenty of time to think.''

N.Y. TIMES' CRAIG CLAIBORN CHANGED WHAT WE THINK ABOUT FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON ARNETT AND SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Craig Claiborne, who died Jan. 22 at 79 in New York, joined
the staff of The New York Times more than 40 years ago, food pages
were largely women's domain. Food editors around the country,
mostly women who had trained as home economists, geared their
writing to homemakers. American restaurants were serving
``Continental cuisine,'' a mishmash of European specialties, and
restaurant critics accepted free meals from them, because no one
took food writing seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne changed all that. As food editor of the Times for 29
years and restaurant critic for more than 10, he established a
format that most newspapers use today _ and, more important, used
his influence to add integrity to reviews. He wrote about a range
of cuisines and people and fostered dozens of careers.
</P>
<P>
   When Claiborne ran the food section, it was required reading.
His Sunday magazine column was the nation's personal cookbook, and
he had such well-honed instincts for good home cooks and
little-known authors that many he wrote about went on to become
famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made food respectable,'' said Julia Child from her winter
home in Santa Barbara, Calif. ``He took it out of the women's pages
and into real life. And he certainly launched a lot of people.''
Child met Claiborne just before he wrote a glowing review of
``Mastering the Art of French Cooking,'' which she co-wrote in
1961.
</P>
<P>
   A slow-talking, charming but aloof Southerner, born in
Sunflower, Miss., Claiborne trained as a journalist and a cook; he
was an editor at Gourmet magazine before taking over the Times food
section _ and transforming it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally enraptured,'' recalled Vogue food critic Jeffrey
Steingarten. ``I cooked out of the Sunday magazines and out of
Wednesdays.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne's love of classical cooking had begun in his youth,
when he moved to France and did a stint at hotel school in
Switzerland. At the Times, he championed French food just when
Americans were first becoming interested in the culinary arts. His
penchant for French cooking led him to Pierre Franey, chef at Le
Pavillon _ the only restaurant in 1950s New York that Claiborne
respected. They went on to write seven books together; Claiborne
wrote more than 20 books in all, of which ``The New York Times
Cookbook'' (1961) was the most influential.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Pepin, another Le Pavillon chef and now a celebrated
author, was working under Franey when he met Claiborne. He was
``instrumental in my life,'' Pepin said from his home in Madison,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Pepin spent many weekends cooking with the two men, who were
neighbors in East Hampton, N.Y. ``It was totally different than in
France,'' Pepin said. They would go to the market and then decide
what to make for dinner. They became such good friends that in the
'60s, Pepin said, ``I got married in his house.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Claiborne, writing about food had usually been considered
frivolous. He wrote about Paul Bocuse and Roger Verge and invited
the young lions of nouvelle cuisine to cook in his kitchen on Long
Island. He also introduced Diana Kennedy on Mexican food, Marcella
Hazan on Italian food, and Madhur Jaffrey on Indian cuisine. ``He
was among the first people to think about food in a global kind of
way,'' said Jaffrey from her home in Manhattan. He was interested
enough in Chinese food to write ``The Chinese Cookbook'' with
Virginia Lee (1972).
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne also took chances on unknown cooks. He wrote about
Maida Heatter when no one knew her and she was making desserts for
her husband's restaurant. ``It changed my life a million percent,''
she said from her home in Miami Beach. Claiborne encouraged her to
write a book. ``I never ever would have written a word about
cooking or anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   On a visit to Paris in 1974, Claiborne wrote a story on Ecole de
Cuisine La Varenne, said founder Anne Willan, even though, at the
time, ``we didn't have a single booked student.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his legacies is his fair reviewing. ``He was the first
person,'' said cookbook author Barbara Kafka, ``to write honest
reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Sheraton, the former Times restaurant critic who now writes
for Vanity Fair and Food &AMP; Wine, agreed. Claiborne actually
criticized what he didn't like, she said _ something that hadn't
happened before. He was also the first reviewer to put the star
system into effect.
</P>
<P>
   On one of Claiborne's few visits to Boston, he and Franey did a
cooking demonstration to benefit Radcliffe's Schlesinger Library.
Franey cooked while Claiborne acted as commentator. Ann Robert of
Maison Robert remembered one thing he told her during that visit:
``I don't eat French fried foods.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of blunt statement that led some to call him, as
Child put it, ``short and snippy.''
</P>
<P>
   But charismatic. ``He was a charming man,'' said Sheraton,
``gentlemanly, with a dry sense of humor. He had marvelous taste in
clothes'' and wore wonderfully tailored sports coats and jackets
with beautiful ties. ``His taste for quality was reflected in
everything.''

IT'S UP TO NEW HAMPSHIRE TO SEND A MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Thank you, Iowa; now, please take a seat.
You had your fling, it's over, and as you slip back into somnolence
take solace knowing you get more bites at the political apple than
most citizens elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire, the floor is yours: You decide if John McCain or
Bill Bradley lives to fight another day.
</P>
<P>
   The odds heavily favor George W. Bush and Al Gore, the
front-runners everywhere else from day one. Only New Hampshire can
keep a race going in either party. If Vice President Gore rolls up
Bradley here as he just did in Iowa, the old basketball star can
forget about the playoffs at the convention; he won't even last out
the regular primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's handlers promise he won't go down without a fight in
New Hampshire. But losing the first two rounds would put Bradley in
a coffin-shaped box heading into the 16 Democratic contests on
March 7, topped by California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   For all practical purposes, McCain and Bradley, the handshake
twins who shook on campaign finance reform, will die in a New
Hampshire snowbank unless they win here. Bradley's poll numbers
have been slipping, and after the whipping he took in Iowa, as any
skier knows, the slip may turn into a slide.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has led here, not by much, in some recent polls, but his
fate is in the hands of New Hampshire's independents. These
notoriously fickle, late-deciding folks choose from the unenrolled
menu, headlined McCain in Column A and Bradley in Column B. Off the
Iowa results, who benefits? Probably McCain. He's a maverick in a
state that has rewarded mavericks. His true-blue patriotism and
compelling life story distinguish him. You could not ask any man to
do more for his country than the fighter pilot who stood tall as a
POW.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the advent of the modern primary system a half-century
back has Ye Olde Granite State been in position to exert such
leverage on choosing the next Leader of the Galaxy. Like so much in
politics, it wasn't really planned to work this way, it just sort
of happened accidentally, like most of history.
</P>
<P>
   Some things happened in Iowa that were _ let's be blunt _
screwy. More than half of all Iowa's voting Republicans cast their
presidential vote for men who had never been elected to any public
office, not even dogcatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes, and Gary Bauer, three men who never
won any shard of power from their fellow citizens, combined for 53
percent. Forbes, who got an eyebrow-raising 30 percent for his
megabucks investment, plowed millions into Iowa. Keyes, the single
biggest surprise at 14 percent, ran a Velveeta-and-saltine campaign
compared with Forbes's capitalist carpet-bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's 9 percent managed to eclipse the 5 percent of Senator
McCain, who merely staged a flyover for Iowa and hoarded his ammo,
TV money, and candidate time for the New Hampshire push. Because
this is the ballgame, for all intents and purposes. If McCain can't
beat George W. Bush (a not overly impressive 41 percent in Iowa)
here, then the Arizonan may as well raise the white flag. Same for
Bradley, who got hammered by nearly 2-1 in Iowa. If Dollar Bill
loses here next Tuesday, it's hard to construct any plausible
scenario by which he cops the Democratic nomination. So New
Hampshire looms as not only the gatekeeper to the primary season,
but the time-keeper, and the saloon-keeper as well, tossing out all
the revelers who are tapped out.
</P>
<P>
   All the brawnier states with piles more delegates who tried to
move up in the calendar to exert more influence have created a
delegate selection system that is so front-loaded as to be
extremely precarious. It's like a hay wagon piled 12 bales high,
swaying dreadfully around the corners and over the bumps.
</P>
<P>
   One rider who fell off in Iowa was Utah's Orrin Hatch (1
percent), the American Gothic senator out of the Grant Wood
sketchbook. Hatch, as it happens, has personally won more elections
over his career than Bush (twice elected governor), Forbes, Keyes,
and Bauer combined. Same for McCain. But Iowa's Republicans, a
self-selected and self-propelled slice of prairie conservativism,
hold senators in low regard.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Money Boys won in the Republican contest in Iowa. Bush
and Forbes can buy any political service or tool or rent-a-crowd
they need.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley outspent Gore substantially in Iowa, and has a smaller
edge here, but money is not the factor among Democrats as it is in
the other race.
</P>
<P>
   It's now up to New Hampshire to send a message against unlimited
money and the influence of multimillionaires on our politics. If
New Hampshire doesn't send that message, the way this cockeyed
system is constructed, no other state can.

 MTV TEAM HITS N.H. TO RALLY YOUNG VOTERS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HERMIONE MALONE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ ``To me, voting equals power and power equals
voice,'' said Julia Mejia. ``Voice equals change.''
</P>
<P>
   Mejia, 29, is one of six members of the MTV Street Team _ a new
addition to the station's Choose or Lose 2000 Campaign, which was
launched here Tuesday at New Hampshire College.
</P>
<P>
   One week away from the state's presidential primaries, the
emphasis in the crowded campus field house was involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the ability to make choices with the political
process, but the first choice is the choice to participate,'' said
Vice President Al Gore, whose daughter Karenna was scheduled to
speak for him. Borrowing a phrase from Ghandi, Gore said, ``You
must become the change you wish to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the hundreds of students who attended, despite an
early-morning snowstorm, were still undecided about whether to
choose or lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I'm not involved,'' said senior Sherri Evans, 21.
``I'm not even sure I'm going to vote. I might be a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   But a friend of Evans' was more optimistic. ``I'm more inclined
to listen,'' said Sarah Pumpel, 21, who added that no candidates
were speaking up on environmental issues, something important to
her. More young people don't participate in the political process
because they'd simply ``rather be watching MTV,'' Pumpel said.
</P>
<P>
   A greener planet is also a priority for Amy Livingstone, who
sported a ``Vote environmentalist'' T-shirt as part of the
nonprofit organization, Campus Green Vote. Livingstone, 24, wants
her peers to realize they can take a stand on issues, and make
their votes count.
</P>
<P>
   ``The candidates are going to be shocked to see how many young
people are going to be putting their ballots in the ballot box.
We're a huge voting bloc, and unfortunately, in the past, they have
ignored us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Campus Green Vote is part of a national coalition,
YouthVote2000, which targets young people to take their local
activism and translate it into votes this November. Deputy campaign
manager Ryan Friedrichs said with this ``Internet generation,''
there's no excuse why candidates can't reach out to young voters.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Dorchester High School and Mount Ida College,
Mejia never imagined she would be working as a reporter. In fact,
she turned away from the career in school. But she said,
``Peer-to-peer influence is the most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people feel really removed from the issues. They don't
see how health care impacts them . . . or Social Security,'' she
said. ``What we do is help young people see how the issues affect
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, say the folks from MTV, is the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our audience really listens when it's other young people
telling their stories,'' said Stephen Friedman of MTV. ``We've
talked to every major candidate. The fact that they're talking to
us means they care about the youth and the youth vote.''

SUPER BOWL BERTH CAPS MATTHEWS' CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The weather inside was frightful. The indisputable
evidence was the scarves, overcoats, and boots that adorned most of
the media and the select group of Tennessee Titans who gathered for
an interview session late Monday night in a tent that must have
been sponsored by Frigidaire. The Titans had braved 30-degree
temperatures along the walkway _ or gangplank _ from the team
hotel, and they were barely visible in the haze of the
breath-filled room. Despite their wardrobe armor, most of them sat
huddled in front of microphones, rubbing their hands, stomping
their feet, their chattering teeth serving as accompaniment to
their comments.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Matthews wore a shirt. Cotton. Top two buttons undone.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning back in his chair, arms folded in front of him, he was a
portrait of leisure. The Georgia weather may be better suited for
an Arctic expedition than the Super Bowl this week, but to
Matthews, this is paradise. And after 17 years in the desert, if he
wants to pretend he's at a tropical resort, nobody's going to blame
him.
</P>
<P>
   Sun and shorts are the traditional Super Bowl staples, but
Matthews wouldn't know that. To him, the game was a rumor. The
Titans' linchpin left guard, who has been selected to the Pro Bowl
for the 12th straight year, is destined to wind up with a bust in
the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and for almost two decades, it
appeared his career would be one, too, at least from a competitive
standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   But at age 38, he finally has broken the curse that afflicted
his family tree like a genetic defect. When the Titans beat the
Jacksonville Jaguars, 33-14, in Sunday's AFC Championship game,
Bruce became the first Matthews to qualify for the NFL final.
That's saying something, because his father, Clay Sr., toiled four
years with the San Francisco 49ers in the 1950s and his brother,
Clay Jr., labored 19 seasons with the Cleveland Browns and Atlanta
Falcons from the '70s to the '90s without a whiff of the grand
prize. That's 40 years of Matthews futility in all, and
numerologists may note that it matches the drought of the Titans
since they helped christen the AFL as the Houston Oilers in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   So, per order of coach Jeff Fisher, the Titans are enjoying this
experience to the fullest, and Matthews naturally is in the
vanguard here in Valhalla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mentioned having fun, and that's the way Bruce is,'' said
Fisher, who has a fairly good grasp of Matthews's psyche, having
been his teammate for one season, 1980, at the University of
Southern California. ``That's what he does best. And I guarantee
you he's in his room right now doing something competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Matthews was at that moment on the other side of the
ice curtain that separated coach from players, explaining how he
had just about abandoned hope of ever getting this deep into a
season. Though the Titans, then based in Houston, qualified for the
playoffs every year from 1987-93, they never made it as far as the
AFC Championship game. And since Matthews, who has played every
interior position with distinction since joining the Oilers in
1983, was in his prime back then, he figured that his plaque in
Canton, Ohio, probably would contain one glaring blank space.
Number of championships: 0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the end is a lot closer than it used to be,'' he said.
``I guess, more than anything, I had my doubts. I had resigned
myself to the feeling that I could have a successful career without
making the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   This was also a king-sized rationalization, he realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest part was seeing other guys making it,'' he said.
``It was OK if they were veterans, but it always irked me when
rookies made the Super Bowl. I'd kind of hardened myself to not
making it. But now, having gotten there, it's everything I thought
it would be. It's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, he proceeded back to the hotel and did just what
Fisher figured _ indulged in some competitive fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of Ping-Pong tables in the lounge,'' he
reported Tuesday during the annual Super Bowl Media Day cavalry
charge, which was held inside the temperate climes of the Georgia
Dome, where the Titans will face the NFC champion St. Louis Rams
Sunday. ``I played Kevin Long, took care of him. I split with Al
Del Greco this morning, so I'm looking forward to getting back to
the hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he was in no rush. Matthews is relishing every moment
of this week and counseling his colleagues, even those upstart
freshmen who stumbled to paydirt on their first try, to do
likewise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to understand that this may never happen again,''
he said, ``so they should enjoy the opportunity and make sure we're
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The deeply religious Matthews believes he owes his belated
success to divine intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good Lord has given me a body that can stand up to a
lot,'' he said. ``That's why I'm able to be here now. It's
humbling.''
</P>
<P>
   So was his reward two weeks ago after the Titans upset the
Indianapolis Colts, 19-16, in the AFC semifinals. In the locker
room, Fisher presented Matthews with a game ball, not so much for
his efforts that day but more as a lifetime achievement award.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Fisher may have felt he owed Matthews after their
college experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't talk to me much back then,'' said Matthews. ``He was
on the defensive side of the ball and he's three years older than
me. He had some good players around him in the secondary, guys like
Ronnie Lott and Joey Browner. I'm not saying he didn't have to
cover anybody, but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews can get away with such flippancy because there is such
mutual respect between the former Trojans. While Matthews
acknowledges that being coached by an old college teammate may be
unprecedented in the NFL, he considers it ``no big deal. I never
really think about it. It did seem strange when he became defensive
coordinator in Philadelphia and I played against him, but after he
got here, it didn't seem unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Except to his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of young guys,'' said Matthews, ``and they'll
be flipping through the media guide and say, `Whoa, you played with
Coach Fisher?' ''
</P>
<P>
   All right, so he's ancient, but at least he's not history. And
thankfully, the curse is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, one of the Matthews family is here,'' said the one
who got here, beaming. ``I'm glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   And thrilled that his season isn't.

SMALLISH LONDON FLETCHER STANDS TALL FOR RAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Half the football world now seems to be toting a
videocam over its shoulders, while the other half has a Super Bowl
XXXIV media credential hung from its neck, and so it was that both
halves Tuesday descended on London Fletcher just as the St. Louis
Ram was emoting about what it meant for John Carroll to play
Western Reserve in that high-powered world of Division 3 college
football in Northern Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a voice boomed from the floor of the Georgia Dome,
``Fletcher, are you going to be the `spy'? You going to be the
`spy'? I know you the man. I know you make the plays. I know you
make a thousand plays, but what's it going to be this Sunday?''
</P>
<P>
   The voice kept egging Fletcher, sitting on a Super Bowl podium,
while the videocam at the side of the voice kept rolling and
rolling, catching all the byplay. The credential hanging around the
neck of the voice identified the intruder as one ``Nate Newton'' of
that noted literary organization, the Dallas Cowboys. In his other
life, Newton is an outstanding offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the game plan just yet _ and I would never reveal
our game plan,'' Fletcher shouted back at the voice. ``Our
assistant coaches aren't even down here yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Newton's voice kept on: ``Aww, man, you don't know your job yet?
Aww, man, I know you've been looking at some film, right? You see
Eddie George on that film.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher, the Rams' so-quick middle linebacker, wouldn't bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done my job to prepare to win the football game,'' he
shouted, ducking the question of whether he's been watching the
Tennessee running back on film.
</P>
<P>
   But Newton wouldn't give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty times. Thirty times Eddie George is going to get the
ball. And how many times you be tackling Eddie George?''
</P>
<P>
   Not a blink, not an instant passed before Fletcher shot back,
``As many times as it need be to win a football game.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect reply. Interview closed. And London Fletcher, quite
clearly, is as quick on the draw as he is on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who tried to convince the world that he is 6 feet
tall but who really is a 16th of an inch on the downside of 5-9 _
and who will be the key Sunday night to slowing the Titans' attack.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Fletcher will be the ``spy'' on Tennessee quarterback
Steve McNair, as Newton and many others suspect, always watching
McNair and not letting him dash up the middle for huge gains on
busted plays. Or perhaps Fletcher will be doing what he does best,
meeting a back like George head-on and bringing him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd hear coaches and scouts say, `For a little guy he seems
to play pretty good,' '' said Rams coach Dick Vermeil a few podiums
away. ``Yeah. I'd like to know what the National Football League
says of his stature now.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Vermeil turned serious, saying this little guy who might
not fill half of what scouting combines decree are the physical
specifications of playing linebacker in the NFL is a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``London kept catching my eye in camp and then we'd put him on
special teams,'' Vermeil said, ``and it got so he dominated on
special teams. Then we started him the last game of the (1998)
season when Eric Hill was hurt and he played the position better
than it was played all year. Therefore, we didn't bring Eric Hill
back and Eric Hill had done a good job for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In that game, against the 49ers, Fletcher made 17 tackles. The
49ers' next game was against Green Bay in the playoffs and, Rams
vice president of personnel Charley Armey recalled, Packers GM Ron
Wolf ``called me up and kept asking me about Fletcher. He was
saying, `Who's this guy making all those tackles?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher finally won the job, said Vermeil, citing the most
basic criterion for any defensive player, ``because he always got
to where he had to get . . .''
</P>
<P>
   And Vermeil then waited before adding the two-word punch line,
``. . . very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   All defenders eventually get to where the ball is (or was), some
at glacial speed, some at good speed, but Fletcher would arrive at
warp speed, ``and he always seemed to make the big play,'' said the
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Armey was asked whether he is prouder of rescuing quarterback
Kurt Warner from obscurity or finding an undersized linebacker at
John Carroll, a small Jesuit school in Cleveland that plays
small-time football, and Armey's reply was direct: ``I'm proudest
of finding London Fletcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher's personal story of finding his way out of life's
depths is intrepid enough. His mother is a drug addict and his
18-year-old sister was raped and murdered when he was 12. Fletcher
was an athlete, a good enough basketball player to win a
scholarship to St. Francis College of Pennsylvania, as a _ get this
_ point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could shoot, I could pass, whatever the game called for,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard in college, a devastating middle linebacker in the
NFL. Those are two roles that few men ever have combined.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher transferred from St. Francis to John Carroll, not far
from his home, because of its academic reputation and because two
of his former high school coaches were on the staff there.
</P>
<P>
   In time, he made the football team, once recording the amazing
total of 29 tackles against Northern Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I began thinking I might be able to play in the NFL,''
said Fletcher. If anyone noticed, that was.
</P>
<P>
   Armey noticed, and Fletcher arrived in his first Rams camp with
$16 in his pocket. On his second day of camp, ``I got into a fight
with another guy on the field.'' Just to be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   And London Fletcher has been noticed ever since.
</P>
<P>
   As he will be noticed Sunday, whether ``spying'' on Steve McNair
or tackling Eddie George. But come Monday, he promised, he will be
the same no matter who wins Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different between me and my mother,'' said Fletcher.
``I'm just playing a game. If I play a game and I lose, there's
always another game I can play and win. My mother's in a battle. If
she loses, it's over.''

KEN HEEBNER AWAITS A TECHNO-BUBBLE BURST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, they were revered as three investment giants,
familiar on any downtown Boston street, whose wisdom had stood the
test of time and made piles of money for their customers.
</P>
<P>
   But none of them was ready for the roaring high-tech stock
market, and their stellar records, stretching over decades, were
smudged by disappointment over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Fund manager George Vanderheiden called it quits this month
after 29 years at Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Clough, chief market strategist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., a
man with deep Boston roots, retired last week after a dozen years
in his post.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Ken Heebner, down like Vanderheiden and Clough over
the last two years, but with no plans to go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at my performance in 1998 and '99, it's a lot less
competitive _ to put in mildly,'' he said. Heebner has been known
for his dramatic investment highs and lows over the last 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortuantely, Heebner is putting it mildly.
</P>
<P>
   But like Vanderheiden and Clough, he makes no apologies for
investing conservatively while technology stocks and even the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index zoomed past them. Perhaps more
painfully, scores of other mutual fund managers have left them in
the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Heebner's central point: We're in a ``titanic'' investment
bubble, and if a manager was lucky enough to make money with go-go
stocks, he should get out now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they sell today and do something else with the money, they
did a much better job than I did,'' he said. ``If they ride them
back down, we'll see. I'm not going to accept the judgment of
history right now for just a two-year period.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Heebner has had many fabulous investment periods
during his career, and he beat the S&AMP;P 500 for six out of seven
years in a key mutual fund before his current slump.
</P>
<P>
   Heebner manages about $8 billion in many different funds and
accounts, but look at the performance of two for a representative
picture of how he has done: his flagship CGM Capital Development
fund and his more concentrated CGM Focus Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Focus earned just 3.5 percent in 1998, trailing the S&AMP;P 500 by
more than 25 percentage points. It returned 8.5 percent last year,
trailing the index by a wide margin again.
</P>
<P>
   Capital Development performed only slightly better, gaining 10.3
percent in 1998 and 7.7 percent last year. The fund, which is
closed to new investors, earned a healthier 22.3 percent in 1997,
but still trailed the benchmark index by more than 11 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund customers have noticed. Among the $2.6 billion
managed in funds under the CGM banner, fully 27 cents of every
dollar walked out the door between the start of 1998 and last
November, according to Financial Research Corp. of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   That is money customers pulled out of their accounts and put to
work elsewhere. The total of assets managed under the CGM mutual
fund banner stood at $1.9 billion in November, according to
Financial Research.
</P>
<P>
   Heebner did not dispute the figures, but said he didn't know if
a 27 percent redemption rate over the same period would be a good
estimate for his total money under management.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Heebner never bought a technology stock, but they
have been few and far between in the CGM portfolio. The reason: He
is more conservative than usual in measuring risk and reward,
fearing that new tech companies can steal away market share with a
better silicon mousetrap.
</P>
<P>
   He is actually upbeat on the semiconductor industry and laments
that there are a few others that got away. ``Maybe I should have
owned Microsoft,'' he concedes.
</P>
<P>
   But what about today's stars with glitzy three-digit stock
price-to-earnings ratios and huge market values? Cisco Systems
Inc.? EMC Corp.? Oracle Corp.? Sun Microsystems Inc.?
</P>
<P>
   Fuggedaboudit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these multiples and this tech sector represent the
most grotesquely exaggerated speculation I've seen in my career,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heebner's complaint, in part, is that all those big stars feed
off dot-com mania. When those IPOs and venture-funded Web companies
can no longer issue more stock to pay for equipment, the Ciscos of
the world will suffer. He think it's not too far off.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with holding on to all those bargain stocks is that
a fund manager's job is to make money for his customers and keep up
with the market over time, not own a portfolio of undiscovered
gems. In a financial world dominated by momentum investing, don't
you get at least a foot on the train with everyone else?
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly true for an investor like Heebner, who is
famous for criss-crossing the market, looking anywhere for
opportunity and being critical of ``style'' straightjackets imposed
on money managers at many funds. He would probably say there's a
differerence between discipline and style.
</P>
<P>
   Heebner sighs. ``I would have had to anticipate the massive
speculation that poured into these stocks,'' he said. ``There was
nothing in history that said they were going to 100 or 200 times
earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Heebner sounds mostly like a value investor crowing over
stocks he bought for a song. He still promotes the virtues of real
estate investment trusts, an investment category that has gone
nowhere in the last few years, despite Heebner's aggressive
cheerleading.
</P>
<P>
   Heebner is buying some international stocks. He sees Asia, Latin
America, and other parts of the world building up economic steam
while interest rates rise in America.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no escaping the big hole Heebner's dug for himself.
He's firm about what he isn't going to do to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not going to overpay for growth or take excessive
risks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several years from now, people will look at this as a period
when valuations and investor behavior were totally unrepresentative
of the long term. The hero will be the person who was smart enough
to buy (technology stocks) two years ago and sell now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   As they prepare to air Super Bowl ads for a company that didn't
exist a year ago and until recently operated out of a garage,
Computer.com cofounders Mike Zapolin and Mike Ford describe their
start-up as ``a technology site for your mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Computer.com is a retail Web site that will offer
personal computers, software, and tech support to computer novices.
Plans call for the site to launch on Super Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our demographic is not the Super Bowl fan,'' Zapolin admits.
``We're about seniors, soccer moms, and kids.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is Computer.com spending more than half its seed money on
$3 million worth of Super Bowl advertising?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other time of the year that people actually look
forward to watching ads,'' says Zapolin, 33.
</P>
<P>
   Zapolin isn't alone in his thinking. More than a dozen Super
Bowl advertisers this year may be dot-com companies.
</P>
<P>
   Computer.com plans to air two ads during the pregame show and
another during the game. Like most of his dot-com brethren, Zapolin
won't talk about the content of the ads. He doesn't want to spoil
their surprise effect.
</P>
<P>
   One of Computer.com's investors is Jeff Taylor, chief executive
of Monster.com, an on-line job search network also located in
Maynard, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com may have set the standard for dot-com advertising on
last year's Super Bowl. Its ad, created by the Mullen advertising
agency of Wenham, drew high praise. The tongue-and-cheek ad that
showed children talking about their career aspirations generated an
instant response, shattering records for job searches at the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people turned off the game and went to our Web site,''
Taylor says. ``Couch potatoes became mouse potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Zapolin hopes the same thing happens to Computer.com.
</P>
<P>
   By his reckoning, Computer.com has an advantage over many
dot-coms that will air ads on Super Sunday _ an easy-to-remember
and self-explanatory name and phone number, 1-800-COMPUTER.
</P>
<P>
   Some other dot-coms will have to ``explain what they are,''
while Computer.com can focus on its marketing message, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Created by ad agency Merkley Newman Harty of New York,
Computer.com's ads are about more than just driving traffic to its
Web site; they're also about impressing Internet peers, luring
talent, and preparing potential investors for a possible initial
offering of Computer.com's shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   A Super Bowl ad for a dot-com can launch a Web site, grow a
company's stock valuation, ``bring in a key strategic partner, or
set yourself up for a long-term IPO,'' Zapolin says.
</P>
<P>
   As expensive as the ads are, they could be worth it. Ads could
save Zapolin from ``a year of road shows,'' he says, alluding to
the process many start-ups go through to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   The ads could have cost more, but Zapolin persuaded the ad
agency to accept some compensation in the form of Computer.com
stock options rather than entirely in cash.
</P>
<P>
   If Zapolin's goal of launching an unknown dot-com on the Super
Bowl sounds like a long shot, check out his resume.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he helped expand a Web site called Beer.com for beer
hobbyists. Four months later, the site was sold to Interbrew, maker
of such brands as Rolling Rock, for more than $7 million. The
claimed return on investment: 8,700 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because many Super Bowl games turn out to have lopsided action
on the field, some traditional advertisers balk at buying time in
the fourth quarter. Zapolin says he's not worried by the
possibility of 50 million fans switching off the game before
Computer.com's last ad airs.
</P>
<P>
   Says Zapolin: ``Even under a worst-case scenario, 90 million
people will hear about us.''

UNIONS FLEX NEW MUSCLES AS OVERSEAS TIES GROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Sam Weinstein learned of a pending merger between New
England Electric System &UR;  &LR; in Westborough, Mass. and a British
company, the 51-year-old union representative was eager to meet
with his counterparts overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein, a senior aide at the 50,000-member Utility Workers
Union of America, was seeking a three-year contract with NEES that
would be binding even after it merged with National Grid Inc. of
London.
</P>
<P>
   Two other unions had similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
   NEES assured the unions there would be no layoffs, but
Weinstein's union wanted to organize all subsidiaries and new
acquisitions worldwide, without corporate interference.
</P>
<P>
   The company balked. Why give the union carte blanche?
</P>
<P>
   But with support from four British unions, US utility workers
secured a contract with NEES that gave them the right to use card
checks to organize customer service, technical, and field workers
in the United States. And the company said it would remain neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the new world of union muscle.
</P>
<P>
   With the boom in corporate mergers and global operations, US
unions _ many of them at utility and telecommunications companies _
are joining with their counterparts at home and abroad to build the
size and strength they need to take on these new, larger
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things are happening,'' said Nelson Lichtenstein, a
professor of history at the University of Virginia and author of
``Walter Reuther: The Most Dangerous Man in Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First, the interconnections in telecommunications are so
intimate and far-reaching that the utility and telephone unions
have had to try and reinvent themselves, because everything is
changing so rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are finding that they are going to have to become
international, and they must connect with other European unions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly,'' he said, ``the labor movement is reaching out to
workers and labor groups in underdeveloped countries in new ways,
and this _ as we saw with the World Trade Organization
demonstrations in Seattle _ has become a real political issue.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, European and North American unions are not strangers
to one another. In the late 1800s, a coalition of trade unions
brought labor leaders on both continents together for the first
time. And US steel and auto unions have longstanding relationships
with labor abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that union cooperation is increasing, and
it is increasing out of necessity,'' said Kenneth Zinn, North
American director of the International Federation of Chemical,
Energy, Mine and General Workers' Unions (ICEM), an international
coalition of 450 labor groups.
</P>
<P>
   Zinn acknowledged, however, that with a few notable exceptions,
labor's desire for more international cooperation has not led to
many cross-border agreements. Nevertheless, changes are afoot:
</P>
<P>
   --Last week, US workers at Imerys, a multinational ceramics and
construction materials corporation headquartered in Paris, joined
with Belgian unions and ICEM to launch an international organizing
campaign at the company's subsidiaries. In the United States, the
Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers union is
trying to organize Imerys' plants in Georgia and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   --Last May in California, in a move that clearly suggested
greater cooperation with foreign unions, the 22,000-member Service
Employees International Union, Local 1877, formalized a partnership
with Mexico's Telephone Workers Union. Both unions represent
janitors and other service employees.
</P>
<P>
   --In 1999, the Oil, Chemical &AMP; Atomic Workers signed a
three-year pact with DSM Polymer in Virginia after the company's
Netherlands parent, DSM, declined to bargain. DSM changed its mind
after the workers contacted the Dutch union, FNV Bondgenoten.
Together, the labor groups persuaded the company to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   --Two years ago, the ICEM convened a meeting in Washington,
D.C., with the leaders of 350,000 utility union workers from
Britain and the United States. The goal: to explore new ways to
collaborate.
</P>
<P>
   British unionists discussed privatization in the electric
utility industry and its impact on job security and future
bargaining. During the race to privatize, they said, several
British electric companies had been purchased by US firms. For US
labor leaders, the central concern was deregulation's impact on
union workers and organizing.
</P>
<P>
   The ICEM has since developed a Web site, www.icem.org, which
lists a network of unions at multinational corporations and
provides union news from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein, of the US utility union, believes that securing the
help of the British unions helped allay layoff fears among New
England Electric System's rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meetings with the British unions were critical,'' he said.
``They took our side, and that had a huge impact. It made it clear
that the company would get no agreements from any of its unions
(during the merger) unless the unions got something, too.'' The
story doesn't end there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last September, after British trade union leaders asked NEES
and National Grid to consider forming an international joint
labor-management council, we met again,'' said Bill Dowd, chief
labor spokesman for NEES. ``We rapidly reached agreement on how the
council will work.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Dowd, National Grid, which had a longstanding
relationship with unions, was instrumental in getting the US
unions, NEES, and National Grid's executives together.
</P>
<P>
   At Narragansett Electric in Providence, R.I., a NEES subsidiary,
Laurie Stenovitch wasn't sure what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard we would be under new, British ownership, I was a
little nervous,'' said the 32-year-old technician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `What are they going to do with us?' Now I honestly
don't think there will be layoffs, because we are too
understaffed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stenovitch, with the company 13 years, said she was heartened by
the fact National Grid regularly negotiates with unions and by the
meetings between the British and US utility and electrical unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will keep us all on the same page,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, future efforts won't mean much unless the US labor
movement is able to hammer out cross-border agreements, such as the
1998 pact between ICEM unions and Statoil, a Norwegian corporation.
Statoil agreed it and its 22 subsidiaries would respect the rights
of workers to organize. The company also said it would maintain
occupational safety and environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, unions are still struggling to hold
the line on declining membership and have been slow to respond to
economic shifts. And they have had difficulty overcoming national
and geographic barriers _ factors that could hurt their attempts to
extend and strengthen international ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, the cold war was being played out among labor
unions here and abroad,'' said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of
labor education and research at Cornell University. ``Then, the
realization emerged that multinationals could be vulnerable, but
only if unions found the right leverage point. Many unions are now
beginning to see that that leverage point is collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the furious pace of mergers, consolidations, and
restructurings in the telecommunications industry, the
Communications Workers of America began reaching out to foreign
labor leaders in the 1980s. In recent years, it has developed ties
with the Mexican Telephone Workers union, the Communications
Workers Union in Britain, and with labor groups worldwide with
links to such companies as Nortel and Ameritech.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Early, a CWA representative in Boston, said there will be
more international union partnerships in the future. But the
strength of those collaborations, he said, will depend largely on
US labor's ability to organize workers on the grass-roots level in
a ``worker-to-worker, action-oriented effort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Progress is being made, but too often it is too little, too
late,'' he said. ``US unions are still taking baby steps, but the
consciousness within the labor movement is changing. Labor now
understands that nowadays, you cannot win a union battle without
international cooperation or cross-border bargaining.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ When Barbara Wallraff was in college, she
wanted to be an architect. ``What I pictured,'' she explains, ``was
sitting quietly in a room, holding a blue pencil, working to
perfect something.'' She got her wish _ only the something she
perfects is made of words rather than mortar and brick.
</P>
<P>
   As a senior editor at The Atlantic Monthly and proprietor of its
popular ``Word Court'' column, Wallraff is a scrupulous yet
undogmatic arbiter of correct usage and grammar. Such is her
editorial reputation that National Public Radio asked her to
copy-edit the Constitution on the occasion of its bicentennial
(don't you go make the mistake of referring to ``a more perfect
union'').
</P>
<P>
   Her e-mail address is MsGrammar(at)theatlantic.com, which is as
it should be. Every word that goes into the magazine she reads at
least once, and often twice, vetting each sentence for clarity and
grace as well as grammar and usage. It may sound like the most
prosaic of jobs, but far from it. As poetry editor Peter Davison
notes, ``Sometimes she queries the grammar in a poem.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallraff has been writing ``Word Court'' since 1995. A book of
the same name, based on the column, has just been published. In
both, she addresses questions posed by readers on everything from A
(a, an before h-words) to Z (zeds, zeros).
</P>
<P>
   The column is ``a marvel,'' says Jack Miles, an Atlantic
contributing editor and the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ``God:
A Biography.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think her judgment is flawless. I never disagree with her.
The combination of exactitude and fine distinctions with such
common sense about language is what makes her such a good judge.
She's, well, judicious.''
</P>
<P>
   That second syllable in ``Word Court'' notwithstanding, Wallraff
does not see herself in juridical terms. ``The simple truth is I
can't promulgate laws,'' she says. ``I don't mind telling people
what to do _ but what I want to tell them isn't `What I think is .
. .' but `Consensus and precedent show that good writers write this
way, and people who don't know what they're doing write the other
way.' I'm conveying information. It's not really an opinion in that
case, is it, just fact.''
</P>
<P>
   It's characteristic that Wallraff would interpolate ``is it'' in
the previous sentence, turning assertion into something more
collaborative. Instead of thundering from on high, she demonstrates
from alongside: quick to cite chapter and verse on why she thinks
what she does, but slow to generalize and dismiss out of hand. Not
for nothing does she take the epigraph for her book from St.
Matthew, ``Judge not, that ye be not judged.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helps that she possesses a talent for verbal comedy
(Wallraff admits to there being ``a Rocky-and-Bullwinkle level to
my humor'') and an awareness that one person's correctness is
another person's fussiness. She's been known to cite the authority
of not just H. W. Fowler (author of ``Modern English Usage'') but
also Elvis Presley (whose ``Can't Help Falling in Love'' Wallraff
salutes for avoiding the redundancy ``cannot help but'').
</P>
<P>
   She long ago made her peace with the fact that, as she puts it
in her book, ``Standard American English is a great, messy deluge
of words.'' She concedes, for example, that jargon has its place,
even if that place is usually the laboratory or workshop. But she
still lets out a growl when a restaurant calls itself a ``grille''
(unless there's a ``ye olde'' in front of it, the word should be
``grill'').
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think of myself as a centrist,'' Wallraff says,
when asked to place herself on the language spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you see (at the magazine's offices) is a wall
of Atlantics dating back to 1857. To pull down one of those issues
from 130 years ago and to understand what was on the mind of that
person, and in pretty good detail, that indicates there's a lot to
be said in favor of the language not changing very fast. But new
coinages are fun. New words are fun. Fashions and trends in
language are just as much fun as fashions and trends in anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallraff, 46, lives in Brookline with her husband, Julian
Fisher, a high-tech entrepreneur, and their two Maine coon cats,
Augusta and Kittery (``who are very sweet,'' she points out).
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Tucson, Wallraff comes by her word awareness
naturally. Her father was a professor of philosophy at the
University of Arizona _ ``He was pretty finicky about language,''
his daughter says _ and her mother was a microbiologist.
</P>
<P>
   Wallraff came east, partway, to attend Antioch College, then all
the way, to work for a Harvard Square architectural firm.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture, according to Goethe, is ``frozen music.'' What
Wallraff saw was neither cool nor harmonic _ ``schmoozing and
backslapping and taking people out to lunch,'' she recalls. She
switched to managing a graphic design office and began doing
freelance writing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, she started copy editing at The Boston Phoenix and
writing its ``Urban Eye'' column. She eventually became the
weekly's lifestyles editor.
</P>
<P>
   She joined the Atlantic in 1983. It would seem to have been a
marriage made in magazine heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy going through people's prose,'' Wallraff says, ``and,
if there's something wrong, finding what is the exactly right way
to fix it. It's like doing crossword puzzles for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather was an art restorer. An art restorer is not
supposed to have a style but to know how to fit his brush strokes
into whatever's been done so it's completely invisible. I was so
happy one time when a writer took me to task for using a certain
word _ `I wouldn't use that word,' he said _ and I was able to tell
him, `That's your word.' He couldn't tell the fixes from what he
himself had done. So there's a lot of pleasure in just helping
people say exactly what they mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the language, Wallraff's views on usage have evolved over
time. If anything, the attitude toward usage of Word Court's
presiding judge owes as much to medicine as the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out as a real hardass,'' she says. ``If there was a
complicated exception to a rule, or some little idiom that I wasn't
completely familiar with, I'd try to make the writer not write it
that way. And as I've seen more and more and more prose over the
years, it's a pretty steady thing: Well, I don't quite know what
the rule is, but I can't make it any better, so I'm just going to
leave it alone. It isn't that I relaxed, but I've learned that
there are a lot of things about language that it's very hard to
define and explain according to some rule you can read in a book.
You kind of want to be like a physician, `Do no harm.' ''

WICKED GIANT ROBOT; ONE MORE LIST (BUT WORTH IT) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You have to like _ no, love _ a magazine of Asian pop culture
that calls itself Giant Robot and teases on its cover a trio of
unrelated stories with the single line, ``Eat Dogs, Eat Bugs and Be
Lactose Intolerant.'' Such is the refreshing irreverence of this
Los Angeles quarterly, which deserves to move from an underground
thrill into a mainstream darling. It's whip-smart and wickedly
entertaining _ an anti-tribute to late golfer Payne Stewart is
spiteful, mean, and laugh-out-loud funny. Besides, where else can
you find ratings for 31 brands of Ramen noodles, a celebration of
Rudy Ray Moore's blaxploitation king Dolemite, and an examination
of a Korean culinary tradition that gives new meaning to doggy
style?
</P>
<P>
   With such offerings, cover girl Margaret Cho is almost
overshadowed. Oddly, given the magazine's offbeat sense of humor,
publisher Eric Nakamura's Q&AMP;A with Cho, a comedian, seems rather
subdued. But that could be because most of the conversation centers
on Cho's failed TV show and her near-death experiences with drugs
and drink. In 1994, Cho became the first Asian-American to star in
her own television comedy, ``All-American Girl,'' on ABC. But the
show, undone by lousy writing and endless tinkering was, according
to Nakamura, ``shot down like a Korean jet in Russian airspace.''
To make matters worse, Asian-Americans denounced the show for
reinforcing stereotypes, and network execs pressured Cho to lose
weight, in an attempt to ``look a little bit white.''
</P>
<P>
   A sudden weight loss landed her in the hospital, and the show's
failure pushed Cho toward alcohol and drugs. She dropped out of the
spotlight and focused all her energy ``on being this kind of
gorgeous disaster,'' until several overdoses later she realized
things were ``just disgusting.'' Since getting clean, Cho turned
her tribulations into an acclaimed one-woman show, ``I'm the One
That I Want.''

   What, another list? We spent all of 1999 up to our armpits in
endless lists clocking the best whatever of the year, decade, and
century, and Vibe has the audacity to come up with another one? OK,
now that that's out of my system, the list of 20 classic love songs
assembled by Michael A. Gonzales and Amy Linden is not only fun,
but informative. Wisely opting against numerical rankings, the
songs are instead introduced alphabetically. And the list is as
much concerned with the songs themselves as the artists who made
them famous. Van Morrison's ``Crazy Love'' is called ``the perfect
anthem for midnight pillow talkers,'' and one learns the song has
been covered by everyone from Bryan Ferry to Maxi Priest. For each
song, there's a mini-list of notable renditions, which range from
the familiar _ Chet Baker's classic version of ``My Funny
Valentine'' _ to others best forgotten _ such as Michael Bolton's
howlfest masquerading as ``When a Man Loves a Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue, there's a solid, if too brief, piece on the
first lady of Ruff Ryders, Eve, the 21-year-old platinum blond
bombshell whose debut album entered the charts at No. 1 last year.
Says writer Greg Tate, Eve's success thrives in the space between
``Lauryn Hill's House of Afrocentric Spirits and Lil' Kim's Rough
Sex Shoppe.'' For her part, Eve _ former stripper and practicing
Muslim _ doesn't view her rhyme as the end of the road, but as a
means to an end. ``I'm not going to be doing this for the rest of
my life _ rapping, spitting bars _ I'm not. She says. I see a lot
of properties, a lot of investments. I see me as a businesswoman _
maybe in music, maybe not.''

   For the first two decades of the 20th century, the Greenwood
section of Tulsa thrived as one of the nation's richest
predominantly African-American neighborhoods, which earned the area
the moniker ``Black Wall Street.'' But in June 1921, Greenwood
became the site of one of the most devastating race riots in
American history. More than 300 people, most of them black, were
killed, and 30 to 40 blocks of Greenwood were burned to the ground.
As vividly recalled in Emerge, the riots began when a 19-year-old
black youth was charged with assaulting a 17-year-old white girl.
But as told by Gina Henderson and Marlene L. Johnson, the tensions
between Tulsa's white and black communities had simmered for years.
Oklahoma was home to some of the nation's toughest Jim Crow laws,
and in Tulsa, lynchings and ``whipping parties'' terrorized the
black populace.
</P>
<P>
   Yet segregation had helped build Greenwood since it was the only
place where blacks could spend their money. By 1921, the
neighborhood percolated with businesses, newspapers, theaters, and
hotels _ and whites greatly resented this prosperity. Aided by law
enforcement and the National Guard, the white rioters broke the
back of Greenwood's black community, and only in recent years have
historians begun discussing the event. Last year, the state's race
riot commission recommended reparations for each family survivor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had the Oklahoma City bombing, it angered me that
everyone called it the biggest urban disaster of all time,'' says
state Representative Don Ross, who helped create the race riot
commission. ``As bad as it was, I made a case that the riot was
worse. The Tulsa riot was ethnic cleaning before Bosnia.''

 HA JIN FINDS THAT `WAITING' IS A THEME THESE DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 888-346-9867 or (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days Ha Jin, winner of the National Book Award for the
novel ``Waiting,'' finds himself in pause mode, confronting a
literary crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   While the China of his youth still yields writing material, it
is a land he describes as increasingly ``unfamiliar and distant.''
What he sees clearly is that the experience of present-day
immigrants is slowly emerging as the new terrain for his fiction.
After he completes a second novel set in China, ``immigrant life
will become my subject matter, but it will take a long time,'' he
mused. ``I must do it step by step.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 43, Ha Jin came to the United States as a graduate student
at Brandeis University in 1985. He has not returned since, and the
intervening years have witnessed several rounds of cultural and
political liberalization in China _ alternating with rounds of
cultural and political repression.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston recently week for readings, he noted that even the
China of his memory _ the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, his
service in the People's Liberation Army, the China that provided
the background for ``Waiting'' _ now evokes ``things that my heart
is not attached to.''
</P>
<P>
   With that loosening connection has come a sense of dislocation,
shared with other Chinese who are unlikely to return. ``They have
alienated themselves from their homeland,'' he said, ``and it is a
question of whether you become part of the new community.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience of Chinese immigrants today, he observed, is
closer to the immigrant experience of a century ago. Because of
political turmoil and the long ocean voyage, there was little
likelihood then that immigrants would return to their homelands.
Now, many Chinese are not able to go home, said Ha Jin, ``either
because they are here illegally or because it would be politically
unwise to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   He can no longer be considered ``a Chinese writer'' because, he
said, ``when you leave, you leave. You can't go back.''
</P>
<P>
   The biography of Ha Jin, who grew up in northeastern China, is
not dissimilar from that of other educated _ and relatively
privileged _ Chinese who have come to the United States since the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, he served in the People's Liberation Army. Since
colleges were closed because of the Cultural Revolution, he worked
as a telegrapher on the railroads and took a beginner's course in
English. He finally made it to college in 1977 and was ``assigned''
_ as was the case well into the early 1990s _ to study English.
</P>
<P>
   When he won a rare opportunity to come to the States he studied
English literature at Brandeis _ receiving a PhD in 1993 _ and then
at Boston University. He is now an associate professor of English
at Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Lisha Bian, and son, Wen _ now 16 and, Ha Jin says,
``completely American'' _ were allowed to join him in 1987. All
three have become U.S. citizens and live in a suburb of Atlanta. Ha
Jin's parents and siblings remain in China.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, he made compromises. A first step was adopting Ha Jin
as a pen name. ``My name was Jin Xuefei, but I realized that `x'
words like `xue' are impossible for Americans to pronounce. So I
adopted Ha Jin when my first poem was published at Brandeis.''
</P>
<P>
   More important was his realization in 1990 ``that I couldn't
return. I stopped working at odd jobs'' _ among others, working as
a night watchman and busing tables at an Italian restaurant. ``It
did not make sense to work at low-paying part-time jobs, so I
finished my degree and started to write. I had to have a decent job
and become an American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiting'' is his first full-length novel. Set in rural China
in the 1960s, it involves a doctor, forced into an arranged
marriage with an illiterate peasant woman 20 years earlier. As the
book opens, he is returning to her village as he does every summer
in an attempt to get her to agree to a divorce _ so he can marry a
nurse at the hospital where he works.
</P>
<P>
   His previous work includes two collections of poetry; ``Ocean of
Words,'' a collection of short stories that won the PEN/Hemingway
Award for first fiction in 1997; and a second collection, ``Under
the Red Flag,'' which won the Flannery O'Connor Award for short
fiction in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Several books are now paused in various stages of writing. One
uses the 1989 demonstrations in Tiananmen Square as a setting _
though he acknowledged he only knows of them secondhand. The
problem, he admitted, will be ``how to bring out the
complexities.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ha Jin will not be joining the ranks of expatriate Chinese
who have written memoirs about growing up in China during the
Cultural Revolution. ``There are so many,'' he said, ``but maybe
the market is now saturated. I was approached a few times, but I
don't think I can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tiananmen Square novel could well be the last book he sets
in China. ``Immigrant life is now closer to me, but there are so
many varieties of that experience,'' said Ha Jin. ``So it is very
rich, but very challenging. There are all kinds, so how can we
understand the truth of the experience?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been very, very fortunate. I'm a kind of an oddball. My
own story is not about the immigrant experience. But I would not
write stories about success,'' he said, ``only about failure,
because that is closer to the truth. Uprooting from one land and
moving to another is a painful, tragic experience.''

NET FIRMS BETTING ON SUPER BOWL ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember Coke, Nike, and pork, the other white meat? In years
past, those products often turned up in Super Bowl ads, along with
the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile and bulletproof Master Locks.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for such products this year. Sneakers, lunch
meats, locks _ they're so old economy. When an estimated 140
million viewers tune in to Super Bowl XXXIV on ABC next Sunday,
what they'll see are ads for many dot-com companies that the
average football fan has never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen of the roughly 36 businesses expected to
advertise on the game have a dot-com connection, up from three in
1999 and one in 1998. Hoping to impress Wall Street as well as
fans, advertisers with names such as Pets.com, Lifeminders.com, and
Ourbeginning.com will pony up at least $2.2 million for each
30-second slot on next Sunday's football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, it's going to be the dot-com bowl,'' says Jeff
Taylor, chief executive of Monster.com of Maynard, Mass., whose
advertising success in last year's game has inspired a host of
other dot-coms to attempt something similar. ``For dot-coms, this
is a chance to rally together around the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   For some dot-coms, the Super Bowl may also be a last chance.
Often desperate to stand out from a crowd of look-alike rivals,
they're blowing much of their venture-capital money on glitzy ads,
much as dot-com retailers did just before the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that Internet start-ups have only a
narrow window of opportunity for creating a new dot-com brand. Miss
that window, and a dot-com's money could dry up. Miss that window,
and a dot-com could be history.
</P>
<P>
   Still, traditional marketing gurus mar- vel at the likes of
Computer.com, a Maynard company that has yet to sell a single
product, let alone turn a profit. A Web site that wants to be an
on-line computer store for computer novices, Computer.com plans to
gamble half its seed money on $3 million worth of go-for-broke
advertising on Super Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Keep something in mind. A dot-com ad isn't targeted just at a
fan watching the game with his pals. These Super Bowl ads are also
aimed at Wall Street. They're aimed at a dot-com company's own
employees. The subliminal message? ``Hey, if we're advertising on
the Super Bowl with Budweiser and Pepsi, we must be big league and
for real.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the fan eating a burrito that the dot-coms are
trying to reach,'' says Sue Parenio, an associate professor at
Boston University who teaches courses on advertising. ``They're
aiming at Wall Street investors. They're trying to drive up their
stock price or attract a buyer for their company.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar appraisal is offered by Skip Pile of Pile and Co., a
Boston firm that helps companies hire ad agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Super Bowl ad can legitimize a brand among multiple
constituencies _ the company's employees, the venture capitalists,
the investment community and, lastly, the target audience of
football fans,'' Pile says.
</P>
<P>
   Not all dot-coms are no-name outfits yearning for legitimacy.
Arnold Communications of Boston, for example, is creating an ad for
the interactive edition of The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   For ABC, the dot-com frenzy has been a blessing. Traditional
advertisers sometimes balk at buying ads for a game that will pit
two small-market teams against each other.
</P>
<P>
   But dot-coms don't seem to mind that this year's tilt could
feature matchups of rarely heard-from teams. So intense is the
dot-com lust for the big time that the average cost for 30 seconds
of Super Bowl air time has risen 38 percent from 1999's $1.6
million, according to Advertising Age.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's always the possibility that an ad will hit
pay dirt, as did the ad that Mullen of Wenham created last year for
Monster.com, an on-line job search service.
</P>
<P>
   While other ads were full of glitz and special effects, the
Monster.com ad showed understated black-and-white footage of
children talking about their career aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I grow up, I want to file all day,'' says one child. ``I
want to claw my way up to middle management,'' says another. ``I
want to have a brown nose,'' says a third.
</P>
<P>
   The Monster.com ad broke through the clutter because it was
``simple and unexpected,'' says Bob Hoffman, head of the creative
department at Boston ad agency Gearon Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   The ad wasn't merely an artistic success. In the 24-hour period
that followed the ad's airing, the number of job searches made at
Monster.com's Web site smashed previous records, and the company
hopes to repeat its success on this year's game.
</P>
<P>
   At Super Bowl XXXIV, the challenge for dot-coms may be tougher.
In 1999, dot-com ads were something of a novelty. This year, the
game will be wall-to-wall with them.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you look at it, advertising on the Super Bowl is a
dicey proposition, even for a traditional company. The games are
often blowouts, which means that millions of viewers can turn off
their TV sets before the second half starts. And few ads make
lasting impressions with viewers.
</P>
<P>
   While a Super Bowl ad ``gets instant recognition, I wonder about
staying power,'' says Kathy Kiely, general manager of Deutsch
Boston. Fans ``can forget about the ad as quickly as they forget
about the score of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the high expectations. With national newspapers
such as The New York Times and USA Today ranking the ads, the Super
Bowl can make or break careers.
</P>
<P>
   When Lance Jensen worked at Arnold on Volkswagen's award-winning
``Drivers Wanted'' campaign, VW toyed with buying Super Bowl air
time but decided against it. The expectations for making an impact
had gotten so high that advertising on the Super Bowl can be a
no-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no way you can beat the hype,'' says Jensen, who
recently left Arnold to open his own agency, Modernista. Super Bowl
ads can be ``a letdown, like a Y2K party. It's never going to be as
good as you want it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the downsides. The upside is that the game is the
closest thing to a shared cultural experience in an America that
seems to be fragmenting into smaller niches and markets.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the game's audience huge, but many viewers are
primed to pay attention to the ads. That's not always the case with
hit TV shows anymore. Sure, viewers may love ``Friends'' or
``Frasier,'' but during the commercial breaks they may be checking
out the Weather Channel or a hockey game on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl is different. The game's first quarter may be the
one waking hour of the year when TV remote-control devices go
largely unused.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bill Heater of Heater Advertising in Boston, a
Super Bowl ad is the marketing equivalent of lakefront property.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't own too much of it,'' he says. ``If you have
something important to say, that's the place to say it.''
</P>
<P>
   What could make this year's crop of ads especially interesting
is the fact that dot-com companies and Madison Avenue tend to have
very different mindsets. By Heater's lights, some of the
high-energy zeal that drives many dot-coms can be at odds with some
basic principles of Marketing 101.
</P>
<P>
   With dot-coms often reinventing themselves with dizzying speed,
a few weeks can equal a year in Internet time. But what often makes
for an effective marketing strategy is a client who stays focused
on one long-term message, repeating it in every contact the company
has with its customers, from Super Bowl ads to Web site design and
product packaging.
</P>
<P>
   If some dot-com entrepeneurs are short on old-fashioned
consistency, one thing they don't lack for is chutzpah. Some plan
to forgo ad agencies altogether and create Super Bowl ads
themselves, according to Ad Age.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see a wide discrepancy of craftsmanship,'' says Fred
Bertino, president of Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos and the head
of the Boston ad agency's creative department. ``But, hey, bet it
all _ that's the dot-com mentality. . . . Besides, it's not their
money; it's venture-capital money.''

FIRST IN THE PRIMARIES, NOT IN CUISINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ A year ago, a California reporter of
remarkable diligence said he had never been to New Hampshire and
eagerly inquired about its restaurants. I told the poor chap that
by the final week of preprimary hysteria, when meals are missed or
bolted suicidally, he would not likely see silverware nor grip it
in his mitts.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1952, reporters have tried to find out what's eating New
Hampshire. But what is New Hampshire eating? America has changed,
but would-be presidents still obsess over a state that ranks 41st
in population and still obey an audience as monochromatic (98
percent white) as the average presidential fund-raiser. Will this
tourist trap of presidential politics survive in the 21st century?
A weighty question, but where do we eat?
</P>
<P>
   Voters have a choice of 30 presidential and four vice
presidential candidates, but diners face no such bounty. Portsmouth
offers respectable eateries, but from the Merrimack Valley it's
easier to reach Boston than the seacoast. Besides, Portsmouth is
more like Maine than New Hampshire, just as Keene behaves as though
it were in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   In campaigns elsewhere, hungry candidates and their accomplices
may enjoy a jolly time and decent food at the Rotary, Kiwanis, or
the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. But cagey New
Hampshire clubbers, anticipating thin fare, must put away a hearty
breakfast on meeting day. The search goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Germond once found a Mexican restaurant in Merrimack, where
the Dos Equis, in the shadow of a Budweiser plant, was cold and
delicious. This coup was as impressive as H. L. Mencken's legendary
discovery of a stray jug of potable sauterne in Rahway, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A memorable meal served at the old New Hampshire Highway Hotel
near Concord years ago was a dish called Chicken Daniel Webster. We
speculated then about how this hunk of poultry might be
rechristened as the state traveled down the food chain of
statesmanship, from Chicken Styles Bridges to Chicken Gordon
Humphrey to Chicken Bob Smith, an oddly flavorless entree encrusted
in granite.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels are just as important to the Fourth Estate as
restaurants. Bedford, with only 11,000 voters to Manchester's
44,000, is home to the Wayfarer, a political rialto since its
founding in 1962 by the Dunfey family. Its one-floor arrangement
replicates New Hampshire's aesthetic goal: Sprawl Free or Die.
Reporters favor the Wayfarer because its design reduces the chance
of being trapped in an elevator with Gary Bauer or Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, challenged by ethics experts for injecting its trademark
into the news, has used the Wayfarer waterfall as its quaintly
rustic backdrop for decades, seldom pulling back for a long shot of
adjacent malls and parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   Every four years, New Hampshire's chief political export has
been ``momentum,'' an elusive concept that may vanish in an
avalanche of votes March 7, when primaries will be held in 13
states, including the largest, California.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show that California has 52 congressional districts,
50 more than New Hampshire, and its capital here has almost as many
good restaurants. At Frank Fat's, a fancy Chinese restaurant long
favored by lobbyists, I see no one using chopsticks; at the bar, I
count a half-dozen single-malt scotches.
</P>
<P>
   When the foremost diarist of New Hampshire politics answered her
cell phone last week, she sat in her car in a parking lot munching
a sandwich between assignments. By now, media dreams of white
tablecloths are gone, replaced by a hold-the-cutlery protocol of
preprimary dining: donuts for breakfast, whatever for lunch, and a
pizza supper.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant franchise in New Hampshire cuisine symbolizes the
Granite State's attitude toward its quadrennial visitors. This
omnipresent logo also describes New Hampshire's economics,
aesthetics, and tax philosophy. Every four years the world worships
at its neon shrine: Drive Thru.

DID BLACK NFL COACH GET QUICK HOOK IN GREEN BAY? NO WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For three weeks football friends have barged into my office with
Molotov cocktails in their eyes or left incendiary messages on
voice mail. My buddy Herb threw up his hands so violently as we
watched a game that I could not tell if he was gesticulating for
emphasis or signaling for a Heimlich to cough up his barbecue ribs.
Assuming that I was in an apocalyptic misery, they said:
</P>
<P>
   ``That was cold what they did to your boy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your boys sure didn't give the brother any time, did they?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do something about that Packers management.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dag man, one year?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an outrage! Injustice! They didn't give him a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know a white guy would have gotten more than a year to put
his system in.''
</P>
<P>
   I listened as all patient reporters do. When they were done, I
issued my response. It has been the same for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad the brother was hired. I was glad the brother was
fired.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``brother'' is Ray Rhodes, who was fired recently as head
coach of the Green Bay Packers after just one season, after his
team missed the National Football League playoffs with an 8-8
record. The team had made the playoffs the last six years under
former head coach Mike Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   It takes no Rhodes scholar to judge this situation. This is not
Cleveland or New Orleans, where 8-8 gets ticker tape. This is Green
Bay, only two years removed from two consecutive Super Bowl
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   There was a complication. Rhodes is African-American. His firing
dropped the number of black head coaches from three to two in a
31-team league.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the NFL is rife with antebellum, institutional
racism as 70 percent of the players are African-Americans but only
29 percent of assistant coaches and 10 percent of head coaches are.
Most coaches are former players at some level.
</P>
<P>
   The firing drew a letter to the Packers from Jesse Jackson's
Rainbow Coalition. Jackson aide Charles Farrell called
African-American coaches an ``endangered species.'' Farrell asked
if a white coach would have been fired after one year at 8-8. He
asked, ``Are black coaches being held to a different standard?''
</P>
<P>
   In general, yes. In Rhodes's case, no way. Sure, white coaches
get more time to sink ships.
</P>
<P>
   The recently fired Pete Carroll got three years to drive the New
England Patriots from the Super Bowl to an 8-8 record and out of
the playoffs. Recently fired Chan Gailey got two years to lower the
Dallas Cowboys from contenders into 8-8 pretenders. No white coach
immediately comes to mind who was fired after one season with an
8-8 record or better.
</P>
<P>
   But I am not your garden-variety observer of race relations. I
am a native Wisconsinite, a Packer fan, and so serious about my
team that my wife made a bet that if my 9-year-old son Tano and I
can keep his bedroom and my home office clean for the next six
months, we can fly to any Packer game in the country next season.
</P>
<P>
   When I plunk my money down for two plane tickets, I am
colorblind. They better win. The Packers were 13-3, 13-3, and 11-5
the last three seasons. But this year, after a 3-1 start with
miracle comebacks engineered by star quarterback Brett Favre, the
team collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   My contortions and chiropractic bills soared as the Packers lost
five of eight road games and lost games at home twice on the last
play, once on a blocked field goal and once by letting a
quarterback as stiff as Al Gore run for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   It was so bad that my son, after yet another blown tackle to
allow a score, said, ``Daddy, it's like the Packers see the runner
coming and they all get out of the way like he's got dynamite.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson should ride herd on the rest of the NFL. No
African-Americans have been seriously considered for any of this
year's head coaching openings, including the Patriots', who for
weeks seemed absurdly locked in on a checkered white candidate,
Bill Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   But do not blame the Packers. Playing in the NFL's smallest,
whitest city, Green Bay this season became the first team in league
history to put African-Americans in the three top posts _ head
coach, offensive coordinator, and defensive coordinator. The
Packers were also the first team to recycle an African-American
coach, taking a chance on Rhodes after he was fired by the
Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes knew that being handed a dynamite team was a golden
opportunity with a short fuse. ``The seat is going to be hot,'' he
said a year ago. The dynamite exploded in his face and his seat
went up in flames as the team lost three of its last four games and
missed the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   So while the NFL is still a plantation, Rhodes is not a poster
child for it. He was hired this week as defensive coordinator in
Washington. Sherman Lewis, the fired Packers offensive coordinator,
was hired this week for the same job by Minnesota. These brothers
still have good jobs on playoff teams. It is how the NFL should
work; it just needs far more of it.
</P>
<P>
   If one wants to insist Rhodes got a quick hook, go ahead. My son
and I have other priorities, like cleaning our house, stuffing
cheeseheads into our suitcases and flying to a warm city next
season to scream, ``Go Pack, Go.'' I was glad to see the brother
get hired. I was glad to see the brother get fired.
</P>

 UNDATED: ... anti-impeachment strategy.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Podesta's brother, John, has been White House chief of staff
since November 1998. Podesta.com, the company where John and Tony
once toiled together, has 53 lobbying clients, and revenues of
about $8 million last year, up from about $6 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Tony Podesta said he sometimes does not go near
the White House for weeks at a time. But there have been times, he
said, when he spends every day in a given week at the White House.
But, he said, ``I've gotten no client into the White House who the
White House didn't want there.'' And Podesta said he never contacts
his brother on behalf of any client.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we helped elect Bill Clinton and Al Gore and
then hung out a shingle,'' Tony Podesta said. ``We started this
business when George Bush was president, and we'll still be here if
his son becomes president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not invent the Internet, as he once claimed. But the
industries driving the new economy often treat him as if he had.
And with good reason: No one in government, arguably not even
President Clinton, has more influence than Gore over the direction
of the technology revolution. And some of Gore's friends have his
ear on those issues, even as they earn millions for advising
companies eager to affect those decisions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Roy Neel, a close friend and former chief of staff
to Gore, is president of the US Telephone Association, which
represents the interests of the Bell operating companies in
Washington. In 1998, Neel was paid $1.2 million by USTA, according
to a survey by the National Journal.
</P>
<P>
   USTA, in turn, retains another former chief of staff to Gore,
Peter Knight, as its lobbyist, for $200,000 a year. Knight, who has
long been Gore's most prodigious _ and controversial _ fund-raiser,
is also Bell Atlantic's chief lobbyist, at another $280,000 a year.
Two months ago, Knight took a leave from his lobbying firm as a way
to mute criticism of his multiple roles.
</P>
<P>
   One member of a lobbying firm, speaking on condition that
neither she nor her firm be identified, said she was troubled by
overtures to potential high-technology clients.
</P>
<P>
   Often, she said, some of those with Gore connections present
themselves as advisers to the president and vice president, note
that they frequently attend White House meetings, and even say that
they can get Gore to appear at client company events. Even if they
cannot affect the outcome, she said, Gore's friends can claim
access to inside information from the White House staff. ``That in
itself is very valuable to clients,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a
public interest law firm that specializes in technology issues,
said he is troubled by what he calls the ``monetarization of
politics,'' but said he sees no evidence that the outcome is tipped
in cases involving Gore's friends.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason: Both sides in any major telecommunications
dispute are often represented by lobbyists with ties to the vice
president. ``They nullify each other,'' Schwartzman said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, Schwartzman concluded, ``makes his own decisions. But the
vice president wants to see his friends be successful and wealthy.
And he wants them to contribute to his campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Two recent issues, perhaps more than any others, illustrate how
easily political money fuels the perception that special interests
exert undue influence on policy.
</P>
<P>
   The first involved the recent Clinton administration decision to
reverse course and permit the export of high-end encryption
technology. Initially, the White House had agreed with the Justice
and Defense departments that US national security interests could
be damaged by such exports.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Quinn, a former Gore chief of staff and Clinton legal
counsel, was paid at least $680,000 by Americans for Computer
Privacy, cobbled together to get the ban lifted.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, Clinton's chief of staff, said Tuesday that
Quinn's lobbying did not affect the decision. What turned the
administration around, Podesta said, was a realization that
technological breakthroughs had eclipsed longstanding policy.
</P>
<P>
   One industry official with intimate knowledge of the decision
supported Podesta's explanation. But the official, who declined to
be quoted by name but is sympathetic to Gore, said presidential
campaign fund-raising loomed over the discussions of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The computer industry, the official explained, was united on the
issue, at a time when Gore was competing mightily with Bush for
Silicon Valley political contributions. To have the administration
at odds with the industry on the issue, he said, could have
transformed more of the high-tech world into Bush supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The other issue involved lobbyist Tom Downey, a onetime
Democratic House colleague who is sometimes described as Gore's
closest friend _ and the only lobbyist who Lehane acknowledged has
lobbied Gore personally on issues. Downey clients include the Merck
drug company, which according to lobbying records gave Downey an
unspecified number of stock options in 1993, the year that Gore
took office as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Starting late in 1996, Merck led a drug industry offensive
designed to prevent South Africa from implementing legislation to
acquire patented AIDS drugs at below-market cost for the 3.2
million South Africans who are HIV-positive. A day's dosage of the
drug cocktail often costs more than a worker there makes in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Downey lobbied Gore's office and Podesta's
firm lobbied the White House, State Department, and the US trade
representative for the drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, where Gore heads a US-South Africa
relations group, backed the drug companies, even imposing trade
sanctions on the country, freezing any action for more than two
years. A State Department memorandum, although noting that the
United States understood the need for the medicine, declared: ``The
US government nonetheless made clear that it will defend the
legitimate interests and rights of US pharmaceutical firms.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug firms have funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars
into national Democratic campaign coffers since Clinton became
president, noted James Love, the director of the Consumer Project
on Technology, which has pressed the administration to take a
humanitarian approach to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, after US AIDS activists had embarrassed Gore several
times by disrupting his campaign events over the issue, the White
House altered course, negotiating a settlement that will allow
South Africa to acquire the drugs at low cost.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Gore spokesman Lehane cited the issue as one on which
Gore took a position counter to the interests of a friend's
corporate client. But Love said the lengthy delays prompted by the
administration's support for the drug industry have had tragic
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's morally repugnant to help campaign contributors in a
situation like this,'' Love said. ``How else can you explain why
the US would impede access to cheap medicine in Africa, which is in
the midst of a health crisis of historic proportions? This is not
something that makes you proud to be an American.''

OREOS AND M&AMP;MS? LEARNING TOOLS

<TEXT>
<P>
   EASTON, Mass. _ These are some of the questions posed to
students in an eighth-grade math class at Easton Junior High.
</P>
<P>
   What's the diameter of an Oreo cookie?
</P>
<P>
   How do you calculate the surface area of a box of Cocoa Frosted
Flakes?
</P>
<P>
   How many M&AMP;M candies in a 16-ounce bag are likely to be red?
</P>
<P>
   The questions come from their controversial new textbook,
``Mathematics: Applications and Connections,'' which uses brand
names like Nike sneakers and Nintendo games, and junk foods like
Cheez-Its, to make algebra and geometry exciting and relevant to
young students.
</P>
<P>
   With glossy photographs of products and corporate logos, and
exercises that send students off to their favorite stores at the
shopping mall, the McGraw-Hill text attempts to silence that
age-old teenage lament about math: ``When am I ever going to use
this?''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say it turns schools into mini-marketplaces,
encouraging students to become more brand-conscious by asking
questions such as: ``Do you like Hershey's Chocolate Kisses?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate advertising is penetrating more and more in our
society, but it should stop at the school doors,'' said Paul
Dubois, a sports sociologist at Bridgewater State College, whose
daughter is using the textbook at Easton Junior High. ``We could
find more creative ways to make math interesting and fun than by
bombarding kids with product promotions.''
</P>
<P>
   The curriculum reflects the growing integration of commercial
products, and sometimes advertising, into an arena once considered
off limits: the public school classroom. Around the country, the
textbook has touched off protests from parents and groups that
monitor commercialism in education, and has been outlawed in
California.
</P>
<P>
   But the authors and teachers say opponents are out of touch with
today's students, who are streetwise consumers reared in an era of
Pokemon toys and action figure tie-ins at Burger King, and need to
process information in a language they know.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, students say, the book is fun.
</P>
<P>
   They learn symmetry by studying the design of Chevrolet and
Hallmark logos. They learn to plot data by creating graphs charting
Nike and Reebok sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like seeing a commercial while you're learning,'' said
Steve Girourd, 13, an Easton student, who thought this was
``cool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes math more fun for us, because it relates to things we
deal with in everyday life,'' said classmate Leah Joy Hanscom, 13.
</P>
<P>
   The McGraw-Hill text, published last year with editions for
students in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, is catching on
in Massachusetts, where it is used by about 80 school districts,
including Braintree, Lowell, Barnstable, Springfield, and Plymouth.
The first edition was introduced in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   It does not rely solely on brand names to bring math to life.
Internet exercises, sports celebrities, and historical events also
are used in examples and equations. And since corporations have not
paid for their products to appear in the book, the authors assert
that calling the placements advertising is inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were responding to what educators across the country have
been telling us they want in their classrooms: real-world examples
that engage the students' interest,'' McGraw-Hill spokesman Bill
Jordan said. ``If you can attract and retain their interest,
they'll learn better and remember longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Among arguably the most important critics, the book is a hit.
When four math classes in Massachusetts schools were asked by a
reporter last week whether they favored the inclusion of company
brand names in their textbook, the students voted a resounding
``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kendall, math director for Braintree's schools, said
because corporate slogans saturate adolescent life these days, they
no longer stand out, even in schoolbooks. ``It just blends in,''
Kendall said. ``I guess we get so many advertising messages that
we've become oblivious to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Easton Junior High math teacher Steven Cerce: ``You can't
get real without mentioning specific products.''
</P>
<P>
   But what galls critics is not just what they see as commercial
clutter on the pages. It is also the idolatrous descriptions of
corporations and advertising icons.
</P>
<P>
   One chapter about ratios reads: ``The characters that appear in
many television commercials are entertaining as well as effective.
One example is the Pillsbury Dough Boy.'' Pictured alongside the
text is a picture of the dough boy cheerily waving to readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a 1996 Louis Harris poll, about 38 out of 100 people . . .
rated the Pillsbury Dough Boy commercials very effective,'' the
text says, explaining that 38 out of 100 is a ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, McGraw-Hill's director of media relations, emphasized
that the corporate references were not requested or paid for by the
companies, although firms did give permission for their logos to be
used.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the corporate images feature fast food, cookies,
candy, and other products that are not necessarily nutritious,
noted Gary Ruskin, director of Commercial Alert in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely inappropriate for a school district to be
endorsing junk foods when we have skyrocketing rates of childhood
obesity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Rubino Jr., former director of mathematics for the
Boston public schools, who was a consultant for an early version of
the text, said the attacks on the McGraw-Hill text are predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Rubino, however, said the fresh approach is desperately needed.
Recent MCAS results showed Massachusetts students performing
dismally in math, with 40 percent of eighth-graders failing the
standardized test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been losing these kids, especially after the fourth or
fifth grade,'' Rubino said. ``This is something we've been trying
to do for a long time: relate math to the world that really
interests kids. I hope it's a trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Students generally said they hoped so, too, although a few
worried about the effects of the lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's product placement, like in the movies,'' observed Gabe
Good, 14, in Cerce's eighth-grade math class. ``You see a movie
star using something and you might want to go buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Grattan, 14, also in Easton, pointed to a lesson that
involved an elaborate computer play station.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you didn't have enough money to buy some of these things,
you might feel bad,'' she said.

N.H. STUDENTS CONTINUE AN ORATIONAL TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANBURY, N.H. _ Rebecca Robinson is a little slip of a thing,
with a long brown braid and a bright red jumper. But as she takes
the stage at Prize Speaking Night, her presence fills the room.
</P>
<P>
   She is a child of perfect diction and precise posture,
enthusiastic hand gestures, pink-cheeked elocution. She is taking
part in a tradition as old as this village and once as widespread
as the property tax: competitive oratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prize Speaking Night at Danbury School is a measure of what we
were,'' wrote the poet Donald Hall, who lives just beyond the
Wilmot line, in the essay ``On Moving One's Lips, While Reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Prize Speaking is a tradition that harks back to a time, many
decades ago, when country people across New England gathered to
play fiddles, sing songs, and hold debates and speaking
competitions, Hall wrote. In most hamlets, though, memorization and
recitation went out of style; competitive oratory, felled by radio,
was killed outright by TV.
</P>
<P>
   And in the process, some say, a generation lost touch with the
power of oratory. Words, Hall wrote, were detached ``from the
sounds they make, which is the castration of reading.''
</P>
<P>
   But here in Danbury, population 985, children never really lost
the magic of the spoken word.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Rebecca's older sister Kris won second place for
Prize Speaking as a third-grader. Kris is in the Army now, but her
plaque sits on a bureau in Rebecca's room, the object of much
covetous attention. Rebecca's goal is to best her sister's
second-place finish in this, her premiere Prize Speaking year.
Rebecca is 6 years old.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of those winter nights when a near-full moon hovers
close in the sky; so cold that snow squeaks beneath boots, so still
that smoke from woodstoves rises straight to the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred people have turned out to witness the children's
oratory. That's roughly 10 percent of the town's population. For
Boston to boast a similar showing, 55,500 people would have to show
up. Fenway Park could not hold them.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Danbury gather in the school's multipurpose room,
which serves as a lunchroom and gymnasium. While long-ago Prize
Speaking Nights featured selections from Robert Frost and Edgar
Allan Poe, the program is heavily weighted toward Shel Silverstein
and his ditties of monsters and nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   The children of Danbury chose their poems weeks ago and have
been reciting them before going to bed and on the school bus ever
since. Last week, three finalists and two alternates were selected
from each grade, their oration scored numerically by a panel of
judges.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, the children will take the stage and take down the
house.
</P>
<P>
   Danbury sits on the north side of Mount Kearsarge, 32 miles from
Concord. While it is surrounded by towns that are more upscale and
transient, Danbury has avoided the effects of gentrification. It
has two general stores, a village church, and no traffic lights,
and its Blazing Star Grange is one of the most active in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The woman running the till at the Danbury general store still
has a silver dollar she won for Prize Speaking some 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even here, Prize Speaking had died out for a time, as
schools started to emphasize creative self-expression over rote
learning. No one seems to remember when the orations died, but
Danbury credits its revival to Edna Powers, a secretary at the
school who was widely renowned for her gift with the speaking
piece.
</P>
<P>
   Powers' father was brother to Wesley Wells, Hall's grandfather.
Born in 1919, Enda Powers grew up in the golden age of recitation.
</P>
<P>
   She was ``a lovely woman,'' Hall remembers, ``a great Democrat
in a Republican sea, and enormously warm-hearted.'' She would be
called upon to display her gifts of recitation at Grange suppers,
wedding anniversaries, 90th birthday parties. When Powers died, her
daughter, Bertha Brown, became school secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Like her uncle Wesley, who kept time to cow-milking with
recitations of ``Casey at the Bat,'' Edna Powers knew the entire
piece.
</P>
<P>
   When her children would bicker, she would break into verse:
``The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Casey'' never failed to shut them up.
</P>
<P>
   The poems that became favorites for recitation, such as Clement
C. Moore's ``The Night Before Christmas,'' did so simply because,
as Hall writes, they were ``good to say out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a kind of literary culture,'' Hall said. ``But it
ain't T.S. Eliot.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, some see it is a kind of refuge, however brief, from the
culture of television.
</P>
<P>
   It gets kids ``away from the routine of TV,'' said Audrey
Curren, an 82-year-old former Danbury teacher, and Hall's cousin.
``Course, kids today, they want to be entertained, not entertain
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall sees an even deeper value.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, a prize-winning poet who lives in his ancestral farmhouse,
said Prize Speaking is about experiencing poetry _ physically,
viscerally.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you learn literature when you are able to feel it in
your body,'' Hall said. ``If you read with your mouth, it goes
right down into your stomach. When you memorize, you internalize
the sounds even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when I read poetry, silently, sitting in this chair, my
throat will get tired.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Robinson's parents sit in the back of the room. Charlie
Robinson lays flooring for a living; his wife, Virginia, drives the
school bus.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks now, they have called upon Rebecca to recite her
piece. She knows ``The Little Turtle'' like she knows her own
heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   One by one the children take their place on the makeshift stage.
Some say their pieces in one giant gulp. One little man adopts the
well-worn posture of New Hampshire feed stores and fire stations:
chest and belly forward, weight back on his heels.
</P>
<P>
   Cheyenne Placido is interrupted by applause from the
kindergarten row halfway through ``Fruit Bats in the Attic.'' She
scowls and shoots: ``I'm not done yet!'' She finishes with a
flourish and without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Every child is awarded with robust applause.
</P>
<P>
   Six-year-old Monique LeClair, after the preliminary competition,
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was awesome. When everyone hears you and claps for
you, and boys bow and girls do curtsies with dresses . . . it's fun
to do that. When people do that, it makes kids happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The children fidget, flush-cheeked, awaiting the judges'
announcements. Each grade will have first-, second- and third-place
winners.
</P>
<P>
   There are names on the Prize Speaking program that match those
on the town's Civil War memorial.
</P>
<P>
   There is Craig Maines, who recited his poem to his father each
night before sleep; there is Michael Larkin, and Monique LeClair,
face painted with whiskers to match a poem called ``Cat.'' Also
here is red-haired Joshua Braley and his sister Alyssa. Nathan
Danforth, Jesse Padgett, Cheyenne Placido, Amanda Greene. Joshua
and Olivia Beaucher, Tiffany and Benjamin Hillsgrove, Hunter
Bourbeau.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Robinson has it figured by process of elimination. By
the time the second-place winner is announced in her grade, she
knows she has won; her mouth curls into a little ``O,'' her feet _
which do not reach the floor _ kick so hard she threatens to
catapult from the chair.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps poetry will settle into the marrow of Rebecca Robinson's
bones. Perhaps, in 10 years, she will feel her throat grow tired
when she reads Emily Dickinson, silently, sitting in a chair.
</P>
<P>
   She hugs her Prize Speaking plaque tight to her chest. She can
barely speak for grinning. She will go home, call Kris in the Army
to tell her the news, and then sleep with her trophy beneath the
bedcovers.

U.S. COURTS AFRICAN LEADERS DURING U.N. VISIT
</HEADLINE>
  By WAYNE SVOBODA 
 c. 2000 Columbia News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   African presidents and other leaders who arrived in wind-chilled
New York City this past weekend to attend a session of the Security
Council on Monday devoted to Congo and ending its brutal civil war
might have felt a certain warmth nonetheless. January has been
tagged ``the month of Africa'' at the United Nations by Richard
Holbrooke, the chief U.S. representative and current chairman of
the Council. Mr. Holbrooke, best known for his work as a U.S.
negotiator in the Balkans, decided to use his month-long
chairmanship to focus attention on Africa as part of what he and
others in the Clinton Administration, led by the President himself,
assert will be a new and improved U.S. attitude toward the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   To some listeners the claim sounds credible, but others-those
who remember America's spotty links to the place in decades
past-remain skeptical. To this latter group, a more revealing
insight into how the current Administration feels about Africa is
the version glimpsed in October 1993, when the President tucked his
tail and ordered that U.S. forces retreat from Somalia just days
after 18 Army Rangers were killed in a Mogadishu firefight with
supporters of a Somali warlord.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists hope recent developments signal a new day. The Monday
session of the Security Council was chaired by Madeleine Albright,
the U.S. Secretary of State, who visited Africa in 1999. Rebels in
eastern Congo backed by Rwanda and Uganda hope to topple Congolese
President Laurent Kabila who is supported by Zimbabwe, Namibia and
Angola. A cease-fire signed last July has not held. Kofi Annan, the
U.N. Secretary General, wants to send in the blue helmets to
conduct a peacekeeping operation, but so far the U.S. hasn't signed
on to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Jan. 20th, at Mr. Holbrooke's invitation, Jesse
Helms addressed the Security Council. Mr. Helms, a Republican from
North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, has criticized the U.N. for many years as politically
and fiscally inept-or worse. Members of the United Nations return
the favor, regarding Mr. Helms as an American polecat of the first
rank. Mr. Helms told his hosts that most Americans consider the
United Nations a money-wasting pain in the neck on a good day and
an internationalist threat to U.S. sovereignty on a bad one. Still,
the fact that Helms and the Council chatted without one side or the
other declaring war is regarded by U.N. boosters as a sign of
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Jan. 19th, the Security Council's guest was
Nelson Mandela, the former South African president and
anti-apartheid hero, who asked the U.N. to help him bring peace to
Burundi, where more than 200,000 have been killed in a civil war
that began seven years ago. Mr. Mandela was appointed by Africans
as a mediator for Burundi in December.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the Security Council debated how to end the
fighting in Angola, where armed factions have tried hard to kill
one another while competing for some three decades to rule the
country. Vice-President Al Gore took time out from campaigning in
Iowa to appear before the Security Council on January 10th and urge
that America and Africa work together to rein in the AIDS epidemic,
'lest many afflicted Sub-Saharan countries be destabilized even
more than they have been.
</P>
<P>
   Such attention is heady brew for Africans who ordinarily receive
little attention on the world stage unless something really awful
happens in their homeland. Lots of awful things have: bloody civil
wars, brutal border disputes, thuggish military coups, executions
of dissidents, absurd economic policies, harsh crackdowns on civil
liberties, attacks on press and religious freedoms. The notion that
this time America might really mean what it says, and might
actually pay attention to Africa's problems for more than just the
month of January, is intoxicating. Before Africans and others who
care about the continent pop the Champagne or its non-alcoholic
equivalent and begin to celebrate, however, they should ask
themselves whether the old days and old ways are genuinely gone.
</P>
<P>
   The odds say they are not. Little about the relationship between
Africa and America is encouraging-not today, certainly not in the
past, probably not in the foreseeable future. Visits to Africa by
Mr. Holbrooke last December, Secretary of State Albright last
October, and President Clinton in 1998 allow the Administration to
appear progressive and to burnish its image as a friend not just of
Africans but also of African-American voters, whose support Clinton
and Gore covet. That Clinton whispers blandishments is no surprise.
His need to be liked does not stop at the water's edge, even if
some of the African heads of state and government he has courted
are hardly inspirational personages. But the Somali example shows
that as a consort he can be fickle when push comes to shove and
principle is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Africa ranks low on the scale used by U.S. politicians and other
government and military officials to calculate our nation's
strategic interest. This inconvenient fact, not racism, explains
why the U.S. sent troops to Bosnia and Kosovo but not Rwanda.
Stability in the Balkans is important to peace throughout Europe.
Central European nations set free by the breakup of the Soviet
Union have gone a good distance toward building the foundations for
democracy and free-market economic reform. Few African nations have
managed to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, African nations served as surrogates for
the West and the Soviet Union, which accounted for much of the
tension in Angola during the 1970's and 1980's for example. But
today's continued turmoil there is homegrown. Colonial powers such
as Britain, France and Portugal were blamed for many of the ills
that beset Africa during the 20th century up to the independence
movement that began there in earnest in the 1960's. After
independence, African leaders kept blaming the outsiders and
decried the legacy colonialism left behind. The finger-pointing has
become less relevant with each passing year, as Africans themselves
have compiled a record on which they must stand for better or for
worse.

 By WALTER V. ROBINSON AND JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What's wrong with the government? It's in the
vise-like grip of monied special interests and their influential
lobbyists who corrupt decision-making, to hear some presidential
candidates tell it. Vice President Al Gore, however, has largely
abstained from joining that chorus.
</P>
<P>
   A closer look at Gore's political and personal retinue may help
explain why: Many of the vice president's close friends, former
aides, and senior campaign advisers work as lobbyists and
strategists for corporate clients who often get access to the White
House and Gore's office _ and sometimes get profitable results from
regulators who operate under Gore's oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Gore raised $28 million for his presidential campaign last year.
That's less than half the $67 million that Texas Governor George W.
Bush raised. But Gore, not Bush, is the favorite of Washington
lobbyists. They gave Gore more than $600,000 in 1999, and their
clients donated millions more to his campaign and the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Washington lobbyists curry favor with both parties,
more often to the benefit of Republicans. But Democrats close to
Gore have carved out a special, growing niche: representing
new-tech and high-tech firms whose prospects often depend on
regulatory decisions. And on technology issues, Gore is the
administration's gatekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   In two cases, major contributors, with help from lobbyists with
close ties to Gore, walked off with windfall decisions from
regulators. In 1997, Teligent Inc. was awarded additional microwave
bandwidth that by some estimates was worth close to $1 billion. In
1998 and 1999, Teligent contributed more than $200,000 to
Democratic Party committees, and officials of the company have
raised tens of thousands of dollars for Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Network Solutions Inc., which had exclusive
rights from the government to award Internet domain names. When
other companies demanded that the monopoly be ended, the firm hired
Gore's former domestic policy adviser, Greg Simon, as its lobbyist.
In a decision worth untold millions to NSI, regulators initially
opted for the status quo, leaving NSI in control of domain names.
Even a decision last year to open the domain business to
competition was shaped to preserve NSI's preeminence.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that Gore himself was involved in either
decision. But it is clear that the web of relationships among
lobbyists, their clients, the White House and the Gore campaign is
mutually beneficial: Friends of Gore are earning millions in fees
to represent clients who want access to the White House, or to
agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal
Communications Commission, where Gore has a hand in appointments
and policy. And critical to Gore's political success, these friends
and their clients have raised millions of dollars for Gore's
presidential campaign and Democratic Party committees.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gore, Chris Lehane, asserted Tuesday that the
vice president has never made a decision that was not based on the
country's best interests. Sometimes, Lehane noted, Gore's decisions
work against the interests represented by his friends.
</P>
<P>
   As for the substantial contributions from both Teligent and
Network Solutions, Lehane said, ``Al Gore has more than 120,000
contributors, who are proud to support him because of his
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's official actions and decisions do, as Lehane suggests,
sometimes disappoint lobbyists who know him. But that would seem
inevitable. On many telecommunications and technology issues
nowadays, lobbyists who trace their political lineage to Gore's
office can be found representing opposing sides.
</P>
<P>
   Lower-tech industries, some considered untouchable by some
lobbyists, have also steered business to Gore's friends.
Masterminding Gore's campaign strategy are a longtime friend,
Carter Eskew, and a pollster, Harrison Hickman, who had pivotal
roles crafting the tobacco industry's $40 million ad campaign
against antitobacco legislation. Among Gore's largest campaign
donors are Washington lobbying firms that earn millions
representing tobacco interests and companies that have pollution
issues before the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane deflected questions about Eskew's tobacco industry work.
``Carter Eskew is now helping to promote the vice president's
antitobacco agenda,'' he said, adding that Eskew is not unlike
someone who played for the New York Yankees and then was traded to
the Red Sox. ``Now, he's playing for the Red Sox,'' the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eskew and Hickman did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that money buys ``access'' in Washington is nothing
new, though the system is now so awash in corporate donations that
some candidates, and even some corporate leaders, are crying for
change.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for example, has raised millions of dollars from the
industrial, professional, and corporate interests that are
regulated by the Texas state government. Senator John McCain, who
has elevated the campaign finance reform issue to first-rank
status, seeks donations from industries he oversees as chairman of
the Senate Commerce Committee, and in one recent case interceded
with regulators in a way that benefited a major contributor. And
Gore himself has attacked former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley
for acting in the Senate on behalf of home state pharmaceutical
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money follows power. When a company needs someone in a
position of power to help them out, it's a very good time for them
to take out the checkbook and make a political donation. That's the
way Washington works,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of
the Committee for Responsive Politics, which maintains a Web site
(www.opensecrets.org), where donations and lobbying revenues can be
tracked and compared.
</P>
<P>
   The evident intersection between Gore's fund-raising, lobbying,
and the companies queuing up to hire his friends is all the more
surprising after the buffeting he took in the 1996 campaign
fund-raising scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Gore was known as the ``solicitor in chief'' for his
zealous pursuit of donations from special interest groups targeted
by the Clinton-Gore reelection campaign. Along with Clinton, Gore
hosted White House coffees that were followed by substantial
contributions. He used his own office to solicit campaign
donations. And for months, he maintained that he didn't know that
an event he attended at a Buddhist temple in California was a
fundraiser. Investigators later discovered that the event was used
to move cash from Asia into the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Gore's contributions are carefully vetted.
Nonetheless, much of the money he has raised come from officers of
companies whose interests coincide with Gore's areas of official
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, lobbying reports examined by the Globe show that
Gore's office is often listed as a lobbying stop for Gore's
friends, on issues that include telecommunications, computer
technology, tax credits, biotechnology, drug company concerns, and
environmental quality disputes. Since 1996, the television networks
alone have spent several million dollars on lobbyists on issues
like the ``V'' chip, which limits access to violent TV programming,
with Gore's office getting much of the lobbying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 19 companies whose executives have donated the most in
individual contributions to Gore's campaign, seven are Washington
lobbying firms. Moreover, lobbying and campaign finance records
show that 15 of the 19 firms have also made unrestricted ``soft
money'' contributions to Democratic Party committees during
Clinton's second term of office. The total: $3,376,690.
</P>
<P>
   One highly successful lobbyist, Tony Podesta, even has a Web
site that invites readers to conclude that he wields considerable
influence at the White House _ which friends say he does, sometimes
aggressively and often effectively. On the site, Podesta's firm
boasts how he ``gained the ear'' of the White House on a key tax
issue and arranged meetings with Clinton for broadcast executives
and sessions with ``key policy makers.'' The site also includes a
trade publication news article describing Podesta's late-night role
helping the White House plot anti-impeachment strategy.

&HT;     PAINTING IS A FAMILY AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN R. GODDARD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Five years ago, Lionel Sosa, 60, surprised
everyone by retiring from one of the country's most successful
Hispanic advertising agencies to devote more time to his family and
his private passion _ painting.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa founded Sosa, Bromley, Aguilar, Noble &AMP; Associates, now
known as Bromley + Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Semi-retirement has meant, among other things, working 12-hour
days for his wife's advertising agency, which counts among its
clients the presidential campaign of Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He has reserved Sundays for painting in his studio near
Floresville. He's been joined by his wife, Kathy, 46; his brother,
Robert, 58; and sometimes by his daughter, Anna, 40. He has a
daughter at Yale University, Cristina, 21, who also paints.
</P>
<P>
   Put their work together and you have ``The Cinco Sosas,'' now on
exhibit at the Nanette Richardson Fine Art Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, Sosa said, ``We have tacos and conversation, then we
start to paint. Everybody does their own thing, but it's a way for
us to be together. I always wanted to be the next Picasso. But by
the time I was 25, I had four kids and I had to make a living. I've
concentrated on commercial art and design for much of my career,
but now I can pursue my dream of painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started four years ago at Christmas when my wife gave
me a bunch of canvases, paints and all the brushes I could possibly
use,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For his subject matter, Sosa looked to old photographs. Accented
with bright primary colors _ blue, red and yellow _ Sosa's
portraits feature his mother, father, friends, neighbors and
relatives as they appeared in the 1940s and 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, we always thought of ourselves as poor.
But these paintings have helped me realize that we were really
middle class to upper middle class,'' Sosa said. ``I'm seeing my
family like I have never seen it before. There's my dad in his
white suit and white hat. There's my mother and her sister in
`Comadres' _ they were best friends all their lives and it never
died. We may not have always had a lot of money, but we were rich
in love and family.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``First Grandchild,'' Sosa's oldest son perches on his
grandmother's knee. Sosa's Uncle George, who just turned 98, is
shown as a young man with curly hair. ``Young Katy'' has a large
pink flower in her hair. Sosa said his paintings may be nostalgic,
but he's not so much trying ``to paint a likeness as I am the
essence of the person.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Kathy Sosa has been inspired by the antics of their
dog, a Jack Russell terrier named Rosalind ``Roz'' Russell. Usually
beginning with a title, she paints visual puns, placing her highly
stylized, cartoonish dog in the spotlight for ``Dog Show,'' chasing
a car in ``Dog Tired'' and on a plate for ``Dog Eat Dog.'' Light
and whimsical, her paintings also feature bright colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a copywriter, so the idea usually comes first,'' Kathy
Sosa said. ``Roz is a big part of our lives. She goes to work with
me and she's always underfoot. ... But painting is fun. It's a form
of therapy and gives me a break from all the stress of running a
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sosa, director of foundation and corporate relations for
the University of the Incarnate Word, said painting has enabled him
to get back in touch with his inner child. He said his work
probably looks like the drawings he did when he was 8 years old,
but with colors added.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a kid, everybody knows how to draw, but we lose
that,'' Robert Sosa said. ``At this point in my life, I realized
that I don't have to worry what people say about my work. That's
usually what keeps us from being creative.
</P>
<P>
   We're too old, we're too young, we aren't trained _ there's all
these self-imposed obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Merging abstract and graffiti-like forms, Robert Sosa's
paintings range from cartoonish figures with huge eyeballs and
stick bodies to highly graphic figurative abstract portraits, such
as ``Retrato en Blanco y Negro.''
</P>
<P>
   While Anna Sosa, who works as an administrative assistant at the
McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, has painted with her father at his
Sunday sessions, she prefers painting at home alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad can paint for 10 hours straight. I can paint for two or
three hours, then I'm ready to do something else,'' she said. ``I
didn't start painting until I was 30. I took some classes at the
San Antonio Art Institute. It's mainly a hobby for me, but I enjoy
the opportunity it gives me to express myself.''
</P>
<P>
   She often copies famous images, such as a Frida Kahlo
self-portrait or images of ``La Virgen.'' Her sister, Cristina, has
painted a dramatic self-portrait of herself in a swimsuit at the
pool _ a striking image of the strength of Hispanic women.
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Sosa said his family has always had an artistic streak,
even among the members who do not paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the family to Paris recently and everybody spent days
going to all the museums,'' he said. ``I have eight children, 11
grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. I don't have to force
the kids to go to museums. Really, it's harder to get them out of
the museums. As a family, we probably enjoy going to museums more
than anything else. Everyone can draw. It must be something in our
DNA.''

 U.S. COURTS AFRICAN LEADERS DURING U.N. VISIT  (Editors: This
article is free for your use. Please send tearsheet to Wayne

York, NY 10027)

<TEXT>
<P>
   African presidents and other leaders who arrived in wind-chilled
New York City this past weekend to attend a session of the Security
Council on Monday devoted to Congo and ending its brutal civil war
might have felt a certain warmth nonetheless. January has been
tagged ``the month of Africa'' at the United Nations by Richard
Holbrooke, the chief U.S. representative and current chairman of
the Council. Mr. Holbrooke, best known for his work as a U.S.
negotiator in the Balkans, decided to use his month-long
chairmanship to focus attention on Africa as part of what he and
others in the Clinton Administration, led by the President himself,
assert will be a new and improved U.S. attitude toward the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   To some listeners the claim sounds credible, but others-those
who remember America's spotty links to the place in decades
past-remain skeptical. To this latter group, a more revealing
insight into how the current Administration feels about Africa is
the version glimpsed in October 1993, when the President tucked his
tail and ordered that U.S. forces retreat from Somalia just days
after 18 Army Rangers were killed in a Mogadishu firefight with
supporters of a Somali warlord.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists hope recent developments signal a new day. The Monday
session of the Security Council was chaired by Madeleine Albright,
the U.S. Secretary of State, who visited Africa in 1999. Rebels in
eastern Congo backed by Rwanda and Uganda hope to topple Congolese
President Laurent Kabila who is supported by Zimbabwe, Namibia and
Angola. A cease-fire signed last July has not held. Kofi Annan, the
U.N. Secretary General, wants to send in the blue helmets to
conduct a peacekeeping operation, but so far the U.S. hasn't signed
on to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Jan. 20th, at Mr. Holbrooke's invitation, Jesse
Helms addressed the Security Council. Mr. Helms, a Republican from
North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, has criticized the U.N. for many years as politically
and fiscally inept-or worse. Members of the United Nations return
the favor, regarding Mr. Helms as an American polecat of the first
rank. Mr. Helms told his hosts that most Americans consider the
United Nations a money-wasting pain in the neck on a good day and
an internationalist threat to U.S. sovereignty on a bad one. Still,
the fact that Helms and the Council chatted without one side or the
other declaring war is regarded by U.N. boosters as a sign of
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Jan. 19th, the Security Council's guest was
Nelson Mandela, the former South African president and
anti-apartheid hero, who asked the U.N. to help him bring peace to
Burundi, where more than 200,000 have been killed in a civil war
that began seven years ago. Mr. Mandela was appointed by Africans
as a mediator for Burundi in December.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the Security Council debated how to end the
fighting in Angola, where armed factions have tried hard to kill
one another while competing for some three decades to rule the
country. Vice-President Al Gore took time out from campaigning in
Iowa to appear before the Security Council on January 10th and urge
that America and Africa work together to rein in the AIDS epidemic,
'lest many afflicted Sub-Saharan countries be destabilized even
more than they have been.
</P>
<P>
   Such attention is heady brew for Africans who ordinarily receive
little attention on the world stage unless something really awful
happens in their homeland. Lots of awful things have: bloody civil
wars, brutal border disputes, thuggish military coups, executions
of dissidents, absurd economic policies, harsh crackdowns on civil
liberties, attacks on press and religious freedoms. The notion that
this time America might really mean what it says, and might
actually pay attention to Africa's problems for more than just the
month of January, is intoxicating. Before Africans and others who
care about the continent pop the Champagne or its non-alcoholic
equivalent and begin to celebrate, however, they should ask
themselves whether the old days and old ways are genuinely gone.
</P>
<P>
   The odds say they are not. Little about the relationship between
Africa and America is encouraging-not today, certainly not in the
past, probably not in the foreseeable future. Visits to Africa by
Mr. Holbrooke last December, Secretary of State Albright last
October, and President Clinton in 1998 allow the Administration to
appear progressive and to burnish its image as a friend not just of
Africans but also of African-American voters, whose support Clinton
and Gore covet. That Clinton whispers blandishments is no surprise.
His need to be liked does not stop at the water's edge, even if
some of the African heads of state and government he has courted
are hardly inspirational personages. But the Somali example shows
that as a consort he can be fickle when push comes to shove and
principle is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Africa ranks low on the scale used by U.S. politicians and other
government and military officials to calculate our nation's
strategic interest. This inconvenient fact, not racism, explains
why the U.S. sent troops to Bosnia and Kosovo but not Rwanda.
Stability in the Balkans is important to peace throughout Europe.
Central European nations set free by the breakup of the Soviet
Union have gone a good distance toward building the foundations for
democracy and free-market economic reform. Few African nations have
managed to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, African nations served as surrogates for
the West and the Soviet Union, which accounted for much of the
tension in Angola during the 1970's and 1980's for example. But
today's continued turmoil there is homegrown. Colonial powers such
as Britain, France and Portugal were blamed for many of the ills
that beset Africa during the 20th century up to the independence
movement that began there in earnest in the 1960's. After
independence, African leaders kept blaming the outsiders and
decried the legacy colonialism left behind. The finger-pointing has
become less relevant with each passing year, as Africans themselves
have compiled a record on which they must stand for better or for
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Mr. Mandela, as close to a heroic figure as the
political world has produced in the past quarter century, to serve
as mediator for Burundi is a sign that Africans are ready to accept
responsibility for solving their own problems. American
policymakers and others who call for the U.S. to send troops
whenever and wherever something untoward happens in Africa should
think again. In choosing Mr. Mandela, Africans have selected one of
their own to lead them. The notion that U.S. troops, U.N.
peacekeepers or maybe even NATO forces or other outsiders are what
the continent needs to set its own affairs in order is
paternalistic. The continent's two regional powers, South Africa
and Nigeria, deserve a chance to display their own acumen in their
own backyard. Nations with less power need to wean themselves away
from looking first to the West for help rather than to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to develop a nation's talent is to provide an
opportunity for its people to show what they can do. To the extent
that the Clinton Administration's desire to direct a spotlight on
African affairs serves such moves toward African self-reliance,
all's the better. But if Washington's newly-proclaimed ardor
amounts to more of the same old same old, the best of Africa's
leaders might consider saying thanks but no thanks.

CAMPANELLA, LAWRENCE IN THE FAMILY WAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
 
 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Family is everything _ that's the theme of Joe DiPietro's play
``Over the River and Through the Woods,'' currently on stage at the
El Portal Center for the Arts in North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   It's a concept two of its stars _ both members of big, vocal,
loving Italian families, just as their characters in the play are _
can identify with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seven sons, three of them still at home,'' said actor
Joseph Campanella, who with wife Jill has made his home for more
than 30 years in Toluca Lake. ``We have nine bedrooms, and all of
them are full. The dining room table seats 16, and on Thanksgiving
we have people eating out on the porch, out on the lawn. Everybody
has a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   He's modeled his character, Italian grandpa Nunzio Cristano, on
his older brother, Phil, who's had multiple joint replacement
surgeries and multiple ailments but still shows up every morning to
help out at the food bank in the little town in Maine where he
lives, lifting bags and schlepping crates of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big bear of a man, a tower of strength, warm and
wonderful,'' said Campanella, who's over 70 and the grandfather of
two young boys. ``For him, it's all about family. He's the one I'm
playing on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Lawrence, the over-60 single mother of two grown sons _
Christopher, 35, and Michael, 33 _ plays Emma Cristano, Nunzio's
wife of many years. Lawrence found her inspiration for the role in
a beloved aunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aunt Ange was the typical Italian aunt _ loud, laughing,
having a good time,'' said Lawrence, who lives in a sophisticated
townhouse just over the hill in the Cahuenga Pass, where she enjoys
visits from her two boys. ``My Aunt Ange told it the way it was.
She told the truth. That's the way my character in the play is.''
</P>
<P>
   The roles give the two actors a chance to laugh and to cry, to
sing a little and even dance a little as two sets of grandparents _
Erica Yohn and Joseph Cardinale play the others, Aida and Frank
Gianelli _ try to convince their only grandson not to move 3,000
miles away, to stay in New York and keep coming to big Italian
Sunday dinners.
</P>
<P>
   It's a welcome return to the Los Angeles stage for both actors,
who got their start in legitimate theater.
</P>
<P>
   Campanella's first role on Broadway in the early 1960s was as
Judy Holliday's leading man in ``Hotspot.'' He won a 1962 Tony
nomination for his role opposite Henry Fonda in Garson Kanin's ``A
Gift of Time.''
</P>
<P>
   With a growing family, he didn't seek movie roles because they
would have required him to be away from home for long periods of
time, choosing instead to work in TV, in roles that won him three
Emmy nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he's appeared on ``The Untouchables,''
``Mannix,'' ``The Bold Ones'' and ``The Colbys,'' along with ``Days
of Our Lives'' and ``Guiding Light.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 alone, he appeared on ``Touched by an Angel,'' ``Walker,
Texas Ranger'' and ``Melrose Place,'' and he has a recurring role
as Judge Joseph Camp on ``The Practice.'' He's also currently the
official voice of BMW in TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   In his whirlwind of an antique-decorated home, he glories in the
hubbub as family members and their friends come and go, three cats
and two dogs make themselves at home, and his wife decorates every
room for every holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I met Jill, acting was everything,'' he said. ``But
Denzel Washington, who used to be a neighbor, said it best: `Acting
is making a living; family is life.' I choose to stay with my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, who shot to stardom in 1957 as the original teen-age
Maria in Broadway's ``West Side Story,'' has appeared on ``General
Hospital,'' ``Murder One'' and ``Touched by an Angel,'' and in
other TV and movie roles, but has spent most of her performing life
on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, a triple-threat (acting, singing, dancing)
entertainer, has appeared five other times on Broadway: in
``Saratoga,'' ``Subways Are for Sleeping,'' ``Nightlife,'' ``I Do,
I Do,'' and ``Kiss of the Spider Woman.'' She's also led national
tours of ``Funny Girl,'' ``The Unsinkable Molly Brown,'' ``The
Sound of Music,'' ``Sweet Charity,'' ``No, No, Nannette'' and
``Sugar Babies.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a dearth of roles in New York that brought her to
California when her older son was only 18 months old. Although she
was a working mother, she kept them close _ close enough that a
love of show business rubbed off onto both boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fed them vitamins _ and lots of spaghetti,'' she said with a
laugh, looking at photos of her two strapping sons. ``They're out
on their own now _ Michael is an actor, and Christopher is trying
to be a writer and is a computer guru _ but we get together
whenever we can. They were here for Christmas, and we laughed and
we cooked and we ate. We ate wonderful things.''
</P>
<P>
   It was her love of Italian cooking, fed by her grandmother,
mother and aunts, that led her to write her own cookbook, ``I
Remember Pasta,'' filled with recipes and stories of her growing-up
years in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was the greatest cook that ever lived,'' Lawrence
said, her face lighting up. ``And dinner at my grandmother's was
five hours long. She would prepare each course fresh. So you'd eat,
and I'd get up and sing and dance. Then you'd eat some more, and my
brother would get up and play the accordion. And you'd eat some
more, and you'd hear about somebody's operation, and you'd eat some
more. We ate until we couldn't move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food was what life was all about,'' Lawrence said, ``and this
play is like that. Everything revolves around Sunday dinner, just
like in real life.'' &QL;

   AOL-ONLINE-ADS (Undated) _ As soon as America Online's
acquisition of Time Warner is complete, the clock will start
ticking on a one-year race for the combined companies to come up
with $1 billion to prove to Wall Street that the deal makes
financial sense. Where can they find an extra $1 billion that fast?
The answer pops up, literally, every time someone signs on to
America Online: in-your-face advertising. America Online says that
much of that first $1 billion will come from improving ad sales on
Time Warner's Internet sites. While much of the public credit for
AOL's success has gone to its ability to develop and market a
service that appeals to the masses, it has also done a better job
than any other Internet company in finding ways to cash in on that
audience. From the first pop-up ad to tiny text links on obscure
pages, America Online has found more parts of its service to sell
than any other company. And its ad sales force, more than 400
strong, is widely considered the toughest, most aggressive deal
makers in the industry. By Saul Hansell.

&HT;     FOR SALE: WILD WEST TOWN AND ALL THE TRIMMINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAJITAS, Texas _ Blackjack Pershing came here hunting Pancho
Villa. A beer-drinking goat named Clay Henry held court at the
local trading post. And along the way, Houston businessman Walter
Mischer built a Wild West resort at Lajitas, complete with saloon,
hotel, golf course and landing strip.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 24, the 2,700-acre Big Bend resort complex goes on the
auction block, along with an additional 20,000 acres belonging to
Mischer's company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fabulous property. It's really a great piece of
history, and it ought to be quite an event,'' said William Bone,
owner of the National Auction Group in Gadsden, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Bone said the Lajitas complex will be sold intact and with no
minimum bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see it bring $5 million or $10 million, but I
promise you this, if someone buys it for $1 million, I don't think
Mr. Mischer is going to care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the gavel falls. One bid buys it. You're buying it all,''
he said. ``We'll sell the other land separately.''
</P>
<P>
   La Jitas means ``little flat rocks'' in Spanish. The complex
sits right above a shallow crossing on the Rio Grande that was part
of the old Comanche Trail.
</P>
<P>
   It later was adopted by cattle, liquor and drug smugglers, and
the crossing still is in regular use.
</P>
<P>
   Just to the east is the 800,000-acre Big Bend National Park. To
the west is the 320,000-acre Big Bend Ranch State Natural Area. Due
north is Terlingua, site of an annual chili cook-off.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Corson, Mischer's grandson and a former general manager of
the Lajitas resort, declined to answer questions about the reasons
Southern Investments is selling the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a real estate development company. We buy and sell
properties all the time. After 23 years, we're kind of getting out
of it,'' Corson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the family aspect, it's been a labor of love, but it's
always been a tough thing,'' he said. ``There is a sentimental
attachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents who depend on the resort for jobs, tax revenue and a
variety of services, said that although prospective buyers had been
spotted in recent years, there was no warning of the impending
sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of speculation going on. I don't know if it
will be a good thing or a bad thing,'' said Beth Garcia, owner of a
rafting company called Big Bend River Tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't imagine someone buying Lajitas and not being
serious about doing something with it,'' she said. ``I'm riding on
faith as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Page, who runs the local trading post, also was caught
unaware.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all just waiting for the 24th. I think it's been on the
market for several years, but I don't know that they've had any
serious buyers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's a positive thing,'' said Page, who is a member of
the Terlingua Common School District board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it at the school board meeting. If it will be
sold or shut down, it will have a big effect not only on the tax
base but the number of teachers we employ,'' he said. ``It's an
important part of the community.''
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The resort includes more than 90 hotel and motel rooms,
townhouses and condominiums, a bunkhouse, an 80-slot recreational
vehicle park, a saloon, water plant and sewer plant.
</P>
<P>
   With its block-long boardwalk and dusty, rough-wood exteriors,
the resort has been a favorite for television and movie producers,
as well as advertising agencies seeking an authentic Wild West
setting.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by rugged canyons and desolate vistas, Lajitas has
served as a background for Marlboro Man and Ford truck commercials,
as well as a scenic background for the television series
``Gunsmoke'' and movies such as ``Rio Diablo'' and ``Streets of
Laredo.''
</P>
<P>
   The only remnants of the original Lajitas are the Trading Post
managed by Page and a small adobe chapel called La Mission de Santa
Maria y San Jose, which was built in 1908.
</P>
<P>
   Bone, the auctioneer, said the first advertisement for the sale
appeared Monday in the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too often do you get a chance to own your own city, with
people up and down the streets, golf courses full, a private
landing strip, and some houses that are almost mansions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a piece of Texas history on the last frontier, the Big
Bend,'' he said. ``I tell you, it's one of the most beautiful
places I've ever seen.''

   There's nothing wrong with the Gilbert &AMP; Sullivan songs and
Sullivan overtures in Mike Leigh's new film (which opens Friday)
about the British operetta duo. But why would anyone buy this CD
when it's nothing but disconnected bits and pieces of ``The
Mikado'' with a snippet of ``Princess Ida'' and a soupcon of ``The
Sorcerer'' thrown in for filler. Oh, and ``The Lost Chord,'' a
syrupy Victorian staple that, if there had been no Gilbert, would
be the only thing remembered today by Sir Arthur Sullivan. The
performances are fine, but the definitive ones _ by the D'Oyly
Carte company in the early '30s _ are all available on remastered
CDs from amazon.com or by order, if they're not in stock, from
standard record stores. And if it's excerpts you want, D'Oyly Carte
has a couple of very popular albums of those, too, one with Sir
Malcolm Sargent conducting and the other with John Reed, the patter
song man (``When I Was a Lad,'' ``I've Got a Little List,'' ``I Am
the Very Model of a Modern Major General'') by whom all subsequent
patter song men are judged.

   For a country with such a fine musical legacy, Italy isn't
exactly a pop powerhouse. Little Italian pop makes its way across
the Atlantic and what does is high on cheesiness: divas-in-heat
house, pretentious prog-rock and cutesy Euro-pop like Eiffel 65. Of
course, Euro-cheese like this has a certain disposable charm, but
not a bit of substance. The single, ``Blue (Da Ba Dee),'' is
typical of what you'll find on the rest of the CD. With a naggingly
catchy processed vocal refrain and bouncy beat, the tune is a huge
hit around the globe and now sits in Billboard's Top 10. It's
well-crafted, if gimmicky, synth-pop that sounds better coming
through a car radio than on a home stereo system. An entire CD of
this stuff is too much of a mildly entertaining thing.

   Best known for their work as ``Prairie Home Companion''
regulars, Robin and Linda Williams have spent nearly three decades
charting the backroads of American folk-country. ``Company of
Strangers'' furthers the husband-and-wife team's backcountry
travels, showcasing their trademark harmonies, bluesy fretwork and
from-the-hip wit. Moving easily between coffeehouse ballads and
Grand Ole Opry-style hillbilly rockers, the music on ``Company'' is
as potent and unpretentious as Tennessee whiskey. Mary Chapin
Carpenter provides backing harmonies on the standout ``Rumble'' and
the plaintive ``So Long, See You Tomorrow.'' And a who's who of
bluegrass players enlivens the guitar-driven story songs here. The
result is a pretty bit of musical Americana, wonderfully free of
stagecraft and studio gloss.

 &HT;    Remarkable career by Tina just keeps going
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe this is the whatever-number album from Tina Turner in her
remarkable three decades-long career or maybe this is a complete
``how to'' kit on getting heavy airplay on VH1. You decide.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the evidence: First, you've got an artist with the
abuse-and-big-comeback formula that's made the mainstream adult
cable station's ``Behind the Music'' a big success. Then you've got
an album composed mostly of polished, acoustic guitar-based
professions of strength that vary from country-lite (``Whatever You
Need'') to '80s R&AMP;B-lite (``All the Woman'') while only
occasionally being more than light (``Without You,'' ``Falling'').
For the first single, none other than the hitmakingproduction team
behind Cher's most recent resurrection with ``Believe'' adds a
similar wavy keyboard and disco feel to Turner's ``When the
Heartache Is Over,'' which is as much of a work-out of formula as
it is her still-engaging, aching vocals.

 &HT;    D'Angelo works his magic
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whew. That about sums up the feeling across the urban
contemporary world now that the most rescheduled, leaked and
anticipated album in the latter half of the '90s is _ after five
years _ finally a reality.
</P>
<P>
   That one word also could characterize D'Angelo's seemingly nude
appearance in the video for ``Untitled (How Does It Feel),'' the
first release from his sophomore effort.
</P>
<P>
   But it best describes the experience of listening to what could
be one song that lasts 78 minutes and 59 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with the emotive, mumble-mouthed singer who introduced
the oft-called retro-soul movement (Maxwell, Lauryn Hill), somehow
channeling early Prince. Then there's the finger snaps and the
Hammond organ on the first single ``Playa Playa.'' A muscular bass
and drum tap get their haunting moment next on ``Devil's Pie,''
followed by rhythm guitar on the rap collaboration ``Left &AMP;
Right,'' a horn section on the beautiful ``Send It On'' and a
powerhouse ensemble on the stand-out ``Spanish Joint.''
</P>
<P>
   You may not have understood anything but the hooks on these
songs. But you know when this is over you've been to a groove,
because ``Voodoo'' works if for no other reason than, musically,
nothing R&AMP;B in the past decade has been as adventurous, as
accomplished and _ you knew it was coming _ as spell-inducing as
this. And after taking all of that in, what else can you do, but
``Whew?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ She's diminutive, soft-spoken and genteel.
</P>
<P>
   She's also an ardent feminist and one of Mexico's most powerful
political figures.
</P>
<P>
   Amalia Garcia, 48, is the first woman to be elected president of
a political party in this country where machismo still generally
rules. Born just before Mexican women won the right to vote in
1953, she was committed to politics by 1975 _ the year Mexico
finally erased a law declaring that husbands could forbid wives
from working.
</P>
<P>
   Since her election in a nationwide vote last July, Garcia has
led the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, founded 10
years ago in opposition to Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   To some, her rise to the top of one of this country's most
powerful opposition parties could signal a new age for women
leaders here.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's victory certainly set a trend. In November the PRI
appointed another woman, Dulce Maria Sauri, president of the ruling
party. It was a move widely acknowledged here as a nod at Mexico's
women, who represent 52 percent of the potential electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Both these women lead their parties during a competitive
election year when Mexicans will select a new president on July 2,
along with a new Congress and other top offices.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, the single mother of a college-age daughter, is a firm
believer in the liberal creed that government should intervene to
solve social problems and help the poor. But she's also so feminist
that she doesn't hesitate to criticize people within her own party
when macho attitudes threaten to keep women in secondary roles.
</P>
<P>
   She was instrumental, in fact, in a party rule that requires
that no more than 70 percent of any PRD administration be dominated
by one gender.
</P>
<P>
   Men make jokes about the policy, Garcia said, smoothing her
skirt primly as she sat down for an interview with Cox Newspapers
in her office at party headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They joke that the quota should guarantee that at least 30
percent should be men so they won't disappear,'' she laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-choice and a veteran politician who fought to upgrade laws
against rape and sexual harassment, Garcia is a woman on the
constant go and a regular front-page item in the country's
newspapers. She flies from city to city meeting constituents and
political leaders of all backgrounds, and she has been credited
with helping transform the PRD from a party on the margins to a
force to a reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's style has helped her party move toward ``the famous
middle road,'' a strategy that's worked for other leftist parties
in the world, said political analyst Joel Estudillo of the Mexican
Institute for Political Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amalia Garcia could be the PRD's future,'' Estudillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's ruling party, the PRI, has controlled the country's
presidency, its Congress and most state governments for 70 years.
It was only two years ago that the PRI lost full control of the
lower house of Congress here and the PRD began to gain more power.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 500 members of the lower house, the PRD now counts 123.
Mexico's oldest opposition party, the conservative National Action
Party, or PAN, counts 117. Nine members are independents or
affiliated with other opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia is considered one of the brains behind another successful
electoral strategy that is starting to boost the PRD presence in
the governors' mansions and mayoral offices in various states:
softening the party's militant image and forging coalitions with
unlikely partners, including the conservative PAN and dissident PRI
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, the party has been elected to governors' offices in
four of Mexico's 31 states. Last December, it sponsored a candidate
that won the mayoral election in the high-profile,
economically-powerful resort city of Acapulco.
</P>
<P>
   In Zacatecas, Garcia's home state, she and the PRD wooed a
dissident PRI leader and sponsored him as their candidate for
governor. They did the same thing in the state of Tlaxcala. Both
candidates won.
</P>
<P>
   The PRD also won the governorships of Baja California and
Nayarit, where they established coalitions with the PAN to defeat
the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Both the PRD and the PAN are trying to drive the PRI from office
and label the ruling party corrupt, negligent and anti-democratic.
Their bedrock philosophies are worlds apart, however. The PAN is
considered pro-free market and socially conservative, and it
supports a continuing ban on abortion here.
</P>
<P>
   While it hasn't made choice a top issue in this largely Catholic
country, the PRD favors decriminalization of abortion and believes
in only limited free-market economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half years ago, the PRD had its first substantial
national victory when its leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas won the Mexico
City mayor's race. Cardenas left office last year to run for
president and appointed another PRD woman, Rosario Robles, his
successor.
</P>
<P>
   With Mexico City in its control along with four states, the PRD
now governs a territory with more than 20 million of Mexico's 93
million people. Even though Cardenas is lagging third in polls,
Garcia is convinced the party's experience will help him and other
party candidates in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six years ago, during the 1994 presidential election the PRD
didn't govern any entity,'' Garcia said. ``Now we govern five and
citizens have seen there is no chaos, no uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``It was said that businesses wouldn't trust (the
PRD). None of that has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   While she acknowledges that Mexico's presidency is the top prize
long coveted by this country's opposition parties, Garcia believes
that her party should also continue to try to win local elections
city-by-city, state-by-state.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico, everything has revolved around the figure of the
president,'' she said. ``We believe that we should put an accent on
each and every space in the government where there could be an
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For Garcia, politics is not only a passion but a birthright _
although her critical view of the PRI took her down a different
path than her family. Her father was diplomat and governor of
Zacatecas who belonged to the ruling party. The year 1968 was
pivotal for her; her father was posted abroad and she opted to
return to Mexico to continue studying when a student uprising for
more democracy was violently repressed.
</P>
<P>
   She studied sociology at the National Autonomous University and
history at the Autonomous University of Puebla. She fought for the
release of Mexican political prisoners in the late 1970s, and
plunged into the women's rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   After briefly joining the Communist Party and then the Socialist
Party, Garcia became a founding member of the PRD. As a federal
congresswoman, she led a successful fight to toughen rape and
sexual harassment laws. Afterward she served in Mexico City's
legislative assembly and fought police corruption, forcing a police
chief out of his job.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was also instrumental in reforms allowing Mexico City's
residents to finally elect their mayor, who, prior to 1997, was
always appointed by Mexico's president.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign for party president last year, Garcia said, ``was
difficult in a in a country that has a tradition, or at least the
reputation, for being macho.'' She said she encountered more
resistance from male party leaders than from the party's
rank-and-file.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty percent of woman voted for me,'' she said. ``We've
decided that women shouldn't be (in the party) just symbolically. I
think that if we're able to get women to identify with the PRD then
that will bear a lot of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But of course that commitment has to be real, not
artificial,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her party's relative success recently, Garcia's
experience hasn't been entirely positive. The first party election
that she ran in ended in disaster last July when the party was torn
apart by accusations of vote tampering from all sides. The PRD
annulled the election, but the party's reputation suffered. A
second election in July was smoother.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Garcia continued high-stakes negotiations last
year that would have established an historic alliance to pick on
opposition candidate for Mexico's July 2 presidential election. Had
it been successful, the coalition would be have included nearly all
of Mexico's opposition parties and posed a formidable threat to the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks ultimately failed; while the conservatives and
leftists came up with a common platform, they couldn't agree on how
to select a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was disappointed by the coalition's collapse, but has no
lost love for the PAN _ particularly because she doesn't think the
conservative party gives enough opportunities to women.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled an observation that annoyed her while she sat in
negotiations in rooms filled with choking smoke from cigars
brandished by a PAN leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when we were in meetings during the negotiations
for an alliance _ four months of daily meetings _ the PAN was the
only party that never had a woman there,'' Garcia said.

&HT;     JOIN THE FIGHT AGAINST KNIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Let me put the plug up front, and I'll explain
later.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, there will be a benefit for the ``No on Knight
campaign'' at the elegant Regency Building in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   You can pay from $50 to $1,000 for cocktails, a buffet, dessert,
the screening of a new documentary on hate crimes and the chance to
hear Judy Shepard, the mother of Matthew Shepard, who was strung up
on a fence and murdered in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   I know what some of you are thinking. Cocktails, dessert and a
film about bigotry and violence? The film, called ``Journey to a
Hate Free Millennium,'' is supposed to be inspiring, and Judy
Shepard is definitely inspiring. Still, you'd probably rather be
going out to watch ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is reality, and these are the kinds of social events we
must attend, and for the dumbest reason. State Sen. William
``Pete'' Knight, a Republican from Palmdale, has created a ballot
initiative aimed at defining same-sex marriages out of existence.
</P>
<P>
   Because he and his anti-gay allies have raised $4.9 million to
his opponents' $2.1 million, my wife and I are forced to redefine
where we put our charitable efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The event Thursday is worth it. The people who show up will have
fun. But Knight is forcing us to spend time and money defending
things that shouldn't need defending _ love and stability.
</P>
<P>
   We have to face those who would deny basic rights to marry, deny
children full protection by their parents and deny people the right
to visit loved ones in hospitals. And good-hearted Californians
have to raise and spend money to fight for those rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Knight Initiative is maddening in its petty benightedness.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's own brother was gay and died of AIDS. His son David is
gay. What kind of family values does Pete Knight have?
</P>
<P>
   In a Los Angeles Times column, David Knight wrote of his father,
``I believe, based on my experience, that his is a blind, uncaring,
uninformed knee-jerk reaction to a subject about which he knows
nothing and wants to know nothing, but which serves his political
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Another irony is that the Mormon Church has been a huge
financial supporter of the Knight Initiative. This is a church that
has had its own problems with definitions of marriage, and in the
past suffered violence and prejudice because of those definitions.
</P>
<P>
   Who are they to get on a high horse when polygamy is still
winked at in Utah?
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Knight side already has started airing TV ads aimed at
Latino voters, a key swing bloc. The ads don't knock gays or
lesbians, but show family members celebrating the anniversary of a
set of grandparents and talking about their wonderful traditions of
marriage and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage and family, that's what Proposition 22 is all
about,'' says the narrator.
</P>
<P>
   The backers of the Knight Initiative are very cagey. They know
most people are fair and will respond negatively to ads directly
attacking gays and lesbians and their right to have their marriages
recognized. So they're just giving voters blah-blah-blah about
family values in both Spanish and English.
</P>
<P>
   Those who would fight the forces of Knight must pay for their
own TV ads. That's why money has to be spent on No on Knight
fund-raisers instead of on other causes.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, according to San Francisco Supervisor Mark Leno,
will be to let swing voters know that they can vote against the
Knight Initiative even if they are uncomfortable with the idea of
gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Same-sex marriage already is outlawed in California. The wording
of Proposition 22, Knight's initiative, goes a little further and
bans the recognition of such partnerships. In other states with
Knight-like marriage laws, this has meant the loss of the rights of
marriage, including the loss of the right to raise and protect
children.
</P>
<P>
   There's a baby boom going on among gays and lesbians in
California. If nothing else, voters can agree to let those children
have rights.
</P>
<P>
   And if you can't get to the fund-raiser, you can vote no on
Proposition 22 on March 7. It won't hurt your family a bit, but it
will help other families. Then we can move on to something else.

<HEADLINE>
AT ONLINE BOOK SITES, EVERYBODY'S A CRITIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Literary assassinations. Anonymous rave-ups. Online stalkers.
Cyber-hustlers. Can this be the stuff of 21st-century book
reviewing?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question buzzing through the world of contemporary books,
as many publishing insiders cast an uneasy eye at loosely
regulated, increasingly influential customer review forums provided
by online booksellers such as Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly everyone's a critic. For better and for worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Redundant redundant,'' ``Pffff,'' ``Overstated! Save your
$$$,'' read Amazon.com reader reviews of David Guterson's
phenomenal best-seller ``Snow Falling on Cedars.''
</P>
<P>
   Others describe it as ``a life-altering book'' and ``one of the
best books I have read in years.''
</P>
<P>
   All are anonymous, as are more than half the reviews posted for
this PEN-Faulkner Award-winning Northwest novel.
</P>
<P>
   To some Northwest writers, this critical free-for-all is a
breath of fresh air in a stuffy, button-down book world. The
mouse-click critics, unlike most professional reviewers, may
actually have paid for the book. There are bucks on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writers think of themselves as elite, as an aristocracy,''
says Sherman Alexie, author of ``Reservation Blues'' and ``Indian
Killer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate to think of being judged by the `common' reader. The
fact is, the common reader has a better bullshit detector than most
academic critics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Everyman forums seem the very grist of democracy,
egalitarian playgrounds for ideas. Or are they minefields?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure art should be judged on a democratic basis,''
says best-selling Seattle fantasy writer Terry Brooks. ``I frankly
don't give a damn if my next-door neighbor likes something I like
or not.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received some complaints from authors who are not so
pleased about the average customer being able to say whatever they
like,'' says Laura Dawson, director of content development at
Barnesandnoble.com in New York. ``But this is a new way of selling
books.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a way strewn with pitfalls, suggest skeptics. They smell
something foul in all this literary fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS
</P>
<P>
   It's OK to hate a book, critics of e-criticism say. It's not OK
to gang up on it, to create an online literary lynch mob.
Especially if that lynch mob is anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   But online forums require neither names nor background checks.
One notorious customer review of the Bible was signed, simply,
``God.''
</P>
<P>
   This leaves industry insiders questioning who, exactly, is
writing the reviews. ``Any competing author can send in blind
comments _ with no traceable identification _ to undercut the
competition,'' says Fred Hills, an editor at Simon &AMP; Schuster in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me to be a misuse and an abuse of what was
intended to be a very good idea _ namely, in addition to
professional reviewers, let's hear what actual readers have to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers, stung by negative reviews, talk of anonymous ``drive-by
shootings'' on the sites _ devastating reviews designed to tarnish
reputations and trash book sales. They point to competitors,
personal enemies, unhappy book subjects, even students who flunked
out of an author's college class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get a lot of reviews,'' says Morton M. Denn, a
professor at Levich Institute in New York whose ``Process Fluid
Mechanics'' is used as a college textbook in chemical engineering
classes. ``One day I happened to log on and found this one review,
obviously written by a disgruntled student. It was very negative,
very upsetting to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The headline for the review: ``A lesson in how NOT to teach
fluid mechanics.''
</P>
<P>
   Online editors say they cannot prevent such drive-bys. ``There
is simply nothing we can do _ or should do,'' says Nick Allison,
editor-in-chief for books at Seattle-based Amazon.com. He suggests
a quick cure for such cyber-slams. ``If authors see that happen,
they can don an anonymous hat and post a positive review.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what writer Lev Grossman did when readers began
savaging his book ``Warp'' on Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this book. I highly recommend it,'' he wrote, posing as
``a reader from Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The best debut I've read in ages,'' he wrote, this time as ``a
reader from Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Utterly original ... Don't miss this _ really,'' wrote
Grossman's ``reader from New York.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves even gushing five-star reviews suspect. It could be
a reader, could be a relative. ``The industry rap is that no one
counts the first two reviews,'' says Paul Hilts, technology editor
at Publishers Weekly magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first is from the author or the editor. The second is from
the mom. After that you can start counting.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not. Local writers describe puffery campaigns, where
groups of friends sign onto Amazon to heap praise on an author,
boosting a one-star book to the top, five-star rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person bent on promotion can, with the help of his or her
friends, bombard the net with flares of contrived praise,'' says La
Conner novelist Tom Robbins. ``Conversely, books can be targeted
and attacked by any cadre of jerks with an ax to grind, even if
none of its members has actually read the book in question.''
</P>
<P>
   Reforms are necessary, says Bainbridge Island author Jack Olsen.
``It's such an opportunity for hanky-panky,'' he says. ``At the
very least, you must make these people identify themselves, give
their real names.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to do it, or the abuses are going to get worse and
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   But editors at Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com suggest such
abuses come with the democratic territory of the Internet. It's a
wild new frontier for literary pundits, pirates and poseurs. ``It's
part of the beauty and terror of having something so wide open as
this,'' Allison says.
</P>
<P>
   Abuses are the exception, he says, not the rule. ``I think
ultimately, with several million reviews on the site, the vast,
vast majority of them are genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   REVIEWING THE REVIEWERS
</P>
<P>
   Screening customer reviews is tricky. And online editors are
leary of second-guessing the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't authenticate. We can't require a driver's license and
a photo ID,'' says Allison, who describes Amazon's screening
techniques as confidential. ``People have to submit their name and
e-mail address, but they don't have to post it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the names may be bogus, and the e-mail addresses
fly-by-night. ``People can make up e-mail addresses, or get a
Hotmail address for a day,'' says Barnesandnoble.com's Dawson.
``There can't be any policing of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Both online booksellers post sets of guidelines for reader
reviews, advising against profanity, obscenity, hate remarks,
spiteful comments and ``spoilers'' _ reviews that give away the
endings of books. Both include legal disclaimers on their sites,
although it's not clear who would be held accountable for
slanderous remarks in a court of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a developing area of law,'' says Seattle entertainment
lawyer Neil Sussman. ``If someone uses a chat room, says slanderous
things, posts pornography, threatens the president _ the question
is, can the server be held liable?''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, he says, is still out. ``Some cases have held
servers liable; some are still wending their way to the Supreme
Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, screeners give careful consideration to requests to
take down reviews. ``We get asked by publishers and writers to
retract reviews,'' Allison says, ``but unless it fails to meet one
of the guidelines, we don't take it down just because they don't
like it. It would violate the standard of an open forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawson says Barnesandnoble.com editors investigate strings of
reviews that sound suspiciously similar. Giveaways might be
repeated phrases, misspellings, grammatical errors. The site also
has pulled reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``On occasion,'' Dawson says, ``an author or publisher will tell
us, `We know the person who posted this review and they have a
specific ax to grind, and that, while the review seems OK, it's
not.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We make them offer proof.''
</P>
<P>
   She cites the example of a female author who asked
Barnesandnoble.com to retract a review. The review seemed
innocuous. It appeared to be from her parents. ``She called and
said, `My parents have been dead for years, and this person is
stalking me. It's a death threat.'''
</P>
<P>
   True-crime writer Ann Rule is one author who has taken on reader
reviews. Her latest book, ``And Never Let Her Go,'' is about the
murder case of Delaware attorney Thomas Capano. ``One of the
reviews said my career was over,'' Rule says. ``It was out of
Delaware, so you knew it was from the killer's family. Amazon took
that part out.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Rule: ``These things can really hurt _ both your feelings
and your sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Rule's friend, Donna Anders, asked Amazon.com to retract an
incendiary review of her mass-market paperback, ``Another Life,''
only to have the review reappear five months later. She described
the review _ titled ``Dribble, make that smarmy, plodding dribble''
_ as a personal attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``A genuine review is one thing, but someone who attacks you on
a personal front _ something is wrong,'' Anders says.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com also removed a suspect review of Bainbridge Island
writer Fred Moody's book about virtual reality research at the
University of Washington, titled ``The Visionary Position.'' In a
column for ABCNEWS.com, Moody explained the review was from a
reader who cited certain ``authorities'' claiming the author
fabricated quotes and invented episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out, as I had suspected,'' Moody wrote, ``that the
writer himself is written about in the book, and the people he was
citing as authorities on me were none other than himself.''
</P>
<P>
   A YOU-BLURB-ME, I-BLURB-YOU WORLD
</P>
<P>
   New technology is transforming the book business at a dizzying
pace. New publishing ventures are all over the Net. Suddenly,
writers aren'tdependent on New York publishers. For a buck a month,
they can hawk their e-book off their own Web site at fatbrain.com.
</P>
<P>
   Customer reviews are just one quick-click hit in the literary
revolution. On increasingly sophisticated bookseller Web sites,
browsers can call up staff reviews and capsule comments from
Publishers Weekly, Kirkus and other professional review
publications. They may find comments from authors, editors,
publishers, and chat online with other readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this rich tapestry, this multiplicity of voices,''
Allison says. ``If you spend time looking at a page, you can get a
really good bead on that book.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com even offers customers a chance to create their own
``member profile,'' with a short biography of themselves, samples
of their online reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your member profile could launch you into a professional
review-writing career,'' is the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   If only it were so easy.
</P>
<P>
   National Book Award-winning author and University of Washington
professor Charles Johnson has written scores of reviews for The New
York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post and other
prestigious publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has an opinion about something, and everybody's
opinion seems valuable,'' Johnson says. ``But when it comes to book
reviewing, there is a level of responsibility that seems terribly
important.''
</P>
<P>
   The art of reviewing, he says, is an art learned over time. It
is an art of balance, thoroughness, fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things The New York Times does before you write a
review, they ask you: Are you a personal enemy of this writer? Do
you and the writer have enmity toward each other? You cannot review
the work of a friend,'' Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That automatically takes out the problem of character
assassination, or of misuse of that review space.''
</P>
<P>
   Those standards could be a world removed from the
whatever-dot-com realm of customer reviews. It's one reason
publishing veterans still stick to trusted bylines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider the reader reviews unrepresentative,'' says Seattle
literary agent Elizabeth Wales. ``I would trust them if they were
more like letters to the editor, if I got the sense the editor had
culled through a variety of responses.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even conventional reviews can be tainted. Insiders
describe the book world as an I'll-blurb-you, you-blurb-me place,
where authors swap compliments on the backs of book jackets, where
personal and political agendas color critical opinions, and where
negative reviews may be toned down to appease advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious book critics want to control the dialogue, control the
way in which books are measured,'' Alexie says.
</P>
<P>
   That control may be slipping as customer reviews gain influence
in the publishing world. ``I'm no cyber-pundit, but I think some
people have wondered whether the empowerment of all those people,
the ability of all those people to communicate with each other,
makes professional criticism unnecessary,'' Allison says.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far,'' Allison adds, ``the answer to me appears to be no.''
</P>
<P>
   So far.
</P>
<P>
   POWER TO THE PEOPLE
</P>
<P>
   On a book tour in Italy to promote his latest psychological
thriller, ``Heartbreaker,'' Northwest novelist Robert Ferrigno was
surprised to be asked his response to reviewers' comments.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the question that surprised him. It was the source of
the comments. They were all online reader reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``These isolated readers who dash off a review at 1 a.m.,
suddenly they have a worldwide audience. Suddenly, there's a writer
from Italian Vogue referring to their review,'' Ferrigno says.
</P>
<P>
   Some online book-buyers report they're now changing purchasing
decisions based on customer comments. ``I tend to prefer customer
reviews,'' writes an Amazon.com customer from Seattle.
``Professional reviews tend to get bogged down in themselves, and
sometimes reveal too much of the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Booksellers saw the power of people-speak when an obscure
30-year-old book about a failed Antarctic expedition suddenly
became a hot property. The book, ``Endurance,'' took off after it
was recommended to other readers on the ``Into Thin Air'' customer
review page.
</P>
<P>
   And even as skeptics complain of cyber-sniping and call for
reforms at reader review sites, publishers have begun using
flattering customer reviews on the backs of book jackets. ``It's so
cannibalistic and exploitive in the book world, publishers will
look for any praise to put on a book,'' Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   Walls continue to tumble. And to some, the flying dust and
revolutionary rumble are cause for applause. ``With reader reviews,
you really do get a sense of what average people who actually paid
for your book have to say,'' Ferrigno says. ``You connect with your
readers on some very basic level.''
</P>
<P>
   That's for better and for worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists love to think of themselves as rugged individualists.
But we need our audience,'' Alexie says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, they're who we are working for.''

   CIR-DIGITAL-DIVIDE (Undated) _ Universal access to the Net,
treating computers as the equivalent of telephones, has long been a
goal of many in the computer industry, who are concerned about the
so-called ``digital divide.'' The concern is also self-serving, as
is quickly acknowledged by Silicon Valley executives involved in a
new Clinton administration plan to develop universal computer
access with federal money. But the problem of access to information
is real, and the best solutions very unclear. A look at what this
``divide'' is and what will it take to close it. By Katie Hafner.

   ETHNICITY-HOUSES (Undated) _ As the cultural melting pot seeps
outwards, away from the cities, it brings with it a new kind of
ethnic diversity to the previously all-white enclaves. Nowhere is
this more evident than in the town of Iselin, N.J. By Alastair

   SEED-CATALOG (Union, Conn.) _ By sunrise one day last week, it
was 6 below in this frozen burg. But the wind made it feel like 30
below as it knifed through the pine trees and banged on the metal
doors of a secondhand trailer across from Marilyn Barlow's old
farmhouse. By 8 a.m., this slumbering world was buzzing with the
dreams of spring. The first of hundreds of gardeners started
calling. When would the Select Seeds catalog arrive? Was it too
early to start kiss-me-over-the-garden-gate? (Yes.) What about
poppies? (Scatter them outside, over the snow.) Orders poured in,
by phone and fax, for America, a fragrant, cherry-red-and-white
sweet pea dating to 1896, and for a little fringed
raspberry-scented flower that Napoleon carried from Egypt to
Josephine. Three women hunched over computers, typing in orders,
surrounded by postcards. By Ann Raver.

   NY-DIVORCED-ROOMMATES (New York) _ Breaking up is hard to do,
especially in Manhattan's tight housing market. Faced with the most
expensive rents in the country, skyrocketing co-op prices and a
paltry vacancy rate estimated at less than 1 percent, an increasing
number of Manhattan couples are living together long after their
relationship dies. Call them room-exes; their existence recalls
Soviet-era Moscow, when the chronic housing shortage forced most
divorced couples either to live together or move back in with their
parents. By David Wallis.

   HUMANS-AS-PREY (Helena, Mont.) _ Dan Dodge's 12 year-old son,
Jake, was playing outside the family home in this mountain-ringed
town when his father heard him yell, ``There's a mountain lion!''
Dodge looked out the window to see a dun-colored cat crouched about
30 feet away from a picnic table, moving stealthily toward his son.
Dodge ran to his bedroom, and grabbed a .270-caliber rifle. Firing
from inside the house, he dropped the 115-pound female cat with
several shots. Dodge called to alert the Montana Department of
Fish, Wildlife and Parks, which approved his course of action. Pete
Johnson, the conservation officer who investigated the shooting,
said: ``Lions are unpredictable. If the kid had taken off running
it could have triggered the predatory response in the lion.'' By

BISHOP SPONG GETS A CHANCE TO LISTEN, FOR A CHANGE

 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``Every time Bishop Spong opens his mouth,'' remarked an
Episcopal priest friend shortly after the bishop's last book
appeared, ``a dozen people call and threaten to quit the church.''
 &HT;    This week, my friend can breathe a little easier. On Saturday
(January 29), after 25 years as the Episcopal bishop of Newark,
N.J., the always-controversial John Shelby Spong retires.
 &HT;    Unlike most Episcopalians, who are generally a genial lot, Spong
is the churchman every one loves to hate.
 &HT;    Over the years, he has attacked traditional Christian doctrine
and morality. His publications include: ``Living in Sin? A Bishop
Rethinks Human Sexuality,'' ``Rescuing the Bible from
Fundamentalism,'' ``Resurrection: Myth or Reality?,'' ``Born of a
Woman: A Bishop Rethinks the Virgin Birth,'' and ``Why Christianity
Must Change or Die.''
 &HT;    He has championed women's ordination, same-sex unions and the
ordination of gay and lesbian persons. Throughout, he has become
the nation's most well known -- and notorious -- religious
provocateur.
 &HT;    The bishop's enemies equate him with theological liberalism and
cite him as prime example of its bankruptcy. It is no surprise that
conservative Christians hate him. He has attacked every belief they
cherish and, in their mind, pushed one denomination over the brink
of heresy.
 &HT;    How could any person, in the paid employ of a Christian church,
so gleefully assail its creeds, scriptures and ethics?
 &HT;    But for all his blustering, Spong is neither a true liberal nor
a true theologian. Instead, his new autobiography, ``Here I
Stand,'' proves him a rather illiberal theological popularizer.
 &HT;    Whether the bishop recognizes it or not, his stances have often
harmed those who agree with him on the issues. Although he depicts
himself as a theological gadfly, he is really a sort of
institutional horsefly.
 &HT;    In the months leading up to his retirement, Spong called for a
``New Reformation'' in Christian theology and practice. He argues
that outmoded forms of doctrine and ethics can no longer adequately
express the power and meaning of Christian faith.
 &HT;    In ``Why Christianity Must Change,'' he offered his ``Twelve
Theses'' as a reform agenda arguing, among other things, ``Theism,
as a way of defining God, is dead.''
 &HT;    His autobiography ends with this appeal: ``I urge my successors
in faith to embrace, not to fear, the changes necessary to enable
the Church of the future to be born -- I think a radical
reformation is on our doorstep.''
 &HT;    These insights are neither original nor unique. That theism is
in trouble and that Christianity needs reform are truisms so
obvious that it almost seems ridiculous to state them. And reform
is, in many ways, already occurring. Since the end of World War II,
western Christianity has been undergoing a vast theological and
ethical reorientation that defies simple ``liberal,''
``conservative,'' ``heretical,'' or ``orthodox'' labels.
 &HT;    Many clerics, theologians, and faithful lay persons have
dedicated their lives to thoughtfully guiding Christian
institutions during this challenging time. Old patterns of doing
spiritual business no longer work. Even rather traditional churches
-- such as the bishop's own Episcopal Church -- are experiencing
new waves of creativity in ministry, worship and community.
American church life is being reformed.
 &HT;    But that reformation does not follow a particular agenda.
Sometimes, it takes the form of a local ``community'' church whose
members find spiritual fulfillment in small groups. At other times,
reform expresses itself through walking the labyrinth, silent
retreats and centering prayer.
 &HT;    New interpretations of Jesus -- from ``What Would Jesus Do?'' to
the Jesus Seminar -- are having a powerful impact on theologically
diverse congregations.
 &HT;    Even church conflicts, such as struggle over the role of
homosexual persons in religious life, are reshaping the nature of
faith communities.
 &HT;    In short, Bishop Spong, get with the program. Even those of us
who agree with you on some issues (like gay and lesbian ordination)
do not need your agenda.
 &HT;    Indeed, one of the major problems with contemporary religion is
that it persists in being hierarchical. Having a bishop tell us
that what we should no longer believe is as retrograde as the
biblical fundamentalism you castigate.
 &HT;    Maybe now that you have retired, you can sit in the pews and
listen to us for awhile. We are further along than you suspect. And
we all think you need to shut your mouth.

cherish and, in their mind, pushed one denomination over the brink
of heresy.
 &HT;    How could any person, in the paid employ of a Christian church,
so gleefully assail its creeds, scriptures and ethics?
 &HT;    But for all his blustering, Spong is neither a true liberal nor
a true theologian. Instead, his new autobiography, ``Here I
Stand,'' proves him a rather illiberal theological popularizer.
 &HT;    Whether the bishop recognizes it or not, his stances have often
harmed those who agree with him on the issues. Although he depicts
himself as a theological gadfly, he is really a sort of
institutional horsefly.
 &HT;    In the months leading up to his retirement, Spong called for a
``New Reformation'' in Christian theology and practice. He argues
that outmoded forms of doctrine and ethics can no longer adequately
express the power and meaning of Christian faith.
 &HT;    In ``Why Christianity Must Change,'' he offered his ``Twelve
Theses'' as a reform agenda arguing, among other things, ``Theism,
as a way of defining God, is dead.''
 &HT;    His autobiography ends with this appeal: ``I urge my successors
in faith to embrace, not to fear, the changes necessary to enable
the Church of the future to be born -- I think a radical
reformation is on our doorstep.''
 &HT;    These insights are neither original nor unique. That theism is
in trouble and that Christianity needs reform are truisms so
obvious that it almost seems ridiculous to state them. And reform
is, in many ways, already occurring. Since the end of World War II,
western Christianity has been undergoing a vast theological and
ethical reorientation that defies simple ``liberal,''
``conservative,'' ``heretical,'' or ``orthodox'' labels.
 &HT;    Many clerics, theologians, and faithful lay persons have
dedicated their lives to thoughtfully guiding Christian
institutions during this challenging time. Old patterns of doing
spiritual business no longer work. Even rather traditional churches
-- such as the bishop's own Episcopal Church -- are experiencing
new waves of creativity in ministry, worship and community.
American church life is being reformed.
 &HT;    But that reformation does not follow a particular agenda.
Sometimes, it takes the form of a local ``community'' church whose
members find spiritual fulfillment in small groups. At other times,
reform expresses itself through walking the labyrinth, silent
retreats and centering prayer.
 &HT;    New interpretations of Jesus -- from ``What Would Jesus Do?'' to
the Jesus Seminar -- are having a powerful impact on theologically
diverse congregations.
 &HT;    Even church conflicts, such as struggle over the role of
homosexual persons in religious life, are reshaping the nature of
faith communities.
 &HT;    In short, Bishop Spong, get with the program. Even those of us
who agree with you on some issues (like gay and lesbian ordination)
do not need your agenda.
 &HT;    Indeed, one of the major problems with contemporary religion is
that it persists in being hierarchical. Having a bishop tell us
that what we should no longer believe is as retrograde as the
biblical fundamentalism you castigate.
 &HT;    Maybe now that you have retired, you can sit in the pews and
listen to us for awhile. We are further along than you suspect. And
we all think you need to shut your mouth.

STOCK SHOW NEOPHYTE ENCOUNTERS COW PATTIES AND FUNNEL CAKES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW MARTON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It must be the dry-cleaning tag flapping from my fleece vest. Or
maybe likely the culprits are the evergreen chinos and navy-blue
Hush Puppies. Yes, it has to be those pathetic prep-school pants
spilling on top of citified shoes that betray me as an East Coast
bull in this western china shop.
</P>
<P>
   At the 104th Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show and
Rodeo, somewhere between Cattle Barn No. 1 and the Swine Arena, my
ruse is discovered. Passing a sea of black and white hats, I am
eager to blend in to my newly adopted agrarian fraternity. For
once, I am glad to show off my bow legs, eager to match their
curvature with that of legs that have spent countless hours riding
the range. The lone horse I ever rode was named Valium. But despite
my best intentions, all I can do is broadcast, ``Yankee, Yankee,
Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   I approach my first-time immersion into the Stock Show
subculture with an equal mix of enthusiasm and knock-kneed
trepidation. My life on the East Coast rarely brought me into close
proximity with the animal world. When it did, the results only
worsened its mortality rate. My cat, Whiskers, taught me about
premature rigor mortis. My German shepherd, Wolf, was such a
gorgeous model of purebred perfection that he had every neurotic
ailment possible, including a fatal case of epilepsy. Of course, I
choose to forget my countless encounters with that most repellent
species of all, the Brooks-Brothers-skinned ``excessivis money
grubum.'' Habitat: the jungles of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Transplanted to Fort Worth, I find it possible to deal with the
Dalai Lama one day, Snowflake the llama the next. I prefer
Snowflake, owing to her three stomachs and superior fibers. At the
Stock Show, in the middle of a rush hour of llamas, one species of
the short-haired variety bravely greets me. First, Suzy Que peers
at me with her eyes shining like caramel marbles. Then she begins
to hum and murmur, garbling sweet nothings, I naively believe.
Between her burps, I sense this llama's forgiveness of my
tennis-whites-wearing, East-Coast-suburban roots.
</P>
<P>
   And then this brazen little hussy _ only 2 years old, yet a
sprightly 280 pounds _ smooches me. It's on the cheek, mind you,
because this is our first encounter and she is clearly not that
kind of llama. Hers is a soft peck, dry as a wheat stalk,
surprisingly gentle and a sign of good breeding. At this point we
part, but I have been touched by a llama. Who cares if Snowflake
might need orthodontia. I'm not a husband yet, so animal husbandry
will have to do. I plan on joining the South Central Llama
Association.
</P>
<P>
   I now believe that second only to having a girlfriend offer to
go Dutch is the rare pleasure of having a passel of Nigerian Dwarf
or Boer goats feast on raisins from your hand. Here I am, crouching
in a pen, being gummed into submission by Cricket, Mallory and
Keyana. This marks the first time I've ever been attacked by a pack
of Hoovers with hooves.
</P>
<P>
   Goats, with their satiny white coats and brown headdresses, are
such convivial beings, so ready with a bray of the day. (And for
those with jumpy tummies from eating one-too-many Stock Show cream
puffs, goat's milk is quite the elixir.) I admire the starched
dress-code civility of goat breeders. Whether tall or stubby, stout
or thin, they shun the traditional Stock Show uniform of skin-tight
bluejeans in favor of pressed white shirts and pants. It appears as
if a confab of ice cream salesmen or Long Island croquet
competitors has made a wrong turn, ending up leading a parade of
Toggenburg, Alpine or Oberhasli goats.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no lighthearted congregation. Stern judges from the
Official American Goat Society are keen on inspecting awfully
private goat parts. Such forward behavior makes me blush. Udder
development and haunch sturdiness come under particular scrutiny.
Judges' hands blithely go where no hands really should travel. In
another time, such behavior would earn a slap. Still, the goats are
used to this kind of attention. And, predictably, their masters
begin to resemble them. One white-haired breeder with a receding
chin and a silvery, faint mustache actually shares the same
whiskers and profile as his chin-challenged goat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loose goat, runaway goat,'' rings out from the Sheep Barn.
This is the equivalent of a 911 emergency. I swivel my head to
catch a blur of horn and tail tearing up an aisle. I give chase but
am quickly surpassed by the goat's owner, who finally corrals the
recalcitrant creature. One goat observes all this hullabaloo with
detachment. With all the disdain of a Miami Beach retiree losing at
pinochle, the goat bleats out a grouchy, ``noooooo,'' ``noooooo.''
I feel this goat's pain. I will learn more about what's ailing him
by surfing www.cybergoat.com.
</P>
<P>
   Not really one for counting on reincarnation after my pedestrian
life is done, I still wouldn't mind returning as one of the Stock
Show's animals. Oh, just to spend a day in the tender loving care
of these fawning Homo sapiens. I could think of worse ways of
passing the time than being attentively prodded by 14-year-old
Cayla Monk from Lovelady, Texas. Cayla gives nothing but playful
nudges to Ruby, her 700-pound polled Hereford. Nearby, another
heifer is used as a Barcalounger by its owner. Some beast of
burden.
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, the Stock Show life of a heifer or
goat, a llama, mule or homing pigeon is all about great eats,
staying toasty under a sun lamp, and getting lots of siestas with
some good country pedal steel in the background. And did I mention
the quality hair care?
</P>
<P>
   Stall after stall feels less like a barn and more like a Paul
Mitchell salon. All that's missing are copies of ``People''
magazine and some gossip. Once given a vigorous hair washing in
Ajax lemon cleaner, a Brahman or black Angus heifer receives a
haircut with military-issue shears last seen lopping off Elvis'
pompadour. Then comes the cow-spray, a brand of styling moooouse
perfect for achieving the trend-setting 'do most recently favored
by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince. Now the cow's fur has all
the velvety sheen of a mink stole. What becomes a heifer most?
</P>
<P>
   In another stall across the way, a recently scrubbed heavy-wool
llama is waiting for the final step in her hirsute makeover. For
this blow-drying session, a vacuum cleaner nozzle sends out a
cyclone of wind. No bad llama-hair days here. Not to be
out-primped, one donkey (from CeleBraytion Acres _ get it?) is
being tweezed and manicured until his mane is the very model of
bristle perfection. Once trimmed, this donkey is outfitted in
thermal wear, the better to weather the coming cold front. I last
saw this fleecy get-up riding up a chair lift in Aspen.
</P>
<P>
   Before arriving at the Stock Show, I was given all manner of
scatological warnings about watching my step lest I end up
slip-slidin' away. I started to conclude that FFA stood for future
fertilizer of America. I'm here to report that the toilet training
of the large bovines _ from Limousins to Simmentals _ is
impeccable. Each momentous offering is followed by a speedy scrape
of a shovel and even faster removal. And it is a great canard that
all this waste just adds up to a terrible stench. In fact, the mix
of hay, urine, hair spray, Brut aftershave, beer and bags of
Tostitos produces a strangely alluring perfume.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of my Stock Show day, it is time to prove how much I
belong in the company of once-and-future breeders. It is time to
eat like a real man, avoiding such wimpy Euro-fare as Greek gyros
or chicken Milano. I say, ``Bring it on,'' and on it comes, a
heaping plate of barbecue (sliced, not chunk) with all the
appropriate side-saddles of baked beans, potato salad and plenty of
pepperoncini.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling terribly full of myself, but not so full that I can't
afford dessert, I swagger up to the funnel cake kiosk, my eyes
growing wider as the the hubcap-size cylinder is showered in
confectioner's sugar. I dig deep into my wallet, crumpled dollars
at the ready. And then, on the verge of being admitted into my
long-awaited farming firmament, I commit the ultimate sin.
</P>
<P>
   I ask for half a cake.
</P>
<P>
   The cake-maker's bewildered look brands me with that dreaded,
``You ain't from 'round here'' mark. I slouch away, cramming the
funnel cake into my satchel. Still, I do my best mosey, strangely
content with my Stock Show day. I have mixed with the
hoofed-and-booted classes. I have worn a cowboy hat and escaped
looking like a complete moron.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be back next year. I'll be driving a dually, sporting a
buckskin hat, some Justins, jeans so tight they'll require a
crowbar to remove, and a belt buckle the size of Abilene.
</P>
<P>
   And I'll take the cake. All of it.

SOURDOUGH BREAD YOU MAKE IN DAYS, NOT IN AN INSTANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, we're tackling sourdough bread from starter to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Rohde from Rhome, Texas, sent us the requested recipe for a
sourdough starter using instant mashed-potato flakes and
instructions for three variations of the bread.
</P>
<P>
   INSTANT-POTATO SOURDOUGH BREAD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starter:
</P>
<P>
   3 packets yeast
</P>
<P>
   1 cup warm water
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons instant mashed-potato flakes
</P>
<P>
   Combine ingredients. Let stand on counter for 8 to 12 hours,
then refrigerate for at least 3 days and no longer than 5 days.
Remove from refrigerator and follow Step One. The first feeding of
starter doesn't usually produce a sweet-enough bread. Discard 1 cup
and refrigerate as in Step One. The next batch will produce great
bread.
</P>
<P>
   Step One:
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons instant mashed-potato flakes
</P>
<P>
   Add these ingredients to starter. After feeding, let starter
stand at room temperature for 8 to 12 hours. Starter will be very
bubbly. Remove 1 1/2 cups to make bread and return remaining
starter to refrigerator. Keep in refrigerator 3 to 7 days and feed
again. If you're not making bread, you may throw away 1 cup of the
starter. You must remove 1 cup every time you feed the starter.
</P>
<P>
   Step Two:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups starter
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup corn oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup warm water
</P>
<P>
   6 cups bread flour or unbleached white flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Combine all ingredients in a large bowl to make a stiff batter.
</P>
<P>
   Grease another bowl and transfer dough to that bowl. Turn dough
over (greased side up) and cover lightly with foil. Let stand
overnight, at least 8 hours. Do not refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   Step Three:
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, punch down dough and knead 8 to 10 times.
Divide dough into 2 loaves and put into 2 greased loaf pans. Brush
tops with vegetable oil. Cover with wax paper and let rise at least
5 hours and as long as all day. Dough rises very slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Step Four:
</P>
<P>
   Bake in 350-degree oven for 30-45 minutes. Remove and brush with
butter, cool on rack. Wrap well and store. This keeps best in the
refrigerator, and it freezes well.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritional analysis per slice, figuring 10 slices per loaf: 240
calories, 6 grams fat, 42 grams carbohydrates, 5 grams protein, 0
cholesterol, 123 milligrams sodium, 23 percent of calories from
fat.
</P>
<P>
   Variations:
</P>
<P>
   Oat bran bread: Replace 2 cups flour with oat bran flour or
cereal, and add 1/2 cup rolled oats. This makes a very coarse bread
that doesn't rise as much, but it is great for sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Whole-wheat bread: Replace 2 cups flour with whole-wheat flour
or replace all the flour with whole-wheat-blend flour. You can also
mix oat bran with whole-wheat flour. To do that, use 1 cup bran, 2
cups whole wheat and 3 cups bread flour. This bread is great for
toast or sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Cinnamon bread: Make the recipe for white bread. Before putting
loaves in pan, flatten dough into a circle and sprinkle with
cinnamon and sugar. Roll bread up, place in loaf pans, and bake
bread in same way.  &QL;

&HT;     FRIVOLITY BEFORE SUPER BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There is surely not a sillier day on the American
sports calendar than the Tuesday before the Super Bowl. That's the
date designated as Photo and Interview Day by the NFL, a day when
the collective IQ ratchets down to the level of a houseplant.
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to rhododendrons everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a stream of mostly unrelated quotes wending
their way through the annual goat rope at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   While out of context and rather meritless on their own, they
reveal what various Tennessee Titans and St. Louis Rams are
thinking as they prepare for Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   Standing with his massive arms folded across his chest, Rams
defensive tackle Jeff Zgonina surveyed a woman from MTV wearing a
pink tube top and pink paisley pants and said, ``There's nothing
serious about this. You have a bunch of guys who come down here to
party all week, write a few newspaper articles and ask a fat man
like me about football. You can't take it serious or it'll drive
you crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next breath he was off and talking about the performance
of the Rams' defense in the NFC Championship Game against Tampa
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally won a game for our team,'' Zgonina said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offense has bailed us out enough times. We finally held up our
end of the bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of bargains, that's what Rams punter Mike Horan did on
Sunday night to arrange flights for his family to come to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get on priceline.com so they could get tickets to
come here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Titans tackle Brad Hopkins had his mind on his toe, which is
injured and going untreated. The toe, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why I don't attract attention to the fact I have
turf toe is I'd have to come in for treatment,'' he said, using
unassailable logic. ``I got eight million other things to do. I
don't want to come in and put my foot in a bucket of ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Todd Collins, one of his linebackers, Rams coach
Dick Vermeil said, ``Swamp chicken?'' (Sounds like something you'd
find on a menu in a New Orleans restaurant.) Asked about another of
his linebackers, London Fletcher, Vermeil said, ``London Fletcher
is way beyond a story. He's real. He's nonfiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Rams defensive tackle Nate Hobgood-Chittick has a name
that sounds like a fictional character in a British novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hobgood is my mother's name and Chittick is my father's
name,'' he said. ``When my brother was born, they gave him both
names. I was 6. My mother asked me if I wanted to do it, too. What
are you going to say when you're 6? Chittick is Danish. It means
`baby face,' which is fitting for me because I got fat cheeks. I
don't know what Hobgood is.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobgood-Chittick is one of defensive tackle D'Marco Farr's
teammates. Farr grew up in Richmond, Calif., and went to the
University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Bay Area kid,'' he said. ``I miss going to Blondie's
Pizza after games. I didn't want to go to Cal. I sensed something
bigger was going on at Washington. I haven't looked back since.
Three Rose Bowls, a national championship and a degree. And I met
my wife there. Can't go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with MTV, Comedy Central and HBO, somebody gave a
credential to Christian TV, which caught up with Titans wide
receiver Chris Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christ means the world to me,'' he said. ``It says if you love
me, obey me. You can do all things through Christ. All things are
possible through Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders took a different tack in praising teammate Bruce
Matthews, who is about as old as some of the characters in the
Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in the league for 200 years now and he's in the
Super Bowl for the first time,'' Sanders said. ``That's what makes
the Super Bowl so special.''
</P>
<P>
   Picking up the theme himself, Matthews, a 17-year veteran who
has played more games on the offensive line than anybody in NFL
history, said, ``I've got to give God the credit. I've been blessed
with a body that stands up to the pounding. My diet of
cheeseburgers and Diet Cokes is only going to carry you so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Praise the Lord and pass the cheeseburgers. The Titans certainly
gave thanks for the play that won their wild card game against
Buffalo, a kickoff return for a touchdown off a lateral that is
called ``Home run throwback.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the season started, we started working on it more and
more and it became one of our returns,'' wide receiver Derrick
Mason said. ``As the season went on we got more and more
comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-interview with Comedy Central, Tennessee defensive end
Mike Frederick was goaded into saying, ``That's why we wear these
tight pants. They're sweet.'' Afterward, he said, ``That could have
been the highlight of my entire trip. I'm sure I'll look like a
complete idiot. They're in the business of making you look like an
idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie George's mother made sure her son was no idiot. She pulled
the future Tennessee Titans running back out of high school in
Philadelphia and sent him to Fork Union Military Academy in
Virginia for a little discipline and direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother put me in an environment where I saw guys have
success and go to college,'' he said. ``That changed my whole
mind-set.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to Ohio State, won the Heisman Trophy and is now in
the Super Bowl. Thanks, mom.
</P>

   As for the Rams being favored to win the Super Bowl, George
said, ``That's why they have Las Vegas, so they can make the bets.
That's fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's fine and frivolous and feckless and fulsome all at the same
time. It's the silliest day of the year on the sports calendar.

STOCK SHOW NEOPHYTE ENCOUNTERS COW PATTIES AND FUNNEL CAKES
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Resending to remove extraneous word in lede) By ANDREW MARTON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It must be the dry-cleaning tag flapping from my fleece vest. Or
maybe the culprits are the evergreen chinos and navy-blue Hush
Puppies. Yes, it has to be those pathetic prep-school pants
spilling on top of citified shoes that betray me as an East Coast
bull in this western china shop.
</P>
<P>
   At the 104th Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show and
Rodeo, somewhere between Cattle Barn No. 1 and the Swine Arena, my
ruse is discovered. Passing a sea of black and white hats, I am
eager to blend in to my newly adopted agrarian fraternity. For
once, I am glad to show off my bow legs, eager to match their
curvature with that of legs that have spent countless hours riding
the range. The lone horse I ever rode was named Valium. But despite
my best intentions, all I can do is broadcast, ``Yankee, Yankee,
Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   I approach my first-time immersion into the Stock Show
subculture with an equal mix of enthusiasm and knock-kneed
trepidation. My life on the East Coast rarely brought me into close
proximity with the animal world. When it did, the results only
worsened its mortality rate. My cat, Whiskers, taught me about
premature rigor mortis. My German shepherd, Wolf, was such a
gorgeous model of purebred perfection that he had every neurotic
ailment possible, including a fatal case of epilepsy. Of course, I
choose to forget my countless encounters with that most repellent
species of all, the Brooks-Brothers-skinned ``excessivis money
grubum.'' Habitat: the jungles of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Transplanted to Fort Worth, I find it possible to deal with the
Dalai Lama one day, Snowflake the llama the next. I prefer
Snowflake, owing to her three stomachs and superior fibers. At the
Stock Show, in the middle of a rush hour of llamas, one species of
the short-haired variety bravely greets me. First, Suzy Que peers
at me with her eyes shining like caramel marbles. Then she begins
to hum and murmur, garbling sweet nothings, I naively believe.
Between her burps, I sense this llama's forgiveness of my
tennis-whites-wearing, East-Coast-suburban roots.
</P>
<P>
   And then this brazen little hussy _ only 2 years old, yet a
sprightly 280 pounds _ smooches me. It's on the cheek, mind you,
because this is our first encounter and she is clearly not that
kind of llama. Hers is a soft peck, dry as a wheat stalk,
surprisingly gentle and a sign of good breeding. At this point we
part, but I have been touched by a llama. Who cares if Snowflake
might need orthodontia. I'm not a husband yet, so animal husbandry
will have to do. I plan on joining the South Central Llama
Association.
</P>
<P>
   I now believe that second only to having a girlfriend offer to
go Dutch is the rare pleasure of having a passel of Nigerian Dwarf
or Boer goats feast on raisins from your hand. Here I am, crouching
in a pen, being gummed into submission by Cricket, Mallory and
Keyana. This marks the first time I've ever been attacked by a pack
of Hoovers with hooves.
</P>
<P>
   Goats, with their satiny white coats and brown headdresses, are
such convivial beings, so ready with a bray of the day. (And for
those with jumpy tummies from eating one-too-many Stock Show cream
puffs, goat's milk is quite the elixir.) I admire the starched
dress-code civility of goat breeders. Whether tall or stubby, stout
or thin, they shun the traditional Stock Show uniform of skin-tight
bluejeans in favor of pressed white shirts and pants. It appears as
if a confab of ice cream salesmen or Long Island croquet
competitors has made a wrong turn, ending up leading a parade of
Toggenburg, Alpine or Oberhasli goats.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no lighthearted congregation. Stern judges from the
Official American Goat Society are keen on inspecting awfully
private goat parts. Such forward behavior makes me blush. Udder
development and haunch sturdiness come under particular scrutiny.
Judges' hands blithely go where no hands really should travel. In
another time, such behavior would earn a slap. Still, the goats are
used to this kind of attention. And, predictably, their masters
begin to resemble them. One white-haired breeder with a receding
chin and a silvery, faint mustache actually shares the same
whiskers and profile as his chin-challenged goat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loose goat, runaway goat,'' rings out from the Sheep Barn.
This is the equivalent of a 911 emergency. I swivel my head to
catch a blur of horn and tail tearing up an aisle. I give chase but
am quickly surpassed by the goat's owner, who finally corrals the
recalcitrant creature. One goat observes all this hullabaloo with
detachment. With all the disdain of a Miami Beach retiree losing at
pinochle, the goat bleats out a grouchy, ``noooooo,'' ``noooooo.''
I feel this goat's pain. I will learn more about what's ailing him
by surfing www.cybergoat.com.
</P>
<P>
   Not really one for counting on reincarnation after my pedestrian
life is done, I still wouldn't mind returning as one of the Stock
Show's animals. Oh, just to spend a day in the tender loving care
of these fawning Homo sapiens. I could think of worse ways of
passing the time than being attentively prodded by 14-year-old
Cayla Monk from Lovelady, Texas. Cayla gives nothing but playful
nudges to Ruby, her 700-pound polled Hereford. Nearby, another
heifer is used as a Barcalounger by its owner. Some beast of
burden.
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, the Stock Show life of a heifer or
goat, a llama, mule or homing pigeon is all about great eats,
staying toasty under a sun lamp, and getting lots of siestas with
some good country pedal steel in the background. And did I mention
the quality hair care?
</P>
<P>
   Stall after stall feels less like a barn and more like a Paul
Mitchell salon. All that's missing are copies of ``People''
magazine and some gossip. Once given a vigorous hair washing in
Ajax lemon cleaner, a Brahman or black Angus heifer receives a
haircut with military-issue shears last seen lopping off Elvis'
pompadour. Then comes the cow-spray, a brand of styling moooouse
perfect for achieving the trend-setting 'do most recently favored
by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince. Now the cow's fur has all
the velvety sheen of a mink stole. What becomes a heifer most?
</P>
<P>
   In another stall across the way, a recently scrubbed heavy-wool
llama is waiting for the final step in her hirsute makeover. For
this blow-drying session, a vacuum cleaner nozzle sends out a
cyclone of wind. No bad llama-hair days here. Not to be
out-primped, one donkey (from CeleBraytion Acres _ get it?) is
being tweezed and manicured until his mane is the very model of
bristle perfection. Once trimmed, this donkey is outfitted in
thermal wear, the better to weather the coming cold front. I last
saw this fleecy get-up riding up a chair lift in Aspen.
</P>
<P>
   Before arriving at the Stock Show, I was given all manner of
scatological warnings about watching my step lest I end up
slip-slidin' away. I started to conclude that FFA stood for future
fertilizer of America. I'm here to report that the toilet training
of the large bovines _ from Limousins to Simmentals _ is
impeccable. Each momentous offering is followed by a speedy scrape
of a shovel and even faster removal. And it is a great canard that
all this waste just adds up to a terrible stench. In fact, the mix
of hay, urine, hair spray, Brut aftershave, beer and bags of
Tostitos produces a strangely alluring perfume.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of my Stock Show day, it is time to prove how much I
belong in the company of once-and-future breeders. It is time to
eat like a real man, avoiding such wimpy Euro-fare as Greek gyros
or chicken Milano. I say, ``Bring it on,'' and on it comes, a
heaping plate of barbecue (sliced, not chunk) with all the
appropriate side-saddles of baked beans, potato salad and plenty of
pepperoncini.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling terribly full of myself, but not so full that I can't
afford dessert, I swagger up to the funnel cake kiosk, my eyes
growing wider as the the hubcap-size cylinder is showered in
confectioner's sugar. I dig deep into my wallet, crumpled dollars
at the ready. And then, on the verge of being admitted into my
long-awaited farming firmament, I commit the ultimate sin.
</P>
<P>
   I ask for half a cake.
</P>
<P>
   The cake-maker's bewildered look brands me with that dreaded,
``You ain't from 'round here'' mark. I slouch away, cramming the
funnel cake into my satchel. Still, I do my best mosey, strangely
content with my Stock Show day. I have mixed with the
hoofed-and-booted classes. I have worn a cowboy hat and escaped
looking like a complete moron.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be back next year. I'll be driving a dually, sporting a
buckskin hat, some Justins, jeans so tight they'll require a
crowbar to remove, and a belt buckle the size of Abilene.
</P>
<P>
   And I'll take the cake. All of it.

&HT;     UNOLYMPIC CITY BETTER SUITED FOR SUPER BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To the rest of the world, Atlanta is this year's Super
Bowl city. To me, though, it will always be the flawed Olympic City
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttling about town the other day in brand new coaches (a far
cry from the relics and rattletraps used more than three years ago)
recalled a city in the throes of something completely different.
Atlanta can do the Super Bowl. It had less success doing the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it deconstructed its Olympic Stadium to make way
for, ugh, a baseball park named in honor not of Hank Aaron but the
man who married Jane Fonda. The place where Michael Johnson threw
down a 200-meter dash for the ages is now home to guys who chew,
spit and scratch and call John Rocker a teammate. Double ugh.
</P>
<P>
   A downtown building called the Inforum, which served as the Main
Press Center for the Olympics, overlooks Centennial Olympic Park.
The place doesn't carry the historical freight of Dealey Plaza in
Dallas, but it is nonetheless somber riding along the street that
separates the park from what was the press center. Two people died
that night and others were injured in a bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the bombing in Centennial Park, I remember looking
out the window of the Inforum to see federal agents on their hands
and knees combing the grass for bomb fragments and other clues to a
crime that remains unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   The memory comes in color. The tags agents used to mark evidence
were pink.
</P>
<P>
   Except for lightly used Centennial Park, there's not much
evidence that the Olympics were once here. There's a banner in the
main terminal of the airport reminding visitors of the event and
another hanging from a building on the Georgia Tech campus, which
served as the Olympic Village and which was about as hard to get
into as Fort Knox.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation problems, tacky commercialism and the bombing
made Atlanta's Olympics something less than glorious. It was still
the Olympics but the city where it was held was not Olympian in
stature.
</P>
<P>
   Better Atlanta should host the Super Bowl and leave the grandeur
to cities that are truly grand.

   CIR-WEB-LIVE-HELP (Undated) _ Many companies are making it
possible for e-commerce sites to pipe live customer service
representatives to shoppers over the Internet, but icontact.com is
pushing the idea much further. Instead of waiting for a befuddled
online shopper to press a help button on the computer screen,
icontact.com's technology lets human helpers _ the company calls
them ``Netreps'' _ hover unseen in the background but able to
contact Web shoppers, many of whom believe they are browsing the
Net unobserved. If the technology becomes more widespread, online
consumers may soon experience an unprecedented level of service
and, some might say, an unprecedented level of intrusion. By Michel
Marriott.

   CIR-DIGITAL-DIVIDE (Undated) _ Universal access to the Net,
treating computers as the equivalent of telephones, has long been a
goal of many in the computer industry, who are concerned about the
so-called ``digital divide.'' The concern is also self-serving, as
is quickly acknowledged by Silicon Valley executives involved in a
new Clinton administration plan to develop universal computer
access with federal money. But the problem of access to information
is real, and the best solutions very unclear. A look at what this
``divide'' is and what will it take to close it. By Katie Hafner.

Apple iTools. Apple takes advantage of its control over its

   SEED-CATALOG (Union, Conn.) _ By sunrise one day last week, it
was 6 below in this frozen burg. But the wind made it feel like 30
below as it knifed through the pine trees and banged on the metal
doors of a secondhand trailer across from Marilyn Barlow's old
farmhouse. By 8 a.m., this slumbering world was buzzing with the
dreams of spring. The first of hundreds of gardeners started
calling. When would the Select Seeds catalog arrive? Was it too
early to start kiss-me-over-the-garden-gate? (Yes.) What about
poppies? (Scatter them outside, over the snow.) Orders poured in,
by phone and fax, for America, a fragrant, cherry-red-and-white
sweet pea dating to 1896, and for a little fringed
raspberry-scented flower that Napoleon carried from Egypt to
Josephine. Three women hunched over computers, typing in orders,

   NY-DIVORCED-ROOMMATES (New York) _ Breaking up is hard to do,
especially in Manhattan's tight housing market. Faced with the most
expensive rents in the country, skyrocketing co-op prices and a
paltry vacancy rate estimated at less than 1 percent, an increasing
number of Manhattan couples are living together long after their
relationship dies. Call them room-exes; their existence recalls
Soviet-era Moscow, when the chronic housing shortage forced most
divorced couples either to live together or move back in with their
parents. By David Wallis.

   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Leslie
Land.

<P>
   HUMANS-AS-PREY (Helena, Mont.) _ Dan Dodge's 12 year-old son,
Jake, was playing outside the family home in this mountain-ringed
town when his father heard him yell, ``There's a mountain lion!''
Dodge looked out the window to see a dun-colored cat crouched about
30 feet away from a picnic table, moving stealthily toward his son.
Dodge ran to his bedroom, and grabbed a .270-caliber rifle. Firing
from inside the house, he dropped the 115-pound female cat with
several shots. Dodge called to alert the Montana Department of
Fish, Wildlife and Parks, which approved his course of action. Pete
Johnson, the conservation officer who investigated the shooting,
said: ``Lions are unpredictable. If the kid had taken off running
it could have triggered the predatory response in the lion.'' By

great writers have long ceased their creative output, but this
April in his eighty fifth year, the Nobel prize winning author Saul
Bellow is set to publish his first major novel in over a decade.
Not only that, but Bellow has also become a father again at the age

Viking in April, is based on the life of his friend Allan Bloom,
the conservative thinker and professor of political philosophy who

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time the truth came out: Journalists are a dark-humored
bunch. Believe it or not, we usually try to restrain that tendency,
limiting it to office talk rather than putting it in print.
Sometimes, though, things happen.
</P>
<P>
   A recent thing that happened was the death last week of Hedy
Lamarr, the sultry actress of the '30s, '40s and '50s. Many of us
were unaware that Lamarr was still alive _ after all, she hadn't
made a movie since 1954. That got us wondering; what other
celebrities are alive whom we believe are dead, and vice versa?
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, we wonder about this a lot, but seldom do we get to do
something about it in print. It's like a true-false quiz, only in
this case it's a dead/not-dead quiz. By the way, we had to look up
quite a few of these ourselves.

SMOOTH JAZZ TRUMPETS ITS SUCCESS AT BASS HALL AWARDS SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Ten years ago, Dave Koz was a young
saxophonist who had no intention of making jazz his career.
</P>
<P>
   A fan of artists including Steely Dan, the Crusaders, Genesis,
George Benson and Santana, Koz was recruited to play in a band led
by his friend, multi-instrumentalist Jeff Lorber, and then urged
again to make his own recording.
</P>
<P>
   That first CD sold 300,000 copies, an astonishing number for
Koz. He acknowledges that the success came largely because he was
at the right place at the right time with the right relaxed,
light-but-funky sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was right when smooth jazz had really begun to take
hold,'' he says. ``The music was like a little club you could
belong to. And I've been on the bus ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it what you will _ smooth jazz, oasis jazz, contemporary
jazz _ the creamy, jazz-plus-pop music of Koz, Lorber, the
Rippingtons, the recently deceased Grover Washington Jr., George
Benson, Kenny G, Boney James and dozens more exploded in popularity
during the late '80s and '90s, finding a wide niche among aging
rock, jazz and R&AMP;B fans who wanted something melodic and positive
to listen to.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth-jazz stations are in all major radio markets, superstars
such as Kenny G (formerly Kenneth Gorelick, another Lorber band
alumni) play arenas and large clubs, and more than 35 million
smooth jazz CDs are sold every year.
</P>
<P>
   This week the smooth jazz capital is Fort Worth, where the
inaugural Oasis Smooth Jazz Awards will be held Friday night at the
Bass Performance Hall. This will be the first awards show devoted
solely to smooth jazz music.
</P>
<P>
   Awards in 20 categories _ from Smooth Jazz Artist of the Year to
Best Song, Best CD to Best Live Venue _ will be presented. Koz, the
show's host, will play, as will Rick Braun, Lorber, Peter White,
Kirk Whalum, Richard Elliot and others.
</P>
<P>
   The second half of the show will be full sets by the Rippingtons
and Koz. Bill Paddock, one of the show's producers, says the Oasis
Awards will be broadcast in ``two to three months'' on a network
yet to be determined; there will also be a compilation CD of music
from nominees and the actual show; and this summer, several winners
and nominees will go on a 25-city tour.
</P>
<P>
   Such recognition for smooth jazz has been a long time coming _
and far longer than the 13 or so years that the music has been a
recognizable format.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smooth jazz is a chameleon,'' says Paddock, a partner in the
Oasis Group, the company producing the awards show. ``If you need a
stress-reducer, it's great; at the same time, it has a groove to
it. And the Oasis (radio station KOAI/107.5 FM) and Caravan of
Dreams are the reasons Fort Worth/Dallas is such a major market for
it. The Oasis has been providing the music to the public for years,
and the Caravan is a phenomenal place that the artists love to
play. They love the fact that it's so intimate and has such great
sound.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, smooth jazz is extremely flexible, with a root system
that stretches from the swinging jazz/R&AMP;B of '50s/'60s organ-led
small combos by the likes of Jimmy Smith to the aggressive fusion
of Return to Forever in the '70s to the Latin rock of Santana to
the pop/jazz of Steely Dan to the wide-ranging Crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   These cross-currents spawned numerous smooth jazz stars, from
Washington to George Duke to the Crusaders' Joe Sample. And though
it wasn't called smooth jazz then, the music's sound (jazz/pop, and
often instrumental) was around in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Chuck Mangione's ``Feels So Good,'' or George Benson's
cover of ``On Broadway?'' Both were airbrushed jazz songs that
crossed over into pop territory.
</P>
<P>
   The audience for a smoother brand of pop-oriented jazz grew,
even as New Age music grew apace. The two came together in the
mid-'80s and found a small but growing audience. Radio stations
featuring the format sprang up, the first being the Wave, KTWV/94.7
FM, in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal, Koz says, was multifaceted and found two homes: In
aging urban fans who had hung in there with guys like Roy Ayers and
the Crusaders (and now also loved Sade and Luther Vandross) and
what Koz calls ``disenfranchised'' rock fans, people in their 30s
and early 40s, looking for something a bit more relaxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who doesn't really understand all the complexities of
jazz can feel they're being challenged at least a little,'' he
says. ``It's real guys, real musicians playing music and writing
songs. They're making music people can put on at a dinner party or
on Saturday morning or driving in their car. That's what I think of
when I'm making my CDs.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-'90s, Kenny G had become the most popular saxophonist
of all time, acts such as George Duke and Jonathan Butler could
pack Fort Worth's Caravan of Dreams and other top-flight clubs any
night of the week, and package tours showcasing younger artists
were sometimes playing arenas and outdoor amphitheaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This music has huge demographic appeal,'' says Carol Archer,
the smooth jazz editor for ``Radio and Records,'' a trade
publication covering the music broadcast industries. ``It's the
only genre of music listened to equally among black and white and
men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   Although smooth jazz is extremely popular _ Paddock says it has
about 13 million regular listeners _ it also reached was Koz calls
a crisis situation: Younger artists are not capturing the sort of
sales that classic smooth-jazz artists such as Koz, Kenny G and
others have.
</P>
<P>
   ``A song may have huge airplay, but that doesn't mean people buy
the CD,'' says Koz. ``We need more of a star-making mentality. We
have to make the personality of our people known, rather than just
a song.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to create an identity between the artist and the
person listening to it, and that can be hard because this is often
instrumental music. That's the only way the genre will survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jazz expert Art Good agrees, saying that the music is keeping
its original audience, but not drawing people in their 20s and 30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smooth jazz stations don't play a lot of young artists any
more,'' says Good, president of JazzTrax, a syndicated jazz radio
show that also sponsors several jazz festivals. ``And they're not
necessarily playing the music people want to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, people in their 30s need something new, and
that's where smooth jazz is missing it. They would get interested
in this format, but not if they're just listening to the same old
artists.''
</P>
<P>
   But that, says Koz, is the strength of the Oasis Awards, and why
he's so enthusiastic about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this show can help define smooth jazz as a genre
that's here to stay,'' he says. ``That's why it couldn't come at a
better time. It's an event we can all rally around.''

<P>
   ``Don't think for a moment that this little look at the history
is going to capture it all because it's happening right now, even
as we sit here.'' That insight is courtesy of Dr. Robert Metcalfe,
a computer network pioneer and technology pundit who holds forth in
``The Internet: Behind the Web,'' a new documentary from the
History Channel.
</P>
<P>
   He's right, of course, but the hourlong program does present an
extremely user-friendly snapshot of the initial development of the
Internet and its influence and impact over the past 30 years. The
show concerns itself with the early days of the Net; its most
visible aspect, the World Wide Web, is brought into the narrative
toward the end.
</P>
<P>
   While computer science can be a dense topic for prime time, this
documentary distills the complicated history fairly well. The
program wrestles technical concepts like packet sharing and the
TCP/IP protocol into bite-size chunks that will go down fairly
easily for the casual observer who doesn't know much about networks
but is hooked on e-mail and online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   As ``The Internet: Behind the Web'' explains, the Soviets'
launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 brought about an epiphany
among complacent Americans, who decided that it was time to get
serious about science, lest they fall behind and be conquered by
the communists. The space race was kicked into gear, as well as the
federal government's interest in computer science. In 1958, the
administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower created both the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, for the rocket scientists, as
well as the Advanced Research Projects Agency, for other types of
government-financed exploration.
</P>
<P>
   One of ARPA's projects was the creation of a computer network
that could withstand damage from a catastrophic nuclear attack by
automatically rerouting digital messages to get them to the right
place. The agency was allocated $1 million in 1969 to create such a
network. That led to the eventual creation of the Arpanet, which
begat the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the subjects of many historical documentaries, many of
the Internet's creators and benefactors are still alive. The
program includes commentaries by notables like Ray Tomlinson, the
engineer who first put the (at) symbol into e-mail addresses, and
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web. It is refreshing to see
such innovators give their accounts in their own words, instead of
seeing the usual treatment of still photos and voice-overs.
</P>
<P>
   Since this documentary comes from the History Channel, plenty of
archival footage is woven in among the experts' commentaries. When
the show deals with the state of computer science in the 1960s, for
example, clips of Vietnam War protests, civil rights demonstrations
and lunar missions flit by on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the historical clips tend to be a bit melodramatic, like
the jolting atomic explosions featured during a discussion of
America's Cold War rivalry with the Soviet Union. Even more
curious, though, is the repeated use of what appears to be a clip
from the 1956 film ``Earth vs. the Flying Saucers''; it shows
disk-shaped alien ships, now a cliche, zooming down and chopping
off the Washington Monument at the base. Although the clip is
amusing the first time it is shown, when the program's narration is
discussing the state of computers and space science in postwar
America, it grows a little silly with repetition.
</P>
<P>
   (The clip may also have the unintended effect of making the
viewer realize just how derivative the 1996 movie ``Independence
Day'' actually was.)
</P>
<P>
   The program covers a lot of ground. One point that would have
been interesting to explore further was the influence of the
academic community on the Internet's early culture. The cooperative
spirit of those early years seems a far cry from the often-crass
commercialism on the Web these days.
</P>
<P>
   Technically advanced viewers may find the show's script
simplistic, but they are obviously not the target audience. Any
Luddites watching get a chance to feel smug when a piece of trivia
appears before one of the commercial breaks: ``On Sept. 2, 1969,
the first message was sent between nodes on the Arpanet. It was
also the first Arpanet crash.''

AUTOMAKERS' HOPES KEEP ON TRUCKIN'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ All-new minivans from DaimlerChrysler, a new large
sport-utility from Toyota, a mini-SUV/wagon from Pontiac and a
hybrid Chevrolet vehicle that is part sport-utility, part pickup
were among the stars at the annual North American International
Auto Show in Detroit's Cobo Hall.
</P>
<P>
   This is the nation's largest show, probably because Detroit is
the home to General Motors, Ford and the U.S. operations of
DaimlerChrysler, the automakers that made up what once were known
as The Big Three (before Germany's Daimler-Benz gobbled up Chrysler
Corp.).
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the list of debuts at this year's show, it's clear
that the former Big Three had to share the stage with some
out-of-town houseguests. Many of the world's other automakers,
particularly the Japanese, seem to enjoy parading their new
products before the 5,000 or more motor journalists who show up.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota took center stage with a vehicle clearly designed to take
on the venerable Chevrolet Suburban. Called the Sequoia, this new
full-size sport-utility vehicle won't go on sale until early next
year. But General Motors had better watch out; this new guy is
going to be a contender.
</P>
<P>
   If Toyota follows through with its promise to make the Sequoia's
price competitive with those of other mainstream, full-size SUVs _
that is, the Suburban and its clone, the GMC Yukon XL, as well as
the Chevy Tahoe/GMC Yukon and the Ford Expedition/Lincoln Navigator
_ this vehicle is likely to take some business from them.
</P>
<P>
   Built on the same chassis as the new Toyota Tundra full-size
pickup, the Sequoia gives Toyota its first real contender in the
rapidly growing full-size sport-utility market.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Toyota has been selling the Land Cruiser and its clone,
the Lexus LX470, for several years. But those vehicles are priced
above $50,000, out of reach of mainstream, full-size SUV buyers.
The Sequoia goes head-to-head with vehicles produced for the mass
market.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of. Vehicles in the $28,000-$40,000 range _ which is
where the Suburban, Yukon, Tahoe and Expedition play _ are beyond
the reach of many of us, too. But GM is selling nearly 200,000
Suburbans a year, which makes this Texas icon a prime target for a
mass-market vehicle such as the Sequoia. Toyota expects first-year
sales to be about 60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Powered by a 4.7-liter V-8 engine based on the power plant used
in the upscale Lexus LS400 sedan, the Sequoia will seat up to eight
people, and will be available in two- and four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   It will find success because baby-boomers perceive Toyota to
offer quality, dependability and longevity. I've felt all along
that some of the intense brand loyalty among Suburban owners would
fall by the wayside if a worthy competitor were to come along, and
to some extent that has happened with the Expedition/Navigator and
Ford's newest SUV, the behemoth Excursion.
</P>
<P>
   NEW MINIVANS _ Chrysler Corp. took the minivan mainstream with
the introduction of the Plymouth Voyager and Dodge Caravan in the
early '80s (followed by the Chrysler Town &AMP; Country, an upscale
version).
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the minivan has been the company's bread-and-butter
vehicle, with more than 8 million sold. And even with the switch
many families are making to sport-utilities, the market for the
vans remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   New entries _ particularly from Japan, such as the Honda Odyssey
and Toyota Siena _ are eroding DaimlerChrysler's minivan market
share, which has fallen below 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To combat that, the automaker dropped new ones into the Detroit
show _ literally _ during a preview for motor journalists. Lowered
from the ceiling while suspended from cables, the 2001 Chrysler
Voyager and Dodge Caravan (and a new Chrysler Town &AMP; Country, which
was driven onto the stage), are the best minivans yet from the king
of the genre.
</P>
<P>
   Although these vans look much the same as last year's,
DaimlerChrysler says they are all new. And they come with a bunch
of new features designed to keep them in favor with moms.
</P>
<P>
   They will be available with dual electric sliding doors, which
competitors have been offering for several years. But exclusive to
the new DaimlerChrysler vans will be such innovations as a
power-opening tailgate, three-zone automatic temperature control
system, and a removable center storage console with power outlet.
Other new features will include side air bags, an in-dash four-disc
CD changer, and a sliding-door obstacle-detector designed to
protect small fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The 3.3 liter V-6 engine will go to 180 horsepower from the
present 158 hp, and there will be a new, optional V-6 with 230
horsepower _ the most powerful engine in the minivan segment.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S AN AVALANCHE _ Jumping on the hybrid truck/SUV bandwagon
created at last year's Detroit show by the Ford Explorer SporTrac
and Lincoln Blackwood, GM rolled out its new Chevrolet Avalanche, a
cross between a Tahoe and a Silverado pickup.
</P>
<P>
   With four full-size doors, it's a people hauler up front _ with
room for up to six. But behind the second seat is a six-foot pickup
bed that can be converted to eight feet by folding up the second
seat, folding down a panel, and lifting out the rear window (which
conveniently stows out of the way, on board). It creates an
open-air driving experience, but it will hold a quad- wheel
off-road vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Due out sometime next year, the Avalanche will be 219 inches
long _ about eight inches shorter than the standard short-box,
extended-cab Silverado.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S THE VERSATILITY, BABY _ Introduced rather theatrically,
surrounded by a horde of screaming late-teens, the Pontiac Aztek
brings to production a concept car that Pontiac rolled out at last
year's Detroit show.
</P>
<P>
   Part small hatchback car, part microvan, and part SUV, the Aztek
is aimed an an active, young consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   GM calls it ``the world's first sport-recreation vehicle.'' Its
purpose is to bring young people into Pontiac showrooms in droves,
something that the sporty Firebird _ which is quite popular among
some youthful consumers _ couldn't accomplish in any great numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The future of Pontiac and other, more stodgy GM brands such as
Buick, Cadillac and Oldsmobile, depends on broadening their appeal,
snaring more buyers who don't yet have gray hair.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztek should do that for Pontiac, at least. It's small,
versatile, available with all-wheel drive and a camper package, and
it's no slouch on the road. Under the hood is a potent, 3.4- liter,
185-horsepower V-6 engine. The car holds up to five adults, or,
with the rear seat removed, two adults and 93.5 cubic feet of stuff
(camping gear, skis, etc.).
</P>
<P>
   It will go on sale this year; the first production model will be
auctioned on the eBay Internet site, with the proceeds going to an
environmental group, GM officials said.  &QL;

<P>
   If, as most people in the computer industry seem to think, the
Internet is on its way to becoming the dominant mode of information
exchange, then it is no longer a luxury but, like the telephone, a
necessity. Anyone without it is in danger of being shut out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been saying for a long time that this transition is like
what happened with telephones, and it's becoming clear to me that a
whole lot of people will be left out,'' said Garrett Gruener, a
Silicon Valley venture capitalist who is one of the people working
on a solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But telephones are a lot easier to provide than computers. And
while the so-called digital divide is an easy problem to label, it
is a lot stickier to solve.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most visible attempts, and one that illustrates the
complexity of providing universal Internet access, is likely to
come Thursday night, when President Clinton, in his State of the
Union address, is expected not only to make note of the divide but
also to suggest federally sponsored remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget for next year, according to White House aides,
will include some $50 million in competitive grants to communities
and organizations involved in efforts to help low-income families
go online. Aides said Clinton will also mention initiatives for
teacher training and incentives for businesses to help bridge the
gap.
</P>
<P>
   One solution to the technology gap that has already been
presented to the administration is the brainchild of a group of
Silicon Valley executives, including Gruener. It is an initiative
called ClickStart, a nonprofit organization that would use federal
subsidies to help connect millions of low-income Americans to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the funds for such a program will materialize is far
from certain. Still, the announcement of ClickStart has helped stir
awareness of what promises to be a dominant issue for the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Commerce Department study found that urban households
with incomes above $75,000 are more than 20 times as likely to have
home Internet access than rural households at the lowest income
levels and that the gap for home Internet access between those at
the highest and lowest income levels widened sharply from 1997 to
1998.
</P>
<P>
   While many other efforts focus on building technology centers in
low-income neighborhoods, ClickStart is focused on providing
computers for home use. For a copayment of about $5 per month, each
recipient will get a $10 monthly federal subsidy in the form of a
voucher. It can be used to buy hardware and Internet access from
any vendor participating in the program.
</P>
<P>
   The ClickStart program, if it is financed at all, is scheduled
to expire after five years. The reason, say the executives who
created the program, is that by then enough people will have
received the technology boost they need, market forces will have
taken over and prices for hardware and Internet access will have
dropped significantly enough to be affordable even to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just an accelerator,'' said Eric Schmidt, chief
executive of Novell and one of the ClickStart organizers. ``We're
not trying to create welfare here.''
</P>
<P>
   The subsidy, paired with the copayment, adds up to $180 a year,
which the ClickStart organizers say is enough to buy both a
functional PC and Internet access. Increasingly, low-cost PCs are
being paired with free Internet access, and vice versa. The
trade-off, however, is that the user is often besieged by
advertising. That makes seasoned technology-access advocates like
Daniel Ben-Horin wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the poor are the most susceptible to advertising
generally, the least able to afford to navigate the perils of our
consumerist culture and the most prone to being misled by dishonest
advertising,'' said Ben-Horin, president of CompuMentor in San
Francisco, one of the nation's largest providers of technology
assistance services to nonprofit groups and schools. At the same
time, Ben-Horin said he lauded the effort as the first one to
approach the problem on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress fails to approve federal financing to bridge the
technology gap, the ClickStart creators say they will not abandon
their idea. ``We'll continue on a path of trying to raise as much
money from the private sector to replace what would otherwise be
the $10 subsidy from the feds,'' said Wade Randlett, who is vice
president of an Internet startup company, Red Gorilla, and another
ClickStart organizer.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps even more important than the initial hookup, say
many in the nonprofit sector, is a program that takes care not to
``dump the hardware and run.'' A program like ClickStart, they say,
must provide follow-through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tough issues here are not the hardware or the software,''
said Preston Moore, coordinator of the Digital Divide Working Group
at the First Unitarian Church of Oakland, Calif., a city that has
become a favored test bed for programs seeking to bridge the
technology gap. ``The tough issues are the brick-by-brick building
of connections between people at a very individual level, which is
a painstakingly slow process of learning what differences a
computer and Internet access can make in a person's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore has a grant proposal pending with the AOL Foundation, the
online service's philanthropic arm, that would provide technology
mentoring. ``The idea is to have a person assigned to train, then
continue to work with a family after the family has received a
computer and Internet access,'' he said. ``And that means getting
beyond buying consumer goods on the Internet. It take a lot of
patience and a lot of listening, and a lot of humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of yearning to solve this problem by throwing
technology at it. Don't get me wrong. The technology is essential,
but that's not the hard part. The hard part is the person-to-person
connections that have to go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The ClickStart creators say this is something they have thought
about. Julie Henderson, executive director of the Marcus A. Foster
Educational Institute in Oakland, which is helping administer a
ClickStart trial there, said her organization will help with
ongoing training and support, in Spanish, Chinese and Vietnamese as
well as English. Participants in the trial will receive computers
from PeoplePC, said Nick Grouf, the company's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But some say that simple training and technical support still
fall short of what is needed when bringing Internet access to poor
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Like Moore, Ben-Horin expressed concern that training and
support issues might be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tendency to say, `Here's a machine, here's the
software and, maybe, here's some classroom training, now stop
whining and use this great stuff,''' Ben-Horin said. ``But that's
not enough. What needs in their lives can computers and the
Internet help disadvantaged people address? What obstacles are
preventing use and how can these obstacles be removed? These are
the hard questions a support program for these families will have
to address.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Lazarus, founder and director of the Children's
Partnership, a nonprofit organization based in Santa Monica,
Calif., said her group had been studying communities across the
country, conducting research on needs that extend beyond what Ms.
Lazarus called ``the boxes and wires.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What seems clear is that the real meat is in two areas,'' Ms.
Lazarus said. ``First, coaching and making sure people can get the
technical help that all of us need. And secondly that the
information that is on the Internet is of real value to people in
underserved communities.'' The group plans to release a
comprehensive set of findings in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Borgstrom, executive director of the Appalachian Center for
Economic Networks in Athens, Ohio, has been working to bring
technology to poor areas for far longer than the topic has been a
political issue.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Borgstrom said the economy of Athens County was devastated
when the coal mines left in the 1930s, and the area has yet to
recover. ``People still have issues of food, clothing and shelter
that are more profound than Internet access,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Borgstrom noted that in Athens County, where 34 percent of
the population falls below the poverty line, many households are
still without telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Borgstrom said, ``in the past five or six years it
became really clear to us that the Internet was going to become a
really important tool for them to be able to expand, create jobs,
grow and thrive.''
</P>
<P>
   One focus of her work, Ms. Borgstrom said, is working with very
small companies that sell locally produced foods. Giving those
enterprises Internet access, she said, helps them in a number of
ways. It gives them good trend information, as well as useful
information about their competitors, and the ability to engage in
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus is not Internet access for the sake of Internet
access,'' Ms. Borgstrom said. ``But it's the Internet for the
really targeted objective of building a sustainable and thriving
economy here with lots of good jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others take issue with the ``digital divide'' concept
itself. The phrase, wrote Steve Cisler, a consultant in San Jose,
Calif., who has written extensively on technology and privilege, is
a demeaning and simplistic characterization of a complex problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are online or offline,'' Cisler wrote in a recent
editorial in The San Jose Mercury News. ``You have a computer or
you are without one; you are trained for the digital future or you
are in dead-end, low-paying work.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Cisler wrote, even those who are online fall
somewhere on a spectrum of connectivity. ``A few million American
families have DSL and cable modem access, and the majority are
still using modems of varying speeds,'' he wrote. ``Those in rural
areas may have poor phone lines that are an expensive toll call to
the closest ISP because 20 percent of the counties do not have an
Internet point of presence. Are all of them on one side of the
digital divide and those without any access on the other?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Silicon Valley executives behind Clickstart are
confident that they understand the issue and are doing the right
thing. ``The problem is there's a set of people for whom $10 to $20
a month is a lot of money,'' Schmidt said. ``The question is, `Is
society better off if they're online, too,' and the answer is,
`Absolutely.'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Breaking up is hard to do _ especially in Manhattan's
tight housing market.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the most expensive rents in the nation, skyrocketing
co-op prices and a paltry vacancy rate estimated at less than 1
percent by real estate agents, an increasing number of Manhattan
couples are living together long after their relationship dies.
</P>
<P>
   Call them room-exes; their existence recalls Soviet-era Moscow,
when housing shortages forced most divorced couples to live
together or to return to their parents. Capitalist-style supply and
demand has produced the same problem in Manhattan, brokers, divorce
lawyers and family therapists suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can imagine a situation where a couple breaks up and one
spouse says to the other, `You can have the dog, kids, and bank
account, I'll take the apartment,''' said Edward Hochman, chairman
of the New York City Rent Guidelines Board. ``It's probably easier
to get a new dog, kid and bank account than an apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   The housing crunch may be the driving force creating room-exes,
but there are other, subtler motivations. Many room-exes suffer
from separation anxiety. Others opt to live with the devil they
know rather than the demonic roommate who may move in, forget to
pay the rent and festoon the shower faucet with wet underwear. Some
are estranged parents who stick together for the sake of the
children. A few bitter souls stay put to wring a favorable divorce
settlement out of their now-insignificant others. Others just hope
to seize the grand prize: an affordable one-bedroom apartment on
the Upper West Side. (The loser moves to Bayonne, sorry.)
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the motives, former mates rarely make ideal
roommates. Chloe Sweeney, a rock singer, and her room-ex, Suke, a
guitarist, broke up three years ago and squabbled for months
afterward. ``I'm not going to say things didn't break or weren't
thrown,'' Ms. Sweeney said in a pub near the cramped East Village
tenement apartment she shares with a pug, two cats, a rabbit and
Suke.
</P>
<P>
   The pair _ who are now chummy enough to share a pitcher of
Budweiser while dissecting their relationship _ say sharing a bed
after splitting up (which they did for a year) complicated an
already complicated situation. ``Sleeping in the same bed made me
feel ugly, unattractive,'' said Ms. Sweeney, who has striking blond
hair and a devilish grin, and who instigated the breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she exiled Suke (pronounced SUE-kee) to a storage
nook that doubled as a guest bedroom. But battles still break out
over chores, noise, even the erasure of a message on Ms. Sweeney's
answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That only happened once,'' Suke said sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He refuses to help out with the animals,'' she griped. ``He
used to empty the litter box all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true at all,'' Suke protested. ``I'm attached to
the cats.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Despite his affection for Boris and Natas (that's Satan
backward, Ms. Sweeney noted), Suke frequently fantasizes about
striking out on his own. ``Hopefully, the stock market will crash
and apartment prices will come down,'' he said. ``I'd love to have
more space, a couch, a living room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he moved out,'' Ms. Sweeney shot back, ``I'd jump for
joy.''
</P>
<P>
   For the foreseeable future, however, the room-exes plan to
maintain the status quo. Why? Suke and Ms. Sweeney cite their
devotion to Snuka, the band that they started six years ago.
``Because we live together, band business gets done quicker,'' Suke
explained. ``When you are in a serious band, there's very little
time to get on with your life. The band is your life.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jerry, a former room-ex who works as a communications
consultant, understands the urge to sublimate the self for a
compelling cause. When his marriage of 12 years collapsed, he put
off packing his bags until he could find an apartment appropriate
for his two young daughters (he asked for anonymity to protect
their privacy).
</P>
<P>
   ``If I looked at a place that was borderline, I took them along
to help make the decision,'' he recalled. ``After all, it was going
to be their home _ their half-home.'' Meanwhile, Jerry slept in the
bedroom with his future ex-wife, not wanting his children to see
daddy on the couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only time in my life that I had trouble sleeping,''
Jerry sighed. ``I've never been a drinker, but I had to have a
highball every night before bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four months later, he tracked down an affordable
two-bedroom apartment in his neighborhood. ``In any other city, I
would have found a place in two weeks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   June Jacobson, a Manhattan divorce mediator and psychotherapist,
who currently counsels three sets of room-exes, believes that the
trend toward shared parenting encourages many couples to prolong a
household past its sell-by date. And when both parents want to
remain active in their children's day-to-day lives, the one who
moves out needs an apartment nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the difficulty in finding a new home can become a
convenient smoke screen for an inability to take action, Ms.
Jacobson warned. She advises room-exes to ask themselves, Is
lingering together really an apartment issue _ or a reluctance to
get on with their lives?
</P>
<P>
   Some family therapists suggest that keeping up appearances to
protect children may backfire and that youngsters are better off
with a clear-cut divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``They then have a sense of order and predictability,'' said
Sonya Rhodes, a psychologist on the Upper West Side. Otherwise, she
said, children may perpetuate a fantasy that the parents will
resolve their problems and get back together.
</P>
<P>
   ``How betrayed do they feel when that fantasy doesn't come
true?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Former lovebirds who can't fly the coop should spend plenty of
time alone, Dr. Rhodes recommended, as a way to create separation
without physical distance.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing a formal privacy policy was among the steps that
help Tim McCoy cope with his live-in-ex-lover. He and his former
partner rationed time in their East Village condominium, divvied up
chores more equitably and started splitting bills down the middle.
To short-circuit a possible meltdown, McCoy's ex also bought a
cellular phone, enabling him to speak with his new flame with
relative discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Among room-exes, dating remains a thorny issue, one with the
potential to wreck chances of a later friendship. ``At first,''
McCoy said, ``it was just hell. He would drop little comments like,
`I went on a date,' and ask questions like, `What are you going to
do when I bring someone home?'''
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, Suke and Ms. Sweeney avoid bringing home paramours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to sleep elsewhere,'' Ms. Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walls are paper thin,'' Suke added.
</P>
<P>
   During the occasional meeting between Suke and a suitor, Ms.
Sweeney is circumspect. ``I introduce Suke as my guitar player,''
she said. ``I never say ex. Never! When I date someone, I don't
tell them for a few months that I live with my ex-boyfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicia, a marketing executive, hardly dated during the three
months she lived with her ex-boyfriend: she was too busy crying.
``I couldn't stand being with him, but I was overwhelmed with guilt
because I knew how hard it is to find an apartment,'' she said. ``I
was crying every night, but he wouldn't leave.'' Exasperated,
Alicia _ who asked that her last name not be revealed, to avoid
embarrassing her parents _ took decisive action. ``I spent three
weeks with a real estate broker and found my ex-boyfriend a great
place, one block away,'' she said. ``You need to separate as soon
as possible, even if you share the cost of a hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is not unheard of for the separated _ even the
divorced _ to get back together again.
</P>
<P>
   Are room-exes more likely to kiss and make up?
</P>
<P>
   ``Never,'' hooted Ms. Sweeney, who paused to drag on her
cigarette. ``Well, maybe 20 years from now, when we realize that
nobody will ever put up with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Suke raised his eyebrows. ``Twenty years,'' he said. ``That's a
long time.''

NURTURING A GARDEN BUSINESS AS IF IT WERE A SEED 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION, Conn. _ By sunrise one day last week, it was 6 below in
this frozen burg. But the wind made it feel like 30 below as it
knifed through the pine trees and banged on the metal doors of a
secondhand trailer across from Marilyn Barlow's old farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   By 8 a.m., this slumbering world was buzzing with the dreams of
spring. The first of hundreds of gardeners started calling. When
would the Select Seeds catalog arrive? Was it too early to start
kiss-me-over-the-garden-gate? (Yes.) What about poppies? (Scatter
them outside, over the snow.)
</P>
<P>
   Orders poured in, by phone and fax, for America, a fragrant,
cherry-red-and-white sweet pea dating to 1896, and for a little
fringed raspberry-scented flower that Napoleon carried from Egypt
to Josephine. She called it mignonette, or ``my little darling.''
</P>
<P>
   Three women hunched over computers, typing in orders, surrounded
by postcards and snapshots of gargantuan plants. Like a
seven-foot-tall specimen of love-lies-bleeding, towering over a
small boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the literature says they should only grow to three feet,''
Andrea Jacomet, of Hermit, Calif., writes.
</P>
<P>
   On the back of a Wolf Man postcard, J. Turner, of Eureka,
Calif., requests a catalog. V. Smith, of Edinboro, Pa., requests
the same, ``if you can spare one'' (shrieks of laughter from the
women). Her postcard, from the Natural Bridge Wax Museum in Natural
Bridge, Va., depicts Eve, in naked innocence, eating an apple in
the forest primeval.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we've had a rash of bunny-bloom calls,'' said Ms.
Barlow, who started Select Seeds at her kitchen table 13 years ago.
She handed over a note from L. Pearl Rudd, of Liberty, Mo., who
can't find the larkspur with ``the bunny head in the middle of
single florets.'' A blurry photocopy of the coveted flower is
attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``See the bunny?'' Ms. Barlow asked, pointing to a little
long-eared white blob inside the flower. Sort of. It could be a
donkey.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barlow had 50 customers her first spring, in 1987. So far
this year, she has sent out 130,000 catalogs. She started with less
than what a lot of people would pay for a sofa: $2,000, for seeds,
the printing of seed packets and catalogs, a few classified ads,
some mailers and stamps.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it was just Ms. Barlow, with her first baby, Brian, on
her lap, reading postcards in her kitchen, filling orders, counting
seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first few years, we lost money, and that created a little
tension,'' said Ms. Barlow, a thin, sturdy woman with bobbed,
straight hair and a matter-of-fact gaze. Then they started breaking
even. Now, profits are plowed right back into more seeds, another
computer, more help (to do things like answering the phone:
860-684-9310).
</P>
<P>
   ``We grow some of the seeds that are rare or hard to find,''
said Ms. Barlow, whose part-time employees adopt projects in their
own backyards. Janine Heck grew morning glories on bamboo trellises
and harvested four cups of seed. Nan Hayden grew sweet-scented
tobacco in five long, wide rows, with her steers hanging over the
fence.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Ms. Barlow grew Mastadon pansies, a fragrant
old-time variety with bronze and gold tones, long grown by Steele's
Pansy Gardens in Oregon. When she heard the company was going out
of business, she paid its owner, Phyllis Steele, a visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They grow them in 10-foot-wide beds hundreds of feet long,''
Ms. Barlow said of the Mastadons. ``And walking through those
fields was wonderfully fragrant.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Steele passed the mantle, as it were, showing Ms. Barlow
what to look for: how the seedpods swell into a teardrop, just
before they open. And the young seedswoman took some seeds home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't totally successful,'' she said. ``We don't have the
climate to grow a lot of seeds, and it takes a lot of time to
devote to baby plants.''
</P>
<P>
   She has her own garden behind the house, where she tries all
kinds of plants, from love-in-a-puff, which has a little white
heart on its velvety black seeds, to variegated Japanese hops,
whose handsome green-and-white-splotched leaves are alarmingly
vigorous (they hopped the fence to cover her compost pile). And
she's partial to spring bloomers, like sweet rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so fragrant,'' she said. ``I know it's a roadside escape,
but it looks so nice, the violets, whites and mauves. I collect the
seeds and scatter them around to make sure I have a full stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she is surprised, by things like the birdhouse gourds
that grew into giant green baseball bats, dangling from the rustic
trellis that her husband, Peter, built of mountain laurel.
</P>
<P>
   There's a feeling of old New England here, so close to the
Massachusetts line, where rock walls disappear into the woods, and
fields stretch out without any starter castles. It's almost as if
this antique-flower business suggested itself out of the land and
the 1850 farmhouse that Barlow, a carpenter, pulled from ruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bathtub was in the shed,'' Ms. Barlow said. ``The cellar
was full of water. But it was the land we bought it for _ 50
acres.''
</P>
<P>
   They had looked for years, driving up this road and that road,
looking at the cellar holes of houses that had long ago crumbled
back to the earth. They would find gnarled lilacs, shrub roses,
peonies and lemon lilies, sturdy plants that are signposts,
horticultural landmarks of vanished lives.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One day, they saw the house, rising out of a field of long grass
and surrounded by a state forest. There were lilacs by the shed, a
pear tree in the yard. ``It must have been August,'' Ms. Barlow
said. ``Because the grass was full of those big yellow spiders with
the black stripes.''
</P>
<P>
   The place wasn't for sale, but the couple waited. And bought it
the same day it appeared in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Barlow went to work on the house, first excavating the
foundation away from the hill, so that rainwater would stop pouring
into the cellar. He used the soil to make raised beds for Ms.
Barlow's garden, which is terraced up the hill. The Barlows had a
stone wall built into the base of the hill, and Ms. Barlow's
brother, Tom Hart, made a rustic gate out of wild mountain laurel.
</P>
<P>
   Once they had the cottage, Ms. Barlow could start her cottage
industry. She had worked in a commercial nursery for several years,
before getting a certificate in horticulture from the University of
Connecticut. But then what?
</P>
<P>
   She thought of growing perennials, but they require hard
physical work out in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``But seeds are just waiting to grow,'' she said. ``You don't
have to take care of them every minute.''
</P>
<P>
   You might say that heirloom flowers are in Ms. Barlow's genes.
She grew up in a house of women, on a farm in Unionville, Conn., in
Hartford County, where a great-aunt and a grandmother and a
great-grandmother all gardened. The house was surrounded by
hay-scented ferns and mossy old roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to climb on the running boards of my grandmother's car
and drive down to the gardens,'' she said. They shucked peas on the
lawn.
</P>
<P>
   By 14, she was working for a big-leaf tobacco company in nearby
Simsbury, with other girls who went from barn to barn, stitching up
the big leaves that are used to wrap cigars.
</P>
<P>
   So, by the time they got the cottage, Ms. Barlow was more than
ready. She already knew that she wanted to offer more than what was
in most of the catalogs at the time: dwarf marigolds, zinnias,
impatiens, that awful red-hot poker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to realize how many of the old flowers had fallen out
of the trade,'' she said of her research trips to museum gardens
like Sturbridge Village and the Harriet Beecher Stowe House.
``There might be a dozen mignonette varieties, and now there are
one or two.''
</P>
<P>
   She went to the federal agriculture library in Beltsville, Md.
She wrote to European consulates, to get lists of flower-seed
exporters. She got more names from the American Seed Trade
Association. She discovered the Seed Savers Exchange, in Decorah,
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barlow also got in touch with Peter Grayson, the English
seedsman who rescued the fragrant sweet pea from oblivion, bringing
back 35 long-forgotten varieties (there were once more than 300
varieties of this trendy Victorian flower). Grayson gave Ms. Barlow
a contract to sell his rediscoveries to Americans, scented beauties
like Black Knight, which is a dark maroon, and Cupani, a bicolor in
purple and deep blue.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, gardeners like William Yoakum, of Ohio, started sending
her rare seeds, like kiss-me-over-the-garden-gate, which some call
ladyfingers. Its dangling pink blossoms droop from six-foot stems
that definitely need a gate to lean on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something Oriental about it,'' Yoakum wrote. ``It
reminds me of the willow trees on Blue Willow china.''
</P>
<P>
   But where's the bunny bloom larkspur? L. Pearl Rudd, of
Missouri, is desperate for seeds. &QL;

USING PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE TO FORGE SEAMLESS NET LINKS

 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Get ready to be served in a big way by the companies that make
personal computer operating system software. Apple Computer and
Microsoft Corp. have been making frequent references lately to
services they will provide to their clients (that's you, if you use
either Mac OS 9 or the forthcoming Windows 2000) via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Apple unveiled the first four of its new Internet-based
services, called iTools, this month on its redesigned Web site,
www.apple.com. These inaugural iTools and their companion services,
iCards and iReview, give a glimpse of the potential ways such
services will change the way people use personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which is preparing to release Windows 2000 next
month, has been more restrained in talking about future services
for its clients. And who can blame it? The Justice Department has
its gimlet eye on Microsoft, watching for shenanigans that appear
to take unfair advantage of the Windows monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly what Apple says its services are all about:
taking unfair advantage of the fact that Apple controls the client
operating system at one end, the server system at the other and the
Internet portal where the two converge.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's initial array of services, only for users who have OS 9,
is displayed as folder tabs across the top of its Apple Web site,
which also can be reached by typing www.mac.com _ the prime unreal
estate of Apple's Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   These services include free e-mail accounts with a mac.com
address, the best electronic greeting card service on the Internet,
a human-based system for reviewing other Web sites, a new kind of
safeguard to prevent access by kids to Internet pornography and
other objectionable material, a simple set of tools for creating
and posting personal home pages on the Web, and _ my favorite _ a
personal data backup and storage service in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, services like these already exist everywhere on the
Internet. The key is that Apple, because it controls the software
at both ends of the Internet connection, can do things that other
software and Internet companies cannot do, like forge seamless
links and bridges between Macs that may be on adjoining desks or on
separate continents.
</P>
<P>
   The Apple services are free, as long as you have access to a
relatively current Macintosh with a PowerPC processor.
</P>
<P>
   If that means going out and buying a Mac, well, that is how
Apple intends to justify these services.
</P>
<P>
   In case anyone misses the point, Apple even states that its new
services are for ``members only.'' Windows users need not apply.
And other Macintosh software developers need not apply, either.
Apple will build and control its own iTools, said Steve Jobs,
Apple's iCEO.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason, technically at least, why Microsoft cannot
do the same thing with its forthcoming Windows 2000 services.
Suddenly, it seems charming that the Justice Department was so
upset with Microsoft for merely combining a personal computer
operating system (exhibit A, Windows) with a piece of software
known as a Web browser (exhibit B, Internet Explorer).
</P>
<P>
   What Microsoft may be preparing to do, and what Apple Computer
has already started to do with its iTools, is to create a technical
country club in cyberspace where the food is superior, the golf
courses are more manicured, the pool is Bondi blue, the best
coaches work there, the parties are cooler, and there are no old
junkers in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are ways for others to sneak in, Apple's new
iTools services are available to users of Apple's Mac OS 9 or, in
about six months, Mac OS X (pronounced ``ten''). The use of the
services also requires a membership, which imparts a unique member
name and password. The member name _ Steve, for example _ becomes
the basis for the free e-mail account, as in, Steve(AT)mac.com,
which one assumes is already taken.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is already the most popular service on the Internet, but
Apple's version has advantages over any of the other freemail
services. For one thing, it is free of advertising, if you don't
count the entire Apple computer and e-mail address as one giant
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Email can be retrieved and read with any e-mail program,
and Apple makes it easy to forward mac.com mail automatically to
another e-mail account.
</P>
<P>
   The next service is iReview, which may become a guide for
choosing among millions of Web sites. Apple has a team of editors _
it refuses to say how many, and for all we know it may be two Old
Media guys chained in a dungeon in Cupertino _ who visit Web sites
and assign them grades. Borrowing a trick from Amazon, it also
encourages members to add their own ratings and reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic greeting cards are extremely popular on the Internet
for reasons that elude me, but Apple's iCards service is quite
clever. Anyway, if you enjoy sending people e-cards, you will adore
iCards. There are no advertisements. And that brings us to iTools,
a collection of services that will be expanded over time. There are
currently four tools. Email is one; the others are KidSafe,
HomePage and iDisk.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   KidSafe is Apple's solution for protecting kids from the
childish things that adults put on the Internet, like dirty
pictures, nasty chat sessions and assorted fringe philosophies.
Most current Internet filters come with a list of Web sites and
words that children are not allowed to see.
</P>
<P>
   But new Web sites are created every day and the filters cannot
keep up with all the bad ones. Also, blocking words like ``sex''
prevents students from seeing socially redeemable sites that
include the word.
</P>
<P>
   KidSafe is a reverse filter. It limits kids to sites that have
been approved by a special panel of certified teachers and
librarians, perhaps including the two guys in the dungeon at Apple.
Apple says some 50,000 sites have been approved so far, and it
plans to approve and add 10,000 new sites a month. As always,
technology is a poor substitute for close parental involvement, but
KidSafe is the next best thing.
</P>
<P>
   HomePage is a collection of tools and templates that allow
members to create personal Web pages on a free publishing area
called homepage.mac.com. The most popular use will probably be
posting job resumes and baby pictures. The tools are not very
sophisticated, but they are easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   The last and most important of the iTools is iDisk. With iDisk,
Apple has at last atoned for the lack of a floppy disk drive on its
iMac computers. The iDisk is a virtual hard disk, in effect a disk
in the sky, where any iTools member can park up to 20 megabytes
worth of files, free. (Apple will eventually allow people to rent
more space for an additional fee, Jobs said.)
</P>
<P>
   The user's personal iDisk shows up on the computer screen just
as if it were a physical drive on the computer. One can drag files
and folders back and forth from the local drive to the iDisk drive,
but the speed of the transfers depends on the speed of the user's
Internet connection. It will almost always be slower than a native
hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   There are five permanent folders inside the iDisk, labeled
Documents, Movies, Pictures, Sites and Public. The Public folder is
especially intriguing. If the owner of the iDisk so chooses, he or
she can publish documents, pictures, movies or Web pages in the
Public folder and make them available to any other iTools members
who want to see them. Who needs floppies?
</P>
<P>
   A proud parent could drag an entire album of digital pictures,
or even an iMovie, into the public file of the iDisk, send an iCard
of one of the pictures to grandma(AT)mac.com and announce, ``Hey,
Grandma, go to the iDisk page, type in my iTools user name, and
open my Public folder to see more pictures.'' The folder shows up
on the screen of Grandma's iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Many people will find iDisk useful for squirreling away backup
copies of important files. If lightning strikes my office and turns
my iMac into a puddle of molten goo, I can retrieve my important
files from Apple's servers and install them on my new Mac,
assuming, of course, that I am not a puddle of goo myself. While
the Public folder is open to everyone, the other folders in the
iDisk are protected.
</P>
<P>
   Apple needs to do a better job persuading its ``members'' that
their private information is indeed private and will not be
exploited for Apple's commercial gain. After all, discretion is a
hallmark of good service. But the idea that someday an Apple expert
will be able to fix my Mac remotely, upgrade my software and warn
me when my hard drive is about to crash is compelling. &QL;

BOXED IN: EXPLORING A BIG-BOX STORE ONLINE

<P>
   Without any fanfare or hoopla, Wal-Mart rolled out its
redesigned Internet site on Jan. 1. After trying to shop there last
week, I understand why nobody was bragging about it.
</P>
<P>
   What I couldn't understand, as I wandered around in confusion on
the Wal-Mart site, was why anybody would ever buy anything there. I
tried, believe me, I tried. But every time I thought I had zeroed
in on a potential purchase, I encountered problems.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the design. Wal-Mart wanted to replicate the
experience of shopping in one of its brick-and-mortar stores. The
first thing I noticed after arriving at www.walmart.com was a
smiling employee named Jill the Greeter. But unlike the live
greeter I encountered last week stationed inside the front entrance
of a real Wal-Mart _ who cheerfully steered me toward an aisle
stocked with dozens of kinds of light bulbs _ Jill the Greeter was
not much help. When I typed ``light bulbs'' in the search box above
her big toothy grin, the site inexplicably responded with a list of
12 ``product matches'' that turned out to be books with titles like
``A Snake Mistake'' and ``The New GE.''
</P>
<P>
   Still looking for light bulbs, I clicked on the icon for the
home page's Store Map. A weird floor plan appeared on the screen.
It looked like a map of an actual store, with aisles separating big
rectangular departments labeled with names like ``health/beauty,''
``books'' and ``sporting goods.''
</P>
<P>
   A useful feature perhaps, except that none of the bulb-likely
categories _ ``housewares,'' ``household goods'' and ``home
fashions'' _ seemed to be related to one another in any way,
despite their proximity on the Store Map. I had to search all three
categories independently; then I went back to the general map and
realized that ``home improvement,'' a department name that conjures
images of plumbing supplies, table saws and screws, might harbor
light bulbs. Which it turned out to do, after I followed the
Lighting and Indoor links and found a paltry selection consisting
of four kinds of bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this map would be useful if you were planning a heist in a
real store _ ``Look, Moe, you gotta keep your head down when you
sneak your loot bag full of cameras past that big customer service
desk'' _ but it did nothing but confuse me.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how I tried to navigate the site, whether by searching
for specific items or browsing through departments and
subdepartments, I could never find anything I wanted to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the designers of the site were too much in awe of the
Wal-Mart experience. In trying to replicate the success of the
actual stores online, they've drawn a few faulty parallels. In a
real store, there is some logic to putting housewares near
household goods and putting children's fashions on the other side
of the store. On a Web site, each product should be separated by at
most a click or a quick search.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to look at this through the eyes of the online
customer and not try to bring the offline experience online,'' said
Thomas Wurster, a senior vice president at the Boston Consulting
Group, a management consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   And the Web site abandons those things that make the stores
themselves so easy to navigate: wide aisles, clear directions and
unimpeded sightlines. If a shopper was trapped in a dark corner of
a store for as long I was looking for light bulbs, the manager
would have sent in a rescue team and a couple of St. Bernards.
</P>
<P>
   What Wal-Mart is known for, other than cheap prices, is
selection. Now, I know that in theory, the site offers a big
selection. But I know that only because a Wal-Mart spokeswoman told
me that the site stocked 600,000 items, compared with the 100,000
products you would find in the average offline store. But in some
of the site's 14 major merchandise categories, very few things were
for sale. Last week, for instance, there was only one thing for
sale in the whole New Technology section of the Home Entertainment
category: a two-way radio for $29.96. Actually, you did have a
choice: it was available in either orange or purple.
</P>
<P>
   In my gut, I believe that Wal-Mart has more New Technology items
for sale. It must. But since none of the site's tools for finding
merchandise worked properly, I was at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for instance, the Toy Finder tool. When I queried the
search engine for a $10-to-$20 toy for a 9-year-old girl, and I
chose the Children's Activity toy category, it suggested six
inappropriate toys, like a Crayola Color Wipe Off Play Mat and a
Fisher-Price Magna Doodle Bus $19.84), which was described as an
aid to learning letters and numbers. While I have a 9-year-old cat
who still doesn't color in the lines or count up to 10, my (almost)
9-year-old daughter stopped playing with toys like that a few years
back.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Find My Store tool, which egged me on to enter my ZIP
code to find the nearest actual Wal-Mart store, had glitches. When
I tried to zoom in for details on how to find the two closest
stores (as ``pinpointed'' on a poorly detailed aerial map of Long
Island, N.Y.), the tool instead gave me a different list of stores.
Finally, wanting to scream, I gave up and phoned a store to get
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I expected more from one of the nation's leading
retailers. We're not talking about some mom-and-pop operation here,
run by people who decided that it would be fun to put up a Web page
and sell things they had lying around in the garage. Wal-Mart draws
100 million shoppers a week to its 2,500 stores nationwide. From a
tiny discount store in Rogers, Ark., that Sam Walton opened in
1962, Wal-Mart grew into a major force in retailing, transforming
American customers into discount shoppers who expect a wide
selection and friendly service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this pent-up demand for goods in small towns,'' said
Sandra Stringer Vance, the co-author of ``Wal-Mart: A History of
Sam Walton's Retail Phenomenon'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster paperback,
1997). ``The thing was, Walton opened the first store, and it
lacked the polish of the later operations, but prices were so low
that customers just flocked to it. It was really primitive, with
exposed pipes. No air conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Four decades later, the online version needs some renovation.
And I hope that the announcement that Wal-Mart made just days after
this online store opened _ that the company will team with Accel
Partners, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, to create a new
company called Walmart-com _ is a sign that more changes are ahead.
A Wal-Mart spokeswoman, Melissa Berryhill, said she knew of no
timetable for yet another redesign. ``A lot of time and effort was
put into this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. But can't someone there at least make it easier to
buy light bulbs?

DO WE WANT A NEW SHOW THAT OUT-CRUDES `ACTION'?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ There was a moment during the Fox executive
news conference when Christopher Titus, a lanky, boisterous
stand-up comedian whose biographical sitcom sits in the network's
midseason holding pattern, leaped out of his seat and rushed to the
stage, yelling as if the place were engulfed in flames.
</P>
<P>
   He had interrupted _ although, judging from the seeing-a-ghost
faces of Fox Chairman Sandy Grushow and entertainment chief Doug
Herzog, ``shocked'' is a more precise description. Swinging his
arms wildly and bobbing his head up and down, Titus was half-joking
when he screamed something (no one seems to know what, exactly,
which spoiled the joke half) about the network finding a home for
his self-titled comedy.
</P>
<P>
   This is never, ever done. Even by a relatively unknown stand-up
comic trying to make not so much a good impression as a lasting
one.
</P>
<P>
   It is customary during executive news sessions that Fox
employees, and even stars of its shows, who often languish in the
back of the room, speak only when spoken to, laugh on cue, and
applaud wildly when a comment is pro-Fox or anti-anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, ``Titus'' has some leverage.
</P>
<P>
   How, without so much as a ratings point? Grushow and Herzog,
trying to stop the ratings hemorrhage at Fox, are offering another
unburdened half-hour comedy, which in just one episode will surpass
the crudeness quotient of ``Action,'' the other Fox series whose
view of Hollywood morality had audiences bent out of shape.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have spoken confidently about the unusual series, which
breaks into the action with the lead character, shot in black and
white, sitting in a room explaining the proceedings, giving
background and telling what's coming next. In true stand-up ego
form, this is where Titus is able to sprout all sorts of things
without being interrupted, without having to share lines, like the
one about driving his drunken father to his mother's parole
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Grushow, hired in November to refocus a network that has left a
trail of dead or dying new shows, explains the development of
``Titus'' as proof that the Fox network, once proud but now
something of a laughingstock, will not stiffen and abandon its
reputation of offering edgy, in-yo-face fare. ``Titus'' is
certainly that, but hardly in the way that ``Malcolm in the
Middle'' makes family mayhem clever, or even endearing. ``Titus''
bear-hugs dysfunctionality, a prerequisite of family sitcoms these
days, and one that unfortunately sells.
</P>
<P>
   The title character lives with his womanizing, psychologically
abusive father, Ken, played with menacing comedic flair by Stacey
Keach. He also has a dimwitted brother (Zack Ward), a
strong-willed, smart (except for the part where she's with him)
girlfriend (Cynthia Watros), and a buddy (David Shatraw) who
receives a barrage of taunts because he comes from a stable (read:
boring) upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   The three family members rip into one another with a volley of
insults (the father constantly calls the boys ``wussies'' for
things like treating women with respect) and even joke about the
boys' mother, who years ago was committed to a mental institution
as a manic-depressive schizophrenic. I can see mental health
professionals going berserk over Ken's reference to her living in a
mental-care facility as being ``shacked up in the wacko basket.''
</P>
<P>
   That all of this apparently comes directly from Titus' life
gives the sitcom an underlying dramatic pull, not to mention a
sense of sadness. ``To write a show, you had to have gone past it
and see the positive aspects of whatever your life was,'' says
Titus, whose award-winning one-man show, ``Norman Rockwell Is
Bleeding,'' was an unapologetic look into the modern-American
family. ``So to write the show and make it funny; you're never
going to see us go to a real sappy place of `Look what happened to
me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot and two additional episodes screened for TV
writers, Titus describes his father as noble and loving, a man with
the best interests of his children at heart, ``when he's sober,''
or when his ``mean-spirited evilness was directed at someone
else.'' The pilot's premise involves the brothers thinking their
father is dead because he hasn't come out of his room in four days,
not even to get a beer.
</P>
<P>
   They reminisce about how he raised them; the introduction is a
litany of vignettes that's akin to psychological torture.
</P>
<P>
   Titus calls it tough love that balances out in the end. There's
a scene, for instance, in which Dad lets his son play with an
electrical socket and, boom! ``Now,'' Dad says proudly, ``he'll
never do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Explains Titus: Dad ``was a 21-year-old father with a 3-year-old
kid, and he did the best he could. He was just on me all the time.
And look at me now. I mean, I don't know how much I can rip on him
too hard. I'm here talking about my TV show coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   As for using mental illness as a punch line, and his mother's
ailment at that, Titus' feeling is: ``Anything is funny if the
setup is right. And it's my mom, so, you know, the deniability is
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In that way, ``Titus'' is similar to Louie Anderson's 1996
sitcom ``Louie,'' about a psychotherapist dealing with an alcoholic
past. Honesty and accountability rose out of Anderson's personality
in his short-lived series (it was gone after a handful of
episodes), but audiences were charmed by Anderson's
self-deprecating humor.
</P>
<P>
   Also similar to ``Titus'' is Showtime's ``Rude Awakening,'' now
in its second season, about a recovering alcoholic, her alcoholic
friends and her pill-popping, booze-loving mother, played by none
other than Vanessa Redgrave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rude Awakening'' also comes from real life: The creator is
Claudia Lonow, a former actress who played Michele Lee's daughter
on ``Knots Landing'' before slipping into a life of booze and
despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rude Awakening'' doesn't get much flak because it's protected
under the guise of pay television, and because it's so awful that
no one cares.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Titus'' will be on network television, and probably as
soon as March. Still, its creator doesn't seem fazed by any
impending fallout over its content. ``We're not poking fun at
(mental illness); we're not saying that being dysfunctional is good
or bad,'' he says. ``It's my life. And you know what else? If it's
picketed, I'll join the picket. Because it is what it is. Live with
it or don't watch it.''  &QL;

MAN VS. BEAST: WHOSE NEIGHBORHOOD IS IT, ANYWAY? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont., Fla., Colo.)  (lh) 
 By JIM ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. _ Dan Dodge's 12-year-old son, Jake, was playing
outside the family home in this mountain-ringed town when his
father heard him yell, ``There's a mountain lion!'' Dodge looked
out the window to see a dun-colored cat crouched about 30 feet away
from a picnic table, moving stealthily toward his son.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge ran to his bedroom and grabbed a .270-caliber rifle.
Firing from inside the house, he dropped the 115-pound female cat
with several shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see bear,'' Dodge, a painting contractor, said. ``We see
moose. We see a lot of wildlife and leave them alone. When they
come in stalking your kid, that's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodge called to alert the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife
and Parks, which approved his course of action. Pete Johnson, the
conservation officer who investigated the shooting, said: ``Lions
are unpredictable. If the kid had taken off running it could have
triggered the predatory response in the lion.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident is one of a growing number of people-predator
conflicts, not deep in the wilderness but in the housing
developments that now encroach on the wide-open spaces. Thanks to
better roads, cellular phones, Federal Express deliveries and a
latte shop in almost every small town in the West, more and more
people want to live amid nature in the raw.
</P>
<P>
   But so, of course, do wild animals. From the Rust Belt through
the Sun Belt, once nearly invisible predatory creatures with sharp
fangs and long claws are routinely making their way into places
where development is growing and people are living. As the problem
becomes more acute for the animals, wildlife experts are
encouraging communities to try new strategies to avoid killing
them.
</P>
<P>
   Merely warning people to avoid bears, cougars and alligators
would seem to be tricky. ``There's a fine line between fear and
respect,'' said Michael Korn, coordinator for the Department of
Fish, Wildlife and Parks in Helena, Mont. ``We don't want people
running up the hillside with torches yelling, `Kill the monster!'
People can live with lions by knowing how they operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Both people and predator populations are growing in pristine
locations, according to state records. In Washington, the
Department of Fish and Wildlife reported nearly a doubling of
cougar sightings from 1996 to 1998 (from 495 to 927), mostly around
populated areas. And in the last 15 years, the cougar population
has grown from 1,500 to 2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1960s, there were bounties on predators. Until very
recently, they were routinely killed if they showed up near homes.
But the public has made it clear through voter initiatives and
support of wildlife conservation groups that it wants wildlife
protected, especially ``charismatic megafauna'' _ a scientific term
for animals that are big and furry and likable, like mountain lions
and bears. As a result, the hunting and trapping of mountain lions
is now banned in California, Oregon and Washington. Indeed, some
humans are more than happy to toss birdseed, suet and dog food
around the perimeter of their property. So predators have developed
an appetite for close encounters.
</P>
<P>
   On the shores of Whitefish Lake in Montana, Julie Duncan was
fined $120 last year for putting out clams and oysters so she could
videotape black bears coming down to her yard. Officials
intercepted a grizzly making its way to the feast.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, people frequently wander up to alligators on the
18th green and offer them a treat.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife once rarely and furtively glimpsed now routinely prowl
porches, driveways, golf courses and schoolyards. ``Five to eight
years ago, calls about bears and lions were isolated,'' Korn said.
``Now they're a large part of what we deal with.'' Dogs, cats, pet
llamas, goats and sometimes people have become easy pickings.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists believe the solution should not be
directed at the wildlife but at people who encroach onto the
wildlife's turf. And there's a battle in nearly every state over
reining in sprawl. ``First and foremost, the problem comes from
humans living, working and recreating in predator habitat,'' said
Tom Skeele, executive director of the Predator Conservation
Alliance in Bozeman, Mont., a nonprofit group that works to save
predators. Some places, like Boulder, Colo., are buying up open
space around town to preserve habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Different parts of the country have started education campaigns
to keep people from being attacked, and also to keep predators from
being needlessly killed. Once an animal loses its fear of people
and begins eating off a porch, it usually must be destroyed,
wildlife experts say.
</P>
<P>
   At schools near Boulder, for example, wildlife officers teach
schoolchildren how to be lion savvy and make themselves imposing,
should they encounter a wild feline. One way is by putting their
coats above their heads, to look taller.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Whitefish, Mont., population 5,875, a grizzly
ventured down the city's main street in the middle of the day last
summer. Grizzlies have also made their way to areas at the edge of
Whitefish, a resort town, to eat garbage, said Tim Manley, who
handles problem grizzlies for the Montana wildlife department.
</P>
<P>
   Garbage isn't the only feeding problem. In much of the West, new
homes are landscaped with plants like arborvitae that deer find
irresistible. Then, as the deer follow a culinary trail of apple
trees, tomato plants and azaleas, mountain lions follow along,
waiting to cull the herd.
</P>
<P>
   Dry weather and poor food crops during last summer's drought in
the East sent black bears into suburbs from New Hampshire to
Pennsylvania, where they raided barbecue grills and even
refrigerators. In New Jersey, where the number of black bear
sightings doubled in 1999 from the previous year, children at one
bus stop were frightened by an errant bear. Homeowners in
Pennsylvania regularly find black bears hibernating under their
patios.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the predator, the problem is the same. ``They
don't know where a handout ends and a hand begins,'' said Frank
Mazzotti, a University of Florida wildlife researcher who has
studied alligators and crocodiles. But if the predator takes too
big a bite, it is killed, and there is a backlash against the
species. ``And that's not the animal's fault,'' he said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Mountain lions, a fast predator with paws the size of a
catcher's mitt, pose the most widespread problems throughout the
West. There have been numerous fatal attacks, almost all of them on
children or women because they are similar in size to the lion's
natural prey, deer.
</P>
<P>
   The lions don't always win. In 1994, an old lion with few teeth
attacked Suzanne Groves, 25, a biologist, as she took stream
samples in the Mancos River in southern Colorado. The lion bit the
back of her head and held her under water for several seconds. The
two wrestled, and the woman ended up on top, with her arm in the
lion's mouth to hold it down. Then she grabbed a pair of forceps
and stabbed the animal, which ran away. It was later shot by
wildlife agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you're going to win a fight with a cougar is if
it doesn't have any teeth,'' said Todd Malmsbury, a spokesman for
the Colorado Division of Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   In South Florida, ``any body of water larger than a puddle can
have an alligator in it,'' Mazzotti said. Since 1948 in the South,
there have been some 200 recorded attacks on people by alligators,
eight of them fatal.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Trapping predators in suburban settings is becoming a critical
art. The job usually falls to wildlife agents.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, a wolf and coyote ``getter,'' an unmanned
gunlike device covered with meat that shot deadly sodium cyanide
into the animal's mouth, was used. The gun would go off when the
animal pulled on the meat. Now wildlife agents load getters with
tranquilizers. Tranquilizer darts also are being designed into a
special collar on captured, and then released, wildlife. A
biologist can activate it by remote control anytime, anywhere. Then
they can pick up the animal as it dozes.
</P>
<P>
   Some wolf collars emit a radio frequency if they wander into
someone's yard, setting off sirens and strobe lights that scare the
predator.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The mountain lion problem is so acute in some states that
wildlife officials have suggested allowing hunters to use tracking
hounds once again. ``Given the growing number of complaints, we are
no longer able to provide service at the level the public wants,''
said Steve Pozzanghera, assistant director of the Washington
Department of Fish and Wildlife. His department this month asked
the legislature for the funding to create a kind of wildlife SWAT
team that would be ready to respond to conflicts and to educate the
public.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Whitefish, they're trying aversive-conditioning modification
to teach grizzly bears to fear humans. ``We push them out using
rubber bullets, bean bag rounds and cracker rounds,'' Manley said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts from the Wind River Bear Institute in Heber City, Utah,
a nonprofit conservation group, bring in fearless Kirilean bear
dogs from Finland that will aggressively chase a grizzly bear and
hopefully condition it to stay out of inhabited areas.
</P>
<P>
   But no one expects the problem to go away. ``As human population
increases and habitat is altered,'' Pozzanghera said, ``you will
see increasing conflicts with wildlife.''

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Someone carelessly left a hot skillet on top of the counter
top next to my stove, leaving an ugly scorch mark on the surface of
the Formica.
</P>
<P>
   I tried rubbing this black mark off with a mild abrasive but the
scorched area is too deep. I don't want to replace the entire
plastic counter top.
</P>
<P>
   It has been suggested that I glue some ceramic tiles over that
area and then use the tiles as a hot plate or cutting board, but I
feel this would be hard to clean around and would stick up too much
above the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Any other suggestion as to what I could do to cover up the
damage?
</P>
<P>
   A: One idea I've seen that worked out really well is to cut out
a rectangular section and then cover the opening with a drop-in
heatproof ceramic insert similar to the one shown here.
</P>
<P>
   To finish off and mount this insert you can use a mounting kit
that is sold in some home centers, or you can use the same kind of
stainless steel molding that is used for installing rimmed kitchen
sinks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been told that my attic is not vented adequately
because it has no ridge vents and no vents along the eaves.
</P>
<P>
   The attic does have regular louvered vents in the gables or
peaks at each end of the house, and so far I have seen no signs of
condensation or mildew.
</P>
<P>
   What do you think I should do?
</P>
<P>
   A: For maximum efficiency and adequate venting there should be
soffit vents in the eaves along each side, and sometimes ridge
vents are also needed along the top so that air can come in at the
bottom and flow out at the top.
</P>
<P>
   It all depends on the size of the attic and the size and number
of its vents.
</P>
<P>
   In your case I would just keep inspecting the attic regularly to
see if any problems with moisture or mildew do develop _ then take
the necessary steps to improve circulation up there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently had my cellar insulated and when this was done
they laid sheets of plastic over the dirt floor in the unfinished
crawl space under one part of the house.
</P>
<P>
   However, now I notice that there are signs of water under this
plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be because this type of insulation was not adequate
for a crawl space?
</P>
<P>
   A: That plastic is not intended to serve as insulation _ its
function is to serve as a vapor barrier that will seal out moisture
from the soil.
</P>
<P>
   The water you see under the plastic shows that the plastic is
doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   If the plastic were not there, that moisture would find its way
up into the house and could cause condensation and mildew problems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The detached garage behind my old house has a weatherproof
outdoor electric outlet on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   I use this for several electric power tools but this outlet is
not equipped with a ground fault circuit interrupter (not required
when the house was built).
</P>
<P>
   They tell me that this could expose me to a dangerous shock, so
I want to install one of these devices in this receptacle.
</P>
<P>
   Can I do this myself without having to call in an expensive
professional electrician?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your safest bet is to buy a portable GFCI (ground fault
circuit interrupter). It plugs into a regular grounded outlet and
provides the same protection as a permanently installed GFCI _ as
long as the original outlet is properly grounded.
</P>
<P>
   You simply plug this portable unit in like any extension cord,
then plug your tool or appliance into the receptacle on the front
of this device.

   CHINA-INTERNET (Beijing) _ The Chinese government on Wednesday
issued stern new regulations intended to control and restrict the
release of sensitive information on the Internet, underscoring the
government's love-hate relationship with cyberspace in a country
where the number of Internet users is growing exponentially. The
new rules, which were published in Wednesday's issue of the

is set to publish his first major novel in over a decade. Not only
that, but Bellow has also become a father again at the age of 84.
Bellow's new novel, ``Ravelstein,'' to be published by Viking in
April, is based on the life of his friend Allan Bloom, the
conservative thinker and professor of political philosophy who
wrote the best selling ``The Closing of the American Mind'' and who
died in Chicago in 1992 at the age of 62. By Dinitia Smith.

<P>
   ``I've always had this house in my head,'' said Dr. Niranjan
Rao, an Indian-born surgeon. With its three-story turret of rustic
brown stone and the castellated rampart that commands its entrance,
Rao's new home is a three-dimensional symbol of assimilation and
pride.
</P>
<P>
   In another sense, it is also a map of finding one's place in the
world. What makes this 7,000-square-foot house different from its
sprawling suburban neighbors is its theme: the struggle for unity,
pulling together the disparate parts of a family and a culture into
a single expression.
</P>
<P>
   The threads, however, are by no means seamlessly woven.
</P>
<P>
   Rao and his wife, Meena, are Indian; their architect, Dr. Ahmed
Azmy, is of Egyptian descent, and their canvas is a patch of
American suburbia, an unspoiled stretch of farmland in central New
Jersey, near the banks of the Millstone River. Architecturally, the
house has awkward transitions and unresolved passageways. But a
home is not just about style.
</P>
<P>
   As the cultural melting pot seeps outwards, away from the
cities, it brings with it a new kind of ethnic diversity to the
previously all-white enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this more evident than in Iselin, N.J., where the
heart of the Indian community is centered along Oak Tree Road, a
blighted strip that even Robert Venturi would find hard to embrace.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the bleak false fronts and mirrored windows are
exotic spice palaces, Indian restaurants and silk shops, purveyors
of statuettes of Hindu gods and glittering saris. An old Pizza Hut
with a red-tiled roof has been transformed into Sukhadia's, ``the
Sweet Maker,'' selling specialities like sesame chikki and mango
burfee.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, out of
45,000 Indian immigrants to the United States in 1996, almost 14
percent moved to New Jersey. The newspaper India Abroad reported
that in 1999 there were an estimated 160,000 Indians in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Jagdish Sidana, a movie director from Bombay, and his
wife, Padma Khanna, an actress and dancer, are in the process of
buying their first small house not far from Oak Tree Road. Nearby,
hundreds of others are personalizing mass-produced, split-level
houses with Hindu shrines, or transforming living rooms into
communal sleeping areas for grandmothers from Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, we lived with friends, then we managed to
rent a house,'' Sidana said. ``If you don't have credit and a
financial record, then you don't fit into the system. You can't get
a house, and even renting is difficult if you don't know anyone.
It's not that there's prejudice; it's just the way it is. That is
the hard part for a foreigner coming here for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a tenacity of purpose,'' he said. ``That's
what it takes to live in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther out still, in a more rural landscape, live Meena and
Niranjan Rao, who met when they were students at college in India.
A native of Indore, in central India, she was majoring in
engineering; he, from Bangalore, in the south, was studying
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were in Cleveland, my husband was working 18 hours a
day as a resident at the hospital there,'' Mrs. Rao said. ``We were
living in a very dinky house, and we used to go to this cafe where
we watched architecture students from Case Western playing around
with building blocks.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, the couple borrowed the Lego blocks of their
two-year-old son and began to play, too, with ideas for their dream
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't make circles with Lego blocks,'' Rao said. But
they could make an octagon, and that's the shape they ended up
building several years later, when Rao began practicing as a
general vascular surgeon at a hospital in New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   To transform their Lego daydream into an actual home, the Raos
hired Dr. Ahmed Azmy of HACBM, an architectural and engineering
firm in Princeton. ``I am Muslim and they are Hindu, but we worked
well together,'' Azmy said. ``The cultures are closer than you
think. Both have strong family ties and a spiritual sense of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The architect and his clients knew that they wanted the house to
have three key elements: a central courtyard, an entry that faced
east and a pooja room for prayer.
</P>
<P>
   With its eight sides connected around an open courtyard, the
facade of the house projects a surprisingly defensive air. All it
lacks is a moat and a drawbridge.
</P>
<P>
   A critical eye might wonder precisely what it is defending its
inhabitants from. The insidious influences of American pop culture?
Or the erosive effects of assimilation and a subsequent loss of
ethnic identity?
</P>
<P>
   The answer may be simpler than that. The inspiration for the Rao
house came from a Raj-era palace in Bangalore. Growing up nearby,
Rao had always been fascinated by the 45,000-square-foot pink
granite palace, which, like the Raos' house in New Jersey, is
stylistically out of its element. It was built in 1887 by Chamaraja
Wodeyar X, the maharajah of Mysore, who had been spellbound by
Windsor Castle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's just a hotel,'' Rao said of the building, which is
known as the Bangalore Palace. ``When I was a boy, you weren't
allowed to visit it, but there were pictures of it, and it made a
deep impression. From the start, we had the desire to create
something special like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Admiration for the past is a common influence in suburban
architecture (just thik of all those mini-Mount Vernons). But
unlike most American homeowners, the Raos were guided in their
nesting by more spiritual concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the planets to be in the right position before we
started,'' Mrs. Rao said, explaining their decision to consult with
a Hindu priest from a temple in nearby Bridgewater.
</P>
<P>
   The priest studied the birth stars of husband and wife, and
chose the most auspicious date for a groundbreaking ceremony, a
chilly day in April.
</P>
<P>
   Evil spirits were chased away by melodic chanting, and the land
was sanctified with incense, flowers, oil lamps and offerings of
food. The priest next dug a small pit in the middle of the property
and deposited nine precious stones and nine different grains in the
pits to represent the nine planets of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the main entrance to an Indian house faces east,
toward the rising sun. The Raos brought a compass, found true east
and started from there.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the lot faces southwest, so the entrance to the
house sticks out at an awkward angle, and the main hall _ large and
multiwindowed, with a highly polished red granite floor _ is
sparely furnished and rather chilly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the house has been arranged as a succession of
interlocking spaces for both public and private functions, some of
them designed in response to specific Indian traditions. The
kitchen has two separate areas, for example _ one for cooking
traditional vegetarian cuisine and another for cooking meat. The
octagonal structure is wrapped around a central courtyard, giving
all the rooms a view, either onto the surrounding landscape or
inward.
</P>
<P>
   ``A courtyard gives you privacy, but it is open to the sky and
the weather,'' Azmy said. ``I wasn't familiar with some of their
vernacular traditions, such as the pooja room, but the courtyard
concept is also very important in Egyptian culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The pooja room, a home shrine, sits in its own special part of
the house, an octagonal turret with a red marble floor. There are
no rooms below or above this sacred space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that we were spending so much money on this house that
there should be a special room built just for God,'' Rao said. Mrs.
Rao concurred. She said, ``We wanted a pure space.'' Every day, the
family goes there for prayers and chanting. Shoes are taken off and
left outside in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Not far to the north, in Watchung, N.J., another Indian doctor
has built a different kind of monumental house, not inspired by the
childhood memory of a palace in southern India but, instead, by
something all-American: a segment of ``Lifestyles of the Rich and
Famous.'' But in its way, the home of Dr. Sudhir Parikh is a castle
fit for a neo-Raj lifestyle, its 25,000 square feet commanding the
top of a hill in a high-priced subdivision of other megamansions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Parikh and his wife, Sudha, came to the United States in
1975 from Ahmedabad, India, by way of London. He specialized in
asthma and allergies, and went on to open a successful string of
clinics around New Jersey, which is plagued by environmental
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   One night, as the Parikhs were watching Robin Leach tour a
glamorous house in Dallas. They contacted the architect, Ronald
Riseman, who specializes in a certain kind of domestic grandeur,
and hired him to come north and design something similar.
</P>
<P>
   To all appearances, the house is yet another example of the
French chateau style beloved by property developers. But Indian
architectural themes have been subtly worked into the generic
format. A turret on the north side of the house is reflective of
Mogul architecture of northern India, Parikh explained. And on one
side of the house, like a Western echo of a traditional Mogul
garden feature, is a hot spa that overflows into an artificial
river. The water cuts a wavering line through the stone paving of
the terrace and empties into the swimming pool, which in turn
splashes down a 10-foot-high waterfall into a stone basin.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the house are Mogul-style touches, from elaborate
arches to doors copied from originals at the Lake Palace of Udaipur
in Rajas-than. At one end of the family room _ the couple have two
children _ is a monumental carved teak canopy whose columns hold up
a seat for two, suspended by chains. It is modeled after the
porchlike swinging seats in Indian palaces, Parikh said.
</P>
<P>
   In the cavernous lower level _ a 7,000-square-foot entertainment
area that feels a bit like a luxurious bomb shelter, with a 12-foot
movie screen and video projection system hanging from the ceiling _
stands a life-size vignette of an Indian man leading his family
through a metaphorical desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the image of Indian culture I admire,'' Parikh said.
``The man is the provider and protector of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Why such an excess of space for such a relatively small family?
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a very humble middle class family,'' Parikh said.
``I have five brothers and sisters who are all doctors, too. We
grew up in a very small house, less than 1,500 square feet. From
that time, I always dreamed of becoming a self-made person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came to this country in the late 1970s, you would
open The Times and see a photograph of a cow and a beggar sleeping
on the sidewalk,'' he continued. ``That was the impression people
had of India, but that is not India. If you go to history, there is
a great culture. People from India are as good as anyone else if
the right opportunities are given. Once we have opportunities, we
know how to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Parikhs' spotless, well-ordered environment is as far away
from the stereotype image of the cow and the beggar as one could
possibly get. Besides being a display of arrival and upward
mobility, the house is also a means of public service, extending
the doctor's identity as a successful Indian immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   The Raos lend their house for community events and Indian
literary gatherings. ``In the beginning, it's difficult
transferring from Eastern to Western ways,'' Parikh said. ``It
happens gradually. We make sure that our children attend Indian
cultural events and read Indian books. I feel as if I have become
much closer to India since I came here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some traditions make it through the immigration lines at Kennedy
Airport; others are left behind. The Parikh and Rao houses might be
seen as architectural essays in assimilation, but the sprawling
floor plans, with their personal temples and multitude of cultural
built-ins, speak of global diaspora, of heightened expectations, of
160,000 Indians setting up homes in New Jersey in the last 12
years, of strong family and religious ties, and a complex
overlapping of cultural influences.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the door to the temple room, Parikh said, ``Every
morning we come and pray here for a few minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   There are statues in three of the four corners: a large bronze
statue of Krishna, five-foot-tall wood versions of the gods Shiva
and Parvati, and the lifelike, slightly embalmed-looking figure of
the family guru, Mahaprabhuji, who sits in a lotus position on a
white platform. Here, the Parikh children pray for just 30 seconds,
to the gods and the guru.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't make them do chanting or pooja like many Hindu
families,'' their father said, referring to prayer services.
``We're more reform minded.''

JOHNNY ROTTEN BLASTS TV _ VIA HIS TV SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first episode of ``Rotten Television,'' Johnny Rotten:
sits in a tank and blows up a mannequin clothed in vintage rock
duds; takes Courtney Love, Neil Young, Axl Rose and Ozzy Osbourne
to task for not gracing him with an interview; interviews a handful
of clods who have answered an ad for a VJ for the show, two of whom
are such steak brains that they don't know who the bass player for
the Beatles was; gets his hair dyed; gets thrown off the
``Roseanne'' show. For real.
</P>
<P>
   There's more, of course, but the point is, Johnny Rotten is
back, he's on TV, and he's still not a big fan of what he calls
``fake and fraud,'' which he sees all around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much lies and nonsense in any industry you'd care
to name, but in particular the TV industry,'' says Rotten, who was
lead singer of both the Sex Pistols and (as John Lydon, his birth
name) Public Image Limited. ``I'm speaking my mind; I don't like
people to say one thing and do another.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotten says ``Rotten Television'' will air on VH1 ``when there's
a topic worthy of me.'' But in general, he's not a fan of
know-nothings and the sheeplike nature of too many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any such thing as rock 'n' roll anymore
_ it's an amalgamation of business interests,'' he says. ``Just
because lemmings go off the cliff doesn't mean I have to follow
them. VJs have turned this into a nation of half-wits.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotten began developing the show three years ago; he called
George Gimarc of Dallas looking to do something in television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to be different from the get-go,'' says Gimarc,
who is the show's co-creator. ``We talked it out, and along with
(co-creator and executive producer) Rob Barnett, we threw
everything in the pot. What happens in the future depends on what
happens in music and culture that catches our eye. Certainly awards
shows are a really big target.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of view is that this is somebody who's like you but
has access and is going to show what it's really like. There's
always a self-mocking thing with John, ever since the Sex Pistols,
and this will continue that, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Episode No. 2 will document Rotten's sojourn to the Sundance
Film Festival, where he will interview ``the stars'' and watch the
premiere of ``The Filth and the Fury,'' a documentary on the Sex
Pistols that includes horrifying footage of a heroin-addicted Sid
Vicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be as I always am: polite until otherwise indicated,'' he
says, relishing his chance to train his laser gaze and merciless
demeanor on actors, directors and hangers-on. ``I'm not here to be
all negative, negative. I have no format whatsoever _ I don't
believe in them and I never have. That's the story of my life,
really.''
</P>
<P>
   LOVE ME DO: And on a personal note, would the young lady who
proposed marriage to me because she liked my list of 50 great rock
songs please call back and leave your name and number?
</P>
<P>
   I love XTC, too. Honest.

FILING YOUR TAXES ONLINE: IT'S FASTER, MORE ACCURATE AND WELCOMED
BY IRS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (Circuits)  
(af) 
 By CATHERINE GREENMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Internal Revenue Service had its druthers, all the
taxpayers and preparers who still mail in returns would get on
their PCs and file over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of filing taxes electronically using stand-alone
or Internet-based software are numerous, the agency says.
</P>
<P>
   With electronic returns, IRS employees don't have to type
information into the agency's computer system, as they do with
paper returns, and that reduces costs. The agency says taxpayers
who file electronically will get electronic confirmations that the
returns were received and will get their refunds in about half the
time (usually within 7 to 10 days), compared with the usual time
required for a return that was mailed in.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, returns that are prepared and sent electronically
tend to be more accurate, said Robert E. Barr, the assistant
commissioner for electronic tax administration at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Returns prepared with a pencil and calculator have about a 20
percent error rate, compared to a 5 percent error rate for those
prepared by software,'' Barr said. ``And the electronic gateway on
our end is more reliable than the keypunchers who transfer the data
from paper to our system.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has recently been publicizing its goal of having at
least 80 percent of all individual tax returns filed electronically
by 2007. Currently, about 25 percent of total returns are filed
electronically, either over the Web or through the telefile
program, where filing is done by pushing buttons on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many Americans still sit at the dining-room table or
at their desks with calculators and fill out their tax forms by
hand, or they take their W-2s and other papers to an accountant to
have their taxes prepared and mailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do what they're used to,'' said Len Silverman, a
certified public accountant with a private practice in New York
City who still files his clients' returns by mail. ``It's going to
take awhile for the change to electronic filing to filter through
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the convenience of electronic filing is catching on. Thirty
million returns were filed electronically last year, according to
the IRS, a 19 percent increase over the year before. And according
to Forrester Research, the number of people who used Internet-based
tax programs to prepare their returns will reach 1 million this
year, only the second year that such services have been available.
</P>
<P>
   Those who choose to file their returns electronically this year
will face a range of choices. Virtually every computer-based tax
preparation option _ whether it involves software that is bought at
a store, downloaded from the Web or run directly over the Web from
an online tax preparer's server _ allows the user to transmit a
federal return electronically.
</P>
<P>
   And because more paid tax preparers are applying for agency
approval to file electronically, they are becoming increasingly
able to file their clients' returns online. Among the 29 million
returns received from hired preparers in 1999, 21 million were
received electronically, Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken TurboTax Deluxe, a popular program offered by Intuit on
CD-ROM, is available in stores and online at the Intuit Web site
this year for $49.95; the state tax version can be downloaded free
when the federal software is bought online.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger TaxCut Deluxe, sold by H&AMP;R Block, is available in
stores and online for $39.95 and includes free state tax software.
</P>
<P>
   The deluxe versions of tax-preparation programs generally tack
on tax-planning and tax-saving guides. The standard versions of
Quicken TurboTax (downloadable or on CD-ROM, $29.95) and Kiplinger
TaxCut (downloadable or on CD-ROM, $14.95) do not include state
forms. All the tax software mentioned here is available for both
Windows PCs and Macs
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to avoid downloading or installing the tax
software programs, both Intuit and H&AMP;R Block offer Web counterparts
to their software programs. Each of these programs offers the same
features and forms as the software versions, but the information
you type in during the interview process is stored on the company's
servers instead of on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   TurboTax for the Web for Tax Year 1999 costs $9.95 for the
federal version, $4.95 for the state version. The charge for the
Web version for TaxCut, available next week, is $9.95 for each form
filed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both Intuit's and H&AMP;R Block's Internet tax preparation programs
are free to those who qualify for filing 1040EZ forms. In addition,
Intuit's Tax Freedom Program is available online to anyone with a
1999 adjusted gross income of less than $20,000, regardless of how
complicated the return is. The state return is also free.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Microsoft has entered the tax preparation software
market with the release of TaxSaver Federal Deluxe on CD-ROM, which
sells for $44.95 (before a $20 rebate). A lighter version of
TaxSaver can be downloaded at taxsaver.msn.com for $19.95. Neither
of these programs includes state returns.
</P>
<P>
   Once you submit a software-prepared return online to the
software manufacturer, it is encrypted and batched with other
returns and sent electronically to the IRS. ``Our system is
designed to receive 50 to 500 forms at a time,'' Barr said. ``We
don't have a system in place to receive onesies directly from
individual filers.''
</P>
<P>
   Two newcomers to the online tax preparation business, H.D. Vest
(www.hdvestonline.com) and Taxes 4 Less (www.taxes4less.com), in
Calabasas, Calif., are offering services this year.
</P>
<P>
   H.D. Vest Online is offering free federal and state return form
preparation, regardless of income level or the return's degree of
complication, with the hopes of attracting potential new customers
to other financial services offered by the company, which is based
in Irving, Texas. Customers answer a series of questions online to
complete a return. Once it is completed, H.D. Vest sends the filer
an e-mail message with suggestions for financial planning, tips on
reducing next year's tax bill and the location of a local H.D. Vest
affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the rest of the services mentioned here, Taxes4Less' tax
preparation site is not fully automated. Instead, taxpayers fill
out a questionnaire online, pay a fee of about $100 and transmit
the information to a living, breathing tax analyst, commissioned by
the company, who prepares the return.
</P>
<P>
   Returns are sent back to the filer within 48 hours by regular
mail or e-mail, said Greg Yulish, president and co-founder of
Taxes4Less.
</P>
<P>
   The company offers a $3 incentive to encourage people to file
their federal taxes electronically once they are completed.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you think that any of the software or Internet-based tax
preparation solutions are completely paperless, be aware that you
still have to sign and mail an 8453 form (stating that you
understand and agree with your return) to the IRS after you file
electronically. The forms are available for printing at all the
sites once the returns are completed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the IRS sent out on postcards 11 million E-file
Customer Numbers, which taxpayers can enter on their electronic
returns in lieu of sending in the 8453 form. The postcards were
sent to taxpayers who had filed electronically the previous year,
Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers who owe money can make their payments with checks,
have them debited directly from their bank accounts or charge them
to their American Express, Discover or MasterCard accounts. The
credit card companies may charge convenience fees, which will be
noted on the cardholder's statement. Those who want to pay by
direct debit or by credit card must call (888) 2PAY-TAX.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to fill out paper forms and file by mail, a
computer can still be useful. All federal forms and publications
are available for downloading at the IRS site, which is reached at
www.irs.gov/forms(underscore)pubs/findfiles.html.

<P>
   During last year's Super Bowl, partygoers could rack up another
advantage over fans who attended the game. Not only did television
watchers save the price of admission, get all the munchies they
could eat and have a chance to critique the latest batch of
million-dollar commercials, but they could also see exactly where
the first-down stripe was.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of squinting at linesmen, chains and poles, home viewers
could see a computer-generated yellow stripe across the field,
marking the line that the offensive team had to cross to make a
first down.
</P>
<P>
   This simple addition to football broadcasts, introduced on Sept.
27, 1998, in a game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Cincinnati
Bengals, has been well received by viewers: a 1999 Harris poll
found that 92 percent of football fans wanted to see the virtual
first-down strip in future broadcasts. And so they have. Since that
first broadcast, by ESPN, all the sports networks have hustled to
adopt the technology.
</P>
<P>
   They have had a choice of two companies to do the job:
SporTVision, whose 1st &AMP; Ten system is the choice of ESPN and ABC,
which will broadcast Super Bowl XXXIV on Sunday from Atlanta; and
Princeton Video Image, whose orange-colored First Down Line is used
by CBS and several international broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Adding the line to a game broadcast is an impressive feat of
logistics and engineering. It takes surveying equipment, special
video cameras, a rack of computers and a staff of operators to
insert a simple line and change it every time a first down is made.
And it takes impressive computing power to generate and overlay the
line: SporTVision's system uses a dedicated PC and four Silicon
Graphics workstations, while Princeton Video Image's system uses a
proprietary multiprocessor video editing computer called L-VIS,
(pronounced Elvis) for live-video insertion system.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies' systems receive raw video feeds from the three
main cameras used in all broadcasts _ at the 20-, 50- and 20-yard
lines _ as well as the video feed from the network's production
unit that is about to go out over the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The raw video feeds are used to generate the image of the line,
but it is the network's feed _ which includes the score, the game
time and the network logo _ that is the final target for the
virtual line.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for that arrangement is time: the virtual first-down
line can take around half a second to generate, so it should be the
last thing that is done before the video feed goes to the network
studios for broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   For the first-down line to be acceptable to fans, it must look
as natural as a yard marker painted onto the grass or artificial
turf. To achieve that, the focus and perspective must be exactly
right _ which is why each of the three ``up'' main cameras at the
stadium are equipped with sensors that precisely measure the
cameras' pan and tilt angles, and levels of zoom and focus. By
comparing this information with a 3-D computer model of the
stadium, the video production systems can generate a realistic
video overlay 30 times a second that will appear natural, neither
sharper nor more blurred than the rest of the picture, and will
seem to stay in place as the camera moves.
</P>
<P>
   When the offensive team makes a first down, a crew member on the
field calls in the location of the marker, and a computer operator
in the video production outpost enters the measurement into the
system. The graphics workstations generate a precise position and
dimensions for the line, using information from the 3-D computer
model and the live camera's positioning sensors. It continues to
update that information as the camera pans to follow the action.
</P>
<P>
   Overlaying the line onto the broadcast image is the last stage
of production, and it is no simple feat. The process is similar to
chroma-keying _ the trick used in weather reports where the
broadcaster stands in front of a solid green or blue screen, and a
weather map is superimposed electronically onto the screen. But
that process is simple compared with the first-down-line overlay.
</P>
<P>
   Regular chroma-keying replaces a single key color with an
overlaid image, but the grass or turf on a football field contains
a range of colors, from shadowy dark greens to mud brown, and the
colors can change as daylight fades or as clouds pass in front of
the sun. A dedicated operator needs to tell the system to overlay a
range of field colors while excluding the colors of the teams'
uniforms (predominantly blue and gold for the St. Louis Rams and
light and dark blue for the Tennessee Titans in the Super Bowl on
Sunday) so the players will appear to step over the line. As the
game progresses, the operator monitors changes in light and enters
any color changes into the system.
</P>
<P>
   A processor- and labor-intensive process like that does not come
cheap. Although both companies and the networks they work for are
silent on the subject, most estimates place the cost per game of
adding the virtual first-down line at tens of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology is not just being used as a customer service
_ it also generates revenue. SporTVision's patents prominently
mention the system's benefits for adding advertising to on-screen
``dead space.'' CBS uses Princeton Video's technology to do that
every day, overlaying virtual advertisements on Manhattan
cityscapes during the ``Morning Show.'' CBS even used it to obscure
an NBC billboard in Times Square during the recent coverage of the
New Year's Eve celebration _ something the news anchor Dan Rather
later said he regretted.
</P>
<P>
   The technology has also been used in some baseball broadcasts to
put virtual advertisements on the backstop behind home plate. But
you are not likely to see a first-down line dotted with corporate
logos. The National Football League controls the Super Bowl, and
while it has approved the virtual first-down line, it is adamantly
opposed to showing a lot of logos on screen.

   What Is It? Rose Campion
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm enclosing a photograph of a plant I love. Can you
identify it and tell me where to find it? The foliage is silvery
green. The flower is a beautiful deep rose-red. I am almost certain
it is a perennial. I've shown the photograph to nurseries, but they
have not known its name.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Plant photographs lie at least as often as they give useful
clues. But in this case there's no mistaking old-fashioned rose
campion, Lychnis coronaria, which has been a staple of dooryard
gardens for centuries in spite of its straggly habits and neon
magenta flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Lychnis does have a few merits. It thrives in tough conditions,
unbothered by poor soil and drought. And it blooms for a long time.
Though the flowers are small and widely separated, rose campion
keeps putting out new ones (albeit fewer and fewer of them) for six
to eight weeks after the initial burst of blossom in early July.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it may be that the plant persists simply
because each flower makes roughly a zillion seeds, all of which
germinate, so before long your garden is full of the silvery little
rosettes of the first-year leaves. But don't worry. As long as you
keep your place well-fertilized and amply watered, most of them
will rot.
</P>
<P>
   L. coronaria is classed as both biennial and perennial. It
flowers in its second year and usually, but not always, dies after
flowering. To keep a clump going in the same spot, just thin out
all but two or three of the babies that sprout near the parent
plant.
</P>
<P>
   The only difficult part of growing these near-weeds is having
the discipline to cut them down when they start looking tatty, even
though they're still covered with buds. (Full disclosure: I love
rose campion's ghostly twin, L. coronaria alba, which floats on its
Tinkertoy architecture all over my white garden.) The easiest way
to get campion plants is to beg a few babies from someone who has
them.
</P>
<P>
   Rose campion plants are available from Bluestone Perennials,
7211 Middle Ridge Road, Madison, Ohio, 44057; (800) 852 5243.
Seeds, which should be chilled for six weeks before planting for
best germination, are available from Pinetree Garden Seeds, PO Box
300, New Gloucester, Maine 04260; (207) 926-3400. Both catalogs are
free.
</P>
<P>
   L. coronaria alba is available in plant form from Avant Gardens,
710 High Hill Road, North Dartmouth, Mass. 02747; (508) 998-8819;
catalog, $3. Seeds are sold by Thompson &AMP; Morgan, PO Box 1308,
Jackson, N.J. 08527; (800) 274-7333; free catalog. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Willful Basil
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last fall, I brought a big pot of basil in from the terrace.
It has been sitting in a sunny window and providing us with leaves
ever since, but lately it seems to be declining, and the few leaves
it has produced don't have much flavor. I've tried to keep the
flowers pinched out. Is there anything else I can do?
</P>
<P>
   A: Basil is an annual plant. It wants to make lots of leaves,
then switch its energy into making lots of flowers, followed by
lots of seeds. That accomplished, it wants to die. Keeping the
flowers pinched out will stave off the end for a while, but as
you've noticed, the plant is determined.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it is in flowering mode, it will focus on flowers _ or
trying for flowers _ until exhaustion puts it out of its misery.
</P>
<P>
   So that's it for last year's plant, but before you rush off to
get a new one, please consider just doing without until next basil
season. Basil needs strong, unfiltered sunlight to produce the
essential oils that make it so tasty, and even the best
greenhouse-grown plants tend to be pale shadows of the summer
herb. &QL;

A BRIEF TIME IN THE SUN: LORRAINE HANSBERRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PERRY STEWART 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lorraine Hansberry was tragically young, unquestionably gifted
and passionately black when she died 35 winters ago. Seven years
earlier, at 28, she had burst onto the American theater scene like
a comet with her first play, ``A Raisin in the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Broadway play written by a black woman, it told in
universally human terms the story of three generations of
African-Americans struggling desperately to escape their cramped
Chicago apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Her output as a writer was necessarily small, due to her early
death from cancer. But there was enough material to provide a
performance portrait of Hansberry. So her former husband,
songwriter and music publisher Robert Nemiroff, pieced together
excerpts from Hansberry's plays, journals and speeches and
christened the result ``To Be Young, Gifted and Black.'' Hansberry
had used those three adjectives to salute the winners of a United
Negro College Fund writing contest she judged.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 31 years since ``Young, Gifted and Black'' was first
produced, and a little over 20 years since Fort Worth's Rudy
Eastman directed the piece for Sojourner Truth Players. A lot has
happened in the interim. Nationally, the civil rights movement has
seen strides and setbacks. In Fort Worth, Eastman founded Jubilee
Theatre, an African-American playhouse where ``To Be Young, Gifted
and Black'' previewed last weekend and played this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lorraine Vivian Hansberry was born May 19, 1930, in Chicago. But
her family was not the model for the Younger household of ``Raisin
in the Sun.'' Her father, Carl Hansberry, was at various times a
real estate broker, banker and deputy U.S. marshal. He earned
enough money to keep his family living in comfortable style. Like
the Youngers, the Hansberrys bought a home in a previously
all-white neighborhood. Residents protested and threw bricks, but
the Hansberrys were victorious in court.
</P>
<P>
   After college, Lorraine Hansberry moved to New York City, wrote
for magazines and married Nemiroff, who co-wrote the 1950s hit
``Cindy, Oh, Cindy.'' They were divorced in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Many theatergoers know Lorraine Hansberry only for ``Raisin in
the Sun.'' But she had more than one story to tell. Her second
play, ``The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window,'' which closed its
Broadway run on the day Hansberry died, is a world away from the
Chicago tenement of her first play. The title character, a Jewish
intellectual, appears several times in ``Young, Gifted and Black.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes think that when Hansberry wrote `The Sign in
Sidney Brustein's Window' that she foreshadowed some stuff we would
later see by other playwrights,'' Eastman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an awfully good piece, and it attests to her versatility.
She was a literary person who just happened to be black. She had a
sense of the whole world. That's where her universality lies, in
the fact that she could communicate in several voices.''
</P>
<P>
   The examples of Hansberry's writing selected for ``Young, Gifted
and Black'' reveal considerable passion for the civil rights
movement of her time and unabashed rage at the injustice that
fueled the movement. Those elements were prominent in Eastman's
late 1970s production, but the rage factor may have diminished in
the interval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a play about the words,'' Eastman told a preview Fort
Worth audience in his pre-curtain welcome. That characteristically
terse comment is an important clue to why and how Eastman chose to
revisit the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``My approach to it was that the sheer quality of her writing
was more important than the anger of it,'' he said. ``Back then, I
looked at it with the passion of youth rather than the passion of
the movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Eastman believes, ``The country has been lulled into
economic security and so forth. So the whole movement is confused
to some degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the things Lorraine Hansberry advocated we have seen
come true, and a lot of things she advocated probably have not
happened yet. But that's the way it is in any kind of movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years later, we can look back and appreciate how far
the nation as a whole has come since these ideas were first
introduced ... I think that one of the reasons I chose to do it
was: `Let's look back at it, see where we've come from.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice sort of barometer for that. It allows us to
compare ourselves to what we were 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastman's staging of ``Gifted and Black'' does not follow the
script completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nemiroff made `suggestions' rather than firm directions,'' the
director said. ``But it also says in the notes that all of these
are subject to change depending on how the director wants to
approach the material.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastman took advantage of that artistic elbow room by assigning
the monologue at the end of Act I to a white character instead of
the African-American character indicated in the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was interesting to hear those ideas coming out of
a different mouth,'' he said, adding that he also wanted to
underscore Hansberry's admiration for the work of Irish writer Sean
O'Casey.
</P>
<P>
   While it departed from the show's blueprint, Eastman's gambit
was very much in synch with its spirit of diversity. ``Gifted'' was
written for five women and two men, and Nemiroff's intent was for
the cast to be racially mixed. Eastman's cast consists of five
women and three men. One man and two women are white, the rest
African-American. Although one actress (Regina Washington) is the
principal Lorraine, all five women appear as Hansberry at some time
in the play.
</P>
<P>
   What if death had not silenced Hansberry's articulate voice
prematurely? What if she had been here to comment on the
assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X? Would she
have picked up the torch and turned full-blown activist?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling that if she had lived, she would have become
much more of a revolutionary,'' Eastman said. ``And she might have
become very bitter about how things were going, particularly during
the Reagan years that lulled us all into the I-Me Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Maisha Baton_ the Albuquerque, N.M.-based poet, playwright and
educator, speculated:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if she were alive today that she would still be a
playwright. She loved the theater. After `Raisin,' she began to
speak even more to social issues, and she would have continued to
do that _ but in her plays. She would be a revolutionary playwright
rather than a revolutionary.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet another shopper recently decided to forgo a trip to the mall
and instead boot up the personal computer and do a little
e-commerce. What the shopper may not have realized was that her
every mouse click was being observed by Johanne Torres, 23, an
employee of icontact.com, sitting at a terminal at the company's
nondescript offices in Fairfield, Conn., some 500 miles away from
the shopper's home in Morrisville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The shopper was looking for a hope chest at the site of a
Boston-based store called Home Town Stores, but she was becoming
frustrated as her searches persistently guided her to pages selling
tool chests. Ms. Torres decided to step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here live to assist you,'' Ms. Torres typed. ``How can I
help you today?'' Her words appeared in a box that popped up on the
shopper's screen much like an Instant Message pops up on America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, hello, Johanne,'' the shopper replied. ``This is an
interesting feature.''
</P>
<P>
   In less than a minute, Ms. Torres told the shopper that the
online store did not have in stock the item that she was looking
for but gave her the e-mail address of someone at the store who
could help her.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are making it possible for e-commerce sites to
pipe live customer service representatives to shoppers over the
Internet, but icontact.com is pushing the idea much further.
Instead of waiting for a befuddled online shopper to click on a
Help button on the computer screen, icontact.com's technology lets
human helpers _ the company calls them Netreps _ hover unseen in
the background, able to get in contact with Web shoppers, many of
whom believe they are browsing the Net unobserved.
</P>
<P>
   If the technology becomes more widespread, online consumers may
soon experience an unprecedented level of service and, some might
say, an unprecedented level of intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   From her 17-inch computer screen, Ms. Torres can, at a
well-trained glance, easily keep track of five to six shoppers at
sites that are equipped with icontact.com's system. She can see
what items attract shoppers' attention based on what they search
for, what they place in their virtual shopping carts and where they
might be running into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Torres, who was monitoring traffic at HomeTownStores.com,
said she noticed that the North Carolina woman appeared in need of
a computer-assisted helping hand. So Ms. Torres reached out through
the Internet, tapped the woman on the shoulder and introduced
herself. She told the shopper how to speak back, if she wished, by
typing in a window that appeared on her screen.
</P>
<P>
   Using icontact.com's software, Ms. Torres could just as easily
have helped the customer fill out online forms and could have
corrected any mistakes that might have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Torres could also have remotely taken control of the
shopper's Web browser and directed her any way that Ms. Torres,
icontact or the shopper wished.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at icontact.com say their system is proactive,
compared with competitors' reactive systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our software has the power to initiate contact,'' said Bill
Christie, chief operating officer of icontact.com. ``We don't have
to wait for someone to ask us for help.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, icontact.com's system operates on consumer sites like
Network Associates, the Marriott Vacation Club and CyberState
University. Christie said he hoped that icontact.com's technology
would one day be as pervasive on the Web as Dolby technology is in
consumer and professional audio systems, to the point that people
might be content to let unseen Net representatives guide them
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If that were to happen, the simplest online activity could
become a lot more chatty and interactive. But the question remains
whether consumers would be comfortable with the idea they they
might not be shopping in complete anonymity, that powerful software
was profiling their buying habits, ranking them as customers and
starting digital dialogues with them.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet experts raise the issue of whether systems like
icontact.com's may be too intrusive, violating shoppers' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Lucian Hughes, director of research at Andersen Consulting, a
technology research and development company in Palo Alto, Calif.,
said people generally viewed privacy as ``sacred, but cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If people sense a loss of control over their privacy,'' Hughes
said, ``then there will be an enormous reaction. On the other hand,
people are willing to surrender it in the right conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said that if online customer service systems clearly
explain to potential users what they are doing and if the service
proves useful, people are likely to embrace it. In short, he said
the give and take with customer service people, even those unseen
on the Internet, adds to the sociability of shopping; a trend that
he says is likely to be extended by high technology.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very social in their shopping,'' Hughes said.
``People like to feel part of a group.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Gier is a vice president at Ask Jeeves, an online question
and answer service. ``You need to be sensitive of the rules of
interfering with people on a Web site,'' Ms. Gier said. ``You need
to be sensitive to breaking into someone's experience when they are
just surfing. You may run into some issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie said that having a Net representative start an online
conversation with a shopper is not very different from having a
good salesman approach a repeat shopper in a traditional store.
Shoppers who say they do not require help are left alone.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of interactive Web service for icontact's clients is
that despite the growing popularity of online shopping, millions of
people still find the process confusing and frustrating. A survey
conducted last summer by Net Effect, a software company recently
bought by Ask Jeeves, found that 67 percent of online shoppers
never complete their transactions. And less than 6 percent of
people who window shop online try to buy something before clicking
off.
</P>
<P>
   Web site designers have scrambled to improve online customer
service, setting up 24-hour live customer support services in
special chat rooms and fully automated help features. But online
shopping sites are increasingly looking for more ingenious,
interactive technologies to reassure online shoppers that _ just as
in a traditional store _ someone is standing by to help.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like the former Net Effect, the Acuity Corp. and
WebLine Communications, which was recently acquired by Cisco
Systems, have had the capacity to guide shoppers in real time
through e-commerce sites that used their technologies; but that was
only in instances in which shoppers actually asked for help.
</P>
<P>
   On the Land's End e-commerce site, which uses a help system
designed by Cisco Systems, shoppers who click on a special Help
button are given the option of calling a company representative on
the telephone or communicating with an assistant through a chat
window on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Net representatives using icontact systems focus on particular
types of shoppers. The program carefully tracks traffic on sites
using the technology, and only those customers who meet certain
standards _ like having a particular frequency of purchases and
amount of average purchase _ established by site managers will get
the attention of a Net representative.
</P>
<P>
   Most shoppers, Christie said, are delighted to learn that live,
online help is available. One of the first hurdles, he said, is
convincing shoppers that the help they are getting is being
provided by a real person and not some kind of artificial
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers have quizzed Net representatives about everything from
the weather to the identity of Monica Lewinsky before they were
convinced that the online help was indeed human.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bowman, chief executive of icontact.com and Outpost.com, an
e-commerce site that makes extensive use of live online help, said
he was convinced that ``people want online what people offline
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Fardos, a district service and support manager for Hewlett
Packard, said the system from icontact.com is being used
successfully in the company's online business with other companies.
He said he thought ``the system might be a bit too invasive'' for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Johanne Torres said she had found that most consumers
appreciated the unsolicited human touch online.

A SENEGALESE SINGER MIXES THE STREET AND THE SPIRITUAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID HECHT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAKAR, Senegal _ Cheikh Ndigel Lo says he would never be able to
make his music if it was not for his religion. He is a Mouride.
Followers of this distinctly Senegalese Sufi Islamic brotherhood go
into trances from hours of chanting, some while beating themselves
with wooden clubs.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the kind of music Lo is known for. One of his new
songs is a remake of the Beatles' ``Let It Be,'' though Lo, who is
44 and speaks little English, has changed those words to
``Mbeddemi,'' meaning ``in the street'' in the Wolof language. (The
song has not been released internationally because of unresolved
copyright issues.)
</P>
<P>
   In the title track of his new album, ``Bambay Gueej''
(Jololi/World Circuit), to be distributed in the United States in
March by Nonesuch, he sings of how, when the Mouride founder,
Amadou Bamba, was exiled by the French colonizers at the beginning
of 20th century, he magically turned into the ocean, providing
``the salt of life'' and connecting continents and cultures.
</P>
<P>
   The songs in the album also change like the ocean, from Cuban
salsa, to Congolese soukous, to Nigerian Afrobeat, to Bambara music
from Mali, with elements of reggae, funk and jazz. All are peppered
with a distinctively Senegalese percussion sound. The final song of
the album, ``Zikr,'' is a simple Mouride religious prayer. (Zikr is
an Arabic word for the ritual recitation of the names of God.)
</P>
<P>
   So many different styles could become a mishmash. This album is
not. ``Bambay Gueej'' (``Bamba Is the Ocean'') has been No. 4 on
the European-based World Music Chart since December after having
been No. 1 in November. The Senegalese singer Youssou Ndour and
Nick Gold, the owner of World Circuit, caringly produced the album,
getting the voice of a Mali singer, Oumou Sangare, for backups on
one song, and the Cuban flutist Richard Egues for another.
</P>
<P>
   But Lo, speaking in French and Wolof, insisted that the real
producer behind his music is his marabout or spiritual guide, Maame
Massamba Ndiaye Borom Ndigel. Maame (grandfather) ``knows the
secret of breath,'' he said, wearing a 4-by-6-inch photograph of
the marabout around his neck permanently. The marabout, he said,
has ``powers that most people cannot even imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   From the village of Ndigel the marabout leads a group of holy
Mouride warriors known as the Baye Fall who crisscross the hot
dusty interior of Senegal, singing, proselytizing and begging.
Senegalese often complain that the Baye Fall are loud and
bothersome, yet they are also well loved. They dress differently
from most Mourides, wearing bright costumes made of patchwork
clothes and dreadlocks like the Rastafarians. The Baye Fall say
they wear dreadlocks to emulate the Senegalese warriors of old, but
they bear no arms. Many, like Lo, believe in magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I connect to Maame through the earth,'' he said in his
oceanside living room in a Dakar suburb called Mamelles. As he said
this, he slapped his hand on the ground. ``You think he isn't aware
of what's going on in this room right now as we speak? Ha!''
</P>
<P>
   With bulging eyes and resembling Sammy Davis Jr. in dreadlocks,
Lo is considered by the Senegalese to be the most unusual looking
Baye Fall of all. He rarely answers questions directly; sometimes
he's friendly, other times, suspicious and accusatory. Attempts to
cut short his monologues about his marabout are futile: ``Maame is
with me even when I'm touring the United States,'' he said. ``The
connection is stronger than a telephone and more serious than a
facsimile machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Few followers of the brotherhood claim to have telepathic
powers, but there is perhaps a special connection between the
thousands of Mourides who have gone out into the world in recent
decades. Thousands are street peddlers in cities across the United
States, Europe and the Middle East. Their overseas ``headquarters''
is New York, where many hawk knockoffs of name-brand watches and
sunglasses in tourist areas, particularly Times Square. Many live
in Harlem; in recent years the corner of 116th Street and Malcolm X
Boulevard has become known as Little Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mourides were mostly farmers, growing peanuts for export,''
said Professor Leonardo Villalon, author of ``Islamic Society and
State Power in Senegal.'' (He is presently teaching in Senegal.)
``But with desertification and changes in the economy they have
diversified into international trade networks, which are organized
around connections to their various marabouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of these marabouts live in Touba, a holy city founded by
Amadou Bamba after he made a deal with the French that enabled him
to return from exile on condition that his followers stopped
causing unrest. Although Touba lies in the desolate interior, it
has become Senegal's second main commercial center, with a market
full of merchandise, mostly from New York.
</P>
<P>
   It also has huge white palaces and mausoleums for marabouts,
living and dead, and a large library for the many books about and
written by Amadou Bamba.
</P>
<P>
   Bamba's philosophy has been called Sufi capitalism, and he has
sayings such as ``jef jel,'' meaning in Wolof, ``What you earn for
yourself, take for yourself.'' With so many Mourides in Harlem,
African-Americans are converting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not antimodern, it's not antiwomen, its not
antilearning,'' said Wendy Wilson Fall, an African-American Mouride
who lives in Dakar. ``Mourides are generally considered
cosmopolitan, open and tolerant, with a strong tradition of
religious discussion, much like the shul tradition among the
Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   The door to Mouridism is the Baye Fall movement, Ms. Wilson Fall
said. ``It provides a way of life for people who are not ready for
the discipline required of a practiced disciple,'' she said. Baye
Fall members do not fast during the month of Ramadan or observe
other basic tenets of Islam. ``The emphasis is on intention,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lo was born to Mouride parents but showed little interest in the
brotherhood when he was younger, and he hated school. Mostly he
played music, eventually landing a job at a big hotel in Dakar. ``I
learned to play whatever the tourists wanted: rock, polka,
flamenco, waltzes,'' he said. He had a big Afro hair style in those
days, he said, illustrating by holding his hands about a foot away
from each side of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Life, he said, changed after he met his marabout. ``Maame
connected together all the disparate worlds I inhabit,'' he said.
``Through him I learned to believe and know exactly what it is I
believe in. That's very important for a person.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sufi brotherhoods hold Senegalese society together. Sixty
percent of the economy operates through the Mouride, Lo said,
thumping the floor, and adding, ``Make sure you write that down.''
``We Mourides don't create much though,'' he said. ``We are
traders. We exchange.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In the middle of surfing the Web for Bart Simpson, stock market
updates, sports news and celebrity gossip, why not take a few
minutes and look at a few sites that might save your life?
</P>
<P>
   Few occupations are as omnipresent as firefighting, and few are
as taken for granted. Both aspects are true on the Internet as
well. Directories like www.fire-find.com, firefighting.about.com
and www.fire-ems.net have links to hundreds of sites for individual
fire departments, equipment pages, conventions, clubs, memorabilia
and professional improvement. Jumping in can be like entering a
smoke-filled hallway; it is easy to get distracted and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Modern technology _ heat-resistant suits, two-way radios,
infrared glasses and more _ can create an illusion of safety. ``I
think that what people don't understand is that it is not an exact
science, that firefighting is inherently a dangerous job,'' said
Michael Regan, deputy New York City fire commissioner for public
information.
</P>
<P>
   The New York department's extensive site
(www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/fdny) has charts showing the decline in
civilian deaths from fires over the years, but for all the
technology and training available, firefighters know that their
greatest risk is civilian carelessness. When the origin of a fatal
fire is a bed surrounded by empty liquor bottles, ``it's hard to
put that on the Web,'' Regan said.
</P>
<P>
   The department's online fire safety guides are at
www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/fdny/html/firesafety.html. They include
``Fire Tips for Seniors,'' ``Smoke Detectors'' and ``Planned Escape
From Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Fire Protection Association in Quincy, Mass.
(www.nfpa.org), is renowned for its codes, training guides and
reports and has more than 800 online pages on fire and other safety
issues. Last June, it introduced a children's site, www.sparky.org.
In ``Sparky's News,'' the Dalmatian mascot takes children through
drills on home escape planning, what to do if clothes catch on fire
and other tips.
</P>
<P>
   The association's ``Risk Watch'' program has illustrated
posters, stickers and lesson plans that teachers and parents can
print out, arranged by grade level. There are also summaries and
order forms for the entire ``Risk Watch'' curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Many association reports are not free, but some are online: one
43-page data package details an alarming rise in the number of
fires from lighted candles (www.nfpa.org/research/candles.pdf).
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1940s, the association has conducted
investigations and analyses of major fires. An online reprint from
the NFPA Journal, for example, gives details of the University of
North Carolina fraternity house fire of May 12, 1996, which killed
five people in Chapel Hill the morning of graduation and after a
big late-night party. Carelessly discarded smoking material was the
cause, but the group's analysis also blamed the fraternity house's
interior finish and lack of fire doors and sprinkler systems, which
worsened the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same factors are killing young people at fraternity houses
today as they were 20 years ago,'' the 1996 report says. That
article and many other detailed reprints are at
www.nfpa.org/research/fire(US)investigation/articles/articles.html.
</P>
<P>
   Another article at that site, of special interest to New
Yorkers, is ``What Went Wrong?'' an analysis of two fires, one on
Dec. 18, 1998, in Brooklyn that killed three firefighters and one
five days later in a Manhattan high-rise that killed four tenants
in a stairwell. There are no easy answers in either blaze, it says,
except the need for tenants, landlords and employees to be
educated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Staying put may be the safest action to take in a high-rise
fire, and keeping doors closed can keep fire from spreading,'' the
article says. ``But recent high-rise apartment building fires show
that most people don't know these basics. And ignorance can be
deadly.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the right training and equipment, firefighters
die, as six did in Worcester, Mass., last month. Two firefighters
went into a burning warehouse thinking a homeless couple might
still be inside, and four followed to save the first two, who had
become lost in the inky maze.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only a charred wall remains, and so does a site of
tributes by the Professional Fire Fighters of Massachusetts
(www.pffm.org). One of the most moving is a handwritten letter that
was left at Worcester's central fire station along with the
writer's two most precious possessions: his wings and his Purple
Heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost a leg in an undeclared war, and these men lost their
lives in an undeclared war,'' the Vietnam veteran wrote. ``The big
difference being my war is over, and their war will never end.''

`THE MISSING WORLD' :  A SERIOUS NOVEL WITH A FARCICAL TONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A catchy what-if idea lies at the heart of ``The Missing
World,'' an enthralling new novel by Margot Livesey, who, to judge
from her previous novels, ``Homework'' and ``Criminals,'' seems
fascinated by the narrow borders dividing madness from sanity,
goodness from evil.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is this: Suppose that you had messed up very badly with
someone you loved and who had once loved you. Then suppose
something happened to that person to make him or her forget how you
had messed up. Given a second chance, could you do things right
this time? Or would some deeper cause of your bad behavior prevail?
</P>
<P>
   This is the situation that Jonathan Littleton, an insurance
claims adjuster, and Hazel Ash Ransome, a free-lance journalist,
find themselves in at the start of ``The Missing World.'' Jonathan
and Hazel were lovers living together in London until Hazel grew so
angry at something Jonathan did that she rented her own flat and
moved out.
</P>
<P>
   Then one snowy evening Hazel, walking home from work, is knocked
down by a car that is unable to stop at a crossing. She makes it
home, but while arguing with Jonathan on the phone she experiences
a seizure and passes out. Jonathan rushes her to a hospital and
waits days for her to regain consciousness. When she does, she can
remember nothing from the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Her hostility to Jonathan has vanished, and she is willing to go
home with him to complete her recovery. ``Once again he would be
the man she'd fallen in love with,'' Jonathan reflects. ``And vice
versa. This was the ultimate second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Livesey does several intriguing things with this
complication. First, she begins the narrative from Jonathan's point
of view and skims over whatever he did wrong to Hazel, so that as
readers we sympathize with him and root for him to succeed in
winning her back.
</P>
<P>
   Then her story leaps without any explanation to two other
characters who seem to have no connection to Jonathan and Hazel.
One of them is Charlotte Granger, an out-of-work actress so lost in
fantasies and irresponsible about money that we fear for her
survival. The other is Freddie Adams, a black American from
Cincinnati who has apprenticed himself to a roofer but would prefer
to vegetate at home on his couch.
</P>
<P>
   Only gradually, through complex plot development, do Charlotte
and Freddie connect with each other and with Jonathan and Hazel. As
they do, they begin to shift in moral worth. The apparently weak
turn out to be compassionate and perceptive, while those who appear
strong eventually prove brutal and indifferent to people's
feelings. You come to like the people you at first feared for and
to loathe the ones who began by seeming appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Ms. Livesey tells her story in such a way that no matter
how extreme its events _ and these comprise rape and other forms of
physical violence _ the tone remains nearly farcical throughout,
depending as the action does on coincidence and misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The texture of the narrative is so elaborate that Ms. Livesey
seems almost to be playing literary games. For instance,
Charlotte's relationship with Freddie is foreshadowed when she
meets a schoolgirl on a bus who is writing a composition on
``Othello.'' Other events are echoed in puns. It's as if the author
were defusing the consequences of her characters' actions, or
creating a dud like the Orsini bomb, which Jonathan and Hazel once
saw at an exhibition on the Spanish Civil War. ``Orsini, the
placard explained, was an anarchist who had risked his life to hurl
the bomb at an important personage in the Madrid opera house only
to have it roll under the skirts of a nearby lady and fail to
explode.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to say that what people try to do doesn't really matter,
Ms. Livesey makes all of her characters fail in their objectives
and stay locked up in the worlds of their interior lives, failing
to see beyond their compulsions, whether they are trying to regain
their memories or obliterate them.
</P>
<P>
   In a way the model for all of them is the boy with Tourette's
syndrome who walks the street on which Jonathan and Hazel live.
``He turned once, took a hesitant step and as if some spring in the
mechanism had broken, circled again. ...
</P>
<P>
   ```He frightens me,' said Hazel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jonathan put his arm around her. `He's quite harmless. In all
the years he's been around, I've never heard him say a word to
another person.'''
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly what is frightening about him. Beneath all
the comic reaching out is the failure to connect in this
intricately patterned novel that makes you feel as well as think.

STOCK SHOW REGULAR'S DESSERTS LOOK GOOD ENOUGH TO DRINK
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Resending to fix byline) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Fort Worth Stock Show is going on, and
that means one of the most crowded corners of the Will Rogers
Memorial Center will be in the horse barn where Birdie Auerbach has
her grocery bags stacked under a small table.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an official site for the 104th Southwestern Exposition
and Livestock Show and Rodeo, but it's one of the best stops for
unique desserts.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't where you get the funnel cakes or cinnamon rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few of Auerbach's fellow workers _ and her husband, Roger
_ get to sample the annual deserts. Sometimes people kind of like
to see Roger go first, just to make sure it's safe.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach has a knack for taking unusual ingredients and spinning
them into delicious sweets.
</P>
<P>
   She has made pinto bean pie _ kind of a pecan pie without the
pecans _ and nutcracker pie made out of saltine crackers. Last
year, she brought a chocolate cake made with sauerkraut.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people come to the house, they always want to know
exactly what we're having,'' Roger Auerbach said. ``Then they want
to know what's in it and if we've ever had it before. They know
they might end up with chocolate grasshoppers or something.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the Stock Show, there is never a lack of interest in her
latest concoction. The crowd forms when the Tupperware tops begin
to pop.
</P>
<P>
   This year, she'll be treating her friends to Bailey's Irish
Cream Cake and maybe, if she has time, a Jack Daniel's Chocolate
Mousse Pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I really like that cake,'' Roger says, Auerbach rolling
his eyes. ``Just don't breathe on a fire. I know you can get
arrested for drinking and driving; this cake might get you arrested
for eating and driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Birdie Auerbach says she's been making the Jack Daniel's pie for
years, might have even gotten the original recipe out of the paper,
but the cake is new.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my own recipe,'' she says. ``I didn't get it from
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she and her family have always liked the taste of the
Irish cream, and since she needed to make a cake, she just decided
to merge the two tastes.
</P>
<P>
   It just melts in your mouth, she says of her latest recipe. And
if you really are bothered by the amount of liquor in the recipe,
just cut it back to match your taste. There is a lot of whiskey in
this recipe. Cutting by half would be a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you will notice that there is no actual Bailey's Irish
Cream listed in the ingredients. Auerbach says she generally makes
her own rather than buy the name brand, and all the necessary
ingredients are included in the recipe.

BREAKING OUT OF `THE BOX'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KATHRYN HOPPER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computers that take over chores, rooms that evolve with shifting
family needs, and plenty of spaces to escape from the outside world
and one another are the guiding principles behind the New American
Dream 2000 Home. The 4,500-square-foot mansion squeezed on a
zero-lot-line home in the Dallas suburb of Frisco, was built to
showcase the latest design and construction trends for last week's
International Homebuilders Show in Dallas and will be featured in
the March, April and May issues of ``Ladies' Home Journal.''
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Orlando, Fla., architect Don Evans and built by
Custom Homes Group in Dallas, the house is aimed at a professional
couple in their 30s with two to three children. Given the home's
price tag, $975,000, the couple would also have to have some hefty
stock options or generous parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to create a home that's very modern, very advanced
technologically, but also rooted in tradition, warmth and
comfort,'' says Susan Orlie, the Arlington designer who coordinated
the home's interiors. ``The house centers around the feeling that
the family wants to be there. It's not, `Where do we go out for
dinner?' It's, `Who can we invite over for dinner?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who does come over is bound to be impressed with all the
high-tech gadgetry that merits two rooms _ the ``wiring closet''
and the ``energy room'' _ which together occupy 200 square feet.
The closet is a nifty way to store all your stereo components and
the IBM House Manager system, which controls everything from the
heating and air-conditioning system to lights to sprinklers to VCR
programming.
</P>
<P>
   The energy room houses the home's two hot-water heaters and
electrical boxes. ``The house is so smart that you can wake up and
with the touch of a button by your bed, turn on every light and
appliance you need that morning,'' builder Doug White said.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen also has high-tech touches such as the
remote-controlled Icebox by CMI Worldwide, which uses Internet
access to assist in meal planning, grocery lists and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Architect Don Evans wanted to ``break out of the Dallas box'' by
giving homeowners places they could interact with the outside
world. A courtyard entry on the first level and a Juliet balcony
off a secondary bedroom upstairs offer views of the street. But
given the home's location in the gated community Lakes off Legacy,
its occupants may be more inclined to seek refuge from the world.
</P>
<P>
   No worry. Evans also provides a walled-off pool and patio area
dubbed ``the courtyard oasis,'' which features a built-in
big-screen television, fireplace and grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to build a shell, not a cocoon,'' Evans said. ``If
they want to interact with the outside world, they can; if not,
then they don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners won't have to do much yardwork. The only lawn is a
small patch in front. The back yard is devoted to the paved
driveway from the alley to the garage, which Evans says can double
as a ``sport court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most kids today get their exercise from municipal sports _
soccer or swimming leagues,'' Evans says. ``They don't need big
back yards.''
</P>
<P>
   He brags that the home's design ``lives larger than its square
footage,'' seeming almost as big as a 6,000-square-foot home. That
means there are plenty of places to be by yourself. The kids could
be playing computer games up in the ``imagination room'' upstairs.
Dad may be trading stocks online in the ``Internet alcove.''
Grandma could make tea in her kitchenette in the airy above-garage
apartment dubbed the ``garden suite,'' while Mom takes an
aromatherapy bath in the ``master retreat.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans says he uses ambiguous names so the spaces won't get
pigeon-holed. ``If Grandma comes to live here, then maybe she gets
the garden suite. When she leaves, you get a home office,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Flexibility is carried through the furnishings, too. Kimberlie
Waugh, home design editor at ``Ladies' Home Journal,'' notes that
several pieces are built for speed redecorating. ``The tables and
chairs in the kitchen and study are on casters so they can travel
from room to room based on different needs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The home links public spaces with marble and wood flooring and
separates the private areas with carpeting. Wall colors include a
warm yellow in the kitchen and pale pistachio-green in the master
bedroom. One of the home's best features is hidden in the walls:
Louisiana-Pacific insulation called Cocoon, made of recycled
newspapers. The company promises that the product will cut outside
noise and trim energy costs to the point that heating and cooling
costs for the home should average $191 per month.
</P>
<P>
   No buyer is lined up for the home, but the builder says it will
be an easy sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a home for people who want to live comfortably, but
not be a nerd,'' White said.

STEVE FORBES NEEDS TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE MATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Forbes' better-than-expected showing in Monday's Iowa
caucuses wasn't the worst thing that could happen to the Republican
Party. The worst thing would be if Forbes were to become the
party's presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes at the top of the GOP ticket would be a dream come true
for likely Democratic nominee Al Gore. The magnitude of Gore's
landslide victory in a Gore-Forbes race could be mind-boggling;
same goes for Bill Bradley, if he should somehow snatch the
nomination from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Republicans, the Democrats will have to
celebrate such scenarios in their wildest dreams, since Forbes will
win the Republican nomination only in his wildest dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called victory of Iowa runner-up Forbes _ not to mention
the expectations-game triumph by third-place finisher Alan Keyes _
was meaningless in terms of the eventual outcome of the GOP
presidential nomination race. Forbes and Keyes began the race as
no-shot candidates, and they will end the race as no-shot
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Forbes nor Keyes poses a threat to front-runner _ and
comfortable Iowa winner _ George W. Bush. For that matter, neither
poses a threat to John McCain's status as the ``other guy'' in the
race _ the designated underdog who gets the privilege of chasing
Bush until the chase becomes so futile that there's no reason to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Forbes is that he seems to have deluded himself
into believing that he can be elected president _ which is why that
30 percent of the vote he racked up in Iowa was an unfortunate
outcome for the Republican Party. The caucus results fed Forbes'
delusion that he's a contender and thus encouraged his continued
pursuit of a goal that is hopelessly beyond his reach.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Forbes would have considered dropping out of the race
if he had fared poorly in Iowa. He is obviously in for the long
haul, no matter how ill-advised the effort.
</P>
<P>
   This guy has money he hasn't spent yet, as a friend of mine used
to say. And since Forbes is apparently interested only in
nourishing his own ego _ as opposed to making a positive
contribution to his country and/or his party _ he will happily dip
into his personal fortune to bankroll what is sure to be a petty,
mean-spirited campaign against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, don't forget, Forbes irreparably damaged
eventual Republican nominee Bob Dole with negative and misleading
TV ads during the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. Iowa is history now. Forbes is portraying his distant
second-place finish as a ``surge'' _ and the pundits are letting
him get away with it _ but he will find out what a surge is all
about as he watches Bush sprint away from the field in upcoming
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose 41 percent of the vote was an all-time high for a
Republican in a contested Iowa race, offered his own analysis of
just who is surging and who isn't when a TV reporter asked him
about Forbes' ``surge'' in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He surged into second place,'' Bush said with his trademark
wry grin. ``I surged into first.''
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, Bush surged into first a long time ago, and
he remains the runaway front-runner in national polls. It will take
a heck of a lot more to derail Bush than some phony ``surge'' by
Forbes, or even a win by McCain in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   A post-Iowa editorial in ``USA Today'' derided losing candidates
who tried to palm off their defeats as victories and ridiculed the
notion that ``expectations'' are more important than vote totals:
</P>
<P>
   ``The winners were the ones who got the most votes: Vice
President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Steve Forbes and Bill Bradley zeroed in on Iowa hoping to
bloody the leaders. They and John McCain are trying the same in New
Hampshire. But for all of today's self-serving buzz, Gore and Bush
remain heavy favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real math, adding up the delegate votes state by state, is
what counts, not political baloney about expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   I rest my case.

 &HT;    ASO guest conductor learned at his father's feet
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra baton has been wielded
this season by conductors with distinguished pedigrees: Michael
Stern, son of Isaac Stern; Roberto Abbado, nephew of Claudio
Abbado; Yan-Pascal Tortelier, son of cellist Paul Tortelier. But no
pair of relatives has occupied more distinguished positions than
Paavo Jarvi and his father, Estonian conductor Neeme Jarvi.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Jarvi (pronounced YARE-vi) is music director of the
Detroit Symphony Orchestra and one of the most recorded conductors
in the world. On Monday, son Paavo, 37, became music director of
the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   For Paavo, there's no question about his feelings on the family
business. ``Aside from a career aspiration at 7 to be a fireman, I
always wanted to be a musician,'' he said from Florida, where he
was catching some sunshine between conducting engagements.
</P>
<P>
   The family connection hasn't hurt, either, but not because Jarvi
is a household name. ``It's a big advantage ... growing up in my
father's house,'' Paavo said. ``What goes on between a conductor
and an orchestra is a very mysterious business, and if your father
is a conductor, you get a certain amount of instruction. There is
no rivalry. It's a nice, natural succession. It is old-fashioned
witchcraft between master and apprentice.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvi was music director for four years of the orchestra Malmo,
Sweden, and, most recently, of the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic. At
the same time, he was principal guest conductor of the city of
Birmingham Symphony in England. He gave up Stockholm and Birmingham
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very good experience, and I needed to know how to run
an orchestra,'' he said. ``But there has to come a time when you
must give yourself a little bit of room to think. I had about seven
years of uninterrupted responsibility, and I needed that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Estonia's most famous composer is linked to the Jarvi family.
Hence the inclusion of Symphony No. 1 by Arvo Part on Jarvi's ASO
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very close friend of our family, and he is the same
age as my father,'' Jarvi said. ``This piece was written in 1962,
and I was born that year.''
</P>
<P>
   He has recorded the piece on a Virgin CD called ``Searching for
Roots.'' ``It's the one Part lovers don't know. They think of him
as a religious mystic who writes Gregorian chant, but he started
out as a composer who was often banned as too dissonant and
complex. This is music without any kind of calculated beauty or
hope to be liked. It has no unnecessary prettiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, this is Op. 2, and it follows his Op. 1, which was
called `Nekrologue.' That should tell you.''

 &HT;    Town is comfy in the heat of the spotlight
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COVINGTON, Ga. _ If you wandered into Covington's town square
without any of the little burg's recent history under your belt,
you might feel a sense of deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   That may be because the town played host to the popular TV
series ``In the Heat of the Night'' for eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Covington's no stranger to the bright lights of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Long before ``Heat,'' the first five episodes of ``The Dukes of
Hazzard'' were shot here _ not to mention dozens of feature films.
</P>
<P>
   Pass through the doors of the Covington Flower Shop, and chances
are you'll come out with more than a pocket full of posies.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jo McLaney was in the thick of the action when Hollywood
came knocking. In fact, while the front section of her store is
indeed dedicated to floral arrangements, mosey on back and you'll
find yourself in Hollywood South. Think of it as a souvenir shop as
well as a shrine to ``Dukes'' and ``Heat.'' Here you can purchase,
among other items related to show biz, ``Heat'' sweatshirts, a
cookbook dedicated to the show and a host of ``Dukes'' memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the florist when `Dukes' came to town,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in the shop to buy Boss Hogg's boutonniere.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaney admits that ``Heat'' was an even bigger deal, since the
cast and crew filmed in town for eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We miss them terribly. They became close personal friends.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways one of them never left.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Saturdays we have the Bubba Lover's Coffee Club here in the
store,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   When asked just who Bubba was, McLaney nearly blanched at the
idea that someone actually had no clue. She explained that he was
the ``hunk from Heat'' played by Alan Autry.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to Covington than the legacy of Bubba's biceps.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of Georgia's Main Street communities and therefore has
taken a proactive role in preserving its business district and
small-town charm. The historic town square, anchored by the 1884
Newton County Courthouse and clock tower, is surrounded by
immaculately maintained antebellum and Victorian homes.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a hour's drive from Atlanta, Covington offers visitors
plenty of options for a day's visit. Browse the shops lining the
square, then have a meal at one of several local eateries or even a
picnic in the square's park. And don't miss a leisurely,
informative walking tour of historical buildings and the
Confederate Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   For a total shopping experience, wander into family-owned
Mayfield Ace Hardware. Here you'll take a step back in time while
keeping a foot firmly planted in the present. This old-fashioned
store features everything from nut-studded fudge and monkey
wrenches to Waterford crystal and brass doorknobs.
</P>
<P>
   A few doors down, at Lee's Fashions, you'll be greeted by
Queenie, owner Daniel Song's tiny Pomeranian.
</P>
<P>
   Here, along with casual clothing and an eclectic selection of
costume jewelry, you'll find formalwear for men and women. It's
also the place to hunt down that little girl's frilly party dress.
And in case you're in the market for blond or brunet curls that
cascade past your derriere or perhaps a striped ponytail _ well,
Lee's offers a wall of hairpieces.
</P>
<P>
   Although Song lives in north Fulton County, he enjoys working in
Covington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very secure area,'' he says. ``One night I left my keys
in the lock overnight. When I came back in the morning, they were
still there.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wanda Whitcomb of Conyers, the square is the perfect spot to
combine relaxing and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to go over to the Cathedral,'' she says, ``and look at
the antiques. They have some really nice china. And there's a
little restaurant in there, so I usually go on and have coffee and
a snack.''
</P>
<P>
   A Touch of Country once housed a drugstore. So when Harold and
Dianne Duren took it over to open their furniture store, locals
requested that they keep the soda fountain.
</P>
<P>
   They did.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can browse through the room vignettes that feature
Harold's handmade furnishings, then sit down at the counter for
house-made chili and corn muffins.
</P>
<P>
   Store clerk Donna Hargett insists Covington is like Mayberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real friendly, and everybody knows everybody here.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: From Atlanta, take I-285 east to I-20 east.
Take Exit 45 (Covington/Oxford), which loops into U.S. 278 east.
Turn right onto Emory Street, then left onto Clark Street. You'll
pass the Welcome Center on the right; the square is just ahead.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Most shops are open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Mondays-
</P>
<P>
   Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: Ample parking around the square.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrooms: In most restaurants and also in Covington Flower
Shop.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Handicapped access: Most shops are accessible.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: Covington Visitors Bureau and Welcome Center,
2101 Clark St., 1-800-616-8626; www.citybreeze.com.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In between shopping and sightseeing, consider Michael's on the
Square (1113 Floyd St., 770-788-8717) for an upscale bite. Lunch
fare includes Southwestern shrimp salad, Cuban chicken pasta and
blackened flounder club sandwich. Prices range from $7.50 to $9 for
lunch, $12.50 to $20 for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   If comfort food is your cup of tea, trek to Smiley's (1123
Church St., 770-784-1375) and belly up to the buffet. You can dig
into meatloaf, ham, mashed potatoes and collards. And that's just
on your first go-round. $6.50 for lunch, $7.55 for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond shopping
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Historic tree tour. It's not just the antebellum and Victorian
homes that draw those seeking walking tours. Covington owns and
manages more than 5,500 public trees of 82 varieties, valued at
$4.2 million. The tour begins at the square, which is home to some
of the town's oldest and most stately trees, including a pair of
huge Southern magnolias.
</P>
<P>
   You can pick up a free walking guide at the Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   As you stroll, be sure to notice Whitehall, about a block or so
away from the square. Built in the 1830s, it was Margaret
Mitchell's vision of what Twelve Oaks should look like in ``Gone
With the Wind.'' It's one of the homes open to the public.

 &HT;    Locating hard to find items
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having trouble finding a particular item? We'll try to help you
locate it. But due to the volume of mail, we cannot track down
every request. Readers whose queries are answered in the column
will receive a blue-and-cream canvas Buyer's Edge tote bag. Write
us at Buyer's Edge Find It, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box
4689, Atlanta, GA 30302; e-mail us at buyersedge(at)ajc.com (please
include your name, the city you live in and a daytime phone
number); or call 404-582-7642.

   Q: Our kitchen set includes six Breuer chairs. In the past, when
a seat or back needed to be replaced, we were able to find
replacements in cane or cushioned upholstery through the JC Penney
catalog. The store no longer carries these items. Do you know where
I can buy replacements for my chairs?
</P>
<P>
   _ Kathleen Koch, Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Soon you will be sitting pretty. The famous Breuer chair _
which has a frame of continuous chrome tubing, no back legs and a
cane seat and back _ was designed by Marcel Breuer, a U.S.
architect born in Hungary. Ansaldi &AMP; Sons, 124 Cross St., Lawrence,
MA 01841 (1-877-686-7201) provides cane Breuer chair replacements
that come in a light natural wood finish. Each chair seat is
$33.52; a chair back is $20.72. You can also order from the Web
site: www.ansaldi.com/breuer.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since moving to Suwanee from New York, I have been unable to
find Bell's Seasoning by the Wm. J. Bell Co. of Massachusetts,
which comes in a little yellow box. Hope you can help me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Elizabeth Barbarino, Suwanee, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Since 1867, the William G. Bell Co. has been making its
salt-free seasoning, which many good cooks like to use when they
make stuffing (or dressing) for poultry. It's a blend of rosemary,
oregano, sage, ginger, marjoram, thyme and pepper. Although a
staple along the East Coast, it's hard to find in the South. Most
stores stock it only for the holidays. However, you can order it at
1-800-225-5126. Four 1-ounce boxes are $6. Or order it off the
company's Web site at www.brady-ent.com.
</P>
<P>
   Desi Gould, national sales manager, says the seasoning can also
be added to tuna, ham, chicken and egg salad sandwich fillings.
Bell's, which is part of Brady Enterprises, also offers other
products for sale, including Ready Mixed Stuffing, Pie Spicer and
Meatloaf Mix.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Nips coffee candy. It used to be available
at Stacy's Pharmacy of Emory Village but no more.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ellen Nemhauser, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: It's great to take a little Nip. This rich and creamy hard
candy from Nestle Food Co. has been tempting folks for more than 75
years. Like the package touts, ``Every one (piece) is a delicious
little diversion any time.'' We picked up a box of Nips (99 cents
for a 5.5-ounce box ) at Publix, 3535 Peachtree Road N.E.
(404-848-0344).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I purchase the premiere issue of the magazine
Southern Lady?
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan Coleman-Mitchell, Jasper, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: In this glossy magazine, publisher Phyllis Norton Hoffman
writes, ``Southern Lady is for you who live in the South, whether
by birth, by choice or only in your thoughts.'' Each issue, which
comes out quarterly, includes recipes, decorating tips and profiles
on Southern entrepreneurs. The first issue also featured a blurb
about holiday home tours in Madison and Alpharetta. To get the
premiere copy send $4.95 plus $2 for shipping and handling to
Hoffman Media Inc., Attention: Back Issues, Southern Lady, 405
Riverhills Business Park, Birmingham, AL 35242. The winter issue,
also $4.95, is on newsstands. We picked one up at Barnes &AMP; Noble,
2205 Pleasant Hill Road, Duluth.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Tea Rose perfume, which is put out by
Perfumer's Workshop.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ella Woodward, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   And another request: Where can I find Tea Rose perfume by the
Perfumer's Workshop? JC Penney used to carry it, but no longer. You
are my last hope.
</P>
<P>
   _ Charlene Carpenter, Milledgeville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: A rose is a rose is _ Tea Rose. This classic fragrance was
introduced more than 25 years ago as a blend of tea rose and damask
rose (the latter grown primarily in Bulgaria), with touches of
citronella, peony and geranium leaves. Although it's occasionally
available locally at Marshalls and TJ Maxx stores, you can order it
through the New York office of the Perfumer's Workshop, 150 E. 58th
St., 26th floor, New York, NY 10155. A 1-ounce eau de toilette is
$25; a 2-ounce eau de toilette is $35; the quarter-ounce perfume is
$66 and the quarter-ounce oil is $71. All prices include postage
and handling. Send a check or money order in advance. Phone:
212-644-8950.

HICO: WHERE OLD WEST LEGACY MEETS NEW AGE LEISURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HICO, Texas _ The clearest signal that Hico has arrived isn't
the arty metal sculptures in the Enderle Art Co. gallery downtown;
nor is it that in this largely dry town, you can now buy a
margarita at Jersey Lilly's, a bustling Mexican restaurant. It
wasn't even thr gala November opening of the Texas Cowboy Hall of
Fame, where the Bellamy Brothers played for a bevy of gussied-up
guests.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's this announcement inside Bliss, an upscale boutique
selling bath products, candles and gifts in a renovated storefront
downtown: Hico now has its own massage therapist.
</P>
<P>
   The cowboy town has come to this: Little spa on the prairie.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought, `No way, it's never gonna fly,' but we've
surprised everybody,'' says Kevin Wenzel, who with his wife,
LaDonne, owns Bliss, as well as Wiseman House Chocolates, a gourmet
chocolatier he opened four years ago in a renovated Victorian home.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then, people thought, `Who's going to buy European
truffles?' when we opened'' the candy store.
</P>
<P>
   Until about six or seven years ago, those people might have been
right. But Hico, a small farming town of about 1,200 residents
between Stephenville and Glen Rose, has been quietly reinventing
itself.
</P>
<P>
   First came the antiques stores so popular in small Texas towns.
Then came other shops, such as Cowboy Art, a furniture and
metalworking shop; owner Bobby Kerr's work has become so
sought-after that his clients include Reata, the luxe-western
restaurant in Fort Worth. (He has been busily making chandeliers
for the soon-to-open Beverly Hills outpost of Reata.)
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, a couple of bed-and-breakfast inns have
opened. And the 1883-era opera house has been bought by an outside
investor who reportedly plans to restore it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, I tell you, it's amazing how many people are coming down
here to see this little town,'' says Rabbit Davis, who owns an
antiques store as well as the town laundry and a newly opened
one-bedroom inn right above it. ``Right now, all of us are kind of
sitting here, playing a waiting game, trying to see what's going to
happen next.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the retailing rebirth, Hico was largely known, if at all,
for its somewhat dubious claim to a somewhat dubious citizen: Billy
the Kid.
</P>
<P>
   According to local legend, it was another man, not the Kid, who
died in that New Mexico shootout in 1881. The Kid quietly took the
name of Bill Roberts and began living a fairly law-abiding life
throughout the southwestern United States and Mexico. Sometime in
the 1940s, the man, then known as ``Brushy Bill'' Roberts, turned
up in Hico. Shortly before his death in 1950, his secret claim was
revealed; Roberts even petitioned the governor of New Mexico for a
pardon for his crimes, but it was denied.
</P>
<P>
   Historians have never proved that Roberts was actually Billy the
Kid, but, hey, they've never proved he wasn't. And Hico has
wholeheartedly embraced him: A lumpish-looking Billy the Kid statue
stands guard at the edge of the business district, and the city's
best-known festival is Billy the Kid Day every April.
</P>
<P>
   The culmination of the Billy the Kid fever is the Billy the Kid
Museum, a small exhibit and gift shop in a former hotel in the
heart of downtown. The museum reopened last fall after a
refurbishment that included a reorganization of the display and
construction of an old-fashioned saloon bar, from which you can now
purchase Dublin-made Dr Pepper in a frozen mug.
</P>
<P>
   There's not a lot of Kid memorabilia at the museum; just a
trunk, a quilt and a saddle that all belonged to Roberts. The story
that the Kid survived the shooting _ and how Roberts' true identity
was finally uncovered _ is told in persuasive detail, through
photos, documents and videos. But it doesn't explain why, if he was
really the Kid, Roberts didn't try to capitalize on his identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I've thought about that a lot,'' says Travis
Harkness, the museum curator and a natural raconteur who tells a
convincing Billy the Kid tale. ``You'd have to ask him. But I don't
know, maybe it was like getting a second chance at life.''
</P>
<P>
   Open since 1987, the museum was joined by another last year _
the Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame. Housed in the back room of Bobby
Kerr's Cowboy Art gallery, which is full of rustic western-themed
furniture, lamps and accessories, the hall contains memorabilia
(Larry Mahan's saddle!), videos and photos of rodeo stars like Ty
Murray, Lane Frost and barrel racer Charmayne James.
</P>
<P>
   The hall and the museum cost $3 to enter, but there's free
entertainment in Hico as well. Every Saturday night, there's a free
jam session downtown, with music ranging from bluegrass to jazz;
you can also catch free carriage rides on Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping is the other spectator sport here. Watch blacksmithing
artist John Frederick _ dressed in period costumes and often
spouting comedy routines _ hand-forge candleholders, fireplace
tools, knives and other pieces at Frederick's of Hico. Rummage
through the furniture, pottery and knickknacks at one of the
half-dozen antiques stores. Admire the Texas limestone buildings,
which thankfully weren't tricked up during some renovation boom of
the '70s or '80s.
</P>
<P>
   And be sure to save room for fudge or a truffle from Wiseman
House Chocolates. Kevin Wenzel, who returned to the area he grew up
in after living as far afield as Latvia, makes up to 100 pounds of
chocolate weekly, from pecan fudge to almond toffee to Jack Daniels
truffles.
</P>
<P>
   The shop, located in a lovely restored 19th-century home that
once belonged to a local photographer and his wife, epitomizes what
Hico has become. Over the glass counters holding rows of fancy
chocolates hangs an antique black-and-white photograph of Rufus and
Adeline Wiseman, the home's original owners. And the names of two
of the gourmet candies? Rufus and Adeline.
</P>
<P>
   Hico has figured it out. Bring in the new. Just don't completely
get rid of the old.

rise over a cold air mass in place over interior sections. Bands of
heavy snow will shift from central and eastern Oklahoma early
Thursday into Arkansas and the western Tennessee Valley on Thursday
afternoon as a jet stream disturbance moves east. Accumulations of
more than 6 inches will be common in these area by Thursday night.

of sleet and freezing rain will fall from near the Red River in
eastern Texas to northern parts of Louisiana and Mississippi. The
icy mixture will change to snow in northeastern Texas before
tapering off later Thursday. Showery rain will persist throughout
the day near the western Gulf of Mexico coast. Meanwhile, broken
areas of lighter snow will occur from the central Rockies to the
western Plains as the moist winds ascend the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The day will begin cold and dry over most of the Southeast, but
clouds will thicken as moist air is carried east from the southern
Plains and Mississippi Valley. By Thursday night, snow and ice will
develop over the northern Gulf Coast states, while rain falls
farther south. Brisk winds from the northwest will reinforce the
chill over the Northeast. Snow showers and locally heavy squalls
will occur near the eastern Great Lakes and northern Appalachians.
Partly to mostly sunny skies will occur east of the mountains from
New England to the Middle Atlantic states. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Unprecedented Snow &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week's snow was newsworthy in many areas of the interior
Northeast, but in Raleigh, N.C., it was truly unprecedented. In
three hours early Tuesday at the height of the tempest, 11 inches
of snow accumulated in Raleigh, 4 inches more than the average
snowfall for an entire winter season. The storm total of 20.3
inches also broke the record for the greatest snowfall in any
month. The previous mark was 20.0 inches set in January 1892.
Another wintry storm gathering moisture in the southern Plains
threatens to bring more snow and ice to North Carolina by Sunday. &QL;

<P>
   If you go to Hico:
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Hico is on Texas 220; it's about 80 miles, or an
easy 90-minute drive, from downtown Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Why go: Shops and antiques and a dose of Old West history in a
pocket-size downtown
</P>
<P>
   When to go: Hico is busiest on the weekends, and a number of
shops are closed early in the week. On Saturday nights, there's
live music _ bluegrass, jazz or country _ and free carriage rides
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Take the kids?: Older ones might get a kick out of the Billy the
Kid Museum; rodeo fans of all ages will love the pictures, videos
and memorabilia at the Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame. But younger ones
may get bored quickly with the shops and antiques.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat: Downtown, Jersey Lilly's offers Mexican and
American food, plus a bar (though it's a dry area, so you must join
the private club). There's a deli and small bakery inside Two
Sisters Mercantile. And the Koffee Kup Restaurant's pie, with its
mile-high meringue, is justifiably famous.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay: There are two small inns in town: Mary Ellen's
Bed &AMP; Breakfast, in a cute yellow cottage, has two rooms with
traditional country decor, from $50 to $70 per night. Information:
(254) 796-2272. The Railroad Street Bed and Bath has one
comfortably furnished suite, with a kitchen and sitting area, for
$65 per night. Information: (254) 796-4334.
</P>
<P>
   Side trips: Just down the road is Glen Rose, with Dinosaur
Valley State Park, Fossil Rim Wildlife Ranch, and canoeing at Tres
Rios Park.
</P>
<P>
   Special events: The annual Billy the Kid Day (April 1) is a big
downtown street party dedicated to Hico's most famous resident;
there's music, food, games, crafts booths and a goat-milking
contest.

SORTING OUT ALL THOSE PORTS ON THE BACK OF THE COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>

 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sorting Out All Those Ports On the Back of the Computer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I see where the mouse and keyboard are plugged in, but can
you explain what the different ports on the back of a computer are
for? Are they different between PCs and Macintoshes?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, there are some differences, although the Universal
Serial Bus, or USB, is closing the gap between the two hardware
types. The types of ports may vary from machine to machine, but
here are some general types and purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The standard PC ports, which have been around for a while, are
the parallel and serial ports. The parallel port is most commonly
used to attach the computer to a printer, and it has a wide, 25-pin
connector on the end of the cable.
</P>
<P>
   The serial port, which usually has a smaller, 9-pin connector
(although serial ports can also have 25-pin connectors), can be
used to plug in several different kinds of devices, like modems,
mice and joysticks.
</P>
<P>
   To free the serial port for other uses, though, most computers
have a PS/2 port, which has a round, 6-pin connector. Most
computers made in the past few years also have at least two
rectangular USB ports as well.
</P>
<P>
   USB is now the most common way to connect devices to iMacs and
newer Macintosh models as well. Older Macs will have a SCSI port
(pronounced ``scuzzy'' and sometimes used on PCs as well) on the
back; it is a wide, 25-pin connector that serves as the parallel
interface for Macs. For attaching the keyboard, older Macs also had
a round, five-pin Apple Desktop Bus, or ADB, port, and personal
printers and modems were usually connected through either of the
Mac's round 9-pin serial ports.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What exactly does the term cellular mean in regard to phones?
Are all portable phones cell phones?
</P>
<P>
   A: Cellular phones were named that because they use a series of
cells, or transmission sites, that are spread out to cover each
service area. Early cellular phones transmitted low-power analog
radio signals on an 800-megahertz frequency. (Analog refers to the
process of sending an audio signal in a continuous wave.)
</P>
<P>
   Analog cellular networks, which are much older than the digital
networks that are currently gaining ground, also offer wider
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Although any type of mobile telephone is often referred to as a
cell phone, some people differentiate between phones that use the
old analog cellular networks and ones that don't. Phones that don't
are often just referred to as wireless.
</P>
<P>
   Phones labeled as wireless usually use digital signals to send
and receive calls. Digital phones also have their own type of
networks, which were built after the old analog networks. Unlike
analog phones, which send a continuous sound wave, digital phones
work by sampling just parts of the sound wave and then transmitting
pieces of data quickly in bursts.
</P>
<P>
   Digital networks may not cover as much territory as analog ones,
but they boast (in theory) better sound and clearer, more secure
signals that are harder to decode by people who may be listening in
on phone calls. (You should note that no type of cellular or
wireless phone call is completely secure from eavesdroppers.)
</P>
<P>
   Roaming _ making calls outside the normal coverage area offered
by your service provider's calling plan _ is often easier on an
analog network because of the wider coverage area. A dual-band
mobile telephone can work with either system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most large metropolitan areas are covered by digital networks
already, and the networks are continuing to expand. If you have a
question about coverage in your area, most wireless service
providers offer network maps and coverage options right on their
Web sites. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many PCS phones (Personal Communications Services) are based on
digital technology and usually operate on a frequency of 1900
megahertz. Because of the faster speeds that a digital network can
provide for transmitting data, digital phone networks are able to
handle such mobile treats as wireless Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Nextel is another type of digital wireless phone technology that
can combine telephone functions with two-way radio capability. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Circuits invites questions about computer-based technology, by
mail to Questions, Circuits, The New York Times, 229 West 43rd
Street, New York, N.Y. 10036-3959 or by e-mail to

   COKE LAYOFFS
</P>
<P>
   EDs: Charts are planned on revenues, earnings, earnings per
share, market capitalization, employment and stocks.
</P>
<P>
   COKE-MAIN _ ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola announces it is slashing 6,000
jobs, including 2,500 in Atlanta. Main story will focus on where
the cuts are being made, why the are being made (and why these
areas) and what is the implication for future growth. (Unger,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   w/COKE-STAHL _ ATLANTA _ Interview with Jacks Stahl, Coca-Cola's
new president and chief operating officer, and possible with
Douglas Daft, the company's soon-to-be chairman and chief operating
officer. (Unger, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   COKE-STOCKS _ ATLANTA _ Wall Street loves layoffs. A look at
Wall Street's reaction to the layoffs and how the stock has
reacted. Talking with investors etc. (Luke, Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   COKE-EARNINGS _ ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola releases fourth-quarter
earnings. While the company is expected to show a profit, it will
show a loss for the year. (Unger, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   COKE-ANALYSIS _ ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. told Wall Street today
that it will rethink its growth targets, which many analysts have
criticized as unrealistic. (Unger, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   COKE-PYSCHOLOGY _ ATLANTA _ A look at the psychological impact
of the cuts on the workers left at Coca-Cola and at those who are
being trimmed. What's the impact on the corporate culture. (Joyner,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   COKE-IMPACT _ ATLANTA _ Metro Atlanta, the nation's No. 1 job
market, has escaped massive layoff announcements in recent years,
although the city has had its share of smaller-scale cuts. The job
reductions have occurred in a cross-section of industries, from
electronics and textiles to health care and retail. Since last
July, there have been 19 instances of layoffs at companies with 50
or more workers, according to the state Labor Department. But even
those cuts _ and the layoffs announced today at Coca-Cola _ are
cushioned by one of the best periods of economic growth in Georgia
and U.S. history, labor experts say. (Joyner, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 20.
</P>
<P>
   COKE-LAWSUIT _ ATLANTA _ The reaction of plaintiffs in the
racial discrimination lawsuit agasint Coca-Cola to the layoffs.
(Rankin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   COKE-HISTORY _ ATLANTA _ In 1996, Roberto C. Goizueta wrote a
rare two-page letter inside Coca-Cola's internal magazine. As other
corporations slashed payrolls left and right to appease Wall
Street, the revered chairman and chief executive officer reassured
Coke's loyal thousands that increasing the company's stock value
doesn't mean layoffs or a huge corporate restructuring. (Seward,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.

   UNION-LEWIS _ WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton addresses the
nation Thursday about his goals for the coming year, he will
include a proposal by Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) and Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) to improve minority health care. Lewis is
proposing that Congress give the National Institutes of Health $20
million to establish a center that would study diseases that
afflict minority populations and to examine what he called ``great
disparities between black and white healthcare.'' (Carr, Atlanta

Wednesday night in Manchester, where Texas Gov. George W. Bush and
Arizona Sen. John McCain appear to be in a tight race. (Herman,

</P>
<P>
   GOP-BUSH _ AUSTIN _ Has the Bush campaign hit its first bump in
the road to the White House? Privately, people inside the Bush camp
are saying Bush could lose to McCain in next week's primary. Even
publicly, chief strategist Karl Rove is saying Bush is being
squeezed from the right and
</P>
<P>
   the left. But in the great expectations game, it's also in the
</P>
<P>
   campaign's interest to lower expectations for the front-runner
in what looks like a very competitive state. (Herman, Austin
American-Statesman)

A SCAFFOLD THAT MOVES FROM WATER TO LAND

   (Circuits)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; People don't generally draw much of a connection between prestige
sailing, street luge and yo-yos. Yacht racing is the province of
millionaires, elite designers and high-gloss corporate sponsors.
Street luge is an extreme sport devised by green-haired maniacs.
And the yo-yo is a curiously tenacious novelty item.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, they don't have much in common. But for Temple
Games, a Web start-up in Rhode Island, prestige sailing, street
luge and yo-yos are inextricably intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   The company's flagship product is VirtualCup, an online sailing
simulator that allows competitors to race digital yachts at the
Stars and Stripes site (www.stars-stripes.com) and the online
destination (www.louisvuittoncup.com) of the Louis Vuitton Cup.
More than 10,000 people have downloaded the three-megabyte game and
have competed in 90,000 two-player, real-time racing matches. Four
thousand have registered for an online regatta that will put
contenders on an elimination ladder, in competition for luxury
prize goodies and bragging rights.
</P>
<P>
   The regatta serves two purposes for the sailing destinations.
First, it gives visitors something to do, which encourages them to
return (once your performance statistics are ranked, it's
personal). But more important, it gives neophytes a reason to learn
about sailing. Most people don't have any reason to know, much less
care, about the techniques and official rules of yacht racing. But
when you're competing in a boat race, real or virtual, there is a
strong incentive to find out what the spinnaker is all about, what
the penalties are for hitting the boat markers and who has the
right of way when the paths of two boats overlap.
</P>
<P>
   For Temple Games, the regatta is a proof of concept for a
stripped-down multiplayer game architecture it has been working on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sailing was a good example sport,'' said Jonathan Brown, 32,
Temple's chief executive, who left Netscape to start the company.
``If you're in a boat race and a tenth of a second matters, you
can't have a boat jump five boat lengths because of network lag. We
think we have a really unique way that we've addressed it. We're
looking at patents on a couple things.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Temple's strong suit is streamlining:
slimming the network lag, reducing the file size of the software
and drastically reducing development time. ``The architecture
allows us to produce these kinds of interactive games in a really
short amount of time _ like, three months,'' Brown said. ``A lot of
this stuff is totally reusable: the rendering engine, the community
aspects. A set of the physics is fairly expandable, for sailing or
for track-based things, and we can adjust it for ice or for
pavement or different surfaces. Our next game that's coming out is
something called Extreme Winter Luge. That's basically a luge pipe
track. We can do street luge with the same one.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple is talking to the usual suspects of extreme sports
broadcasting about the luge games and to the interactive division
of IMG, a sports events management company, about downhill skiing.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the company has been supporting its development
efforts by building corporate Web sites, including one that
transformed Yomega Corp. from an old-line manufacturer into a
powerhouse of electronic yo-yo retailing. ``You may laugh,'' Brown
said, ``but yo-yos were huge last year. I mean, really, really
huge. They were probably doing $20 million. They were raking it in.
The Web site that we did for them, within the month that we put it
up, it did 15 million hits a month, and it was doing $35,000 a
month in yo-yos, with the average order being about $12 or $13. The
site paid for itself three times over.''
</P>
<P>
   Nurtured by yo-yo money, the game software is developing into a
seaworthy Web business based on licensing (Temple leases the
VirtualCup code to the America's Cup Association for various
sailing events) and ads (you'll notice that in the game there are
logos on the yacht sails, and from time to time a small plane flies
by, dragging a banner).
</P>
<P>
   The company is courting the Olympics, and the dot-com venture
capitalists. No doubt, the handkerchief will be swiftly retrieved
by a combination of millionaires, green-haired maniacs and yo-yos.

   COKE LAYOFFS
</P>
<P>
   EDs: Charts are planned on revenues, earnings, earnings per
share, market capitalization, employment and stocks.
</P>
<P>
   COKE-MAIN _ ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola announces it is slashing 6,000
jobs, including 2,500 in Atlanta. Main story will focus on where
the cuts are being made, why the are being made (and why these
areas) and what is the implication for future growth. (Unger,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   w/COKE-STAHL _ ATLANTA _ Interview with Jacks Stahl, Coca-Cola's
new president and chief operating officer, and possible with
Douglas Daft, the company's soon-to-be chairman and chief operating
officer. (Unger, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   COKE-STOCKS _ ATLANTA _ Wall Street loves layoffs. A look at
Wall Street's reaction to the layoffs and how the stock has
reacted. Talking with investors etc. (Luke, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   COKE-EARNINGS _ ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola releases fourth-quarter
earnings. While the company is expected to show a profit, it will
show a loss for the year. (Unger, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   COKE-ANALYSIS _ ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. told Wall Street today
that it will rethink its growth targets, which many analysts have
criticized as unrealistic. (Unger, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   COKE-PYSCHOLOGY _ ATLANTA _ A look at the psychological impact
of the cuts on the workers left at Coca-Cola and at those who are
being trimmed. What's the impact on the corporate culture. (Joyner,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   COKE-IMPACT _ ATLANTA _ Metro Atlanta, the nation's No. 1 job
market, has escaped massive layoff announcements in recent years,
although the city has had its share of smaller-scale cuts. The job
reductions have occurred in a cross-section of industries, from
electronics and textiles to health care and retail. Since last
July, there have been 19 instances of layoffs at companies with 50
or more workers, according to the state Labor Department. But even
those cuts _ and the layoffs announced today at Coca-Cola _ are
cushioned by one of the best periods of economic growth in Georgia
and U.S. history, labor experts say. (Joyner, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 20.
</P>
<P>
   COKE-LAWSUIT _ ATLANTA _ The reaction of plaintiffs in the
racial discrimination lawsuit agasint Coca-Cola to the layoffs.
(Rankin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   COKE-HISTORY _ ATLANTA _ In 1996, Roberto C. Goizueta wrote a
rare two-page letter inside Coca-Cola's internal magazine. As other
corporations slashed payrolls left and right to appease Wall
Street, the revered chairman and chief executive officer reassured
Coke's loyal thousands that increasing the company's stock value
doesn't mean layoffs or a huge corporate restructuring. (Seward,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.
</P>
<P>
   GAPACIFIC-EARNINGS _ ATLANTA _ Georgia Pacific reports quarterly
earnings. The stock has been under pressure, as have other building
products stocks. (Bond, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 16.
</P>
<P>
   AIRTRAN-EARNINGS _ AirTran reports earnings and is expected to
post its fourth straight quarterly profit, giving it a full year
profit for 99. (Thurston, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 10.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-SUMMIT _ AUSTIN _ A few hundred members of Austin's
technology business elite meet Wednesday, where they will talk at
length about Austin's most pressing issues. They are expected to
agree to support a permanent organization to assist techies in
becoming more involved in community groups. Other issues to be
addressed include the environment and bidding wars for technical
talent. (Ladendorf, Austin American-Statesman/Geewax, Cox News
Service). 20.

   SUPER BOWL COVERAGE
</P>
<P>
   FBN-SBOWL-FAULK _ ATLANTA _ Rams' running back Marshall Faulk
faced a painful dilemma during his senior year at Carver-New
Orleans. He wanted to play college ball close to home, but
recruiters told him he'd play cornerback. Faulk wanted to run the
ball. San Diego State gave him that opportunity. From there, Faulk
slowly turned himself into one of the league's best backs, first
with the Colts, now with the Rams. And when he lines up on Sunday,
he'll be one of the biggest threats of the game. (Bunn, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. 40.
</P>

   FBN-SBOWL-HARDTIMES _ ATLANTA _ For some, Super Bowl heroics led

Brooks, it provided nothing. Brooks, who led the Bengals to the

times. (Tierney, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 50.

tackle to overcome en route to the quarterback when Jevon Kearse
has been beset by tragedy and obstacles his entire life? Other than

Sunday's game. As Jevon advised, ``Check out the Freak on Sunday.''

<P>
   FBN-SBOWL-FAULK _ ATLANTA _ Rams' running back Marshall Faulk
faced a painful dilemma during his senior year at Carver-New
Orleans. He wanted to play college ball close to home, but
recruiters told him he'd play cornerback. Faulk wanted to run the
ball. San Diego State gave him that opportunity. From there, Faulk
slowly turned himself into one of the league's best backs, first
with the Colts, now with the Rams. And when he lines up on Sunday,
he'll be one of the biggest threats of the game. (Bunn, Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   COKE-IMPACT _ ATLANTA _ Metro Atlanta, the nation's No. 1 job
market, has escaped massive layoff announcements in recent years,
although the city has had its share of smaller-scale cuts. The job
reductions have occurred in a cross-section of industries, from
electronics and textiles to health care and retail. Since last
July, there have been 19 instances of layoffs at companies with 50
or more workers, according to the state Labor Department. But even
those cuts _ and the layoffs announced today at Coca-Cola _ are
cushioned by one of the best periods of economic growth in Georgia
and U.S. history, labor experts say. (Joyner, Atlanta

SIGNAL SPURS HOPE OF CONTACT WITH LOST MARS LANDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mysterious signal has sent NASA racing to try to re-establish
contact with the lost Mars Polar Lander and hoping against hope
that the wayward $165 million spacecraft might still be alive and
struggling to communicate with Earth from a landing site on the red
planet. The chances of success are considered slim.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes soared early this week after scientists at Stanford
University reported that an analysis of data gathered by their
150-foot dish antenna on Dec. 18 and Jan. 4 showed signs of what
might be an extremely weak signal from Mars.
</P>
<P>
   So on Tuesday, NASA sent messages to the planet commanding the
lost spacecraft to try again. On Wednesday, the Stanford scientists
listened for an answer beginning at 4 p.m., the instructed time.
Another listening session is scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Space agency and Stanford officials said it would take a day or
more of analysis before they would know if they had succeeded in
communicating with the wayward spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week's test is a real long shot, and I wouldn't want to
get anyone too excited about it,'' said Richard Cook, the Mars
Polar Lander project manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif. ``The signal that the Stanford team detected is
definitely artificial, but there are any one of a number of places
it could have originated on or near Earth. Still, we need to
conduct this test to rule out the possibility that the signal could
be coming from Polar Lander.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the flutter of hope comes after NASA early last week
officially abandoned its search for the ill-fated lander, which
vanished on Dec. 3 as it sped toward the Martian surface. After a
safe arrival near the planet's south pole, the craft was to have
dug for signs of water ice.
</P>
<P>
   The tantalizing Stanford clues arose from an experimental effort
that NASA had mounted to try to purse all possible ways of
communicating with the lost lander. Stanford was selected because
its huge dish antenna _ a campus landmark _ can pick up signals in
the ultrahigh frequency band. NASA's own dish antennas cannot.
</P>
<P>
   The lander was designed to transmit on that frequency in regular
communications with the Mars Global Surveyor, a craft now orbiting
Mars and listening for the vanished spacecraft. So the space agency
decided it made sense to try to scan those ultrahigh frequencies
from Earth as well.
</P>
<P>
   Several times in December and January, NASA ground stations sent
commands telling the polar lander to switch on its ultrahigh
frequency transmitter and send out the equivalent of a Mayday. And
Stanford listened.
</P>
<P>
   If the mysterious blip turns out to be from the polar lander, it
means the spacecraft probably failed in at least two ways. First,
its X-band radio, normally used to transmit to Earth, is broken.
Second, its ability to relay signals through the orbiting surveyor
is somehow impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Although it took Stanford several weeks to process data from the
previous test communications, NASA officials say things will be
much faster now that the team knows what to look for. In a
statement on Tuesday, the space agency said results were expected
``within several days.''
</P>
<P>
   Most officials seem wary of over-optimism and assume that the
polar lander will produce no sudden outburst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's not going to happen,'' Mary Hardin, a spokeswoman
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said Wednesday. ``It's an
extremely long shot _ that's what I'm getting from the team.''
</P>
<P>
   If the lander is alive, officials believe there is little hope
that any science could be achieved or that its faulty radios could
somehow be repaired. But even tattered radio contact would give a
team of NASA detectives more clues to try to understand what doomed
the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, NASA lost a pair of Mars craft _ an orbiter in
September and the lander in December. Experts who are studying the
failures say the twin losses may yet delay the first of a half
dozen Mars probes scheduled to be launched off every two years,
beginning in 2001. The series is meant to accelerate the agency's
explorations of Mars.

20 PERCENT BOOST IN SALES FUELS POLAROID COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Polaroid Corp.'s comeback kicked into high gear as the company
Wednesday reported strong fourth-quarter earnings and revenue,
bolstered by a dramatic increase in sales of its new instant
picture cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass. instant-imaging company said it earned
$28.5 million, or 64 cents a share, in the final three months of
last year, compared with a loss from operations of $4 million, or 9
cents a share, in the corresponding period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose nearly 20 percent, to $649.8 million from $541.8
million, in the final quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The solid financial performance help boost total 1999 revenue by
7 percent, to $1.98 billion from $1.85 billion. Profit for 1999 was
$8.7 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with a 1998 loss of $51
million, or $1.15 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their camera sales growth was very robust, so the question now
is whether that momentum will continue into film sales _ the area
where they make most of their money _ and if it does, they will
have a hell of a year in 2000 and 2001,'' said B. Alex Henderson,
an analyst at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The strong fourth quarter marked a milestone in the company's
turnaround, said Gary T. DiCamillo, chairman and chief executive.
He has guided the company since October 1995 and was rewarded on
Tuesday with a contract extension, through 2002. His current
employment agreement was set to expire in October.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid has struggled in recent years, with annual sales
stagnant at about $2 billion for nearly a decade. For much of the
1990s, the company has been downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, it has pinned its hopes on a new generation of cameras
aimed at adolescents and young adults. The new products include the
company's first single-use or disposable camera, called PopShots; a
camera called I-Zone that fits in a shirt pocket and produces
images the size of a postage stamp (it was successfully
test-marketed in Japan); and a low-cost camera, the JoyCam.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the new cameras in the second and third fiscal
quarters helped Polaroid emerge from its long doldrums. In the
fourth quarter, the holiday sales rush plus a major TV advertising
campaign gave the company a new momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid's fourth-quarter results did not surprise some Wall
Street analysts, who had forecast 64 cents a share, according to
First Call/Thomson Financial. They made their forecasts after
Polaroid said in October that it planned to spend more money to
promote the new cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid shares, which have risen 9 percent in the past 12
months in anticipation of an expected sales upturn, closed
Wednesday at 22 9/16, up 2 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the company sold a record 9.7 million instant cameras,
surpassing a 1978 record.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its bread-and-butter instant photography business,
Polaroid also sold more than 400,000 digital cameras, most of them
through such mass merchants as Walmart, which DiCamillo said made
the company among the leaders in US digital camera sales volume in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Polaroid also sold some of its noncore assets,
including its fiber optics business and a group that sold antiglare
filters for computers. It also completed a partnership agreement
for its graphics imaging business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Full-year revenues for both instant film and cameras showed
solid increases, validating our strategy to reinvigorate the
business through new products, new channels, and new customers,''
DiCamillo said. ``These results give us confidence in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCamillo said he is targeting ``high single or low
double-digit'' sales growth for the year and ``significant
double-digit operating profit increases.''

&HT;     BOAT SURVIVORS SAY ELIAN'S MOTHER WANTED BOY TO STAY IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Survivors of the shipwreck that killed the mother
of Elian Gonzalez implored Congress Wednesday to reverse the
immigration service's decision to return the boy to Cuba, saying
his mother's ``dying wish'' was for her son to live in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask all the mothers of the world to respect the decision of
his mother who died trying to bring her son to freedom,'' said
Arriane Horta, who survived the shipwreck that killed the boy's
mother, Elizabet Brotons Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez, who was 5 at the time, was found clinging to an
inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25 after the boat
carrying him to the United States capsized, killing his mother, her
boyfriend and nine other people.
</P>
<P>
   Horta, joined by the boy's cousins, Georgina Cid and William
Gonzalez, said that when the boat began to sink, Rodriguez told
everyone on board to make sure her son ``put one foot on U.S. soil
so that he could never be sent back to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was with her when we started to have trouble, and it was her
dying wish that Elian go to the land of freedom and not live under
the repression of Castro,'' Horta told a news conference. The news
conference was sponsored by the Cuban American National Foundation,
a U.S.-based organization that opposes the communist regime of
Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Miami, Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers, Mariela
Quintana and Raquel Rodriquez, were taken to a government-ordered
meeting with Gonzalez, whom they had not seen in more than two
months.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the two women made an impassioned appeal to Congress
not to pass a bill that would make Gonzalez a U.S. citizen, saying
the boy was a Cuban citizen and belonged with his father and them
in Cuba. Versions of the citizenship bill are before both the House
and the Senate. The measures, drafted by members of the Florida
congressional delegation, would confer American citizenship on
Gonzalez, thus removing the jurisdiction of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service from the case.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has ruled that the boy, who is now 6, should be returned
to his father in Cuba. Gonzalez's relatives in Florida have
challenged the order in federal court. ``It's our right to see our
grandson and take him back home,'' Mariela Quintana, the child's
paternal grandmother, said during a visit to Capitol Hill.Although
Congress is poised to act on the legislation next week, the
grandmothers' desire to take the boy to Cuba does has some support
in Washington.President Clinton has hinted that he might veto the
citizenship legislation if it passes. ``I have not decided what to
do and I would not rule that out,'' he said Tuesday.In addition,
some Senators seeking Gonzalez's repatriation to Cuba have
suggested they might use delaying tactics, including a filibuster,
to keep the Senate from debating the citizenship measure. ``The
idea that the Senate and the House of Representatives is going to
determine the fate of a 6-year-old is pathetic,'' Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., said Tuesday. Dodd said Gonzalez belongs with his
father and grandmothers. ``We can have good families in bad
countries,'' he said after a meeting with the grandmothers. ``This
is a good family.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington has no formal diplomatic ties with the Castro
government. And the United States maintains a strict embargo on
trade with the island state that is 90 miles off the coast of
Florida.

   Roughing It With TV: Satellite Dish for SUVs
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A sport utility vehicle used to be something of a status symbol,
but nowadays it seems that everybody has one. The people at
Datron/Transco Inc. have a device that will make your SUV stand
out: a roof-mounted satellite dish that will let you watch live TV
as you drive.
</P>
<P>
   Datron/Transco's latest model, the CruiseTV DBS-4500, was on
display earlier this month at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las
Vegas. Like previous models, the device consists of a motorized
dish antenna inside a weatherproof plastic shell. The dish swivels
from side to side and up and down in order to stay locked on to a
satellite signal no matter how much the car turns.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this model different is the plastic shell. In earlier
models, the dish sat in a white dome, but SUV and van owners didn't
like having what looked like a giant mushroom cap on the roof of
their vehicle. So Datron/Transco redesigned the shell to resemble
one of those boxy rooftop luggage carriers. It comes in white but
can be painted to match the vehicle color (although metallic paints
cannot be used, as they would interfere with the signal).
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is based in Simi Valley, Calif., says the
antenna will work with both Direct TV and Dish Network signals. But
being able to watch your favorite television shows on the open road
doesn't come cheap: the unit retails for about $4,000 plus
installation. And to that must be added the cost of a satellite
receiver, monthly fees to Direct TV or Dish Network and a
television set or two (although preferably not in the front seat).

   The Frigid Majesty Of the Far North
</P>
<P>
   With much of the Eastern Seaboard digging out from this week's
storm, perhaps it's a good time to be reminded of what winter
really looks like. Alaska Web Art, a design company in Wasilla,
Alaska, has put more than a dozen panoramic views of the state on
the Web (www.360alaska.com). Included are vistas of Prince William
Sound and Seward Harbor that rotate 360 degrees and aerial
photographs of the spectacular Denali National Park. There is even
a look at downtown Anchorage, where Thursday's forecast calls for
snow and a high of 9 degrees.

   The Flashing Pen That Thinks It's a Ringing Cellular Phone
</P>
<P>
   Here is a product for those modern-day pariahs whose cell phones
ring at all the wrong times _ at the theater, say, or in the middle
of an important business meeting. The Flashing Fone Pen, marketed
by BUCA, a wholesaler of phone and pager accessories in Long
Branch, N.J., silently alerts the user when a call comes in to a
nearby mobile phone.
</P>
<P>
   The pen, which doubles as an actual writing instrument, comes in
assorted colors and retails for about $20, according to the
company. It flashes for 10 seconds when a call comes in to a phone
that is up to three feet away _ ideal for a situation that demands
quiet (so the phone's ringer is turned off) or that is so noisy
that the sound of a ringing phone would go unnoticed. The device
will work for about three months with two button-cell batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The company cautions that the effective range is cut roughly in
half if the cell phone is inside a briefcase. And the pen doesn't
discriminate: it will flash if it is within three feet of somebody
else's cell phone, as can happen in the close quarters of a
business meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But, as a company spokeswoman noted, the worst that would happen
in such a case is that you would be forced to check your own phone
to see if it was ringing, which is what everybody does anyway when
a cell phone goes off at a meeting.

   Software That Translates English to 10 Languages
</P>
<P>
   This may be the age of the global economy, but so far the
majority of the Web speaks just one language _ English. To give
non-English speakers a break, an Israeli company called Babylon.com
offers free software for easy translation.
</P>
<P>
   The software, which can be downloaded from the company's Web
site, www.babylon.com, works by turning any word on a computer
screen _ whether in a Web browser or a word-processing document _
into a hyperlink. By highlighting and right-clicking on a word,
users can find out what the word means in their language. A bubble
on the screen offers translations, definitions and synonyms. The
software pulls the information from its database of more than 3
million words in 10 languages.
</P>
<P>
   Babylon.com also includes a standard English dictionary, as well
as instantaneous conversions of currency, measurements and
time-zone information. Users can also download a speech synthesizer
that pronounces highlighted words.
</P>
<P>
   The software is not designed to serve as a complete translation
product for people who need entire documents rewritten in their
native tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is targeted to people who have some basic English skills
but may need help with a particular word,'' said Shuki Preminger,
Babylon.com's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also working with other companies on a version of
its product, called BabyloNet, to be integrated into Web pages.

&HT;        BAY STATE LAWMAKERS WELCOME EMERGENCY OIL FUNDS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 2000 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 - Massachusetts lawmakers applauded
Wednesday President Clinton's decision to release $10.1 million in
emergency funds to help low income families pay their heating
bills.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced Tuesday the release of $45 million to
be distributed to 11 Northeastern and Middle Atlantic states facing
soaring home oil heating costs this winter.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency funds will go to 362,966 eligible households in
Massachusetts, according to the Department of Health and Human
Services. Massachusetts received the second-highest amount of
emergency funds. Maine received $10.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire, Connecticut, New Jersey, Vermont and other states
will also get money.
</P>
<P>
   Citing heating oil prices at their highest level since the Gulf
War, Northeast lawmakers and governors lobbied the administration
heavily in recent weeks to release the funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased the president has decided to act to help ease
this crisis,'' said Rep. James P. McGovern, D-Worcester. ``Anyone
who purchases home heating oil or fills up at the gas station knows
that the price of oil has increased dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard E. Neal also applauded the release of the funds.
``The release of these funds will help ease the burden for many
households in our state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton made the announcement at a press conference
Tuesday. ``These funds will help keep more American families safe
and warm this winter,'' the president said. ``And we'll get them
out there just as quickly as we possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   To be distributed by local authorities, the emergency funds add
to $44.9 million of federal money already awarded to Massachusetts
this year under the annual Low-Income Home Energy Assistance
Program, or LIHEAP.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible, families must have annual incomes less than 150
percent of the national poverty level. The majority of recipients
earn less than $15,000 per household.
</P>
<P>
   Heating oil prices have gone up 50 percent in the last two
months in the Massachusetts, according to Mark Wolfe, executive
director of the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association.
While heating normally makes up 15 or 20 percent of low-income
families' household income during the winter months, and for those
using heating oil it may be 35 percent lately, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They released the money early enough in the year that they can
do something with it,'' Wolfe said. ``Assuming prices stabilize, it
should be enough to get people through.''

 &HT;    Goizueta warned of 'situations' in rare letter
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In 1996, Roberto C. Goizueta wrote a rare two-page
letter inside Coca-Cola's internal magazine.
</P>
<P>
   As other corporations slashed payrolls left and right to appease
Wall Street, the revered chairman and chief executive officer
reassured Coke's loyal thousands that increasing the company's
stock value doesn't mean layoffs or a huge corporate restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we drive growth in shareowner value by driving growth
in the economic value triggered by our business,'' Goizueta wrote
that September. He added that a side effect was job growth.
</P>
<P>
   Goizueta, however, didn't rule out layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are any number of situations that could change tomorrow,
today _ even this minute _ that would force us to make hard
decisions we've never had to make,'' he warned. But he quickly
added that wasn't likely.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was then. Sales were up 8 percent and the stock
price 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More than two years after Goizueta's death in October 1997,
Coca-Cola faces one of those ``situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time it had to make a hard decision on layoffs was in
1988. That January, it announced 200 job cuts at its domestic soft
drink unit, Coca-Cola USA. Those cuts primarily involved workers in
bottler support services, such as advertising and marketing, but
employees in other departments also were let go.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the cuts at Coca-Cola USA were at North Avenue,
while the rest were at field offices. The company streamlined its
bottler support services because consolidation among bottlers meant
fewer that needed North Avenue's assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there have been even fewer bottlers as Coca-Cola
continues its strategy of building ``anchors'' that are able to
serve wider market territories.
</P>
<P>
   While there had been no major company layoffs since 1988 until
Wednesday's announcement, the company has trimmed its payrolls in
other parts of the world, where troubled economies have led to
lower profits.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola announced plans to cut its Moscow staff in September
after the company saw sales decline there. The falloff followed a
nose dive in the ruble, which cut into Russians' savings and made
Coke's products more expensive. Even Coke's bottler in Moscow cut
about a third of its work force of 900.
</P>
<P>
   Coke announced Wednesday it was writing down some of its
operations in Russia because of the difficulty in growing the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Another market with mixed results has been Latin America.
Coca-Cola announced in October that it was cutting about a 10th of
its work force in Brazil, or about 100 workers. The company faces
fierce competition from low-cost competing soft drink brands.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola bottlers in the United States also have not been
immune to job cuts. In November, Charlotte-based Coca-Cola Bottling
Company Consolidated announced it would cut as many as 300 jobs
because of expected slower sales growth. CCB is the Coke system's
second-largest U.S. bottler after Atlanta-based Coca-Cola
Enterprises.

U.N. SETTLES ON COMPROMISE CANDIDATE FOR IRAQ DISARMAMENT POST
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Hans Blix, a former director of the
International Atomic Energy Agency, was chosen unanimously
Wednesday by the Security Council to be the chief inspector of a
new disarmament commission for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he would take the council's
advice and appoint Blix, a Swedish lawyer who has attracted
criticism for what some disarmament experts saw as a weak approach
to nuclear inspections in his 16 years at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very experienced man, and I'm sure he knows what he's
getting into,'' Annan told reporters after attending a council
meeting on Congo. ``I hope Iraq will cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Annan nominated Rolf Ekeus, another Swedish
disarmament expert supported by the United States, to the chief
inspector's job. But his nomination was blocked in the council by
France, Russia and, to some extent, China.
</P>
<P>
   The council president this month, Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S.
representative, coupled the announcement about Blix with a warning
to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq not to try to obstruct the
panel, the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission.
Iraq successfully hid a nuclear-weapons program from the atomic
agency for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iraqis understand this resolution,'' Holbrooke said,
noting the council's unity after months of division and disarray.
``They understand the continuing consequences if they obstruct this
process. I think they are playing a very dangerous and, ultimately,
self-damaging role if they continue to obstruct. Let's see what
Baghdad does. Let's hope that they have some residual sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said the council had found consensus only over Blix.
And it appears that France took the lead in resurrecting his name.
Blix had been mentioned weeks ago as a possible compromise
candidate, but faded from the competition. Holbrooke said his name
just ``came up out of the woodwork'' on Tuesday and rallied the
council in record time.
</P>
<P>
   Blix, 71, was traveling in Antarctica on Wednesday. He told U.N.
officials that he would hold a news conference in Sweden early next
month, when he returns.
</P>
<P>
   He is not considered the strongest of more than 20 candidates
who were in the running. But the United States was unwilling or
unable to fight for a stronger nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the intensity of American pressure in the
council on Iraqi issues has declined considerably, as the Clinton
administration has turned its attention to efforts to replace
Hussein. In Blix, they could agree on a respectable, experienced
candidate, if not one likely to be confrontational with the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Under the cease-fire resolution that ended the war in the
Persian Gulf in 1991, Iraq has to be certified free of all
prohibited weapons systems and the means to reconstruct them before
sanctions imposed in August 1990, after the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Since last month, however, Iraq has enjoyed a much more liberal
program of oil sales to pay for civilian goods. It is no longer
limited on how much oil it can sell, a move that the United States
did not oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats have questioned whether easing the sanctions
would reduce the incentive to comply with resumed arms inspections,
which the Iraqis flatly oppose. Wednesday, the Iraqi representative
to the United Nations, Saeed Hassan, repeated the objection,
saying, ``We are not dealing with this resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke praised Blix's appointment. ``As the American
representative, let me make clear that we are pleased with his
nomination,'' he said. ``We think he is an excellent choice.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1981 to 1997, Blix was director general of the atomic
agency, based in Vienna. He saw the organization through some of
its most difficult years. Critics said Blix's strong support for
nuclear energy had led to a willingness to condone unsafe programs
or extensive and loosely monitored projects in countries suspected
of diverting peaceful research to secret work on weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He came under his strongest attack when it was learned after the
gulf war that Iraq had developed a secret nuclear-weapons program
that the atomic agency had not detected in its routine inspections
of Iraqi sites.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, a
research organization in Washington, reflected the view of the
critics when he said that under Blix's leadership the agency was
always known as a somewhat timid watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``The willingness of the IAEA to give Iraq the benefit of the
doubt when it could not come up with specific evidence to
contradict Iraq's claims, that gives me real concerns as to how
strong a chief inspector he can be,'' Leventhal said. ``The big
question about Blix is whether he has the backbone to stand up to
the Security Council with findings that certain members of the
council may not want to hear. I believe his track record at the
IAEA suggests that he tends to bend to political will rather than
come up with independent findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing could become a farce. If the approach of the
IAEA is now going to guide the new commission, I think the world
will have to be highly skeptical about the kind of conclusions this
commission reaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Blix say pinning the blame for missing the Iraqi
weapons programs on Blix is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``To criticize Hans Blix for Saddam's secret nuclear program is
scapegoating,'' said John Ritch, the U.S. ambassador to the agency
in Vienna. ``Ten years ago, the IAEA could only monitor known
nuclear facilities. And neither the U.S. or any other country was
asking it to do more. These limited inspection powers left a window
open for heavily disguised nuclear activity, and Saddam tried to
walk through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blix was burned. But what he did after the gulf war is what
counts. The IAEA dismantled Iraq's nuclear program. It detected and
confronted North Korea for its nuclear violations. And with Blix's
help, the IAEA acquired sweeping new inspection authority and
investigative technologies, which are not being put into effect
worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the international board of governors, made up of member
nations, gave the agency new powers to demand access to suspect
sites for unannounced inspections and to sample soil, vegetation,
water and air for traces of radioactivity. In 1994, Blix was
involved in drafting an agreement to roll back North Korea's
illegal nuclear weapons program _ Iraq and North Korea were in
violation of the 1968 nuclear nonproliferation treaty _ and atomic
agency officials are now monitoring North Korea full time.
</P>
<P>
   Blix, whose relations with inspectors and experts on Iraq's
biological, chemical and systems were often cool and sometimes
tense, will be responsible for those areas in his new role. The
atomic energy agency will continue to monitor Iraqi nuclear
programs.

 &HT;    From `Footloose' to folk guitar
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Kevin Bacon, his brother and I played a
game. And it wasn't ``Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon,'' that
Internet-fueled fest whereby you try to link the actor to almost
everyone in Hollywood through one flick or another.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``rock, scissors, paper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On three,'' he instructs, as his brother and I pause, clenched
fists poised over open palms.
</P>
<P>
   Smack, smack, WHAM!
</P>
<P>
   Kevin and Loretta (``scissors''), 1. Michael (``paper''), 0.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, I've reassured them both that I won't dredge up
the dreaded Six Degrees game.
</P>
<P>
   Admits Kevin, ``It has become a bit tiresome.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Bacons, bottled water in hand, are crashed on a couch in
a threadbare, wood-paneled office above the Carefree Theatre in
West Palm Beach, where the duo launched a 30-stop, country-wide
singing tour last week.
</P>
<P>
   If your acoustic guitar knowledge is nil, you might not know
that the ``Footloose'' veteran and his older sibling teamed up in
1994 to become The Bacon Brothers, a duo that's a little bit
country and a little bit rock 'n' roll. Their first album,
``Forosoco'' (as in folk-rock-soul combo) debuted two years later.
And their follow-up CD, ``Getting There,'' hit stores last fall.
</P>
<P>
   No, they're not selling out National Car Rental Center (or even
the Carefree, for that matter, which was only about two-thirds full
last Thursday). But they have lured some loyal fans. Folks who'll
mouth along to memorable lyrics such as these:
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in this trailer park tonight
</P>
<P>
   Still basking in the memory of that glorious fight
</P>
<P>
   It hit me when she stepped into the ring
</P>
<P>
   Floating like a butterfly, and I still feel the sting
</P>
<P>
   I got it bad for an arm-wrestling woman.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few music critics insist that the only ones who are
getting it bad are concert ticket buyers. But the Bacons remain
undaunted, preferring instead to focus on being a bona fide act
complete with national sponsor (etown.com) and hovering tour
managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get an adrenaline rush, definitely,'' says Kevin, 41. ``I
used to get so nervous, but it's getting a little easier. There's
still that element of danger to being on stage, though. I've
forgotten words to my own songs before.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, to ``Arm-Wrestling Woman'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Michael, meanwhile, is an accomplished composer, having won an
Emmy in 1993 for his score for ``The Kennedys,'' a TV documentary.
His most recent project was scoring Peter Jennings' 27-hour series,
``The Century.'' And he's also penned tunes performed by Perry Como
and Jerry Lee Lewis, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their celebrity status, the Bacons are extremely low-key
and unassuming. Faded jeans, not Armani slacks. Cowboy boots, not
Gucci loafers. A tour bus, not a private jet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, pausing briefly backstage before a pre-show run-through,
they sit quietly, waiting for me to speak first.
</P>
<P>
   Me: Guess growing up with four older sisters teaches restraint _
at least when it comes to running your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin and Michael, 50, are the youngest of six kids born to
Philadelphia native Edmund Bacon, a retired city planner, and his
late wife, Ruth, a Park Avenue debutante-turned-schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up in a family that valued creativity above everything
else,'' Michael says. Including money.
</P>
<P>
   Says Kevin: ``I remember people standing around doing the
dishes, singing and harmonizing.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys would escape to the basement to play dueling guitars
and had their first real gig at a hometown benefit in the early
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember panicking about it,'' Kevin says. ``I thought,
`What we have done? How are we going to play the guitar and
sing?'''
</P>
<P>
   At 17, Kevin headed to New York with Broadway on the brain. He
made his film debut in ``National Lampoon's Animal House'' in 1978,
then did soap stints in ``Search for Tomorrow'' and ``Guiding
Light.'' Michael, meanwhile, formed the folk-rock group Good News,
which toured in the '70s and recorded for Columbia. He moved to
Nashville, Tenn., for the country music scene, then landed in New
York as a composer for film and television. Kevin, by the way, also
lives in New York (and has a house in Connecticut).
</P>
<P>
   But Bacon didn't become a household name until 1984, when Kevin
_ buff, glistening and swinging from factory rafters _ became the
heartthrob du jour as a feisty farm boy in ``Footloose.''
Subsequent roles were minor, and Kevin seemed to vanish (at least
long enough to avoid being typecast as a teen idol). But he
rebounded six years later as a med student in ``Flatliners,'' then
had an admirable turn as a Marine attorney in ``A Few Good Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Other flicks you may recall are ``The River Wild,'' ``Apollo
13'' and ``Wild Things.''
</P>
<P>
   He met his wife, actress Kyra Sedgwick (``Born on the Fourth of
July,'' ``Singles''), four years later on the set of ``Lemon Sky,''
a PBS production. They have two children: a son, 10, and a
daughter, 7. Michael, meanwhile, is married to Betsy, who manages
The Bacon Brothers band. They have a 17-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kevin recently wrapped up filming his umpteeth movie,
``The Hollow Man'' (a sci-fi thriller co-starring Elisabeth Shue),
he'll never fully escape the ``Footloose'' phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   And he knows it.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, he and Michael end each concert with the
goofily upbeat theme song from the '80s blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Says Kevin, his robin's-egg-blue eyes so sincere that it's hard
to tell if he's teasing: ``We figured we might as well embrace the
demon.''
</P>
<P>
   Better THAT than an arm-wrestling woman.

 &HT;    CLINTON DELIVERS FINAL STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS THURSDAY
NIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    With UNION-RESULTS
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Aiming to showcase his victories and spotlight his
remaining ambitions, President Clinton goes to Capitol Hill
Thursday night to deliver his final State of the Union address to
Congress and the American people.
</P>
<P>
   In what promises to be a lengthy _ figure on 80 minutes or so _
rhetorical tour de horizon, Clinton will actually be giving three
speeches in one.
</P>
<P>
   Like all presidents, he'll attempt to use the address to rally
public and congressional support for a broad array of his
legislative priorities. They will range from his proposals for
paying down the public debt and shoring up Social Security to his
plans for making the nation's streets safer and pressing for peace
in the fractious Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be addressing the electorate as well, hoping to favorably
position Vice President Al Gore as the presidential candidate to
pick up the mantle and keep the country on the same general policy
path that Clinton has charted. In fact, Gore will be seated right
behind Clinton and his face often will be in full view for millions
of Americans expected to watch the televised speech.
</P>
<P>
   And he'll be speaking to the history books, portraying his time
in office as a period of extraordinary achievement, an era of peace
amid unprecedented prosperity, in an effort to begin burnishing his
scandal-stained legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a speech that's going to include the
waterfront,'' said Stephen Wayne, professor of government at
Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be his accomplishments, it will be what else needs to
be done,'' said Wayne, author of ``The Road to the White House:
2000,'' to be released in the coming weeks. ``It will be, in a
sense, setting the agenda for Congress in a very favorable
Clinton-Gore way and, at the same time, providing ammunition for
the democratic Congress members when the Republicans fail to enact
most of his proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton won't be doing is bidding his office and nation
farewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sayonara and valedictory are not in this president's
vocabulary,'' said Clinton's former chief of staff, Leon Panetta.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, it's going to look an awful lot like his previous
State of the Unions, in which he'll present a very vigorous agenda
of action for the country,'' said Panetta, who runs a public policy
think tank, the Panetta Institute, in Seaside, Calif. ``If people
close their eyes, they might not think this president is in his
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, though, Thursday's speech will be Clinton's last
hurrah. When the presidential lip-biting, the congressional
applause and catcalls and the wisecracks from the Washington
punditry are all over, Clinton will return to the White House
facing his final fleeting year largely as a lame duck.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, the political calendar will dictate that
he play a diminishing role on the domestic stage, as Gore steps
increasingly into the limelight and the presidential and
congressional races take precedence over White House doings.
</P>
<P>
   On the international front, Clinton will continue to play a
unique role, particularly as he tries to wrest peace from the jaws
of age old conflict in the Mideast, Northern Ireland and the
Balkans. Even foreign leaders, though, have begun looking down the
road toward the next occupant of the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's certain to repeat his vow to keep pressing forward
until his replacement takes office next January, Clinton has also
begun to look back over his presidency and contemplate its
impending ebb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel some nostalgia, and I think it's something I'm very
much trying to fight off,'' he told reporters at the White House on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is to keep the attention of the country
focused on the future,'' he said, ``and to keep my attention, and
the attention of the administration, focused on the future, and the
energy level very high.''
</P>
<P>
   That's certain to be the central theme of Thursday night's
speech, with Clinton slated to rip through one initiative after
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll wind up...(proposing) an additional billion dollars of
new spending about every minute he speaks,'' predicted Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who spoke with Clinton by
telephone Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That could get expensive. White House aides warn that the speech
will be a stemwinder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll only be measured in hours, rather than minutes,'' joked
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't make any plans for a happy hour afterwards,'' cautioned
Andrew Rotherman, the president's special assistant for education.
``It's a huge speech that covers a lot of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used that approach, to great effect, during his last two
State of the Union addresses. At those, his primary goal was to try
to shift the focus away from his relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky, and his efforts to deceive the
country on that matter.
</P>
<P>
   His 1998 State of the Union address came just days after the
Lewinsky allegations surfaced. He gave his 1999 address just after
the House voted to impeach him on charges stemming from the
scandal, and just before the Senate voted to acquit him.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Clinton's mission Thursday night will be to try to
portray his presidency as something much larger than those dark
days would imply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president really views this year as kind of his last
opportunity to try to nail down his legacy as president and to try
to move that legacy away from what happened on impeachment and to
try to move it toward some accomplishments,'' Panetta said in a
telephone interview. ``I think that's very much on his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The likely starting point: Clinton's role in presiding over an
economic boom that began nearly two years before he took office.
The boom has continued unabated since April, 1991, generating some
20 million new jobs, driving down unemployment and crime rates, and
helping to cut the nation's welfare roles roughly in half.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also want to claim a list of foreign policy
achievements _ restoring democracy to Haiti, ending the war in
Bosnia, and managing economic crises in Mexico and Asia, to name a
few.

`ISN'T SHE GREAT' ISN'T SO HOT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Friday, Jan. 28. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 stars 
 
 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Truman Capote once famously said that Jacqueline Susann's
best-selling trashy novel, ``Valley of the Dolls,'' was not
writing, so much as it was typing. Deep down, Susann probably
didn't mind, since the mention by Capote confirmed her celebrity.
And fame was Susann's be-all, end-all, a heady rush better than any
of the salacious sex that filled her three carnal-corn potboilers.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, Susann would have been pleased that someone saw fit
to make a movie of her life, even if it as shallow as ``Isn't She
Great.'' The intermittently funny film is a camp lover's dream,
full of fantastic Pucci outfits and the perverse spectacle of a
paisley-clad John Cleese saying the grooviest things as Susann's
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   But Susann's private life wasn't as much of a hoot as her public
image, and when the movie alights on these tragic episodes, it
feels forced and teeters dangerously close to self-parody. By the
time Susann (played by Bette Midler) makes her fifth trip to
Central Park to talk to a tree where God lives (was Jackie a
druid?), true believers will be inclined to go home and curl up
with the latest Jackie Collins novel.
</P>
<P>
   Midler, despite no physical resemblance to Susann, is a logical
enough choice to play the over-the-top '60s author. In fact,
screenwriter Paul Rudnick and director Andrew Bergman have all but
recast Susann as an extension of Midler's ``Divine Miss M''
persona, altering any facts that would stand in the way of the
kitsch. In that respect, ``Isn't She Great'' makes such
pseudo-reality films as ``The Hurricane'' and ``The Insider'' look
like veritable documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean this movie isn't without its moments. Midler
and Nathan Lane, who plays Susann's devoted publicist husband,
share a nice chemistry and the movie gets a lot of mileage by
throwing the flamboyant Jackie into stuffy situations where she can
strut her sensational stuff.
</P>
<P>
   David Hyde Pierce plays her chief nemesis, a stuffy WASP
assigned to edit ``Valley of the Dolls.'' Stockard Channing is on
hand, too, playing Jackie's self-absorbed best friend, a woman
probably closer to Susann's spirit than the Midler incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   If the movie had kept up the campiness, it might have worked.
But from the start, ``Isn't She Great'' is a fatal blend of soppy
bathos and wacky humor. Its somber scenes involving Susann's breast
cancer and the birth of an autistic child are strangely shoehorned
between various goofy episodes. The strain wears thin, particularly
when Susann heads (yet again) to that God-like tree in Central
Park.
</P>
<P>
   And while Burt Bacharach's score might be appropriate for the
film's time period, its cloying tone manages to evoke only memories
of bad period television dramedies like ``Room 222.'' Susann would
have been nauseated by it all. Worse still: She would have been
bored. &QL;

The film: ``Isn't She Great''(R; language). &QL; 
The stars: Bette Midler, Nathan Lane, Stockard Channing, David Hyde
Pierce, John Cleese. &QL;

RATING SEVEN NEW FILMS AGAINST THE GREAT LITERATURE THAT INSPIRED
THEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank McCourt, who won the Pulitzer Prize with his autobiography
about his impoverished childhood in Ireland, ``Angela's Ashes,''
doesn't think the movie based on his book is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got this scene in the movie where we kids come into
the house that's flooded, and we jump around in the water,''
McCourt said. ``We never did that. We wanted to avoid getting wet,
because if you sat around in wet clothes, you got ill. But the
people who put together that movie scene had never been poor in the
town of Limerick, and so they didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, although many critics have panned the movie version of
``Angela's Ashes,'' McCourt says he is ``well-pleased'' with
producer Alan Parker's film. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful, both in results and in the fact that they did
it at all,'' he said. ``They got the spirit of the thing, and that
is most important.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the movies' love affair with books, there are a lot of
opportunities to miss the spirit of the thing. Of the nerly
250-plus movies that opened in 1999 in Fort Worth-Dallas, more than
40 had literary roots. Many of those came toward the end of the
year or this month, from ``Sleepy Hollow'' in November to
``Angela's Ashes'' this week.
</P>
<P>
   But turning popular books into screenplays is always a ticklish
business, according to Horton Foote, who has earned two Academy
Awards for screenwriting and a Pulitzer Prize for drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone has read and loved a book, they have, in their
minds, what is for them a perfect picture of what the characters
look like, and the setting,'' said Foote, who earned his first
Academy Award for adapting Harper Lee's ``To Kill a Mockingbird''
into a screenplay. ``So the first rule for any screenwriter is to
have respect for the book, its author and its readers.''
</P>
<P>
   Foote said that even the smallest change from print to screen
can loom large to those who think the story was perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `To Kill a Mockingbird,' most felt it was a very faithful
adaptation, as I meant it to be,'' he said. ``But Harper Lee noted
every small change. And in the book, events took three years to
unfold. I had to compact that into one year. So every book that
becomes a movie will be changed somewhat. That can't be helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Among current films based on books, ``Sleepy Hollow,'' ``Stuart
Little,'' ``Girl, Interrupted'' and ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' are
substantially changed onscreen from their first print incarnations.
John Irving's adaptation of his own epic ``The Cider House Rules''
eliminates key characters and some plot lines.
</P>
<P>
   But even strict adaptations don't always translate well.
</P>
<P>
   ``''Bonfire of the Vanities,'' as a film, was pretty faithful to
Tom Wolfe's novel,'' said Ken Kirkland, a publishing industry
analyst in New York City. ``But the screen couldn't capture Wolfe's
nuances that he got into print, so the movie seemed like a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Irving, who took four tries to write a screenplay based
on ``The Cider House Rules,'' McCourt said he never considered
doing the ``Angela's Ashes'' screenplay himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have the confidence, because I'm sure it's a tricky
craft,'' McCourt said. ``Now, as I see the movie, I see things that
aren't what I would have expected. The one time I did visit the
set, in Dublin, I felt very, very uncomfortable and didn't stay. I
was looking at someone interpreting my life _ it's not like they
were shooting a novel. So I went out and had a pint with Emily
Watson (who plays McCourt's mother.) She said, `Do you have
anything to tell me?' And I said, `Not a thing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McCourt said he believes that audiences seeing ``Angela's
Ashes'' onscreen will want to read the book, if they haven't
already.
</P>
<P>
   ``This film can only enhance the book's reputation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Foote says his best advice to authors turning their books over
to screenwriters is: ``Hope for the best. No one will deliberately
set out to ruin your work. And audiences hopefully know...there
will be differences, which in the best-case scenario, will result
in a good film that properly represents the book.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's the lowdown on seven recent book-to-movie adaptations.
</P>
<P>
   Book: ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' by Patricia Highsmith
</P>
<P>
   Changes: Substantial, but reasonably faithful to the theme of
the novel.
</P>
<P>
   Specifics: In the book, Tom Ripley is hired by the owner of a
sailboat manufacturing company to persuade the owner's son, Dickie
Greenleaf, to return to America from Mongibello, Italy, where he is
trying to become a painter. Dickie's mother is dying. Dickie is in
a one-sided relationship with American writer Marge Sherwood; she
adores him, he thinks of her as a sister. Tom falls in love with
Dickie, but eventually murders him when Dickie makes it clear he
has tired of Tom's company. Eventually, Tom masterminds a scheme in
which he inherits Dickie's entire estate. The book ends with Tom
triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Dickie wants to be a jazz saxophonist. He and Marge
are engaged in a torrid love affair. There is no mention of
Dickie's mother suffering from a terminal disease. Tom kills
Dickie, but the movie does not resolve whether he will get away
with that and other bloody crimes.
</P>
<P>
   If you loved the book, will you like the movie? Yes,
definitely. &QL;

A BELLOW NOVEL EULOGIZES A FRIENDSHIP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (rk) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time they reach their 80s most great writers have long
ceased their creative output. But this April, in his 85th year, the
Nobel Prize-winning author Saul Bellow is set to publish his first
major novel in more than a decade. Not only that, he has also
become a father again.
</P>
<P>
   Bellow's new novel, ``Ravelstein,'' to be published by Viking,
is based on the life of his friend Allan Bloom, the conservative
thinker and political philosophy professor who wrote the
best-selling ``Closing of the American Mind,'' and who died in
Chicago in 1992 at 62. In his novel Bellow depicts the title
character of ``Ravelstein'' as a larger-than-life figure, a
brilliant Sybarite and a homosexual who dies of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The book _ written in Bellow's inimitable hortatory style, rich
with learning and full of puns _ tells of his friendship with Bloom
and of Bloom's illness and death.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Bloom's circle assumed that he was gay. Though Bloom
never discussed his sexuality publicly, Bellow said in a telephone
interview from his home in Brookline, Mass., he ``was so strangely
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellow added, ``What he did was to be found in the principles to
be studied in Plato's dialogues, in the `Symposium.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bellow said of Bloom, ``I have a feeling that he would mind''
that his homosexuality was revealed in the novel. Still, he said,
Bloom had asked him to write a memoir of him that was, in the words
of the novel, ``without softeners or sweeteners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had his way of life, and that was that,'' Bellow said. ``He
didn't have anything to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bloom died, the cause given was bleeding from a peptic
ulcer complicated by liver failure, but friends knew he had AIDS,
Bellow said.
</P>
<P>
   James Atlas, a former editor of The New York Times Magazine and
now an editor of the Lipper/Viking Penguin Lives Series, is writing
a biography of Bellow scheduled for publication in the fall by
Random House. He also knew Bloom, and says in the biography that he
died of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt from Bellow's novel appeared in The New Yorker in
November. It included no mention that Ravelstein was Bloom or that
Ravelstein had AIDS, as the complete book does.
</P>
<P>
   Bellow has always incorporated elements of his life into his
fiction. He portrayed his friend Delmore Schwartz in his 1975 book,
``Humboldt's Gift.'' His 1964 novel, ``Herzog,'' is said to be
based on the love affair of Bellow's second wife with one of his
best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ravelstein'' is about the art of biography. In it Ravelstein
urges Chickie, the narrator who resembles Bellow, to write the
story of his life. At the beginning Bellow invokes Macaulay's essay
on Boswell's Johnson and Johnson's vivid portrayal of his subject,
which Chickie has read in ``a purple fever.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Bloom, Ravelstein is bald and corpulent, he stutters and
tends to dribble spit when animated. Like Bloom and Bellow,
Ravelstein and Chickie are neighbors. Ravelstein's apartment is
luxurious, as was Bloom's, with a big collection of LP records. He
is a lover of Baroque opera and a spendthrift.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom was one of several intellectual mentors to Bellow, though
Bellow was some 15 years his senior. They grew to be friends in
1979, when Bloom became a professor at the University of Chicago at
the Committee on Social Thought, where Bellow was also on the
faculty.
</P>
<P>
   They taught a course together on romantic friendship, and
students sometimes called them Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, with
Bloom as the deferential Sancho, even though Bellow considered him
a mentor. Bellow urged his friend to write down his thoughts on
American education, and wrote an introduction to ``The Closing of
the American Mind,'' published in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ravelstein'' describes their friendship, and some of the
events of Bellow's life when he knew Bloom. There is Chickie's
estrangement from his beautiful wife, Vela, a scientist. Bellow's
fourth wife, Alexandra, was a Romanian mathematician. Chickie
complains that Vela is absorbed in her work and doesn't pay
attention to him. (For instance, she has groceries delivered and
makes him unpack them.) Chickie and Vela are divorced, as were
Bellow and Alexandra. Vela is replaced by the younger Rosamund, a
nurturing figure who saves Chickie when he nearly dies of food
poisoning after eating contaminated fish, just as Bellow did after
a Caribbean trip in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 Bellow published his last big novel, ``More Die of
Heartbreak.'' Two years later, at 74, Bellow married a former
student, Janis Freedman, who was 31 and became his fifth wife. Ms.
Freedman is a scholar whose essays have appeared in News From the
Republic of Letters, a magazine Bellow edits with Keith Botsford,
and in Partisan Review. On Dec. 23 Ms. Freedman gave birth to their
child, Naomi Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very pretty, very responsive,'' Bellow said of his
newborn. ``If I didn't succeed at first, I'll try again,'' Bellow,
who has three sons, said of finally having a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bloom was a conservative intellectually, he took no
public stand on the issue of gay rights. ``The Closing of the
American Mind'' was a polemic against the decline of educational
standards and the replacement of the classical canon with
``relevant'' subjects like deconstructionism, feminism and black
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom did, however, decry the loss of mystery in sex in the
oversexualized culture of the 1970s and '80s. And particularly in
his 1993 book, ``Love and Friendship,'' Bloom wrote sympathetically
of the close relationship between the male teacher and his younger
male pupil, which formed the ideal in ``Symposium.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the autobiographical elements in ``Ravelstein,'' the
book is, finally, a threnody for a friend, Bellow said, a friend
who understood him profoundly and whose loss can hardly be
absorbed. ``I could talk to him as I could talk to no one else,''
he said. ``If you don't think that is a gap in my life now,'' he
said, his voice trailing off.
</P>
<P>
   As Chickie says at the end of the novel, ``You don't easily give
up a creature like Ravelstein to death.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   You certainly have to give Craig Ferguson (Mr. Wick on ``The
Drew Carey Show'') style points for the original premise of his new
comedy, ``The Big Tease,'' which follows a Scottish hairdresser on
his quest to be recognized as the best hairstylist in the world.
It's too bad, then, that Ferguson and the filmmakers couldn't
follow through and deliver a movie that didn't rely on stock
cliches about L.A. culture and haircutting.
</P>
<P>
   While Ferguson can often be an appealing presence as Crawford
Mackenzie, the Rocky of hairdressers, the movie itself comes off
mostly as a bad comb-over, a busy exercise in fashion that simply
cannot hide the bald spots in its storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Tease'' is shot as a mockumentary, much in the vein of
``Waiting for Guffman'' and ``This Is Spinal Tap,'' only without
either film's eye for original detail. We first meet Crawford in
Glasgow, where he exuberantly learns that he has been invited to
compete in the prestigious Platinum Scissors competition in Los
Angeles. Crawford says good-bye to his mates and his mum and flies
to L.A., only to learn that he was invited as an audience member,
not as a contestant.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Crawford sets about, camera crew in tow, to win a
place in the competition. Along the way, he acquires the help of
Sean Connery's piercing publicist (Frances Fisher, who delivers the
film's standout performance), a shady limo driver and assorted
other fruits and nuts native to Los Angeles. Baiting him at every
turn is the reigning Platinum Scissors champion, Stig Ludwiggssen
(David Rasche), a haughty hairstylist who seems to have modeled his
own appearance after Fabio. Drew Carey, David Hasselhoff and
various supermodels and hair gurus make cameo appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson has lived in Los Angeles since 1995, but you wouldn't
know it by the way he and co-writer Sacha Gervasi look at the city.
The film is one long parade of Southland stereotypes _ bald women,
Koreatown drive-by shootings, skateboarders and shallowness _ that
sorely lacks inspiration. The broadsides on Angelenos' vanity are
more on the mark. Ferguson to Fisher's publicist on their first
meeting: ``You're using a non-soluble finishing rinse held in place
with a flammable stiffener. Are you mad?'' One makeover later,
she's putty in Crawford's expert hands.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a little Crawford goes a long way. Like Myles
Berkowitz, the real-life protagonist in last February's
faux-documentary ``20 Dates,'' Ferguson's Scottish hero wears a bit
thin after a while. By the time this 87-minute film ends, you won't
be sorry to see him return to Scotland, leaving Southland streets
free of Scottish hairdressers. Now if only we could be rid of those
skateboarders and bald women ... &QL; 
____ &QL; 
The film: ``The Big Tease'' (R; language). &QL; 
The stars: Craig Ferguson, Frances Fisher, Mary McCormack. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed by Kevin Allen. Screenplay by Sacha
Gervasi and Craig Ferguson. Released by Warner Bros. &QL; 
Running time: One hour, 26 minutes. &QL; 
Playing: Selected theaters. &QL;

 &HT;    Grandson carries on Gandhi's legacy of nonviolence
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rajmohan Gandhi is an influential political
commentator in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   He's also the grandson of the man who led India to independence,
Mohandas Gandhi, the mahatma who inspired the world with his
nonviolent philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Among those most inspired by the elder Gandhi was a young
minister from Atlanta, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who went on
to lead a nonviolent movement for civil rights in this country.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Rajmohan Gandhi visited the King Center to pay his
respects and lay a wreath at King's grave.
</P>
<P>
   Gandhi, a journalist and author, is now a research professor at
the prestigious Center for Policy Studies in New Delhi. He is in
Atlanta for three weeks as a distinguished fellow in residence at
Emory University's Claus M. Halle Institute for Global Learning.
</P>
<P>
   Gandhi, 64, first visited Atlanta in 1957 while traveling with a
theatrical company promoting interracial understanding. The fact
that this city became a center for the civil rights movement that
in some ways paralleled his grandfather's efforts in India is not
lost on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any historian viewing the 20th century would find Dr. King and
Mahatma Gandhi standing together,'' he has said. ``Both stood for
struggle plus love, a combination tough to achieve but crucial to
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging discussion shortly after he arrived on the
Emory campus this week, Gandhi discussed his grandfather's legacy
and his own views on contemporary India. Here are excerpts, edited
from that interview.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the Gandhi name ever been a burden to you?
</P>
<P>
   A: It hasn't been a burden to me. But I think it probably was a
burden to my father (a prominent journalist) and his brothers. You
are expected to behave in a particular way. You're always being
examined. You're always being weighed. Perhaps they couldn't do
things which others were doing. To me, it has been really a
blessing. I think most of us grandchildren came to terms with the
fact that this was a name widely known and respected and that it
wasn't going to be off our backs even if we wanted it to be. I find
that people are interested in me perhaps because of my
grandfather's name so that gives me a link with them that others
would have to strive very hard to obtain. This kind of opportunity
to make links is something I value. I regard it as a wonderful
asset.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How well did you know your grandfather?
</P>
<P>
   A: I knew him very well but to the extent a 12 1/2-year-old boy
can know his grandfather. That was my age when he died. He was very
likeable. Of course, we were all keen to attain his attention and
his affection, but we got it. He consciously set out to be a father
to all his people, so if you want to be father to a few hundred
million people, your time for your grandchildren is reduced a lot.
But when we did meet him he was a most affectionate, warmhearted
grandfather _ who also expected you to observe some standards. Even
though I was young I could see that there was this rather
extraordinary combination of great sympathy and warmth and
attentive listening to those who complained to him but also clarity
and courage in what he said to them. I remember saying to myself
this guy is a courageous guy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: To what extent is the legacy of Gandhi and his nonviolent
philosophy still a factor in India?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a factor in the sense that if people get to know that I
am his grandson they are very nice to me. The Gandhi name is a
highly honored name. But in terms of following what he stood for, I
think much of India has rejected it. He was killed because of not
just rejection but of hostility to what he stood for. And I think
one has to acknowledge that the standards he demanded were pretty
tough standards. So that has not gone down well. I would say the
nuclear bomb testing has been only one sign of rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some of Gandhi's critics in India blame him for the bloodshed
during the partition of India and Pakistan. Some of those critics
say the experiment in civil disobedience and nonviolence was in the
end a failure because of the Hindu-Muslim hatred that occurred. How
do you respond to those critics?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't share that view. Another position that one can take _
which I take _ is that but for Gandhi the violence of '47 would
have been greater, much greater. Gandhi did not eradicate violence
from Indian society by a long shot. But he focused a pretty sharp
light on it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How seriously concerned are you that both India and Pakistan
now have nuclear weapons?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think there is room for concern. I don't think there's need
for alarm. We should encourage some cool, calm thinking about it.
Why is there reason for concern? One is that both in Pakistan and
in India _ even if there is no desire to use a bomb against a
neighbor _ the atomic weapons have to be kept in such a way that
they don't damage the environment. Are there sufficient safety
standards there to prevent a nuclear accident in both countries?
The other cause for concern arises from the fact that the
India-Pakistan mistrust is not merely philosophical or ideological
as, say, the U.S.-Soviet Union divide was. Here the mistrust has
strong emotional and religious dimensions, which I think make for a
riskier situation. At the same time, there are (other) nuclear
powers in the world and there have been for some time and they have
_ Hiroshima and Nagasaki apart _ kept their nuclear weapons on the
leash. It should be possible for India and Pakistan to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What aspects of your grandfather's legacy would you like to
see retained in India, and are there parts of that legacy that no
longer seem applicable?
</P>
<P>
   A: When he talked about ends and means, he is terribly relevant
today. When he talked about high-caste Hindus changing their
attitudes and creating a more equal society, he was most definitely
right. When he said the same thing about Hindu-Muslim
relationships, I think he remains valid. And his total commitment
to the individual conscience and freedom of expression as well as
respect for the other person's freedom of expression _ tolerance of
conflicting points of view _ there again what he stood for is
terribly relevant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What points do you want to get across in your meetings with
students?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would say that reconciliation is a strong point I intend to
emphasize, strategies for reconciliation. So many groups seem to
feel that the other group is the unreasonable group. So
reconciliation between these antagonistic groups is one of the
messages I intend to underline. And preliminary to that and an
essential prerequisite to that is dialogue. I was at a meeting with
the Dalai Lama not long ago when he said that the 20th century had
been a century of violence and the 21st century has to be a century
of dialogue. And _ if there has to be struggle _ as far as possible
can we make it a nonviolent struggle? There are not too many
spectacular examples of successful nonviolence, although there have
been some. But I think the world has definitely seen the
spectacular failure of violence.

<P>
   Vivien Leigh lights a cigarette. Sigmund Freud lights a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   That's what they should be doing, isn't it? Miss Leigh is a
glamorous movie star of a bygone era, and everyone knows about Dr.
Freud and cigars. Still, when you consider that both are ill with
only a short time to live, smoking is probably the last thing they
should be doing.
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly why, in this context, smoking becomes an
oddly heroic gesture, an assertion of personality in the impassive
face of fate. The sort of moment, in short, made for the live
theater.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who played Scarlett O'Hara and the founder of
psychoanalysis showed up on separate stages in Chicago last week,
less than a block apart and both under the umbrella of the
Steppenwolf Theater Co. Freud appeared as the befuddled central
figure in John Malkovich's vivacious production of Terry Johnson's
``Hysteria,'' at Steppenwolf's main stage, a rumination on the
doctor's last days.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh is only a supporting character, though a heartbreakingly
vivid one, in ``Orson's Shadow,'' Austin Pendleton's seductive
story of clashing theatrical titans at the nearby Steppenwolf
Garage. You should know, by the way, that Freud was swapping
dialogue with Salvador Dali while Leigh was interacting with such
illustrious contemporaries as Orson Welles; the critic Kenneth
Tynan; Leigh's husband, Laurence Olivier and his lover (and
soon-to-be wife), Joan Plowright.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what kind of shiver runs up your spine on hearing of these
dramatis personae: one of delight or disgust?
</P>
<P>
   Before you pass judgment, be aware that neither of these works
is simply an exercise in vulturelike biographical bone picking.
Johnson and Pendleton, who have been this way before in previous
works, are aboveboard in pointing out that their plays are only
fabrications, speculations inspired by a smattering of known facts.
</P>
<P>
   And though you would expect ``Orson's Shadow,'' in particular,
to drip with lip-smacking prurience, the emotion that seems most to
shape it is a deep and knowing compassion. Both works consciously
use the conventions of theater to point out their own
artificiality. Yet in so doing, they forge a bond with the lives
under examination seldom achieved in more straightforward
biographies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hysteria,'' which ended its Chicago run last weekend, and
``Orson's Shadow,'' which continues at the Garage through Feb. 6,
are imperfect but winning examples of a breed of play that is
especially in vogue now. It's theater as meta-biography, in which
real lives are transformed, abstracted and mythologized in pursuit
of more essential truths or loopy intellectual gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The most anticipated new drama on Broadway this season is
Michael Frayn's ``Copenhagen,'' a ``Rashomon''-like presentation of
what might have happened at a meeting between the physicists Niels
Bohr and Werner Heisenberg during World War II. ``The Invention of
Love,'' a portrait of the poet A.E. Housman by Tom Stoppard, a
longtime master of the meta-biographical play, has just received
its premiere in the United States at the American Conservatory
Theater in San Francisco. And recent and current Off Broadway
productions present Dali (in Kyra Obolensky's ``Lobster Alice'')
and Mae West (in Claudia Shear's ``Dirty Blonde'') as liberating
catalysts in the more ordinary lives they touch.
</P>
<P>
   This all seems appropriate to an age in which the idea of fame
rules civilization as never before, when celebrities are accorded
the stature of Homeric gods and heroes (the idea being they're just
like us, only more so) and when the line between fact and
fabrication is deliberately blurred.
</P>
<P>
   This last trend was most notoriously manifested in recent months
by Edmund Morris' book ``Dutch,'' the story of Ronald Reagan told
by a narrator who never existed. But you can also find it in the
``re-enactments'' regularly featured on television tabloid
biographies. (What really happened on the night Lana Turner's
gangster lover was stabbed to death?)
</P>
<P>
   And it's worth remembering that two of the most notable cultural
prize-takers of last year were the Oscar-garlanded ``Shakespeare in
Love,'' in which Gwyneth Paltrow turns out to have inspired ``Romeo
and Juliet,'' and the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel ``The Hours,''
in which Michael Cunningham peeps into the mind of Virginia Woolf.
Woolf is a relevant name here since from the beginning of her
literary career she was pondering the impossibility of truly
knowing anyone and hence the impossibility of truthful biography. A
quotation from Stoppard's ``Invention of Love'' comes to mind,
uttered by a character named, for the record, Oscar Wilde:
``Biography is the mesh through which our real life escapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoppard is today's most fluent practitioner of the theater of
conjectural biography, starting with his ``Travesties'' (1974),
which brought Lenin, Tristan Tzara and James Joyce together during
a production of Wilde's ``Importance of Being Earnest'' in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
   With wit and bravado ``Travesties'' made a case for finding
expressly theatrical embodiments of intellectual styles and for
bringing legendary cultural sensibilities together to strike sparks
off one another. It was more than just pastiche; it used the
documented thought and language of its real-life prototypes to
shape the play's very form.
</P>
<P>
   This is, to varying degrees, what both ``Hysteria'' and
``Orson's Shadow'' achieve. But they also transcend the scholarly
pranks-playing aspect that is the dominant note of ``Travesties''
(which Stoppard has long since gone beyond) to find a richer
emotional empathy with their subjects. They are both informed by
those moments that occasionally strike you when you're reading
about people you don't know, when you pause to think, ``But what
must it have been like for them _ really?''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The theater, even narrative theater, is afforded more literary
license than films, a more varied use of language and metaphor, and
Johnson and Pendleton both take advantage of this. For example,
``Hysteria,'' which was first produced in London in 1993, is about
the rueful, self-examining thoughts and unresolved guilts that
attack Freud as he nears his death. Yet the play is, inarguably, a
farce. It is boisterously funny; it is also unnervingly poignant.
It earns the implicit double meaning in its title.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Freud's study in London in 1938, ``Hysteria'' follows
Freud (Yasen Peyankov) through encounters with three visitors: his
physician (Nicholas Rudall); Jessica (the superb Mariann Mayberry),
a desperate young woman who materializes out of a rainstorm; and
Dali (Marc Vann), who has come to pay homage from one artist of the
subconscious to another.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what follows might have been scripted by Feydeau, right
down to half-clad people hopping in and out of closets and the
discoveries of mortifying situations (like Freud trying to take the
pants off an unconscious Dali) that are not what they seem. There
are two visual puns on ``Freudian slip,'' one of which has the old
fellow stumbling on a stone phallic symbol.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a phantasmal quality about the evening, however,
and it is Johnson's particular achievement to find the overlap
between the frustrations of classic farce and of Freudian
dreamscapes, in which reality keeps pulling out the rug from under
you. Freud himself, played with a deliberate iconic stiffness by
Peyankov, is straight man to the more agitated, aggressive figures
in the play, who are actually products of his own mind.
</P>
<P>
   Malkovich's direction doesn't quite have the hair-trigger comic
timing required; he lets certain farcical moments linger and
diffuse. And the play itself takes a turn into classic Freudian
mystery solving that brings to mind old psycho-potboilers like
``The Seventh Veil.''
</P>
<P>
   But the production consistently finds the two faces, sad and
silly, in Johnson's text, and lets them merge into a unity of
unsettling depth. And every time Peyankov's Freud strokes his jaw
(Freud's cancer was in his mouth), you are reminded of what has
really given shape to this fantasia of an evening: Freud's
awareness of imminent death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orson's Shadow'' is an expressly theatrical meditation on
another kind of madness: that which rules those who live by and for
the theater. ``Are they all as neurotic as you, Orson?'' says the
young critic Kenneth Tynan to his friend Orson Welles about
professional actors. ``I really need to know.'' The answer is more
complicated than you might expect.
</P>
<P>
   In Pendleton's view, all theatrical egos may be oversize and
shaky, but some are more equipped for survival than others.
``Orson's Shadow'' separates the winners from the losers and makes
it clear that genius has little to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The play was inspired by a footnote of a fact: Welles (played
here by Jeff Still) was to have directed Olivier (John Judd) and
Ms. Plowright (Sarah Wellington) in Ionesco's ``Rhinoceros'' in
1960. In that same period, Olivier's marriage to Leigh (Lee Roy
Rogers, in an extraordinary performance) was coming to an end. He
was also about to become the director of the new Royal National
Theater, an institution in which Tynan (David Warren) would play a
significant role.
</P>
<P>
   Pendleton conflates and rearranges these elements, generously
spicing them with gossipy details, to create an engrossing picture
of success, failure, betrayal, guilt and ravening fear among a
shifting constellation of stars of film and theater. And, yes, you
could argue that this was what the pulp novelist Jacqueline Susann
made her career on.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while ``Orson's Shadow,'' still a work in progress, is
overstuffed with resume-like detail and labored in pointing out its
own ironies, there is an emotional heat to the evening that cannot
be dismissed. Pendleton, who has himself been an actor for more
than four decades, knows his territory. And under the first-rate
direction of David Cromer, the actors bring a fluidity and
conviction to their roles that never seems like mere impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   None of them, seen coldly, look that much like the real people
they're portraying, and there are moments in the script that seem
in direct contradiction of what you know about the characters'
prototypes. Yet you leave ``Orson's Shadow'' with a sense of
somehow having entered the heads of famous figures you're used to
perceiving as through the wrong end of a telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriating and rearranging real lives is a dangerous and, one
could argue, immoral business. But when sympathy and a fierce will
to imagine fully another life inform these sorts of speculations,
expected feelings of tawdriness tend to wash away. In examining
lives scarred by the theater, by stardom, by ambition, Pendleton,
Cromer and their ensemble forge a vital and loving connection,
compounded of faith, imagination and technique, which achieves its
own independent reality. Making this sort of connection was, after
all, what the characters shown onstage in ``Orson's Shadow'' based
their lives on.

 &HT;    Goizueta warned of 'situations' in rare letter
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In 1996, Roberto C. Goizueta wrote a rare two-page
letter inside Coca-Cola's internal magazine.
</P>
<P>
   As other corporations slashed payrolls left and right to appease
Wall Street, the revered chairman and chief executive officer
reassured Coke's loyal thousands that increasing the company's
stock value doesn't mean layoffs or a huge corporate restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we drive growth in shareowner value by driving growth
in the economic value triggered by our business,'' Goizueta wrote
that September. He added that a side effect was job growth.
</P>
<P>
   Goizueta, however, didn't rule out layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are any number of situations that could change tomorrow,
today _ even this minute _ that would force us to make hard
decisions we've never had to make,'' he warned. But he quickly
added that wasn't likely.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was then. Sales were up 8 percent and the stock
price 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More than two years after Goizueta's death in October 1997,
Coca-Cola faces one of those ``situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time it had to make a hard decision on layoffs was in
1988. That January, it announced 200 job cuts at its domestic soft
drink unit, Coca-Cola USA. Those cuts primarily involved workers in
bottler support services, such as advertising and marketing, but
employees in other departments also were let go.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the cuts at Coca-Cola USA were at North Avenue,
while the rest were at field offices. The company streamlined its
bottler support services because consolidation among bottlers meant
fewer that needed North Avenue's assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there have been even fewer bottlers as Coca-Cola
continues its strategy of building ``anchors'' that are able to
serve wider market territories.
</P>
<P>
   While there had been no major company layoffs since 1988 until
Wednesday's announcement, the company has trimmed its payrolls in
other parts of the world, where troubled economies have led to
lower profits.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola announced plans to cut its Moscow staff in September
after the company saw sales decline there. The falloff followed a
nose dive in the ruble, which cut into Russians' savings and made
Coke's products more expensive. Even Coke's bottler in Moscow cut
about a third of its work force of 900.
</P>
<P>
   Coke announced Wednesday it was writing down some of its
operations in Russia because of the difficulty in growing the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Another market with mixed results has been Latin America.
Coca-Cola announced in October that it was cutting about a 10th of
its work force in Brazil, or about 100 workers. The company faces
fierce competition from low-cost competing soft drink brands.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola bottlers in the United States also have not been
immune to job cuts. In November, Charlotte-based Coca-Cola Bottling
Company Consolidated announced it would cut as many as 300 jobs
because of expected slower sales growth. CCB is the Coke system's
second-largest U.S. bottler after Atlanta-based Coca-Cola
Enterprises.

 &HT;    Taking aim at raging elephantiasis
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The scientific name of the disease is lymphatic
filariasis, or LF, but it is more popularly known by one of its
manifestations, which is elephantiasis. Those who contract it
suffer from grotesque _ elephantine _ swelling of the limbs,
breasts or genitals.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 million people around the world have been
disfigured by the disease. Often they cannot work. Experts say 1
billion people in 80 countries, primarily Africa, Asia and Central
and South America, risk becoming infected.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the international community is taking the first
on-the-ground steps in an ambitious campaign to rid the world of
the disease by the year 2020. The effort, by a consortium of public
and private entities, is being coordinated by the World Health
Organization, a U.N. agency. Three Atlanta-based organizations are
involved _ the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Emory
University and the Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is beginning in Nigeria, Egypt and Samoa. Ghana
will likely be next on the list.
</P>
<P>
   LF is a parasitic disease caused by threadlike worms, known as
filariae, that live in the human lymphatic system. The adult worms
damage the lymphatic system, causing fluid to collect _ and create
swelling _ in the arms, legs, breasts and genitals. Another effect
is hydrocele, which is swelling of the scrotum up to a debilitating
weight of dozens of pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is spread by mosquitoes. One that bites an infected
person picks up the worm larvae, called microfilariae, and injects
them into the next person it bites.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to eliminate LF is not based on curing those who
already suffer from it. Instead, it is based on giving people drugs
that kill the larvae and therefore prevent transmission from those
who have it to those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the research on which the campaign is based was done by
the CDC, which has studied LF for 15 years, primarily in Haiti,
said Dr. David Addiss, a CDC epidemiologist. The CDC has evaluated
the effectiveness of different combinations of drugs and will
continue to evaluate the program, Addiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the World Health Organization has designated the CDC a
``collaborating center'' for the elimination of LF, Addiss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our role as a collaborating center is to provide technical
assistance to all the filariasis-endemic countries in the
Americas,'' he said. The CDC has been working with the Haitian
Ministry of Health to develop pilot programs to stop the spread of
LF and has also worked with officials in the Dominican Republic,
which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, and in Guyana, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   LF is found in about seven countries in the Americas, he said,
but it has disappeared from 25 other countries in the Western
Hemisphere _ including the United States. Until about 1925, the
disease was often transmitted in the Charleston, S.C., area, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As living conditions in the United States improved _ as covered
sewers reduced mosquitoes' breeding grounds and screened houses
kept mosquitoes out _ the disease disappeared, Addiss said.
</P>
<P>
   But health officials believe drugs will eliminate LF faster than
just hoping that living conditions around the world improve enough
for the disease to die out on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is based on the worldwide administration to
vulnerable populations of a drug called albendazole, which is being
donated by SmithKline Beecham, the multinational pharmaceutical
company.
</P>
<P>
   About a billion people are deemed at risk, and the drug needs to
be administered once a year for four to six years _ until the adult
worms live out their life spans. So SmithKline Beecham plans to
donate as many as 6 billion doses over the 20 years, said Brian
Bagnall, director of the company's lymphatic filariasis program.
</P>
<P>
   The company has donated medicine for disaster relief, but this
is the first time it has become involved in trying to eradicate a
specific disease, he said. ``It makes our employees feel good, it
makes our researchers feel good, and it's the right thing to do,''
Bagnall said.
</P>
<P>
   In countries such as Egypt and Samoa, albendazole will be
administered with diethylcarbamazine, or DEC, because the
combination is more effective than either drug alone. But DEC
cannot be given in countries where people are affected with river
blindness, because it exacerbates that condition. River blindness,
which is spread when parasites enter the body through the bite of
the black fly, afflicts 18 million people, many of them in
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the drug that prevents river blindness, ivermectin,
also helps limit the transmission of LF. So in countries with river
blindness _ which the Carter Center is heavily involved in
combating _ the albendazole will be given in combination with
ivermectin. Merck &AMP; Co., a U.S.-based pharmaceutical company, is
donating the river blindness drug.
</P>
<P>
   Emory helps analyze the financial impact of the disease, said
Anne Haddix, an economist at the university, and Addiss' wife.
People who are afflicted often cannot farm or do other work, and
the economic burden on affected communities can be heavy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Haddix said she works often with donors who are funding the
program, which is expected to cost $700 million over the 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donors these days really want to know things about how a
program is going to strengthen local health care, or will it have a
detrimental effect on local health care by drawing off resources,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, she said, the doses are administered by community
health care workers who often provide the first health care
available to affected areas.
</P>
<P>
   Can LF be wiped from the face of the Earth in the next 20 years?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows, but SmithKline Beecham's Bagnall said the goal is
worthy, nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bold vision,'' he said.

 &HT;    Recipe Web sites fulfill every taste

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Ever hear of llanddrog fair cakes? You
would have if you had clicked your computer mouse at
http://soar.berkeley.edu/recipes/.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe archive has more than 66,800 recipes on file, some
as obscure as the fair cakes, which are Welsh pastries, and others
as common as chili.
</P>
<P>
   Computer sites can answer food or kitchen questions, locate
recipes and solve your dining predicaments. With the Internet,
you've got a global kitchen, cooking experts and restaurant guides
literally at your fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Net cooks'' know that learning how to search and navigate is
the e-ticket to finding recipes and restaurants online. Like
everything on the Web, the variety of food and dining information
is overwhelming, and varies from four-star to downright dismal.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics of cooking are the best of what the Web offers: At
certain sites, you can change a soup recipe for four to one for 40,
and leave out the onions, then print it out in extra-large type for
Aunt Freida in about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Recipes are where things get fuzzy. At some sites open to any
cook who wishes to post, recipes range from authentic and accurate
to simply wrong all around. We visited a variety of food-related
sites, and picked the best. Be careful, though _ surfing food sites
can be addictive. One good thing: they're calorie-free.

muddle through a recipe, or a veteran who needs some ideas. A food
dictionary is available, and plenty of recipes that are categorized
logically. He also speaks in layman's terms, not foodese. Bravo!

 &HT;    AirTran posts quarterly profit
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AirTran Airways posted its fourth straight quarterly
profit as it continues to gain financial stability under a new
management team.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-quarter result gave AirTran, the second-largest
airline at Hartsfield International Airport, its first full-year
profit since a merger with ValuJet in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with fuel prices going up at pretty alarming rates, we
feel the company is well-positioned for 2000 and beyond,'' said
Chief Executive Joe Leonard, a one-time Eastern Airlines executive
who has run AirTran for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Rising fuel prices are deflating airline profits and prompted
major carriers last week to slap a $20 round-trip surcharge on most
routes.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran has not added a surcharge, but executives disclosed it
has instead raised fares. The hikes started with a quiet $2
across-the-board boost on Dec. 27, followed by a move this week to
increase short-notice fares by $5 or $10.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran's average fuel price rose only 2 cents per gallon in the
fourth quarter, to 53 cents, from a year earlier. But Leonard said
the carrier expects to pay an average of 83 cents in the current
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That increase will be partly offset by lower maintenance costs
and better fuel efficiency associated with AirTran's new Boeing
717s, he added. The carrier now has nine of the planes and will get
seven more this year.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran expects to add about 6.5 percent in new seat capacity
this year, double the figure for 1998, Leonard said. He said the
carrier plans no major route changes but will add flights between
existing destinations.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, AirTran posted a profit of $10.6
million, or 15 cents a share. That compared with a loss of $3
million, or 5 cents a share for the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Operating revenue rose to $123.4 million, up almost 17 percent
from the same quarter of 1998. Revenue per available seat-mile
jumped 14 percent as efforts to attract more business fliers, who
usually pay higher short-notice fares, showed signs of paying off.
Cost per seat-mile fell 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the full year, AirTran had a profit of $29.8 million before
special items. That compared with a loss of $13.2 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Including special items, AirTran lost $99.4 million for the
year. Those items included a $148 million charge for the
accelerated retirements of older aircraft as the new 717s are
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   After facing a liquidity crunch in mid-1998, AirTran finished
1999 with $76 million in cash, up from $52 million a year earlier.
But it still faces the need to refinance $230 million in bond debt
within the next 15 months. Leonard said AirTran hopes to minimize
any increase in costs associated with the refinancing.

 &HT;    Coke says growth targets `on the high side.'
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. told Wall Street today that it will
rethink its long-term growth targets, which many analysts have
criticized as unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by Doug Daft, the company's president and chief
operating officer, came in a conference call with analysts after
the Atlanta-based company announced a loss for the fourth quarter,
and planned layoffs of 6,000 employees. The job cuts, which will
include about 2,500 in Atlanta, affect nearly 21 percent of the
company's global workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the company has told Wall Street it can produce an
average annual increase in case sales of 7 percent to 8 percent. It
also has said that would generate earnings-per-share growth of 15
percent to 20 percent annually over the long-term.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has not been able to hit those targets recently,
and several Wall Street analysts have questioned whether those are
realistic goals. Many, for example, believe it is more likely for
the company to hit between 11 percent and 14 percent increases in
its earnings per share.
</P>
<P>
   In today's conference call, Daft conceded that the existing
targets are ``probably on the high side.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company is in the process of revising its business
strategy, which logically must come before a decision is made about
its long-term goals. But, he added, within a 180 days, if not
sooner, he will tell Wall Street whether the targets will be
lowered.
</P>
<P>
   Daft takes over as chairman and chief executive officer in
April. That is when M. Douglas Ivester will retire from those
posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generations of visionary leadership were not afraid to
challenge the status quo,'' Daft told analysts. ``This management
team is committed to continuing that tradition.''

 &HT;    Good economy act as cushion for Coke workers
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Metro Atlanta, the nation's No. 1 job market, has
escaped massive layoff announcements in recent years, although the
city has had its share of smaller-scale cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The job reductions have occurred in a cross section of
industries, from electronics and textiles to health care and
retail. Since last July, there have been 19 instances of layoffs at
companies with 50 or more workers, according to the state Labor
Department.
</P>
<P>
   But even those cuts _ and the layoffs announced Wednesday at
Coca-Cola _ are cushioned by one of the best periods of economic
growth in Georgia and U.S. history, labor experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a great situation right now,'' says Daniel Rodriguez,
an assistant professor at Emory University's Goizueta Business
School, named after the late Coca-Cola chairman. ``The labor
market's the tightest labor market we've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, unemployment is at a 30-year low, and in metro
Atlanta it's hovering around 3.2 percent. Metro workers who are
laid off tend to find new jobs faster than workers elsewhere in the
country. Last year, metro Atlanta picked up 113,600 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The average worker drawing unemployment benefits in Georgia does
so for a little more than eight weeks, the shortest benefits period
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But First Union economist Mark Vitner wonders whether recent
announced layoffs like the ones at Coke, Lockheed Martin and
Rockwell International are merely hiccups or ``an indication of
(more) layoffs to come. There's no way of knowing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Vitner says the search can be tough for workers in high-paying
jobs with lucrative benefits, such as in the case for Coke workers.
Job growth in Atlanta and elsewhere has largely been at smaller
companies, not large ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for people who lose jobs like that to go out and
find a job that's comparable,'' Vitner said. ``There's not another
Coke in Atlanta or another Delta in Atlanta. There are lots of
other jobs in Atlanta, but not paying at the rate of Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the job cuts that took place during the last decade were
in response to competition within various industries.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the aftermath of deregulation and increased
competition in the telecommunications industry prompted several
waves of job cuts at BellSouth Corp. during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth dropped from a mid-1990 peak of 103,152 employees to
81,241 during 1996. Most of the cuts came from the heavily
unionized local phone unit. However, BellSouth's growth _
especially in wireless, international and Internet units _ has
meant an expanding work force in the past two years. BellSouth
ended 1999 with 96,162 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Delta Air Lines stunned the community in 1994,
announcing it would cut 12,000 to 15,000 jobs as a way to reverse a
severe financial slump. It was the first mass cutback in the
company's history.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Mariner Post-Acute Network, among the top three
nursing home operators in the country, announced last year it was
cutting 7,300 of its 65,000 jobs to recover from cuts in
reimbursements from Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has headquarters at One Ravinia Drive off
Ashford Dunwoody Road, said 300 of the layoffs would be in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Norcross-based Uptons put 1,200 Atlanta-area employees out of a
job last summer when it announced it was closing all of its stores
locally and across the nation and getting out of the department
store business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta, like a lot of other areas of the country, has
experienced some layoffs in recent years,'' said Sam Hall, a
spokesman for the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``While companies have trimmed back on jobs, other companies are
expanding and new companies are coming to Atlanta,'' Hall said.
``So the net effect is that going back to 1991, 1992 _ as we began
to come out of the recession of early 1990s _ we've seen consistent
job growth each year since then.''

 &HT;    Georgia-Pacific posts earnings
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Georgia-Pacific Chairman and Chief Executive A.D.
``Pete'' Correll has done just aout everything he can with the
bottom line of the country's second-largest forest products
company.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Correll has made a religion out of wringing the
costs out of pulp, paper and plywood production. Boosted by another
record-setting housing market, last year was the best since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enter 2000 with a clear view that the pulp and paper
business is going to have a very good year,'' Correll said in a
recent interview. ``It's been a long time since we've entered a
year as upbeat as we are right now.''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest challenge is to get Wall Street's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific's stock is a sore spot with Correll.
Georgia-Pacific Group, which excludes the Atlanta-based company's
timber business, closed Wednesday at $40, down 50 cents. Although
Correll said he's ``encouraged'' that the shares rose about 70
percent last year, the stock has generally underperformed the
Standard &AMP; Poor's and the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Timber Co., which was created as a separate letter stock two
years ago, hasn't bowled over Wall Street, either. Although that
business has consistently beat analysts' estimates, the stock is
down 19 percent from its 52-week high of $27.18 3/4 in August. It
closed Wednesday at $21.93 3/4, up 6 1/4 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our No. 1 challenge is to get the stock price up,'' said
Correll, who noted that a massive restructuring is complete, and an
aggressive move into paper and tissue is showing good profit
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good quarter or a good year won't (help the stock),''
Correll said. ``We've got to show consistent high levels of
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll try to repeat Wednesday's reports of soaring profits.
Georgia-Pacific Group posted net income of $175 million for the
fourth quarter, or $1 a share, up from the year-ago profit of $26
million, or 15 cents a share. It beat analysts' estimates by a
penny.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific's fourth-quarter revenue grew to $5.15 billion,
a 52 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Timber Co. earned $40 million, or 48 cents a share, in the
fourth quarter, exclucing a one-time gain, against $47 million, or
54 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue in the latest quarter was
$108 million, down from $127 million.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the boon in building products waned at year-end.
Lower prices and demand for some wood products continued in the
fourth quarter, pushing operating profit in that segment down to
$194 million from $195 million one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, paper profits were up sharply as rebounding Asian and
European economies tightened paper supplies and pushed prices up.
Uncoated paper prices rose about 25 percent last year. This year,
prices are expected to rise about 8 percent, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific got a big boost from recent acquisitions. Its
new paper distribution subsidiary, Unisource Worldwide, contributed
$35 million in operating profit in the fourth quarter. Unisource,
formerly the nation's largest distributor of paper products and
janitorial supplies, is helping Georgia-Pacific better manage its
inventory, Correll said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That organization has 4,000 salespeople on the ground, so we
know what's happening in the market every day,'' he said. Now that
Georgia-Pacific is more in tune with customer demand, it can keep a
check on production capacity, which has been the bane of the
industry. New capacity usually sinks prices and earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the short-lived paper boom of 1995, this upswing could
stick around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have two or three good years,'' Correll said.
``There's a rational approach by everyone towards adding capacity
now.''

By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It is all LIES!'' Jim Carrey warns audiences at the outset of
the Andy Kaufman biopic ``Man on the Moon.'' ``Things are out of
order ... people are mixed up ... what a MESS!''
</P>
<P>
   This opening gag probably gets the biggest laugh in the movie,
due in large part to the fact that Carrey/Kaufman's rant is easily
recognized as an all but unquestioned Hollywood convention: that
when a film is based on real events involving real people, truth is
often the first casualty.
</P>
<P>
   That has been no more evident than it is now, as an unusually
large number of late 1999's prestige pictures, many of which are
hot Academy Award contenders, are, at least tangentially, based on
true stories. These include ``Angela's Ashes,'' ``Anna and the
King,'' ``Boys Don't Cry,'' ``Cradle Will Rock,'' ``Girl,
Interrupted,'' ``The Hurricane,'' ``The Insider,'' the
aforementioned ``Moon,'' ``Music of the Heart'' and
``Topsy-Turvy.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Carrey may have cracked a great postmodern joke in the
late Kaufman's reality-crunching style, some real people who are
depicted in the acclaimed movies aren't laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Primary among these still-breathing individuals are certain
staff members _ including on-air superstar Mike Wallace, of CBS'
venerable ``60 Minutes'' newsmagazine _ who detest their portrayals
in ``The Insider,'' Michael Mann's expose that won the L.A. Film
Critics Association best picture and four other awards (including
one for Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Wallace).
</P>
<P>
   On the far other end of the contemporary American power
spectrum, a young, working-class Nebraska woman named Lana Tisdel
has tried to take legal action against the makers and distributor
of ``Boys Don't Cry'' for taking liberties with the facts
surrounding her romance with another young woman who pretended she
was a boy.
</P>
<P>
   Chloe Sevigny's portrayal of Tisdel in the film has been widely
praised for its complexity and sensitivity, and it has also won
critics groups' awards. But Tisdel has long claimed that she never
knew the late Brandon Teena was actually a woman, and she certainly
wasn't anywhere near the scene of Teena's brutal murder. But the
film depicts both aspects of the story otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   And while Denzel Washington's portrayal of the boxer Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter just won him a Golden Globe Award and,
consequently, leads the Oscar race for best actor, the film's
narrative of Carter's decades-long struggle to overturn convictions
for murders he did not commit has been attacked for exaggerating,
oversimplifying, and misinterpreting facts and figures in the case.
Critics include New York Times reporter Selwyn Raab, who covered
Carter's trials, and Lewis M. Steel, a civil-rights attorney who
was a member of the defense team for Carter and his co-defendant,
John Artis. For their parts, the makers of ``Hurricane,'' including
director Norman Jewison and co-writer/producer Armyan Bernstein,
have taken out ads in Hollywood trade papers and set up a Web site
to refute Raab's points.
</P>
<P>
   While complaints have been lodged against some of the other
films mentioned _ various historians dislike the broad swipes
``Cradle'' takes at 1930s culture and politics, and the Thai
government has banned ``Anna,'' as it has previous incarnations of
the 19th-century ``King and I'' story _ the factor that unites the
most controversial movies is that they all involve people who are
still alive. And even though living people depicted in ``Ashes,''
``Moon'' and ``Girl'' appear to accept and even praise those films,
their creators readily admit that they changed the true accounts,
too, for dramatic purposes.
</P>
<P>
   That and close variations on the artistic-license defense have
always been justifications for this kind of factual
sleight-of-hand, and they remain so to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubin's story didn't happen as simply as we show it in the
film, obviously, because we didn't have a lot of time,''
``Hurricane's'' Washington readily admits, ``but I told Rubin that
I wasn't going to try to imitate him, because I think that this
story is bigger than him and me. It is, to me, a story about
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to render objective reality into a drama is a very
arduous, time-consuming process,'' adds Mann, who co-wrote ``The
Insider's'' script with ``Forrest Gump'' Oscar winner Eric Roth.
``And this was a tough story to tell because a lot of people in it
are alive, the companies are still there, and it's a drama, not a
documentary. I found that exciting, but it meant that you had to be
relatively truthful about what you were doing. But the objective
was to keep the film a tense experience for 2 1/2 hours, into which
we were compressing a couple of years. I believe Eric Roth and
myself handled ourselves responsibly; but in that sense, I can
understand why people got uncomfortable. I mean, I couldn't imagine
myself going to see a film about myself _ I wouldn't want to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, outside of a pure, idolizing hagiography, who would? But
if Hollywood people _ who as a group are probably the most vocal
critics of exaggerated, oversimplified or just plain made-up
stories about themselves in tabloid and other media _ rationalize
falsified takes of others when it suits their creative or
professional interests, aren't they being hypocritical?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, since well before the first motion picture frame
passed through a gate, dramatists have put a higher premium on
narrative convenience than the documented truth. And it seems
likely that their audiences _ whether in ancient Greece or
Shakespeare's England, in a 1930s movie palace showing ``The
Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex'' or a 1990s multiplex
screening of Oliver Stone's delirious ``JFK.''
</P>
<P>
   But when stories as complicated as ``Insider'' or as complex as
``Boys'' reach the screen today, members of our post-literate,
misinformation-drenched and attention-span-limited culture aren't
necessarily going to seek out documented accounts of the same
events. And that can leave wrong impressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see these movies based on fact, and they don't have any
other point of reference for these stories,'' says David Everitt,
whose new book ``For Reel,'' co-written with Harold Schechter,
outlines the true, dramatically different stories behind dozens of
classic films, including such Oscar winners as ``The Bridge on the
River Kwai'' and ``The English Patient.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if they're reading definitive, non-fiction
treatments of these stories and have a greater understanding. They
come away from the movie thinking they know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   And that can impact lives that are still being lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anybody really cares what I think as an
attorney, but certainly it could be very damaging to a private
individual when license is taken,'' adds Tisdel's lawyer Charles
Coate. ``On the (`Boys Don't Cry') Web site, there are statements
from the filmmaker to the effect that the film is emotionally true.
But emotionally true, as opposed to factually true, are two
entirely different things under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But with their critical acclaim and growing collection of awards
and nominations, it is understandable that filmmakers might
consider emotionally true as desirable an effect as it's creatively
possible to achieve. Still, when the unvarnished truth of a story
is as dramatic and intriguing as a fictionalized narrative,
wouldn't filmmakers be aiding their own dramatic causes by sticking
closer to real events?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you wonder if producers and directors underestimate
the ability of audiences to absorb a little more complexity,''
Everitt says. ``Personally, when I find that a movie has
oversimplified things or made them too one-sided, I feel a little
cheated, because it's not giving me and the other filmgoers enough
credit to be able to handle the ambiguity and reality of life.'' &QL;

WORKPLACE: WHEN BUTTONED-DOWN MEETS BUTTONLESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The negotiation was one part corporate diplomacy and
one part Dilbert.
</P>
<P>
   The young executives of methodfive Inc., a Web design firm, were
planning a Halloween party in their loft-like headquarters in
Greenwich Village. The partners of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the
giant accounting and consulting firm that had recently bought a
stake in methodfive, couldn't decide whether they should wear
costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Donning disguises would make them seem hip, the partners
thought. But they worried that they also might end up looking silly
in front of clients who would be at the party. So they vacillated.
``One day, they would be wearing costumes; the next day they
wouldn't be wearing costumes,'' said Alaina Yoakum, methodfive's
marketing manager, who had frequent conversations with a public
relations executive at Pricewaterhouse about the party.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they decided that the most senior partner coming to
the party would wear a costume so long as methodfive's chief
executive did, too. Somehow, though, Andrew Zimmerman, the partner,
got a garbled message and came in a suit, while Adeo Ressi, the
executive, came as Obi-Wan Kenobi, light saber and all.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman could do little but try to laugh off the mix-up and
rescue himself by joking in a speech to his audience _ including
Austin Powers, a werewolf and a sack of potatoes _ that he was
really a consultant who had come dressed as an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   The Halloween party was more than just an amusing turn in the
cultural acclimation taking place since the button-down
Pricewaterhouse bought a 12 percent stake in the cutting-edge
methodfive eight months ago. It was also a stark illustration of
the communications gap that more and more workplaces are
experiencing as bricks-and-mortar behemoths team up with Web
companies. America Online's plan to acquire Time Warner is only the
grandest of such partnerships. These ``clicks and bricks''
alliances give established companies, many of which have failed to
figure out the Internet, an immediate entry to the online world,
and they give dot-com ventures a scale that might otherwise take
decades to build.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for the methodfive-Pricewaterhouse deal was
similar. Methodfive would quickly gain a foothold with hundreds of
Pricewaterhouse clients around the world (as well as an infusion of
cash). Pricewaterhouse would add sparkle to its enormous but staid
information-technology consulting practice, contending that it,
too, could tap the minds of creative twentysomethings who truly
understood the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, however, employees of both companies
realized that the strategic vision was the easy part. Melding the
two workplaces would be the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Pricewaterhouse, the result of a multibillion-dollar merger,
employs 150,000 people in 150 countries. Its consultants zip in and
out of airports, offering executives advice about ``adding value.''
The top consultant holds an M.B.A. from the Wharton School at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Methodfive opened its doors in 1996, the result of an idea by
Ressi, who was then a 23-year-old dropout from the University of
Pennsylvania's undergraduate program and had already sold one
Internet start-up. Methodfive employs 80 people, most of them in a
10th-floor office lighted as much by the glow of computer screens
as by dim bulbs overhead. Elsewhere in the building are a discount
rug store and a nutrition newsletter. When boredom strikes,
methodfive's employees try to throw a stuffed dog into a trash can
from across the office.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ressi who received a call from Zimmerman last summer. The
two had lunch and hit it off; before long, they had agreed on the
broad outlines of a deal. Then came the first lesson in what it is
like to work with an enormous company. Pricewaterhouse said it had
to study the proposed agreement to make sure it did not violate
Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Throughout the summer,
methodfive added clients, hired new workers and waited for word
from Zimmerman. ``That is not Internet speed,'' Ressi said of the
delay.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but he found the decision-making machinery at
Pricewaterhouse difficult to fathom. ``You think: `This dude is in
charge. I speak to him. It gets done.' That's not really true at
PWC,'' he said. ``One guy has three or four different bosses.''
</P>
<P>
   To find their way, methodfive's workers have set up an internal
public-relations group to treat Pricewaterhouse as a potential
client to which it must sell itself. Ressi said he had traveled to
Pricewaterhouse offices around the world to ``evangelize.'' Ms.
Yoakum, the marketing manager, spends almost one day a week talking
up methodfive to Pricewaterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Pricewaterhouse's consultants do not dispute the methodfive
workers' description of the cultural divide. The differences in
both style and substance, they say, are why Pricewaterhouse
invested in methodfive. ``We need to make sure we protect their
brand and not pull it too close to us and turn it into oatmeal,''
said Michael G. Macesich, a Pricewaterhouse partner.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Wymbs, one of three Pricewaterhouse consultants on a
yearlong loan to methodfive, got a quick taste of culture shock
shortly after arriving in December. Sitting with two methodfive
employees at an impromptu meeting, he began talking about ``value
chains'' and ``core competencies,'' he said. Their reaction?
``Blank stares.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from a large organization, you get embodied with
consultant-speak,'' Wymbs said. ``Being here made me take a step
back and say, `I can eliminate this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not everything has worked out, to be sure. Several employees who
didn't like the idea of linking up with a consulting giant have
left, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But the remaining employees said they saw the benefits of
alliance. Working with Pricewaterhouse has taught them to attack
problems more systematically and to be tougher negotiators with
clients, they said. They have even begun showing up a little
earlier in the morning, some as early as 9. ``A year ago, no one
was in the office at 9,''` Ressi said. ``Not a soul.''

 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week this column was devoted to the impertinence of the
relative ease with which editors and publishers take a flier on a
writer they never heard of, the work being thought of as new and
fresh, perhaps different from anything they ever read before.
Certainly everyone interested in books is aware of that big first
novel, much heralded by the literary criers.
</P>
<P>
   But experience acquaints us with the reality that most often the
real make-or-break book in a novelist's career is not the first
novel but the second. After all, the second novel has to meet the
challenge of expectations. And this is particularly so if the
writer has not succumbed to a sort of fatigue in thinking that
makes the second book almost a duplicate of the first. So while
publishers obviously value consistency, a novelist's career depends
on showing that the first promising book was not a fluke; further,
that the precept held by some critics that writers have only one
book in them is not true for many novelists.
</P>
<P>
   Risk should be the almost indispensable challenge for the second
novel, daring in that the author reaches beyond the first story
into something uncharted and different. Not always easy to do.
There's generally little pressure on a first novel. It is usually
written in seclusion, often without a contract. The second novel is
attached to a contract and an advance. An editor, a publisher and
an agent are nearby; there's an awareness of the expectations of
readers and booksellers.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Galassi, the publisher and editor at Farrar, Straus &AMP;
Giroux, explained it this way: ``People get it into their minds
what a person has been writing about and have all sorts of ideas
about what the new novel should be or shouldn't be, and the author
may have other ideas. It's relatively easy to publish someone new,
harder the second time. But I don't believe that most authors have
only one book in them, and that's the divide where a career gets
tested. The second novel is another mountain to climb. It shouldn't
be the first novel again with more autobiographical material in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The publishing imperative with a novelist is to build a career,
not just make a quick hit with a single book. That means risk and
change. For instance, Riverhead last year published the second
novel written by Chang-rae Lee, a Korean-American. The critically
acclaimed novel, ``A Gesture Life,'' told the tale of a 60-year-old
Japanese immigrant living in a New York suburb. It had a first
printing of 30,000 copies, and more than 50,000 are in print. The
author's first novel, ``Native Speaker,'' was about the
assimilation of a Korean-American.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Spiegel, editorial co-director of Riverhead, said: ``I
think there should be awards for second novels. If a second novel
succeeds, you know you have the real thing. What we are looking for
in a first novel is talent, as much as a story. You can't just keep
inventing novelists. As a publisher, you need writers you are going
to have a long time. You can't tell from a first novel usually.''
</P>
<P>
   Riverhead is also publishing Alex Garland's second novel, ``The
Tesseract,'' totally different from his first, ``The Beach,'' a
mystery adventure that has been made into a movie with Leonardo
DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   Risk taker or not, the publisher and the writer have become, in
some ways, prisoners of the computer and its numbers. Nearly every
bookstore knows from its computer how many copies of an author's
last work it sold. So if a store ordered 100 copies of a first
novel and sold only 10, then 10 or so copies is what the store will
order for the second novel. Sandra Dijkstra, an agent, said:
``Publishers say the numbers are in the computer, and if the
numbers aren't impressive, it's hard to get your writer a good
offer. The problem is if you paint by the numbers, you get a
painting that looks like it was a number painting.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Irwyn Applebaum, publisher of the Bantam Dell group of
Random House, says there's a tendency to hide behind the notion
that everyone has computer printouts of sales. While that has to be
considered when buying a second novel, he said, ``we are in the
risk business.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easier, he said, to take a chance on someone new than an
author with a modest track record. But he added: ``If you really
think the author is talented and terrific or is a promising writer,
then you have to invest in the writer and the talent. Sometimes you
have to scale back a bit. But one of the things you come to
appreciate is the amazing thing that a writer could write a good
first novel at all. Then to come back and expect a writer to write
a good second one. In the end you just have to find the the writers
who want to write that book because they wanted to, for no other
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   How do the writers look upon this slippery second-book slope.
Shay Youngblood said that her first novel, ``Soul Kiss''
(Riverhead), ``came out very quietly, but my second'' _ ``Black
Girl in Paris,'' also from Riverhead _ ``was quite thrilling. I
felt I jumped off the bridge the first time and was already in
midair, so why not keep going? I love the rush, and I don't mind
the pressure. I thought the worst thing to do would be to sit there
like a lump.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Reich, whose first novel, ``Numbered Account,'' a
financial thriller published by Delacorte, made the best-seller
list, said he choose to write a different kind of thriller, ``The
Runner,'' an espionage novel set in postwar Germany, for his second
novel. ``I wanted to write something that impassioned me, even
though some people wanted me to do another financial novel. The fun
of writing is learning something new.''
</P>
<P>
   So how important is the second novel?
</P>
<P>
   Well, David Guterson found it could be not only momentous but
heartbreaking. His first novel, ``Snow Falling on Cedars''
(Harcourt Brace) was a colossal best seller. His second, ``East of
the Mountain,'' was a stunning disappointment to booksellers.
</P>
<P>
   The reverse was true for John Grisham. His first novel, ``A Time
to Kill'' (Wynwood, 1989), was a flop. It sold only 5,000 copies
when it was first published, and Grisham bought 1,000 of them. His
second novel, ``The Firm'' (Doubleday), was his breakout book,
creating the Grisham we now expect. More than 12 million copies are
in print in the United States. After its success, readers took a
second look at ``A Time to Kill.'' It took off. There are now 8.6
million copies in paperback.

TICKETMASTER TO PERMIT PRINTING OF TICKETS AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a plan that at first blush sounds like a scalper's
dream, Ticketmaster-Online CitySearch Inc. said on Monday that
starting in April, it would allow customers to print tickets to
events directly from their computer printers.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Stockham, executive vice president of Ticketmaster-Online
CitySearch, said consumers would need no additional software or
hardware for the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they need is a printer with 300 dpi or better,'' Stockham
said.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution of 300 dpi, or dots-per-inch, is common to all but
the very oldest dot-matrix printers, he said. The more dots a
printer can squeeze into an inch, the less jagged and more readable
are printed text and graphics. Laser printers and ink-jet printers
typically have resolutions of 600 dpi or more, but none have less
than 300.
</P>
<P>
   And scalpers need not salivate. Stockham said the tickets, which
will print out on a standard-size sheet of paper, would include a
bar code to insure that only one person would occupy a given seat.
Once that ticket was scanned at the gate, no one with a ticket
bearing the same bar code would be allowed to enter.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster said the system would spare consumers delivery
charges and give them a respite from lines at will-call windows. In
addition, customers will receive coupons for local restaurants or
parking, as well as directions to the event.
</P>
<P>
   Stockham said that events wishing to accept the tickets will
have to be equipped with bar-code scanners _ machines that are not
yet in use even at all large arenas. The company has not yet
determined the extent to which it would help venues pay for such
equipment, Stockham said. He said he did not know what percentage
of Ticketmaster affiliates already had bar-code scanners.
</P>
<P>
   But David Card, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, an
Internet consulting firm, said venues ``won't put in bar-code
readers unless Ticketmaster funds them or a lot of people want to
do it, and I just don't see a lot of people wanting to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever pays for them, Stockham said the bar-code scanners would
``not require a massive incremental capital investment,'' since
they cost about $100 each, and the ticket databases they would
integrate with are already in place at each venue.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, the new system might play to the advantage
of smaller venues that would require only one or two scanners,
``but there are a lot of incentives for Madison Square Garden to do
it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People do get nervous about not having the physical tickets,
as with electronic tickets for airlines, but that's a hump people
are getting over,'' Card said. ``It'll be useful for kids, or
people with no ID's or credit cards'' who cannot pick up tickets at
the will-call window, Card added, ``and it might help me avoid the
will-call window, but that's not a huge deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockham declined to forecast what revenue might be realized
from offering discounts to places like hotels, restaurants and
parking lots.

   CUBAN-BOY (Miami) _ The grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez arrived
Wednesday for the government-ordered meeting with the 6-year-old
Cuban boy they have not seen in more than two months. (Summary from
wires) By Peter T. Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-INTERNET (Beijing) _ The Chinese government on Wednesday
issued stern new regulations intended to control and restrict the
release of sensitive information on the Internet, underscoring the
government's love-hate relationship with cyberspace in a country
where the number of Internet users is growing exponentially. The
new rules, which were published in Wednesday's issue of the
Communist Party's People's Daily, are specifically intended to
govern the posting and dissemination of ``state secrets,'' a term
that is used broadly by the Chinese government and is vaguely
defined. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   SYRIA-BUSINESS (Damascus, Syria) _ They have luxury cars,
marble-floored offices, satellite dishes, tailored suits and
high-end computers. But young Syrian entrepreneurs, anxious to
catch up with their contemporaries in other Arab countries, are
feeling distinctly bankrupt. On the horizon, they can see the
outlines of a new world, one in which Syria's inefficient and
inward-looking producers will have to compete in a newly energized
Middle East free of trade barriers. And while an end to the
52-year-old state of war between Syria and Israel is also in sight,
with its promise of access to Western markets and investment, many
businessmen here fear they will not be able to reap any of the
economic dividends of peace. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-NY (New York) _ As Al Gore prepares to return to New York
for a second primary, on March 7, this time as the vice president
of the United States and the favorite to be his party's
presidential nominee, he is, in many ways, a very different
candidate from the one whose campaign collapsed on the steps of
Mayor Edward Koch's City Hall in 1988. And there is probably no
better place to chart that evolution than in this same state that
provided Gore with a brutal lesson in presidential politics that he
and his friends remember bitterly to this day. By Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   COKE-CUTBACK (Undated) _ Trying to shore up its slumping
profits, Coca-Cola Co. said Wednesday that it would cut 6,000 jobs,
write down certain assets abroad and take a $1.6 billion charge
against this year's earnings _ all part of making itself into a
company focused more exclusively on marketing. It is the largest
restructuring in the history of the company, and was especially
unusual given Coca-Cola's traditional optimism about selling ever
more of its products. By Constance L. Hays.

`THE CUP' RUNNETH OVER WITH EXILED TALENT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Friday, Jan. 28. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
 
 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've got to give Khyentse Norbu credit for being a first, if
not exactly an original. His easy-to-like film ``The Cup'' is the
first feature made in the tiny Himalayan nation of Bhutan, and it
has got to be the first directed by a big-time Buddhist lama.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, as well, this is the first film to examine the amusing
non-conflict that apparently grips exiled Tibetan monks whenever
World Cup soccer hits the airwaves. Chant or cheer _ is there a
predicament here? Well, sort of, but it's not that big an issue.
Just something that fits snugly in the tradition of mischievous
schoolboy comedies that can be found the world over, but arguably
reached its warm, observant apex in the work of Japan's Yasujiro
Ozu and India's Satyajit Ray, two of Norbu's acknowledged
influences.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the actors are refugee monks, too, including the
father-and-son leads, Orgyen Tobgyal and Jamyang Lodro. Tobgyal's
Geko is in charge of discipline at an exile monastery, and he has a
hard time keeping the young novices' minds on prayer, meditation
and the like when the world's distractions, as represented by
Indians with satellite dishes, are so corruptibly nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Lodro's 13-year-old Orgyen leads a small, fervid cell of
football (soccer) fans within the junior ranks who will stop at
nothing to catch the latest game from Paris, which is usually
broadcast well past the hour when sacred hearts should be asleep.
</P>
<P>
   A tough, obsessive runt with James Cagney charisma, Orgyen is
always getting his buddies, including two new arrivals who've just
escaped the Chinese communist regime back home, in Dutch.
Meanwhile, Geko, who isn't quite as doctrinaire as the kids
imagine, tries to explain the concept of competitive sports to the
elderly, melancholy Abbot (Lama Chonjo, who in real life runs the
monastery where ``The Cup'' was filmed).
</P>
<P>
   As you might imagine, these mild culture clashes produce lots of
light, behavioral humor. Of course, Norbu knows better than Western
filmmakers of late do that Buddhist holy men are people, too, and
``The Cup's'' greatest value lies in its demystifying
acknowledgment of these presumed saints' capacities for crankiness,
self-interest, lust and roughhouse. The resourceful kids, it hardly
needs mentioning, are adorable _ shaved heads and all.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the age spectrum, a crusty old prophet, who
complains that people only want to hear good predictions, is
described by all as smelly and is evidently played by some wizened
guy who had never washed his hair before the movie makes him.
Incredibly, all of the overwhelmingly amateur actors register
credible, engaging performances. That's attributed in large part to
the Tibetans' exceptional concentration, forged in extended group
meditations _ which the film shows as rife with note-passing,
nodding off and irrepressible prankishness.
</P>
<P>
   It's all too cute, in other words, but you've gotta love ``The
Cup'' just the same. Go monks. &QL;

CAR DEALERS LOOK TO LAWMAKERS FOR PROTECTION FROM INTERNET 
SELLERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Internet companies that sell cars directly to
consumers are encountering stiff opposition from auto dealers, who
are using their influence in state legislatures and with state
regulators to protect their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Car dealers, meeting here at their annual convention, are
worried that they are being undercut or bypassed entirely by the
new services. They also are afraid that automakers might sell cars
on the Internet themselves or through the new Internet services. So
the dealers have begun pushing restrictive laws through state
legislatures to prevent this and have encouraged state regulators
to crack down.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators say that the only complaints they have been
receiving about the services have been from dealers, not consumers.
And consumer advocates say that extra competition will be good for
customers, even though there is mixed evidence on whether consumers
save money buying cars online.
</P>
<P>
   Because of state franchise laws and manufacturers' policies,
Internet services must buy cars from dealers, not directly from
manufacturers. Paying two markups, one for the dealer and one for
the Internet company, is a burden on consumers that does not exist
for many other forms of electronic commerce. This erodes any price
advantage the Internet companies may have.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has left the regulation of auto retailing
to the states, leaving potential gaps in regulation for deals that
cross state lines, said state regulators from across the nation,
who convened at a hotel near the dealers' convention for meetings
over the last four days. ``You could buy a car from a Mississippi
dealer who has his Web site in Iowa and delivers a car in Idaho _
who has jurisdiction?'' asked T. Rex Green, Idaho's supervisor of
dealer investigations. ``I can't justify to my taxpayers running
all the way to Mississippi to chase someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Dealers have already used their political muscle over the last
12 months to persuade lawmakers in nine states to tighten state
franchise laws, making it virtually impossible for manufacturers to
sell cars except through franchised dealers. Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination,
signed the toughest such law in the nation last year, and the Texas
Department of Transportation has become the nation's leader in
cracking down on Internet commerce involving cars. Many more states
are expected to consider legislation pushed by dealer groups this
year, with one bill already introduced last week in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   State motor vehicle regulators, acting partly at the prompting
of dealers but also because of concern that businesses could use
the Internet to commit fraud, have become alarmed that Internet
companies may be violating longstanding laws in most states that
require anyone selling a new car or truck to be licensed and have a
franchise relationship with a manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators said that they believed the newest services,
those which actually deliver cars to customers' homes, may violate
laws intended to protect dealers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Top regulators from Wisconsin and Texas said that they had just
ordered CarsDirect.com, an Internet direct seller, to halt
operations in their state. Regulators from Virginia, Kentucky,
Nebraska and Louisiana said that they doubted CarsDirect.com and
similar companies complied with their states' laws; Louisiana
regulators said that they were ``on the verge'' of taking action on
the issue, although they refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Barbour, a spokeswoman for CarsDirect.com, said that the
company was still doing business in every state except Texas and
Arkansas, where the company acknowledges regulatory restrictions.
She declined to comment on any litigation and regulatory complaints
pending against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in Texas also used that state's tough new law in
November to order the Ford Motor Co. to stop using its Internet
site to sell used cars in Houston. Ford has complied, but is suing
the state to reverse the order.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, dozens of Internet companies have
generated sales leads for car dealers, providing abundant
information to consumers about what is available and then sending
the customer to a dealer to close the sale. But a few companies,
led by CarsDirect.com, have recently become car-buying services,
taking prepaid orders from customers, buying cars from nearby
dealers and delivering them to customers' homes on flat-bed trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators reached a consensus here that a model law should
be drafted for each state to regulate car sales over the Internet,
although the details of the legislation have not been agreed upon.
Lobbyists from most state dealer associations attended Friday's
meeting and supported the drafting of such a law.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen regulators said in separate interviews that while
complaints about the new services had been coming from dealers, not
consumers, they believed that consumers could someday be hurt by
insufficient regulation of the new companies. State regulators have
the authority to enforce lemon laws, requiring manufacturers to
take back seriously defective cars, and to fine or even revoke the
licenses of dealers in their states who commit certain frauds, such
as charging a buyer for options that are not actually on a car.
</P>
<P>
   Even a few of the older Internet companies that sell referrals
to dealers are running into regulatory problems. Samuel Hedgpeth,
president and chief operating officer of Autoweb.com, said that
current state laws and regulations favored dealers. Autoweb
unsuccessfully challenged a rule in Texas, for example, that
requires companies to charge a fixed, monthly fee to dealers for
supplying them with sales leads, instead of selling each referral
separately.
</P>
<P>
   The law, Hedgpeth complained, was the equivalent of telling an
ice cream vendor that ``you have to charge the same whether it's
one scoop, two scoops or three scoops.''
</P>
<P>
   The enforcement efforts and tougher franchise laws have been
mainly in the South and Midwest, where dealers' political influence
is particularly strong. Regulators and legislatures in the
Northeast and West have done little so far to address the Internet
car-buying services, with the exception of Connecticut, where the
legislature tightened rules last year against manufacturers'
ownership of dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the bottom line in the current squabble is that
cars are unlikely to get much cheaper anytime soon. Fearful of
angering their dealers and increasingly constrained by state
regulations, domestic and foreign auto makers alike have said in
recent weeks that they have no plans to sell cars directly to the
public through the Internet, nor do they even plan to sell directly
to the Internet companies. Many dealers now sell several brands of
cars, and sometimes retaliate against automakers that offend them
by shifting their energy and advertising spending to a different
brand.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors ran into this problem last year, when it
announced a plan to buy and operate up to 10 percent of its
dealerships, using them partly for Internet sales, only to retreat
quickly in the face of dealers' opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Roy S. Roberts, GM's group vice president for North American
sales and marketing, said here on Sunday that the company now
planned to work so closely with dealers that consumers would not
feel a need for independent Internet services. What the services
``are trying to do is take our customers, and they can only do that
if we don't come together,'' Roberts said. ``We can cut them out.''
</P>
<P>
   GM and other automakers are planning to greatly increase the
number of cars they build to order. This would diminish the need
for dealers to hold huge inventories of cars, one of their main
functions in the current market. Once most cars are custom-built,
customers would be able to order them directly over the Internet.
Dealers are fighting now to make sure that they will handle those
orders _ and that their role is not supplanted by independent
Internet companies, or by the automakers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   According to J.D. Power &AMP; Associates, the auto consulting firm,
nearly half of all new car buyers now use the Internet for
research, and they tend to be relatively affluent. But only 2.7
percent use an Internet buying service, mostly services which send
sales leads to dealerships. The firm estimates that 10,000 or so
cars, worth about $250 million, were sold online last year, almost
all in the last few months, with the numbers rising rapidly with
each passing month.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates once supported auto franchise laws. The laws
have prevented manufacturers from retaliating against dealers that
sell cars for less than the suggested retail price. The laws also
discourage unscrupulous, unlicensed business people from pocketing
people's money and not delivering a car, which was a problem before
the 1950s, when many franchise laws were enacted.
</P>
<P>
   But now consumer groups worry that the laws are being amended in
ways that hurt customers. ``We do have some serious concerns right
now that dealers are using old franchise laws to inhibit new and
creative ways to sell cars, and most of these new and creative ways
are in consumers' interest,'' said Jack Gillis, an auto retailing
expert at the Consumer Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in this legal battle are enormous. Much of the retail
business now being transacted on the Internet involves fairly
inexpensive goods, like $40 shirts or $20 books; direct sales to
consumers over the Internet are estimated at $10 billion to $15
billion last year. Moving even a small part of the nation's $700
billion a year in new and used automobile sales onto the Internet
would greatly expand the scale and economic importance of
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But automakers and entrepreneurs alike have found that moving
car sales online is not easily done because of the regulatory
issues and the political power of the dealers. ``Everybody with a
PC and a background in Palo Alto thinks they're going to
revolutionize the auto industry and retire at 27 with a 180-foot
yacht,'' said James Holden, the president of DaimlerChrysler AG's
Chrysler Group. ``They don't have a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   One company, CarOrder.com, is trying to get around the
regulations by buying dozens of tiny, rural dealerships in large
states. The company hopes to use the dealerships to order huge
numbers of cars directly from manufacturers for sale over the
Internet. But CarOrder has not yet reached any agreements with
manufacturers, which usually limit shipments to dealerships based
on the size of the communities they serve.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Chodos, a financial consultant in Greenwich, Conn., who
bought a Toyota 4Runner sport utility vehicle that was delivered to
his home on Sunday by CarOrder.com, said that buying over the
Internet was much easier than going to a dealership. He has had a
couple of problems, though. The Toyota arrived with an empty gas
tank, while his order last November for a Lexus LS 400 sedan still
has not been filled.
</P>
<P>
   Chodos nonetheless said that he thought Internet companies
should be able to buy cars straight from manufacturers and charge
even lower prices, adding, ``I'd love to see the day when these
Internet companies can go direct, and the dealerships stick to
service.''

ZAPRUDER FAMILY DONATES JFK ASSASSINATION FILM TO DALLAS MUSEUM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A first-generation copy of the amateur home movie that
recorded the assassination of President John F. Kennedy has found a
permanent home in Dallas, just yards from where the historic film
was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Sixth Floor Museum on Dealey Plaza announced
Wednesday that the children and grandchildren of Abraham Zapruder
have donated the 26-second, 8mm film clip to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Museum Chairman Andy Sterns termed it ``the most important and
most generous gift the museum has ever received.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the film are 1,900 other items in the family's
collection, including transparencies and glossy color prints made
from the individual frames of the film.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has the original film stored in the
National Archives and last year was ordered to pay the family $16
million for it.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the Sixth Floor Museum's coup Wednesday, Sterns
said, ``We ... will provide public access to the Zapruder
collection while assuring that the events it depicts are treated
with a dignity that avoids exploitation.''
</P>
<P>
   No members of the Zapruder family were present, but Stern read a
message that was provided by their attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since November 22, 1963,'' the statement said, ``our guiding
principle has been to strike a balance between respect for the
sensitive nature of the film's images and an appropriate response
to the public's demand for access to the film. We have selected the
Sixth Floor Museum for this gift because we are confident that
those responsible for its administration share our values.''
</P>
<P>
   The private, non-profit museum opened 11 years ago on the sixth
floor of the former Texas Schoolbook Depository building, where
assassin Lee Harvey Oswald waited to ambush the president as his
motorcade passed through the plaza below.
</P>
<P>
   Zapruder, a dressmaker, was in the plaza with his Bell &AMP; Howell
home movie camera that day and captured the only moving images of
the assassination. Almost immediately afterward, three copies were
made. The original was turned over to Life Magazine and and
eventually made its way into government hands.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the copies were given to the Secret Service, but the
Zapruder family retained one copy, along with the copyright, which
generates fees for public use of its images.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, a dispute between the Zapruder heirs and the
government over compensation for the original film was resolved
when an arbitration panel ordered the government to pay the family
$16 million.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that decision, Jeff West, the executive director
of the museum, contacted Zapruder's son, Henry, and began
negotiations to acquire the first-generation copy that remained in
the family's possession. An agreement was signed in December.
</P>
<P>
   The museum not only got the film, but the copyright as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, this establishes us as the official
gatekeepers,'' said West, who brought the film to Dallas 10 days
ago and has stashed it in an undisclosed, climate-controlled
location. ``The museum will serve as steward of this remarkable
national treasure, ensuring that it is adequately protected.''
</P>
<P>
   The film has been copied to various formats _ 16 mm and 35 mm _
and most recently into digital form to make enhancement of the
images possible. After 37 years and untold screenings, is there
anything left to learn from it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' West said. ``Dick Stolley, who bought the
original rights for Life (magazine), says it proves whatever you
want it to prove. Who knows what processes it will go through in
the future? It used to be true that a Xerox copy could be no better
than the original. Now it's possible to improve on the original.
Who knows what future technology will tell us about those images.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it was genetic. My grandfather was the first professor of
neurosurgery in the world. My father was a neurosurgeon. And as a
kid, I was always taking things apart and putting them back
together. At 10, I made an adding machine out of cardboard, glue
and nuts and bolts.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in Hanover, N.H., and Dartmouth College made its
computer center available to middle-school students, so I learned
basic programming at 12. I was enthralled with computers.
</P>
<P>
   And then I made an incredible discovery: people were willing to
pay other people to write computer programs. It set in place my
future career.
</P>
<P>
   I was paid $5 to write programming at Dartmouth. I also had a
job as a teen-ager delivering flowers. It was awesome. I got to
drive a van, and I got to see the expressions of pure pleasure on
people's faces. I get that same sense of pleasure today when I see
people using products I've developed.
</P>
<P>
   I never had that angst of ``What am I going to do with my
life?'' I always knew I would go into engineering. Just last year,
I saw my high school science teacher. He still remembered the title
of my project my junior year: ``Ultra Micro-Miniature Thumb-Sized
Digital Calculator With a Novel Nematic Liquid Crystal for the
Display.'' I almost got it working. I still have it.
</P>
<P>
   My master's project at Stanford was a voice-controlled robotic
arm for quadriplegics, potentially to serve you a drink or brush
your teeth. I used software to link up a robot arm and a
voice-recognition system. It's an ongoing project at Stanford
today.
</P>
<P>
   After Stanford, I got a job as a consultant, saved $2,500 and
took three months off to drive around Europe with my girlfriend,
who is now my wife.
</P>
<P>
   I proposed to her on the northern tip of Scotland. It was 10
p.m. but still light out. We were sitting cross-legged in a field.
At the end of the field was a cliff and beyond the cliff was the
ocean. I was overcome by where we were.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the United States, some friends and I developed the
Macintosh mouse for Steve Jobs at Apple Computer. I'm one of four
patent holders on it. People ask me how much money I made. I say:
Take 400 million mice and multiply by my royalty of zero. We tried
to get a royalty, but Apple was too smart to give one to young
designers like us.
</P>
<P>
   A funny theme in my life is being introduced to important people
and spending hours with them without realizing who they are.
</P>
<P>
   I once asked a woman, ``So what do you do at your company?'' And
she replied, ``Well, since I'm the CEO, I guess I run it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another time I had hung out with a guy named Artie. Later on,
somebody asked me, ``What was it like spending all that time with
Arthur Rock,'' the famous venture capitalist? I said, ``Huh? You
mean Artie?''
</P>
<P>
   I have my shortcomings as a boss. I probably avoid confrontation
too much.
</P>
<P>
   My worst boss was a shouter. I once thought the only reason he
didn't make a Business Week list of the 10 Worst Bosses was that
the list didn't start at zero. He once screamed at me as we were
walking down a hallway that I was overpaid and underperforming.
There's no room in American business today for treating people that
way.

WITNESSES SAY THAI MILITARY EXECUTED 10 TO END HOSPITAL STANDOFF
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ A mood of triumph in Thailand after the
quick, clean end of a hostage standoff at a hospital was marred
Wednesday by questions over whether some of the 10 Burmese gunmen
had been executed after surrendering to security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Thai newspapers published accounts from witnesses who said some
of the hostage takers had been shot in the head on Tuesday after
being told to take off their clothes. One paper published a
photograph of four bodies in their underwear, all of whom appeared
to have been shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns were boosted by the fact that none of the hundreds
of patients and medical workers who had been held hostage for 22
hours in the town of Ratchaburi had been hit by gunfire, suggesting
the absence of any intense firefight.
</P>
<P>
   Officials strongly denied that any of the men had been executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A well-trained commando normally will shoot to kill,
especially with a head shot, because if hostage-takers with
dangerous weapons are not killed immediately they could still harm
hostages,'' said an army spokesman, Lt. Gen. Sanan Kajornklam. ``No
commando will target the body, because terrorists could be wearing
bulletproof vests.''
</P>
<P>
   Military officials said nine of the hostage takers were killed
immediately within the main hospital building. They said the tenth
attempted to escape but was gunned down on the hospital grounds
shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Thai military said it had resumed shelling the
hilltop base of the ethnic Karen rebel band, led by twin
12-year-old boys, that had staged the raid from across the border
with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, asked by reporters why not one of
the hostage-takers survived, said, ``The reason is easy. We shot
faster than they did.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If some Thai officials had died in this operation,
the questions would change to, `Why did we send our officials to
die?'''
</P>
<P>
   The Thai police have faced criticism in the past for summarily
executing people they arrest as criminals. This is not the first
time that there were no survivors in a confrontation with security
forces.
</P>
<P>
   When the 10 bodies were displayed to reporters Tuesday, all were
wrapped in white sheets knotted around the neck so that they looked
like faceless dolls. Bloodstains suggested that at least some had
been shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers reported Wednesday that all 10 were then buried
without further examination.
</P>
<P>
   The dawn attack by the security forces on the poorly organized
gunmen at the Ratchaburi Provincial Hospital, 75 miles west of
here, had been well prepared, according to the newspaper accounts.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 40 commandos infiltrated the hospital during the
night dressed as patients or medical workers. They hid weapons in a
kitchen and moved quietly among the hostages, telling them to turn
off their lights and lie on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpshooters and observers with two-way radios took up
positions on the perimeter. A crowd of reporters was moved away
from the scene with the ruse of a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
   At about 5:30 a.m., two percussion grenades were set off at one
corner of the compound, to create a diversion and signal the start
of the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the hostages cried,'' according to an unidentified
woman quoted in the Bangkok Post. ``The rebels did not return fire.
I thought they would just arrest the rebels because they had
surrendered.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted an unnamed hospital official who said she
looked out from a hiding place and saw the police holding rebels at
gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were shot in the head after they had been told to undress
and kneel down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nation, another English-language daily newspaper, quoted a
hostage named Decha Yoowong, 32, as saying he thought some of the
gunmen might have surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   As they crouched together, he said, ``the hostages asked them
not to put up any resistance, with some of them agreeing to that.''
The gunmen then walked into a hallway and it appeared that they
were preparing to give themselves up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commandos sprayed bullets into the room, shattering all
the windowpanes,'' he said. ``None of the hostages were hurt. None
of us saw any of the terrorists being shot because it was still
dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Like similar reports in other newspapers, however, these
accounts were displayed modestly on inside pages.
</P>
<P>
   More emblematic of the mood Wednesday was the comment of
Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart, which the Bangkok Post used
as a front page headline: ``They all deserved it since they've
brought much trauma and suffering to Thai people.''

 &HT;    AppleWorks suite 6.0 a major improvement
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At long last, Apple Computer is preparing to release a
vastly improved version of its AppleWorks suite of productivity
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Most of you will remember this program as ClarisWorks.
Regardless of its name, this is a great piece of software, and
Apple has made it even better, redesigning the program from the
bottom up.
</P>
<P>
   Like Microsoft Office, AppleWorks is a collection of integrated
applications. They include word processing, database, spreadsheet,
painting and page layout. In version 6.0, Apple has replaced the
communications module with one for making presentations.
</P>
<P>
   AppleWorks never was a powerhouse with advanced features
equaling those of Microsoft Office. But it has always been the
easiest program of its kind to learn and use. That hasn't changed
with version 6.
</P>
<P>
   What Apple has done, though, is add a lot of the power features
that are already in Office. Among them are an interactive outline
mode, a thesaurus, document password protection and seamless
integration with the Internet without the need for a Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   You can also draw tables within a document, auto-save your work
and tap in free to a Web database of more than 25,000 images and
150 templates. Images, video and sound clips and photos can be
dragged and dropped into any AppleWorks document.
</P>
<P>
   What you'll notice first about AppleWorks is the look. It has
been redesigned to take advantage of the improved graphic
capabilities of Apple's latest operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   The program now features a series of floating toolbars. They are
tabbed and feature sharply rendered icon representations of
documents, functions and images.
</P>
<P>
   The toolbars are highly customizable. You add or remove icons
through drag and drop. Make the icons big or small, and orient your
toolbars vertically or horizontally.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the toolbars are semi-transparent, letting you see
through them to documents underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Many users will appreciate the addition of drag-and-drop tables
in AppleWorks. Tables are added now by simply dragging an icon from
the toolbar to the document. Text automatically wraps around the
table.
</P>
<P>
   Writers will especially appreciate two new features. One is the
inclusion of a thesaurus, although it's not as good as the printed
version of Roget's. But then again, neither is Microsoft Word's
thesaurus.
</P>
<P>
   The other feature is an interactive outline tool, long one of
the best features of Word. With AppleWorks, you can now start
writing with an outline and expand that outline into a finished
document. Or you can do the reverse, start writing and then view
your work as a reorganizable outline.
</P>
<P>
   Not every new feature of AppleWorks has been described. This is
a big upgrade, and surely there'll be some bugs. But at first
glance it looks like a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Apple expects to release AppleWorks 6.0 in February for $79. The
program also will probably be included with most new Macs sold
after that date.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, check out Apple's Web presentation of
AppleWorks. You'll find it at www.apple
</P>
<P>
   .com/appleworks.

 &HT;    A smart way to target women
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you believe what you see on television, even the
most technophobic women have made peace with the Internet thanks to
a site called iVillage.com.
</P>
<P>
   A slew of TV commercials for the woman-oriented Web site feature
ordinary women telling heartwarming tales of how, thanks to
iVillage.com, they got advice about nutrition or learned about
computers or what to expect when they were expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, no Web site is going to solve all your work, family,
money and relationship problems, but the site's mix of articles,
community topics and shopping tips really is a good way for women
to get started on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The woman-only Web site is one of a growing handful that
honestly pay attention to what their readers are doing and
thinking, as rival Web site Oxygen put it in its ``smart talk for
smart women.'' Borrowing a page from Web magazine Salon, this new
generation of women's Web sites knows the women and teen-age girls
who visit their sites have IQs above room temperature. They also
know how to involve their readers, and that's an exciting and
welcome change from many content sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   IVillage.com is a mix of the conventional and the offbeat, with
a something-for-everyone approach that will probably bring a
variety of women to the site, just as the ads say.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's predictable, other times surprising. Tuesday
night's online chat with Hillary Rodham Clinton was a definite
coup, but iVillage really shines when it offers readers a chance to
comment on what they've read or voice their own opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The company began life on America Online, a place where talking
back and voicing opinions has always been an integral part of the
user experience. Clicking on iVillage's compilation of the 100
greatest books, the reader has no idea whether to expect a litany
of gothic novels or cookbooks. Happily, it's neither.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list is ``Gone With the Wind,'' followed by ``To
Kill a Mockingbird,'' ``A Prayer for Owen Meany'' and ``Atlas
Shrugged.'' The book list is cleverly linked to Amazon.com and
peppered with member comments about the books and how a novel has
influenced a particular reader.
</P>
<P>
   To get the most out of iVillage, go beyond the start page with
its run-of-the-mill tips on romance, kids and money and check out
the book club, careers and election 2000. For women who want to
sample what the Web has to offer without straying too far away from
the community and structure of AOL, this is a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   While iVillage has been around for a while, Oxygen
(www.oxygen.com) is a fairly new site from a powerful collection of
women executives, the most notable being Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen, which will also be a cable TV channel, combines the
traditional modes of online interactivity, such as chat and message
boards, with multimedia applications, such as video storytelling.
When users click on a story, a second browser window pops up and
the story is told through streaming video, a cutting-edge technique
not found on many Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Oxygen's users will probably be frustrated with the time
it takes for these ``video articles'' to load, but most of the
stories are worth the wait. It is a sign of the eventual merger of
TV and Internet technology that users are likely to see in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   If iVillage suffers a little from being too mainstream aiming
squarely at Mrs. America _ Oxygen scores points for targeting women
of all ages and offering a more offbeat selection of subjects.
Mothers who think and their daughters will appreciate Oxygen's mix
of articles and attitude. Users aren't just asked to post comments
but to submit whole stories on a variety of subjects. For example,
it incorporated the ``Girls On'' Web site into its ``family'' of
sites. ``Girls On'' lets teen-agers offer their own opinions on
film, movies, TV, books and a variety of other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen's reader contributions and iVillage's member comments
feel similar to the way women talk to each other face-to-face. Some
comments are thoughtful and witty, others are just silly, but their
authors all use the interactive medium of the Web to express their
ideas for an audience of peers.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these sites have a long way to go before they build the
reputations earned by sites like Salon and Slate, but those two
publications could take a lesson from the myriad opportunities
Oxygen and iVillage offer for reader input. They both make good use
of content and community that's missing in a lot of online
publications, especially those aimed at women. Online women's
magazines are a different kind of medium designed for a different
kind of woman _ one who likes to talk and not be talked down to.

RIVAL E-COMMERCE FIRMS PLAN $252 MILLION TAKEOVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Breakaway Solutions Inc. said it plans to acquire rival
e-commerce services firm Eggrock Partners for about $252 million in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would combine Boston-based Breakaway and Concord, Mass.
Eggrock, both of which provide software consultants, Web hosting
arrangements and other services to companies specializing in
business-to-business transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which still needs approval from the majority of
shareholders in closely-held Eggrock, would add 160 employees to
Breakaway's current headcount of about 350, and bring to 97 the
total number of Breakaway's customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a common vision between the two companies,'' said
Breakaway chief executive Gordon Brooks, who said the acquisition
would also quickly add to the number of his company's satellite
offices. Both Brooks and Eggrock chief executive Maureen
Ellenberger are former executives of Cambridge Technology Partners
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Ellenberger will become vicepresident at Breakaway; other
Eggrock executives Mike Mordas and Vijay Manwani will also join.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the trio will receive about 27 percent of the 3.63
million shares of common stock Breakaway plans to issue in exchange
for Eggrock.
</P>
<P>
   Another 20 percent of the shares will go to Battery Ventures,
the Wellesley, Mass. investment firm, which led a $10 million round
of financing in Eggrock last summer. The balance will be
distributed among Eggrock employees, Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Breakaway's closing price of $69 3/8 Wednesday, the
deal is worth about $252 million. When the deal is completed,
Eggrock holders will control about 12.6 percent of Breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will also help Breakaway continue an office expansion
with new facilities in Boca Raton and in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Eggrock lost money on revenue of about $12 million in 1999,
Brooks said. The aquisition is likely to add about 40 percent to
Breakaway's revenues in 2000, he said. Prior to the merger,
analysts expected Breakaway to report revenue of about $46 million
this year.

RATING SEVEN NEW FILMS AGAINST THE GREAT LITERATURE THAT INSPIRED
THEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Yes, definitely &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Book: ``Stuart Little,'' by E.B. White
</P>
<P>
   Changes: The film bears little resemblance to the book.
</P>
<P>
   Specifics: In book and film, the very human Mr. and Mrs.
Little's second son is a mouse named Stuart. He arrives without
explanation in the book; he's adopted in the film. From there, the
film really uses just one scene from the book _ Stuart
participating in a model boat race _ and that is radically
restructured. Just about everything else in the movie is original
material. In the children's novel, Stuart tracks down a bird
friend.
</P>
<P>
   If you loved the book, will you like the movie? Possibly,
because of the title character. Audiences don't seem to mind the
changes: The movie has ranked no lower than No. 3 at the box office
since its Dec. 17 release. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Book: ``The Green Mile,'' by Stephen King
</P>
<P>
   Changes: An entire subplot is altered; the film is faithful to
the main story line in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Specifics: In novel and film, Death Row guard Paul Edgecombe
recounts the story of convict John Coffey, who has strange healing
powers and may not be guilty of the killings for which he is
sentenced to be executed. This is substantially the focus of the
book, and the complete focus of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The book's subplot _ Edgecombe, now a very old man, tries to
write Coffey's story while confined to a nursing home _ is
eliminated in the film. (In the film the last ``''e'''' in
Edgecombe's last name also disappears.) King's original story had
Edgecombe trying to complete his tale while being bullied by a
nasty staffer. Screenwriter Frank Darabont excised this story line.
The movie holds up well without it.
</P>
<P>
   If you loved the book, will you like the movie? Some critics
attacked the movie as benignly racist, because Coffey is a large
black man who suffers for the sins of white people in 1930s
Louisiana. But readers who enjoyed King's six-part serial novel
will find the movie true to its allegorical spirit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Book: ``Girl, Interrupted,'' by Susanna Kaysen
</P>
<P>
   Changes: Incidental
</P>
<P>
   Specifics: In Kaysen's original autobiographical novel, several
psychiatric hospital inmates have equally substantial roles. In the
film version, one _ Lisa _ towers above the rest. Also, in the
film, hospital staffers are given more attention than they are in
the book. Many critics have noted that the movie bears as much
similarity to ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' as it does to
Kaysen's book.
</P>
<P>
   If you loved the book, will you like the movie? Possibly. Kaysen
has given the movie adaptation her blessing, and Winona Ryder is
well-cast in the lead role. Angelina Jolie's volatile performance
as Lisa gives the movie a big boost. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Book: ``The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,'' by Washington Irving
</P>
<P>
   Changes: Substantial
</P>
<P>
   Specifics: In the film version, Ichabod Crane is a constable in
New York instead of a country schoolteacher. He is summoned to
Sleepy Hollow to help solve a series of murders involving headless
corpses. This differs radically from Irving's original short story
about a legendary headless horseman.
</P>
<P>
   If you loved the book, will you like the movie? Probably not. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Book: ``The Cider House Rules,'' by John Irving
</P>
<P>
   Changes: Substantial, but the main thrust remains reasonably
faithful to the book.
</P>
<P>
   Specifics: John Irving, who wrote the original novel, also wrote
the screenplay. He notes in ``My Movie Business,'' a book he wrote
about the experience, that he wrote four screenplays adapting ``The
Cider House Rules'' for four directors until the final version made
it into production. The streamlined result reveals Irving as
somewhat of a rarity: An author who's his own toughest editor.
</P>
<P>
   Several major characters from the book are missing from the
film, including a tough young woman who carries a near-lifelong
torch for the protagonist. A romantic subplot in the novel is
elevated to near-focal status in the movie. Much of Irving's
original early story _ four failed adoptions of protagonist Homer
Wells; the childhood and professional background of Dr. Wilbur
Larch _ are pretty much missing from what we see onscreen. Although
the early story helps you understand the characters' motivations,
it's not missed unless you've read the book.
</P>
<P>
   If you loved the book, will you like the movie? Probably,
particularly because Irving is both author and screenwriter. Great
casting helps _ Tobey Maguire's mixture of intelligence and
innocence is perfect for Homer, and Michael Caine gives one of his
best performances as Dr. Larch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Book: ``Angela's Ashes,'' by Frank McCourt
</P>
<P>
   Changes: Few, mostly involving peripheral characters in the book
who are absent in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Specifics: Much of McCourt's Pulitzer Prize-winning
autobiography takes place in Limerick, Ireland. Because some places
mentioned have been bulldozed, and because civic leaders in
Limerick disliked the way ``Angela's Ashes'' presented the city,
most of the movie was filmed in Cork and Dublin. Though the
narrator sounds exactly like Frank McCourt, he isn't; actor Andrew
Bennett does the voice-over honors.
</P>
<P>
   If you loved the book, will you like the movie? Probably,
although much of the McCourt humor that worked in print is less
funny in the film, because the depictions of poverty and human
frailties are so explicit onscreen.

HARVARD TOPS MONEY-RAISING GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvard University has surpassed all expectations in its
record-breaking money-raising campaign, raking in $500 million more
than its five-year goal, Harvard officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's new total: $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In October the university announced it broke all records in
higher education philanthropy by collecting $2.3 billion in
donations from 1994 to 1999, or a staggering $1.25 million a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only has the campaign advanced the efforts of each
individual faculty and school, each library, and museum, but it has
given added momentum to crossdisciplinary and interfaculty
collaborations that are essential to our future,'' Harvard
President Neil L. Rudenstine wrote in a letter thanking the 174,378
donors who gave until the campaign ended Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Though the money demonstrates Harvard's stature among the
nation's universities, Harvard officials have not always been eager
to advertise their wealth. Being well-endowed doesn't always
reflect well on a university that charges students $34,350 a year
for tuition and competes with other institutions for faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's endowment already stands at more than $14.4 billion,
making it the world's second wealthiest not-for-profit institution
after the Roman Catholic Church. Despite its increasing wealth,
however, critics say the university hasn't spent enough on such
things as financial aid and undergraduate education.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the campaign's initial numbers in October,
officials took pains to note that the largest portion of the money
raised _ $230 million _ is going toward increasing financial aid to
undergraduate and graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   Money also will go to 90 professorships, with 25 of those slots
aimed at shrinking undergraduate class sizes. Another $65 million
is going to renovating undergraduate dormitories and $55 million to
modernize Widener Library. Other large gifts will go to a new
dining hall and student commons and as much as $200 million will be
spent on new interdisciplinary science programs for undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now far better equipped to meet the challenges of a
strikingly more `internationalized' world,'' Rudenstine said, ``and
to take advantage of the power of new information technologies.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 &HT;    Chat rooms with firepower
 &HT;    By Joe Stafford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After the massacre in Littleton last year,
investigators discovered that the two killers loved Doom, the
granddaddy of frenetic, kill-everything computer games. Often
played online, these are the games for which blood-spattered terms
such as fragfest and gibs were invented to describe the carnage.
Calls rang out to ban them, to stop the spread of the virtual
ultra-violence.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts think that type of game play is a dead end
anyway _ more and more spectacular environments in which to kill
and kill again, yawn _ and that the real future of online game play
is toward more complex social worlds that emphasize teamwork and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   I've played computer games for years, but I wanted to test that
theory from the inside, to enter these strange realms, these
fabulously realistic 3-D worlds, to play the games, meet the
players virtual-face to virtual-face, to dodge the flying shrapnel
and the acid arrows, to ask the questions and to coyly turn down
the sexual propositions.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention these are strange realms?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Holodeck, the brave new world, the chat room with
firepower. Where the future lies. Where the $10 monthly fees on
credit cards lie. Where your dreams and nightmares all come true,
but, more than anything, where you meet people, make friends and,
oh, yeah, kill them.
</P>
<P>
   None of these virtual worlds is a place I'd want my 8-year-old
daughter to venture. Everyone is a stranger, everyone is in
disguise, represented by a fantasy figure of their own choosing,
from futuristic missile-launching soldier to troll. These are
high-powered masquerades where anything can happen, with anonymity
fueling the worst in some people. Especially in first-person
shooters, played on unregulated private servers where anything
goes, the conversation can get primitive really fast.
</P>
<P>
   How would you explain how it works to an 8-year-old girl,
anyway? Well, it's like this. First you buy the game, choosing from
a huge variety of titles such as Warcraft, Rainbow Six, Quake,
Unreal, Tribes. You get the game home, remove the shrink wrap from
the CD, follow the directions and install the game on your
computer's hard drive. Then, hooked up via modem, you connect to a
distant computer over the Internet, sometimes for free, sometimes
for a small monthly fee. Other players connect to the same computer
and together you enter the game and interact in real-time.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of the first-person shooters, you see through the
eyes of your character. In other realms you see over your
character's shoulder, or from above at an angle. You meet others,
you play together, you chat.
</P>
<P>
   But in the frenetic butcher halls of games like Quake and
Unreal, it's hard to talk to anyone. People hop into these worlds
from their work computers, often, from all around the globe, to
jump around and blast away for 20 minutes, to get a quick fix. Just
try to chat with them:
</P>
<P>
   ``Pardon me!'' I type.
</P>
<P>
   SPLAT! I'm dead, pulverized by a rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to ask ...'' I type after respawning, or coming back
to life.
</P>
<P>
   POW! Dead again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, forget it ...'' I type.
</P>
<P>
   SPLAP! Dead.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. That didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   WHAP!
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness there are other, less angry worlds.
</P>
<P>
   I knew I wasn't in Kansas anymore when I logged onto Everquest,
Sony's massively multiplayer online role-playing game (known by the
easy-off-the-tongue MMORPG) and found myself running through a
dripping-wet rainforest as a huge ogre, hunting frogs with dozens
of other trolls and ogres uttering phrases like ``Blorg kill frog
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The people playing these games are adult-ish, computer-wise
modern people and yet here they're bounding through pretend forests
using pretend clubs to kill pretend frogs. I bounce up to an ogre,
a mean-faced thing dressed in skins, wagging a club. I type the
message: ``Beg pardon, I'm a reporter for a newspaper and I wanted
to ask you a couple questions about online gaming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Og no talk now. Og kill stuff,'' he types in return. Og
shuffles off into the gloom. Hmm. That didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, though, you do make friends and meet people who
aren't too busy killing stuff to chat.
</P>
<P>
   THE FUTURE OF ONLINE GAMING
</P>
<P>
   Back in the real world, one expert says games that emphasize the
greatest strength of the Internet _ communication _ are where the
future lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a surprise that shooters became as important as
they are, because they are definitely anti-social,'' says Greg
Costikyan, author of ``The Future of Online Gaming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're returning to what online games were 10 years
ago,'' he says, referring to text-based games _ MUDs or Multiple
User Dungeons _ popularized on college campuses in the late '80s.
``The ability to play online gives you an intelligent opponent,
which is always better than artificial intelligence, and it gives
you contacts. You can talk to people.''
</P>
<P>
   There is solid evidence of a shift. Austin's own Origin Systems
is a case in point. In July, the company, a subsidiary of the
California gaming giant Electronic Arts, set off a storm of
disappointed protests from fans when it dropped its A-10 Warthog
flight simulator and announced plans to devote all its efforts to
online gaming.
</P>
<P>
   Origin pioneered the multiplayer genre with Ultima Online, in
which approximately 150,000 subscribers populate a dragon-infested
magical world. The company plans to add much more social structure
to its new version of the game, UO2, due out this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned a lot about online entertainment over the past
two years since we launched Ultima Online,'' said Jeff Anderson,
executive producer for UO2. ``But most important, we've learned
that we are not just making games anymore. We're building virtual
worlds that will offer new ways for people to interact and
socialize.''
</P>
<P>
   Another example of the trend is hinted at in the
much-anticipated Team Fortress 2: Brotherhood of Arms, due out this
year from Valve, the makers of the hit shooter Half-Life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about deathmatch with better graphics,'' game
producer Gabe Newell says in the January issue of the gaming
magazine Incite. ``It's about really thinking about what groups of
friends are going to enjoy doing together.'' Team Fortress 2 will
force players to work as a close-knit team to defeat enemies in a
war zone and will include a built-in voice communication system _ a
first.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are moving in a similar direction. Microsoft
released its own MMORPG, Asheron's Call, to good reviews in time
for Christmas and plans an outer-space-style massive player game
soon, both leaning heavily on the social aspect of the experience.
In Asheron's Call, players spend half their time standing around
chatting, planning trips into the large 3-D world and exchanging
virtual equipment.
</P>
<P>
   MEET MY PATRON, THE WARRIOR ANGMAR
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps my most revealing experience was in befriending Angmar,
a warrior who dwells in the world of Asheron's Call.
</P>
<P>
   The game calls for pledges of loyalty to other players, and I
picked Angmar more or less at random. My only stipulation was that
I wanted someone who was online a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``How often do you play this game?'' I typed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough that it's hurting my GPA,'' he typed back.
</P>
<P>
   Good enough for me. Figuring he was a college kid, I vowed
loyalty and he gave me some nifty equipment and advice and we
hunted several strange species of creatures together. Only later
did I find out he lives in Austin. And goes to Westwood High
School. And is 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly I felt very old. ``I had the impression you were
older,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the equal anonymity of the Internet,'' Angmar said.
``Age really doesn't matter online.''
</P>
<P>
   For those seeking proof that online games are about more than
just killing, Angmar is a good case. In real life his name is Alex
Dodwell, a sophomore who plays cello in the orchestra, competes in
soccer and is on the debate team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking is the main reason to play games online,'' he said.
``Even while you're killing monsters, you're still chatting. It has
all the allure of a chat room but you get to play a fun game at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Angmar hasn't been online as much lately since his dad put his
foot down. ``I'm pretty embarrassed to say it does occupy a lot of
my time,'' Alex said, ``but it doesn't really cut into my studies
too bad. I spend probably two or three hours a night online.''
</P>
<P>
   The upside of Angmar's _ Alex's _ interest in computers is that
he has become something of an expert with them, building computers
from scratch and even considering a high-tech career someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been able to swim elbow-deep in my computer,'' he
said. ``My mom and dad are always asking me to fix things on
theirs. So my interest in computers might result in a career. It
helps my typing skills, if nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   THE LATE SHOW GETS A LITTLE BLUE
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the fun is choosing how you'll appear to others.
Even the shooters let you choose from dozens of options. Cyborg?
Bodacious, gun-toting cyberbabe? Cigar-chomping drill sergeant?
</P>
<P>
   And maybe it's the testosterone of the game designers or the
players or both, but these worlds almost universally feature
characters who are pumped up, steroidal and sexy in a freakish way.
In the fragfest games the men bulge with muscles that make
Schwarzenegger look like Olive Oyl and the women are cut-looking
with gleaming metal bustiers.
</P>
<P>
   Playing as a male woodland elf one night in Everquest I was
propositioned by a female woodland elf, a really good-looking
blonde.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make a sign if your interested,'' the good-looking elf thing
typed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interested in what?'' I typed back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' the elf thing said. ``Doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Things?'' I typed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together. Anything you want,'' the elf thing said. ``I'll do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what you mean,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated, I guess, the good-looking elf thing ran away into
the gloom.
</P>
<P>
   It's just as well. As my friend Angmar later said, ``It was
probably a 40-year-old pot-bellied guy sitting at his keyboard in
his underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   THIS IS YOUR LIFE
</P>
<P>
   As these encounters hint, for some people, the games are much
more than games. They're more like an alternative life or even a
second job. And, anecdotally at least, they're filled mostly with
males. In point of fact, the games are so male-dominated that
female players have a tough time convincing others that they're not
``role-playing'' a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had someone ask me this weekend if I was really female,''
said Debbie Johnson of Tulsa, Okla., who plays a war magician, Lia
of Leafcull, in Asheron's Call. ``I replied yes, and then he asked
what age. When I replied `Over 40,' he said, `Yeah, sure, I bet.'''
</P>
<P>
   A Web site administrator for Avis Rent-a-Car, married 25 years
with no kids, Lia/Debbie started playing these kinds of games two
years ago and has since persuaded her 70-year-old dad to join her
online.
</P>
<P>
   Another female player for whom online gaming is a family affair
_ of another kind _ is Judy Winget of Cincinnati, who also plays
Asheron's Call. She's 41, a mother of two young children, a
professional business analyst who spends her free time as Reiki
Anzho, the magical monarch of The Mystic Order of Blackthorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a divorce because my ex found `the love of
his life' playing (the online game) Yserbius,'' she said, citing
what is apparently not an uncommon occurrence in the these worlds.
``Though he's still single three-and- a-half years after the
divorce,'' Reiki/Judy added.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the separation, I met a wonderful man playing (online
games) and we've since married,'' she said. Now the two of them
play online together, often meeting in the virtual world.
</P>
<P>
   For Reiki/Judy, the games are as much about conversation as
about hunting and adventuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upshot is, yes, I play because of the social
interaction,'' Judy/Reiki said. ``If I had to do it alone and had
no friends to share the joy with, what would be the point?''
</P>
<P>
   VIRTUAL GAMES, REAL-LIFE MONEY
</P>
<P>
   But for some people the games are, partly at least, about making
money.
</P>
<P>
   Though not officially sanctioned by the game makers, the selling
of items and characters from the persistent worlds such as Ultima,
Asheron and Everquest has become common on Internet auction sites
such as eBay.
</P>
<P>
   For Terry King, 30, who has played Ultima Online since the
beginning two years ago, this phenomenon translates into more than
pocket change. The five-year Dell employee spends 35 hours a week
in the fantasy world, generally playing Red Alkeistarte, an evil
lord who can summon giant demons to his defense. Terry creates
virtual characters and buildings he can sell in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he recently sold his virtual castle from the
Ultima realm at an online auction site for some $3,000 cash money
and sold a tower for $1,500 and a couple of houses for about $500
each. These bits of virtual real estate give a character great
prestige and take months or years of steady playing to build.
Terry/Red said he also makes an extra $200 a week selling
characters he has created.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, Terry/Red maintains that he plays mostly for the
people he meets. ``I have 350 people on ICQ (an instant online
messaging service), and most of them play with me every single
week, if not day,'' he said. ``What I like most is the people I
play with, the sense of community and identity.''
</P>
<P>
   King's wife, Christy, is also an avid gamer, and with four
computers in their house the couple often plays in the same world
at the same time, but hardly ever see each other in the virtual
world. That's because their guilds, the online gaming groups to
which they belong, are sworn enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Christy plays a war mage, Kitty, in the world of Ultima, and
finds the online experience very alluring. ``I tried Final Fantasy
VII (a single-player game), but I didn't like it because it was
just me sitting at a computer,'' she said. ``What keeps you there
is the interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Many players she meets online want to know if she's a ``real''
female, Christy said, ``And then they immediately want to be your
online boyfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   GAME OVER
</P>
<P>
   One last experience: I entered the PK server of Asheron's Call _
the so-called Player Killer world where warriors and enchanters can
frag you and steal your most valuable stuff, no questions asked _
and I purposely and with some difficulty took my lowly character to
the most brutal part of that world, the Direlands.
</P>
<P>
   And for some reason, seeing a lowly archer in this harsh region
where death always lurks touched a chord with many of the
high-level players there. Any one of these dozens of mages and
warriors could have killed and robbed me instantly, but instead
they gave me all kinds of marvelous gifts. At one point I found
myself in the midst of three powerful warlords as they
simultaneously showered me with magical weapons and jewelry and
wished me well.
</P>
<P>
   If anonymous gaming brings out the worst in some people, in
others it seems to bring out the best. And perhaps that is what
makes online games so fascinating _ they offer human experience at
its least complicated. That means killing. But it also means
befriending.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that making friends is what distinguishes
online games from computer games you play without going online.
What fascinates, what attracts, is that these universes are
peopled, after all, with people.

Victims' advocates target Benetton ads 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Crime victims' advocates in Texas and New York are calling for a
boycott of fashion giant Benetton to protest its new advertising
campaign, which sympathetically portrays Death Row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian company and its products, including a line of
clothing carried by Sears, are being targeted in Texas by Justice
for All, and beyond by the New York group Center for the Community
Interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to organize a boycott of Benetton products and
just ask people upfront not to buy Benetton products,'' said Dianne
Clements, president of Justice for All. ``Benetton is in bed with
killers, and Sears is in bed with Benetton.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a $20 million ad campaign, to be carried on
billboards and in major magazines, titled ``We on Death Row.'' It
features pictures of and interviews with more than two dozen
condemned killers. None is from Texas because prison officials
would not let the company interview and photograph inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated attempts to reach a spokesman at Benneton U.S.
headquarters in New York were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release announcing the campaign, Benetton said the ads
are aimed at ``giving back a human face to the prisoners on death
row.''
</P>
<P>
   Benetton advertisements have drawn protests in the past for
graphically highlighting social issues such as AIDS, war and
starvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this new initiative,'' the news release states,
``Benetton has once again chosen to look reality in the face by
tackling a social issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sears, however, apparently has a different reality in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already made our position pretty clear that we're not
enamored with the Benetton advertising and, in fact, Sears is in
discussions with Benetton right now about that issue,'' company
spokesman Tom Nicholson said Tuesday. ``It's certainly not the type
of advertising we would believe would be appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said the Benetton fashion line, introduced last
summer, has been ``well received by most of our customers.''
However, removing the merchandise is ``on the table'' in Sears'
discussions with Benetton, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clements said activists are organizing a protest of a Sears
outlet in Houston, and the one Benetton clothing store in Texas _
in Houston's Galleria. She said the protest is tentatively
scheduled for early February.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Diamond, a spokesman for the New York-based Center for the
Community Interest, a national crime victims group, emphasized that
the group was not calling for a boycott of Sears outright _ only
Benetton products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly want to boycott Benetton products at Sears,''
Diamond said. ``What Benetton is doing is antithetical to
everything Sears represents. Sears represents the heartland of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   According to pro-death penalty groups, the 26 prisoners featured
in the ads are responsible for the deaths of 37 people.
</P>
<P>
   What upset the victim advocates most is that the details of the
crimes they committed are not mentioned in the ads. Instead, the
inmates are asked about their hopes and dreams, their upbringing
and their opinions on life.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Sheets, for example, was asked in the Benetton interview
what he thinks is wrong with the world today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a big problem, with America at least, is that the
parents aren't spending enough time with their kids,'' he said.
``When I was a kid my dad was always home when I got home from
school.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad did not mention that Sheets is awaiting execution for the
rape and murder of Kenyatta Bush, 17, of Nebraska. According to the
taped confession of an accomplice, Adam Barnett, the pair killed
the young honor student because she was black. Barnett killed
himself in jail after implicating Sheets, who denied involvement in
the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Another condemned prisoner, Jerome Mallett, was asked if he had
been unlucky. He said he had been and recalled being ``at a
friend's house in Fort Worth and a guy threw some dynamite in the
house ... and I got all burnt up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallett landed on Missouri's Death Row after a jury convicted
him of killing a state trooper who, during a traffic stop,
discovered that Mallett was wanted in Dallas and a parole violation
and on an armed robbery charge.
</P>
<P>
   Speedy Rice, a professor at Gonzaga Law School in Spokane,
Wash., and a member of the National Association of Criminal Defense
Attorneys, helped arrange the Death Row interviews for Benetton. He
said the interviews were granted only after the company agreed not
to get into ``issues of the crime, guilt or innocence,'' which
would have interfered with the attorney-client relationship.
</P>
<P>
   He said the reaction from crime victims groups ``proves to us
the very reason why this was necessary. We in this country don't
want to think about people on Death Row as human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said one of the most difficult tasks was finding states
that would allow the interviews and photos.
</P>
<P>
   Texas wasn't interested, said Larry Todd, a spokesman for the
Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had others that wanted to do Death Row calendars, have
an inmate of the month. We don't do that sort of thing,'' he said.
``We take the prison business very seriously. We're not into the
Hollywood approach to communications.''

 &HT;    Amazon.com more than a store
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Who has not read of the Internet stock riddle: An
Internet company can incur staggering losses but still have a stock
market valuation like a Dow industrials company?
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the online retailer, is one of the most obvious
examples of that. The company has made founder Jeff Bezos a
billionaire several times over. Yet Amazon.com still spends far
more than it makes. Bezos has said he knows Wall Street is giving
him the benefit of the doubt for now, banking on the assumption
that Amazon.com is reshaping our definition of retail and cannot be
measured by old standards.
</P>
<P>
   An article by Miguel Helft in The Industry Standard, an online
and print magazine about the Internet economy, offers another
explanation. The piece, at www.thestandard.net
</P>
<P>
   /article/display/0,1151,8784,00.html, asks whether Amazon, the
so-called biggest store on Earth, is even really a store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, retailing remains at the core of everything Amazon
does,'' writes Helft. ``During the peak holiday season, Amazon
sales reached a staggering $16 million a day. But Amazon is a new
type of retailer _ and not just because it does business over the
Internet. It has found a way to leverage its customer base,
e-commerce know-how and marketing muscle not only to build its
existing business but also to create new kinds of businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The article lists the companies that Amazon has bought a piece
of during the past 18 months, all this buying done while Amazon.com
was losing money. Amazon has invested about $160 million for equity
stakes in six online retailers: Drugstore.com, HomeGrocer.com,
Pets.com, Ashford.com, Gear.com and Della.com. Helft writes that
those investments are now worth between $900 million and $1.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means Amazon's paper gains from those investments vastly
exceed _ and might even double _ the $559 million in losses Amazon
has racked up in its five-year history. And those gains could soon
soar when HomeGrocer.com and Pets.com complete their pending
IPOs,'' the article reads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, these investments don't make Amazon a venture fund.
Nor is it a holding company of the likes of Internet Capital Group,
which has no operations of its own but has stakes in more than two
dozen business-to-business e-commerce companies. Amazon's goal
isn't to boost its balance sheet with these investments, but if
Amazon's greatest profit potential comes not from sales but from
investments, Bezos may have succeeded in creating a company that
defies categorization. The question is, what is Amazon's real
model?''
</P>
<P>
   SITE OFFERS SELF-HELP GURUS _ IN A COMPUTERIZED SENSE
</P>
<P>
   A Red Herring article looks at who, or what, is behind the
advice being offered from a new Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The article, www.herring.com/insider
</P>
<P>
   /2000/0113/vc-umagic.html, examines the business model behind
Umagic.com, a site designed to offer advice from noted self-help
gurus. But the advice won't be coming from them. The answers will
come from a computer version of the expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this bizarre idea, Umagic has attracted $8 million in
venture funding, including a $3.6 million bridge round landed last
week from Wheatley Partners, Woodland Ventures advertising mogul
Jay Chiat (founder of Chiat/Day and now chief executive of
Screamingmedia),'' the article said. ``The company plans next to
raise $20 million in fourth-round funding with J.P. Morgan's
help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity for the experts to multiply themselves by
a million,'' Umagic founder and CEO David Post told Red Herring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be anybody's guess whether technology can replace humans
in the self-help department,'' the article states, ``at least until
Umagic launches its Web site in March.''
</P>
<P>
   WEB SITE HOPES TO CONNECT INVESTORS, ENTREPRENEURS
</P>
<P>
   A new Web site hopes to be a catalyst for venture capital
investing.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.angeltips.com, opened for testing late last year.
The site will officially launch this month. It had planned to run a
TV ad during the Super Bowl but had second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   The site hopes to connect Web resources and investors looking to
invest in high-technology and Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
   Accredited investors will have to pay a $1,000 yearly
subscription. The charge gives access to the Screening Room, which
will include the business plans and private placement deals offered
at the site. Entrepreneurs pay a $250 fee to post their business
plans on the site. Posting can include a video clip of the founder
describing the company's plan.

Your own animation studio 
c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The purpose of Disney's Magic Artist Studio
($29.99 for Mac and PC; disney.go.com/disneyinteractive/) is
anything but black and white. Is it an animation tutor? A drawing
and painting program? Usually when a product tries to cover too
many bases it ends up lacking in all of them. Not so here. While
the anim-
</P>
<P>
   ation tutorials are basic and the creation of cartoon scenes is
limited to placing looped character movements and canned
soundtracks into pre-drawn scenes, kids seem to love it. And the
painting, drawing and text features are powerful for a program
aimed at children (our test kid was well on his way to producing
his own newspaper featuring Mickey and the gang). It's easy enough
to assemble and save slide shows of favorite creations to show off
to family and friends. Be warned, though ... you could be starring
in one of these epics. Magic Artist Studio lets young Rembrandts
import and doctor photos, making you look potentially, well, Goofy.
</P>
<P>
   STEP INTO THE RING
</P>
<P>
   Looking for some WWF Wrestlemania action? Look no further than
Toymax's WWF Slamcam ($70; www.toymax.com). The Slamcam is a
digital camera for the PC that allowsusers to put themselves in the
middle of the action. The camera is simple. Once you aim and shoot,
you can superimpose yourself as a fan in the crowd, on the body of
a referee or (ouch!) the receiving end of a Steve Austin headlock.
The camera also comes with its own software, which allows you to do
fun, if not strange, photo effects like adding hair or replacing
limbs with chicken legs and fish flippers. The software also
contains templates for fan ID cards, posters and calendars. While
the Slamcam is a digital camera, it's only to be used with the
Slamcam software. This makes photographing your mom's birthday
party rather difficult, unless, that is, you wanted a picture of
her pinned to the mat by the British Bulldog.

   Republicans and Democrats hold back-to-back debates in
Manchester, N.H., tonight. The Republicans, minus dropout Orrin
Hatch, go first (7-8:30 p.m.). The two Democrats will follow (9-10
p.m.). Both will be televised live by CNN. This could be Bill
Bradley's last clear shot at derailing Al Gore before the Tuesday
primary, and John McCain likely will stress that he's more
experienced and qualified than George W. Bush to lead the country.
</P>
<P>
   HATCH GIVES UP THE GHOST
</P>
<P>
   Orrin Hatch officially quit his longshot bid for the Republican
presidential nomination today. The Utah senator says he has no
regrets for having tried. He's now endorsing George W. Bush for
president. His decision comes after finishing sixth and last in
Monday's Iowa caucuses. Hatch got just 1 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   NOT BAUER, THOUGH _ HE'S NO `QUITTER'
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer says he's in the race for the long haul, despite
disappointing results in Iowa (4th place, 9 percent). ``I am not a
quitter,'' he said. ``I'm on the same message I've been on:
restoring protection to unborn children, a China policy closer to
Ronald Reagan's than the Clintonian policies that even some of my
opponents seem to support and I'm for a pro-family flat tax.''
</P>
<P>
   GEE, JUST LIKE THE VIETNAM WAR DAYS
</P>
<P>
   Eight protesters opposed to Occidental Petroleum's plans to
drill in South America were removed from Al Gore's New Hampshire
campaign headquarters by police today. The protesters from Amazon
Watch and other groups want Gore to pressure Occidental Petroleum
to stop drilling for oil on lands of the U'wa people in Colombia.
Gore's late father, Albert Sr., was a vice president of an
Occidental subsidiary, and the group contends Gore Jr. owns
Occidental stock.
</P>
<P>
   BUT HE WASN'T EXACTLY WITHOUT MEANS
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley was making the rounds in New Hampshire before
tonight's debate with Al Gore. He campaigned at a YMCA day care
center this morning, where he talked up his agenda for middle-class
working families. He told a group of youngsters he understands the
challenges of single parents, because he cared for his daughter
while in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   THAT'S WHY HE'S HERE NOW
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything, and George W. Bush wondered aloud aboard
his campaign plane whether his ``moment in time'' has come. If his
father had been re-elected president in 1992, if the younger Bush
had stumbled in the 1994 Texas governor's race, he says he would
not be running for president today. ``If I hadn't quit drinking, I
doubt I would be here today,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   USE HIM IF YOU GOT HIM
</P>
<P>
   In the New Hampshire homestretch, Al Gore is seeking
opportunities to hitch himself to President Clinton's economic
coattails. Gore, who shifts between shunning Clinton and embracing
him, has settled on the latter in his attempt to win next week's
primary and deny Bradley any comeback from his sound defeat in
Iowa. Gore is campaigning on the current record-breaking economic
expansion and reaching for a chunk of the credit for the 1996
welfare reform that congressional Republicans pushed and Clinton
signed.
</P>
<P>
   CAUGHT ON THE ABORTION TIGHTROPE
</P>
<P>
   John McCain talked about his daughter and a hypothetical
unwanted pregnancy. He first said he would encourage 15-year-old
daughter Meghan ``to know that the baby would be brought up in a
warm and loving family,'' and said a final decision would be made
by her _ ``with our advice and counsel.'' A few minutes later,
though, he called reporters together to clarify his answer, saying
it would be a family decision, not made by his daughter alone. By
the time the morning ended, Cox's Mark Sherman reports, McCain's
anti-abortion credentials had been called into question and his
wife, Cindy, walked away from reporters who again brought up the
topic with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   DISTANCE RUNNER, NOT A SPRINTER
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is about to announce detailed campaign plans for
the loaded-up March calendar, underscoring a commitment to fight
deep into the primary season regardless of the outcome of next
week's New Hampshire vote. Bradley has noted pointedly that he'll
have the money to compete post-New Hampshire. His detailed schedule
is to be announced later this week.
</P>
<P>
   BUT MOST OTHER CANDIDATES DIDN'T EVEN SERVE
</P>
<P>
   John McCain's campaign dismissed a full-page newspaper ad
accusing the former POW of working against the interests of other
Vietnam POWs. ``We're not going to dignify that ad with a
response,'' said McCain aide Mike Dennehy. The ad, in the
Manchester Union Leader, accused McCain of working to keep POW
documents sealed. The allegation is that McCain, as part of a
Senate probe in the early 1990s, dismissed reports that some
Americans were left behind alive when other POWs were brought home
in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   HATCH ON, LAROUCHE OUT
</P>
<P>
   The Wisconsin primary ballot selection committee approved eight
candidates from two parties for the April 4 voting. Included is
Orrin Hatch, who formally quit the race today. The committee
rejected Lyndon LaRouche, who already has run unsuccessfully for
the White House five times, calling him a candidate ``not generally
recognized by the national news media.''
</P>
<P>
   A TOUGH BALLOT TO GET ON
</P>
<P>
   John McCain dropped efforts to compete in the primary in two New
York congressional districts: the South Bronx and Suffolk County.
But he promised to keep fighting attempts to keep him off the
ballot in the rest. State GOP leaders support George W. Bush, and
challenged McCain's ballot petitions in 16 of the New York's 31
congressional districts on grounds that he fell short of the
required number of signatures. Today, Democrats on the state Board
of Elections blocked challenges to McCain petitions in eight
additional districts.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOONER THE BETTER
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush, campaigning for son George W. in South Carolina,
predicted it won't be too long before the country elects a female
president. ``I fully expect to see a female president _ she'll be a
Republican of course _ but I fully expect to see her, and I don't
expect to live too many more years.'' The former first lady is 74.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE'S HENRY KISSINGER WHEN YOU NEED HIM?
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump sent letters to Reform Party bigwigs Jesse Ventura,
the governor of Minnesota, and Ross Perot, the party founder,
asking them to broker a peace deal between the two party factions.
Trump has said he's ``very interested'' in running for president,
but believes his prospects would be hampered by intraparty fighting
and fratricide.
</P>
<P>
   PROVOCTEUR'S OFFER ACCEPTED
</P>
<P>
   Michael Moore, the independent filmmaker and TV satirist, had a
standing offer to the entire presidential field: Anyone willing to
dive backward into a mosh pit and bodysurf through the crowd while
Moore's cameras roll would win the ``endorsement'' of his
cable-channel show, ``The Awful Truth.'' Much to his surprise,
Moore already has found a taker: Alan Keyes jumped in _
figuratively and literally. Keyes, in Iowa, jumped right in with a
hundred kids with spiked hair, body piercings and tatoos. ``I've
filmed a lot of bizarre things, but I've never seen anything this
bizarre,'' Newsday quoted Moore as saying. ``He jumped right in. It
enhanced my feeling that the man is certifiably insane.''
</P>
<P>
   GUIDE'S OFFER NOT ACCEPTED
</P>
<P>
   Grueling hours on the campaign trail can make a candidate
snappish, but not like this. When a guide at a New Hampshire
environmental center offered Gary Bauer a close look at a snapping
turtle, Bauer jumped back and went into a shell of his own. ``I'm
willing to face Bush, but not this,'' he said. The encounter came
as Bauer and his family toured Amoskeag Fishways, where glass walls
let visitors glimpse Atlantic salmon migrating up the Merrimack
River in season. The turtle, named Lucky, is the fishway's mascot.
</P>
<P>
   WHO WERE THOSE TWO DOUGHNUT HOLES, ANYWAY?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore had some flaky company during an impromptu stop at a
Dunkin Donuts in Manchester, N.H. In addition to the shop patrons,
according to the Washington Post, Gore was greeted by Buddhist monk
impersonators from Boston. Wearing bald heads, the pair held signs
that read, ``Al Gore Finance Committee,'' a reference to the
controversy surrounding Gore's appearance at a 1996 Democratic
fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple in California.
</P>
<P>
   FRIEND OF THE LOBBYISTS?
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe reported today that Al Gore is ``the favorite
of Washington lobbyists.'' The Globe's front-page story says,
``Many of the vice president's close friends, former aides and
senior campaign advisers work as lobbyists and strategists for
corporate clients who often get access to the White House and
Gore's office _ and sometimes get profitable results from
regulators who operate under Gore's oversight.'' But Gore spokesman
Chris Lehane said Gore has ``never made a decision that was not
based on the country's best interests.''
</P>
<P>
   BIRDS (OF PREY) OF A FEATHER
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan calls both major political
parties ``two wings of the same bird of prey.'' He told the
Birmingham News that Democrats and Republicans rely on ``the same
corporate sources of soft money, the same group of political
consultants,'' and that they won't raise issues he views as vital.
</P>
<P>
   MEANWHILE, BACK IN NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani took expected New York Senate rival Hillary Rodham
Clinton to task today, accusing her of embracing ``old-fashioned,
classical left-wing thinking'' as she prepares for her first-time
run for office. The NYC mayor called his approach ``a more
progressive way of looking at things.'' The Clinton campaign,
meanwhile, trumpeted a report in the weekly New York Observer that
Giuliani is using conservative-oriented mailing lists to appeal to
Rush Limbaugh fans for money.

Adobe Photoshop LE a good `light' version of photo-editing tools &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Adobe Photoshop LE (which stands for Limited Edition)
is not as limited as you might think.
</P>
<P>
   Usually these light versions of standard programs are created to
be bundled with another program or a hardware item. Photo-editing
software, for instance, is generally included with page or Web
design programs and with a new scanner.
</P>
<P>
   They are simplified and limited versions of the original, and
you're encouraged to upgrade to the parent program.
</P>
<P>
   Photoshop is, of course, the reigning professional tool for
computer editing and image enhancing of photographs and other
graphics. It is a large and complex program.
</P>
<P>
   Photoshop Limited Edition, a powerful and complex tool in its
own right, should satisfy the requirements of anyone who isn't
getting paid to use it.
</P>
<P>
   A 250-page manual takes the edge off the complexity, although it
would be nice if it included a tutorial. There is also the standard
aggravation of any Adobe program, which is to say they were all
originally created for Macintosh and Adobe prints one manual for
both platforms, giving side-by-side instructions for both machines
where there is a difference in a given operation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the photo-editing programs I've seen have proved rather
baffling, doing things to an image that didn't seem very useful.
Photoshop LE is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Take the dodging and burning tools, for instance. If you've ever
printed photos in a darkroom, you'll recognize the terms. Burning
means to allow more light to strike a specific portion of the
image, thus darkening it; it's usually done by putting the hands
together in such a way that light falls only on the desired area.
Dodging is just the opposite, done by wiggling a piece of cardboard
on a stiff wire over the area to be lightened.
</P>
<P>
   Photoshop's dodging and burning tools work in an intelligent
manner. If you hold the dodging tool over an area of shade, the
entire area _ not just the part of it directly under the tool _ is
lightened, gradually revealing the detail you wanted to bring out.
The burning tool will take a light shadow and bring it all the way
to black if you desire. If you use the tools judiciously, the
results appear perfectly natural.
</P>
<P>
   Cropping is another simple matter here. It can be done through a
dialog box, but the easy way is with the cropping tool. Simply
outline the area you want to keep, hit return and you've got it.
While this is the way all programs ought to work, it frequently
doesn't seem to happen that way.
</P>
<P>
   Every program of this sort has some filters to make a picture
look more like a painting, or like anything but a picture.
Photoshop LE, however, has dozens of them, nearly all of them
infinitely adjustable in their effect. You can even change the
source of light in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Photoshop Limited retails for $95. It's worth it.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
No need to rush for upgrade to Windows 2000 
By Bill Husted  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Back when I started messing with computers, I thought
operating systems _ the software that literally tells a computer
how to be a computer _ were fascinating. But I had a propeller on
my hat, was shunned by right-thinking people and was generally
considered to be lost in a fantasy world.
</P>
<P>
   I would wait for the new version of MS-DOS, the operating system
I used in those days, with the same anticipation and hope that
normal people felt as they waited for the next great movie. Regular
people looked at me funny.
</P>
<P>
   So I am more surprised than most that operating systems now are
considered to be big news by average folk. When Microsoft brings
out a new version of Windows, newspapers and TV devote the sort of
attention that used to be paid to dictators, rock stars and moon
landings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of making things easier for consumers, all the hype has
made it more difficult. Should you upgrade from Windows 95 to 98?
Should you be the first in line to buy Windows 2000 when it comes
out? Or should you wait for the next consumer-grade edition of
Windows, called Millennium?
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 _ which is priced for and aimed at the business
user _ will be out in February. Millennium, which will replace
Windows 98, won't be far behind. Let's take a look at operating
systems today and try to make sense out of what you should do, when
to replace your old system and when to stand pat.
</P>
<P>
   First, the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you running Windows 95: Upgrade now. Windows 98 is
less likely to crash, uses memory better and does a better job of
protecting your security online.
</P>
<P>
   If you have Windows 98: Stand pat for a while. Don't upgrade
immediately to Millennium or Windows 2000. Let the bugs crawl out
of the woodwork first.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the details.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 95 is showing its age. Even with the literally dozens of
software upgrades and patches that can be found and downloaded for
free at www.microsoft.com, you will see an improvement in almost
all areas by immediately moving to Windows 98. With the Windows 98
Upgrade disc you won't lose any of your data or programs; the icons
and commands don't change substantially, so there is little
confusion involved.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 is a relatively stable operating system. If you buy a
copy, make sure the box says Second Edition, since considerable
improvements have been made since 98 was created. Then, once you've
installed it, use the built-in upgrade feature that automatically
takes you to the Microsoft Web site and installs any software fixes
and patches. Even with the Second Edition there are some important
upgrades, including three or four that help patch some holes in the
security it provides while you are online. To use the built-in
upgrade feature, click on the Start button and click on the Upgrade
menu item while connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   I've used both the upcoming and yet-to-released versions of
Windows in beta. Beta versions aren't complete and have some bugs
that will be fixed before these versions hit the shelves, but they
do offer a good picture of what the product will be like.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium has some nifty new features. It automates some file
repair tasks and is generally just as fast and (once it moves out
of beta) will be more reliable. But there's no rush (besides, it's
not on the market yet). When it becomes available, wait at least a
month before installing it.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 is aimed at the high-end user, not the home
computer. But it's my guess (and it's only a guess) that many of
the new and powerful computers will come with it as a pre-installed
option. I think that _ since 2000 is built on Windows' almost
bullet-proof NT technology _ it will be important to both
businesses and home users. But if you are running Windows 98, you
have the option of watching and waiting once it's on the market.
</P>
<P>
   That's my best advice for today. Wait and see. As strange as it
feels, since I loved 'em before it was cool, don't get too eager
when it comes to new operating systems.

&HT;     MCCAIN CHALLENGES BUSH WITH FACE-TO-FACE CAMPAIGNING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLIS, N.H. _ Arizona Sen. John McCain is combating the
formidable campaign resources of Texas Gov. George Bush in New
Hampshire's Republican primary with more than 100 low-budget town
meetings that give citizens a chance to query, quibble with and
even taunt a man who would be president.
</P>
<P>
   McCain demonstrated his mastery of the format Wednesday at the
105th freewheeling, question-and-answer session that he has staged
in New Hampshire since the outset of his maverick crusade to
sidetrack Bush's juggernaut for the party's presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The 63-year-old senator, who has bantered on Capitol Hill for 17
years, captivated nearly 200 people gathered at a knotty pine
banquet facility in this rural community of 6,300 with
self-deprecating humor, quick come-backs, off-hand mention of
campaign attributes and sweeping campaign promises.
</P>
<P>
   The audience questioned McCain about his ability to forge
bipartisanship. He withstood a swipe by an independent bookseller
who complained that the candidate mentioned that Amazon.com carries
his autobiography, ``Faith of My Fathers.'' McCain fielded queries
on the use of U.S. forces overseas, Veterans Administration health
care and tort reform.
</P>
<P>
   The politically touchy issue of abortion did not come up as it
has at earlier town meetings. But later on his campaign bus, ``The
Straight Talk Express,'' McCain answered a reporter's question only
to revise his answer later about how his family would handle the
hypothetical pregnancy of his daughter Meghan, 15.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, McCain said that the final decision over an abortion
would be made by Meghan. McCain later revised his position in a
statement, saying any final decision would be ``made by the family
and not by Meghan alone.''
</P>
<P>
   During his town meeting in Hollis, McCain delicately referred to
his campaign strengths as he cajoled, persuaded and finally just
plain asked for support for his 5-month-old campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The latest opinion surveys show McCain leading Bush in the
five-man New Hampshire contest, the first primary in which voters
cast ballots at polling booths. The primary for both Republicans
and Democrats is Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain used a hand-held microphone and ambled across the stage
with the confidence of a one-time fighter pilot and the ease of a
talk show host. He introduced his wife, Cindy, cited the couple's
four children, and promptly recalled an anecdote that helped
underscore his seniority in a field of younger candidates.
</P>
<P>
   After driving his children to the first day of school one year,
McCain said he ventured into the parents' reception only to have
another parent remark that it was nice that he had driven his
grandchildren to school. ``I was not amused,'' the white-haired
McCain quipped with feigned indignity.
</P>
<P>
   McCain later returned to his attribute of experience, citing
service ``in the company of heroes'' as a prisoner of war in North
Vietnam. He never directly mentioned Bush, who served in the Texas
Air National Guard during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country needs a steady hand at the tiller,'' said the
22-year Navy veteran who retired as a captain. Potential threats
from North Korea, Iraq, terrorists and China must be confronted by
a leader ``who has the experience and the knowledge and the vision
of what we want the world to look like in the next century,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A McCain ally in New Hampshire, retired Sen. Warren Rudman, had
underscored the implicit contrast with Bush only moments before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a candidate who has the character and the integrity
and the honor to do whatever has to be done in the best interests
of the American people and not a candidate, not a president who
will put his finger up to the wind and decide how the polls blow,''
Rudman said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain invigorated his early morning audience with non-stop
quips. Rudman must enjoy being back home in Hollis ``rather than
trying to do the Lord's work in the city of Satan,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every senator in Washington who is not ``under indictment
or in detox'' weighs presidential aspirations. His quest for the
presidency had even led him to address a West Point graduates'
dinner, ``quite a demeaning experience'' for a Naval Academy
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain indirectly cast aspersions at Bush's record-setting $67
million in campaign donations, contending that unreported corporate
donations could jeopardize the Republican Party's image. McCain has
raised about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the nominee of the Republican Party for president of the
United States, my campaign will have nothing _ nothing _ to do with
these uncontrolled undisclosed, contributions which have corrupted
the political process so badly,'' McCain said, eliciting applause
from his audience.
</P>
<P>
   McCain decried the Democratic fund-raising practices of 1996
that saw President Clinton invite large campaign donors to the
White House to spend the night in the Lincoln bedroom. The scandal
of 1996 ``wasn't Monica Lewinsky, the scandal was the debasement of
every institution of government by the Clinton-Gore campaign,''
McCain declared. ``The president of the United States took the
Lincoln bedroom, treated it like Motel 6 and he was the bell hop.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added: ``I'm going to make what they did illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   He capped off his presentation by reciting the mantra of Granite
State Republicans in a bid to appeal to traditional GOP voters, who
are expected to make up about 70 percent of the electorate in
Tuesday's GOP primary. The remaining voters are expected to be
independent voters who can vote in either party's primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a proud conservative Republican. I'm for lower taxes,
less government, less regulation,'' McCain said. ``But I also have
to tell you sometimes things that you don't want to hear and I
don't want to hear either _ and that is in the short term, we're
going to have to spend some more money while we reform the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Dobens, 52, a heating and air conditioning contractor from
nearby Nashua, came away saying that he would give McCain a second
look after hearing the retired Navy pilot tout a modest tax cut,
campaign finance reform and devoting the federal budget surplus to
underwriting Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm skeptical about most of these politicians, but McCain
seems like a great guy,'' said Dobens, who said he was an
independent voter who planned to cast a ballot in the GOP
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Hackett, 71, a retired homemaker from Hollis, said the
hour-plus encounter with Bush's main challenger in the primary
bolstered her enthusiasm for a plain-spoken Republican who ``has
the courage to stand up for what he believes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush would be all right but he just doesn't have the
experience or the maturity I think we need,'' Hackett said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The news barely registered on the radar of Internet industry
analysts and executives: The Uniform Code Council, the nonprofit
organization that created the bar code system, recently announced
that it had chosen AppNet, an Internet consulting company, to build
what it called ``the largest electronic marketplace for
business-to-business transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the world of business-to-business Internet commerce, it has
become difficult to keep up with the rapid-fire creation of
so-called e-marketplaces _ the darlings du jour of the investment
community.
</P>
<P>
   Business-to-business marketplaces are Web sites on which
companies in a given industry buy and sell their goods, get news
and find related services. And such operations actually began
stealing investors' attention away from the business-to-consumer
market last year. Companies like Chemdex, E-Steel and DirectAg.com
achieved success in their respective industries, offering a
promising model that might be duplicated in other markets. There
are now more than 500 companies that are in some stage of creating
an e-marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The vast lineup of newcomers to this e-commerce arena speaks to
the riches they see awaiting any company that can dominate a given
business-to-business sector. Internet marketplaces are part of a
business-to-business e-commerce industry that is expected by 2003
to reach $1.3 trillion in annual revenue _ more than 10 times the
projected size of the business-to-consumer market. But capturing
that cash will prove difficult, analysts said, and not just because
of the growing number of competitors in every category _ or the
$100 million it can cost to build the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the initial resistance has come from buyers and sellers
within each market, who have been understandably reluctant to risk
disrupting business by making major purchases on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the goal of these e-marketplaces is to be seen as a
legitimate part of the supply chain, not some weird mutant thing or
flavor of the month,'' said Varda Lief, an analyst with Forrester
Research. ``For consumers, shopping is a leisure activity. In
B-to-B, your livelihood depends on how you buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of the e-marketplaces are just now showing signs that
businesses trust them to handle such transactions on a large scale.
For example, Chemdex, an Internet company that created a forum for
buyers and sellers of laboratory products in 1997, now has over 100
corporations and educational institutions purchasing goods from
2,200 suppliers on its site.
</P>
<P>
   Companies making purchases through the site include SmithKline
Beecham and Bristol-Myers Squibb, among others, pushing the site's
revenues to $8.5 million for the third quarter of 1999. Convincing
companies to move purchasing systems onto the Internet was not
easy, recalls David Perry, chief executive of Chemdex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a year ago, we had to begin every presentation with
`Here's what the Internet is, and here's why you should be
interested,''' Perry said. ``The hardest single thing to solve was
the chicken or the egg problem. When you start, you have no sellers
or buyers, and you have no value to one without the other.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, you have no revenue. Chemdex, like other
e-marketplaces, makes money by charging buyers a fee _ based on how
many people in an organization use the site to purchase goods _ and
extracting a transaction fee from sellers. Chemdex charges buying
organizations from hundreds to hundreds thousands of dollars a
year; sellers pay a transaction fee of 8 to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By initially waiving the fees, Perry said he persuaded
SmithKline Beecham, Harvard University and Genentech to use the
site. He said he also requested that they bring their suppliers on
board, and when they agreed, the site at last had something to
offer other prospective buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking difference between a business-to-consumer site
and a business-to-business site, Perry said, is the constraints
that a business places on the purchaser. ``They can only buy from
certain sellers, they have spending limits and the companies want
to have the data associated with that purchase,'' he said. ``So we
have to have technology solutions for all of those customers, and
you have to integrate them with hundreds or thousands of
suppliers.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, that means building into the site a feature
that monitors a buyer's spending limits, alerts them when they
exceed their limit, and sends a notice to executives for further
spending approvals.
</P>
<P>
   The various e-marketplaces are pushing to build a much longer
list of services to distinguish themselves from their competitors,
according to Forrester Research. In a recent survey of 50 such
sites, the firm found that in the next two years, most plan to
expand beyond simply brokering purchases, and offer services like
linking purchases with a company's distribution schedules,
integrating transactions with financial ledgers and settling
disputes between buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the relevance of the Uniform Code Council comes
into play. The council may play a role in expanding that lineup of
services, analysts and executives said. Through its subsidiary,
UCCNet, the council will soon begin building a community of
marketplace sites to cover each of the 23 industries represented by
the council's 240,000 member companies worldwide. The first site,
for the food and packaged goods industry, will be a relatively
modest version of an Internet marketplace, in that it will not
support transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it will allow suppliers like Procter &AMP; Gamble and
PepsiCo's Frito-Lay to automatically notify retailers like the
Kroger Co. on changes made to the suppliers' product catalogs.
Seemingly a pedestrian accomplishment, but nearly a third of all
the goods purchased by grocers are delivered at the wrong price or
in the wrong size, because word of the product changes takes too
long to get from supplier to buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and food industry executives said the new Uniform Code
Council system capitalized on the council's role as a nonprofit
organization devoted to industry standards. Companies will work
with UCCNet to agree on a single procedure for changing product
descriptions. They will then send any product updates to the
UCCNet, which will screen the data to make sure it conforms to
industry standards, before updating the site's product catalog and
informing buyers of the change.
</P>
<P>
   Suppliers like Procter &AMP; Gamble and Frito-Lay can now offer
their goods to grocers through the Internet, analysts said, while
grocers can comparison-shop with confidence that the products and
prices they see are up to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for the industry if we get this rocking and
rolling,'' said Michael Heschel, executive vice president of the
Kroger Co. Heschel said the new system would not only reduce the
cost of communicating with suppliers, but would also eliminate the
inefficiencies that come with incorrect orders.
</P>
<P>
   UCCNet plans eventually to increase the offerings of the
marketplaces to include other services, including a way for buyers
and sellers to collaborate on inventory management. But rather than
build a behemoth marketplace to take on other e-marketplaces in
each of its industries, UCCNet leaders and participants said the
council might want to license the initial service to other
e-marketplaces. Or at the very least, other online marketplaces may
ultimately adopt the Uniform Code Council's standards as a way to
make the ordering process between buyers and sellers more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get carried away with saying what UCCNet could
ultimately become _ sort of like the one megasystem that'll do it
all,'' said Jim Boyce, vice president of global e-commerce for
Procter &AMP; Gamble. ``That's silly. If we see it as simply the
enabler it intends to be, then it's a good thing.''

An extra e-mail account can sometimes come in handy 
By Bill Husted  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All you need is another e-mail account, right?
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens, maybe hundreds, of Web sites offering free
e-mail accounts. At first blush, that looks like a dumb idea. You
need an Internet connection to use these free accounts, and
Internet service includes an e-mail account. So why do you need
another one?
</P>
<P>
   Actually there are several reasons. For one, the Web-based
accounts are easy to check while traveling. You needn't set up your
computer for your ISP's local number or dial in by long-distance if
it doesn't have one. You may find times when you like having a
second, relatively anonymous address. Since replying to online
offers and posting messages often lands you on junk e-mail lists,
it's handy to have a second address.
</P>
<P>
   Today we'll look at some of the most popular free e-mail
services.
</P>
<P>
   Hotmail: This is Microsoft's offering. You can sign up at
lc4.law5.hotmail.passport
</P>
<P>
   .com/cgi-bin/login?lang &QC;  (or just look for the e-mail link to
the service at www.msn.com if that's too much typing). The sign-up
process is painless. You can _ if you like _ also download
Microsoft's Instant Messenger. Besides letting you keep an online
buddy list and send instant messages to people on that list, the
Instant Messenger service will notify you when you have e-mail
waiting. The downside of this service (and many of the others) is
that you'll almost certainly receive a lot of junk mail.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Mail: Flip a coin. It's almost identical to Hotmail
(including the ability to use the Yahoo Instant Messenger service).
Since the actual Web address of the service is untypably long,
simply go to www.yahoo.com and look for the link that says e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Bigfoot: Known as one of the best directory services on the Web
where you can find a person's telephone number, street address or
e-mail address, Bigfoot is a natural when it comes to free e-mail.
Again, the address for the e-mail service itself is long and
unwieldy, so go to www.bigfoot.com and press the link that says
e-mail. The pitch made here _ and the way that e-mail is handled _
is slightly different. Here's the Bigfoot explanation of the
service: ``Bigfoot will deliver your messages to any e-mail account
you want. Regardless of how often you change providers, which
provider you choose or how many accounts you might have,
you(at)bigfoot.com will always be with you!''
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista: Since AltaVista, like Yahoo, is primarily known as a
search engine and start page, it must feel obliged to match Yahoo.
So you'll find AltaVista's entry into the Web e-mail derby as a
link on its Web page at www.altavista.com. While you're there, you
may want to check out AltaVista's offer for free Internet service
as well as e-mail at www.zdnet.com/downloads/altavista/.
</P>
<P>
   GeoCities: This Web service has been around for a long time and
was a pioneer when it comes to free Web sites. It also offers free
e-mail service. You'll find all the details at geocities.yahoo
</P>
<P>
   .com/home/.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape: You know it as the maker of the Netscape Web browser,
but the company also offers free e-mail and more through a free
membership program. You'll find the details at
home.netscape.com/home
</P>
<P>
   /services.htmlcontact. Since you've noticed a certain sameness
to these free e-mail offers by now, you'll not be surprised to
learn that you can also get a free Instant Messenger service and a
free personalized start page.
</P>
<P>
   You've noticed there are a bewildering number of choices. The
good news is that it would be difficult to go wrong with any of
these services. At the price (free), you can afford to sign up for
several if you wish.

3 COPYRIGHT LAWSUITS TEST LIMITS OF NEW DIGITAL MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A flurry of court activities last week revealed a growing
conflict between the entertainment industry, which is struggling to
protect its products and profits in the Internet age, and consumer
groups, which accuse the industry of interfering with free speech
and people's rights to control their watching or listening
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The digital media market is still small compared to traditional
media, but record companies, film studios and publishers are
preparing for what they see as an inevitable migration of
entertainment online.
</P>
<P>
   Three lawsuits in play last week all dealt with different
aspects of protecting copyrighted works. But at the heart of each
is the question of what framework will govern the distribution of
digital content. It will fall to the courts to set the scope and
application of existing copyright laws _ both new laws and those
enacted long before the Internet _ to digital content.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really going on in these legal skirmishes is a broader
conflict between traditional means of media distribution and
digital means,'' said Mark Lemley, a professor specializing in
Internet law at the University of California at Berkeley. ``The
media companies have a legitimate concern that the medium of the
Internet enables piracy, but there is also an unsavory concern that
they are losing their traditional distribution mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemley added: ``The statutes are frighteningly complex, and it's
not clear how to apply them to the Internet. The result that we get
when we work through the statutes and figure it all out may not be
the one that we want.''
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, said Peter Jaszi, a professor specializing in
copyright law at American University, is that ``there are things in
some of the laws which may tilt the results in a direction that is
too restrictive as far as consumer interests are concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Recording Industry Association of America filed
suit against MP3.com, a Web site that last week started a service
allowing customers to store and listen to their CD collections and
newly purchased CDs from a password-protected account online.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Robertson, MP3.com's chief executive, described the
service as a benefit to consumers, letting them listen to music
from any place with an Internet connection. The company took
measures intended to protect copyrights, like allowing the music to
be played but not recorded on a hard drive and limiting the
accounts to one user at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the recording industry filed suit on Friday. In a
letter to Robertson that same day, Hilary Rosen, chief executive of
the recording association, wrote: ``Simply put, it is not legal to
compile a vast database of our members' sound recordings with no
permission and no license. And whatever the individual's right to
use their own music, you cannot exploit that for your company's
commercial gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemley, the Berkeley law professor, said he doubted that the
association's lawsuit would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The suit accuses MP3.com of violating a part of the Copyright
Act of 1976 that grants copyright holders the exclusive right to
make reproductions of their copyrighted sound recordings. But
Lemley said the MP3.com service was technologically equivalent to a
user's making a copy for personal use _ something specifically
allowed under the law.
</P>
<P>
   Jaszi said, though, that it was not clear that the fair-use
exemption applied to MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   Two other cases in play last week are considered crucial tests
of a much newer law, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a
sweeping piece of legislation enacted in 1998 but largely untested
in the courts so far. This law, which makes it illegal to
circumvent copyright-protection technologies, was pushed by the
entertainment industry. But consumer advocates managed to work in
an exemption that allowed software developers to engage in
``reverse engineering'' of copyright protection codes as they try
to create products compatible with the protection technology.
</P>
<P>
   This exemption is an issue in cases that involve software for
cracking encryption codes designed to protect DVDs from illegal
copies. Also on Friday, a federal district judge granted in New
York a request by the Motion Picture Association of America for a
preliminary injunction prohibiting three Web-hosting sites from
distributing the code-cracking software.
</P>
<P>
   The studios say the software, written by a Norwegian teen-ager,
is a piracy tool. But the defendants argue that the purpose of
their program is to allow DVDs to be played on computers that run
the Linux computer system.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, Jaszi said, the case addresses the issue of
whether the newer law overrides the fair-use provision of the 1976
Act, which has sometimes been construed to embrace reverse
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary injunction does not necessarily indicate that
the plaintiffs will prevail, since there is a general bias in the
courts toward granting injunctions in intellectual property cases.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a similar injunction was issued on Tuesday in Seattle
in a case by RealNetworks Inc., a leading provider of software for
distributing multimedia content over the Internet. A federal
district judge there barred Streambox Inc. from further
distributing a product that enables Internet users to record
so-called streaming audio and video on their hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge did not bar distribution of another product, the
Streambox Ripper, which enables users to convert RealNetwork's
proprietary media format into other formats _ most notably that of
RealNetworks' rival, Microsoft Corp. That ruling, Jaszi said,
suggests that the judge may believe Streambox is likely to prevail
in the case of the Ripper.
</P>
<P>
   Jaszi noted that the Ripper tool did not clearly circumvent
copyright protection technologies. Rather, he said, the judge may
believe that it is a threat mainly to RealNetworks' interest in
maintaining the exclusivity of its proprietary format, which would
not be protected under the 1998 law.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Alben, the RealNetworks vice president for government
affairs, said that the company would continue to pursue the case.

CHIP INNOVATOR BETS ON BRAINPOWER, NOT ELECTRIC POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Ditzel must have secrecy in his genes.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, he and his band of engineers operated in stealth
mode. No one else knew quite what they were up to. But their
reputation as chip architects, as well as the backing of investors
that include Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, shrouded
their activities in mysterious, geeky glamor.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of mystery, last Wednesday Ditzel's chip design
company, Transmeta Corp., made a big splash in Silicon Valley by
introducing a new line of microprocessors intended for portable
computers and new types of wireless, hand-held Web-surfing devices.
Some analysts say the chips, which IBM will produce and which are
to be available by the middle of this year, could pose the first
serious challenge in years to the personal computing chip giant,
Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the 43-year-old computer designer sat in his
office in Santa Clara, Calif., surrounded by blown-up diagrams of
his chips, and mused on the upbringing that prepared him to lead
200 employees on a five-year secret mission.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that his father, who was a chemical engineer
employed by Monsanto Corp., had moved moved the family to
Washington under mysterious circumstances when little David was 5
years old. They lived there for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea what he was doing, but 20 years later I learned
that he had gone to work temporarily for the National Security
Agency to work on their Project Tempest,'' Ditzel recalled. Tempest
was a successful NSA operation to secure electronic communications
equipment from potential eavesdroppers.
</P>
<P>
   Turnabout, in the Ditzel family, is fair play. Until last week,
even Ditzel's parents did not know what Transmeta was up to, other
than something having to do with chip design. ``Rather than risk
inadvertent disclosure by a proud parent, I, and eventually the
rest of Transmeta, usually kept the details to ourselves,'' Ditzel
explained.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the cat is out of the bag, there comes a challenge
far bigger than keeping secrets. He must prove that Transmeta's
technology warrants not only stealth, but the money and industry
ambitions that are now riding on it. The premise behind his chips
is in many ways a startlingly simple notion _but also one of the
most audacious gambles that Silicon Valley has seen in several
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta is picking up a torch originally carried by a hardy
band of computer-design rebels in the late 1970s and 1980s, who bet
that computer performance could be improved by drastically
simplifying the hardware and shifting many of the most complex
operations to software. The approach, known as Reduced Instruction
Set Computing, or RISC, was pioneered at IBM and the University of
California at Berkeley. It created a frenzy of computer innovation
during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for personal computing, RISC ultimately failed. With
the exception of Apple's PowerPC chip, made by IBM and Motorola,
RISC chips were never able to achieve compatibility with existing
personal computer software, which ran on the industry-dominating
chips made by Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than RISC, Intel's chips were based on a design called
Complex Instruction Set Computing, or CISC. Despite the greater
complexity of CISC, Intel has been able to use steady advances in
chip-making techniques to squeeze ever greater numbers of
transistors onto each generation of its chips and, thus, ever
greater speed and performance.
</P>
<P>
   So what if that greater performance came at the cost of
requiring considerable amounts of electrical power to operate the
increasingly complex chips _ not to mention power for cooling such
chips, which tend to generate considerable heat? Desktop computer
users could always get enough power from the wall plug. As for
portables _ well, that's what battery chargers were for.
</P>
<P>
   RISC was a concept that Ditzel knew well. He had helped create
the term in 1980 as a graduate student in an academic paper on
which he was co-author with his adviser, David Patterson, a
Berkeley computer scientist.
</P>
<P>
   But 15 years later, as the head of computer design at Sun
Microsystems, Ditzel was forced to concede that the RISC mission
had failed. Not only had it lost out to the Intel personal computer
standard, but he saw that even the RISC microprocessors used in
Sun's workstations were rapidly becoming as baroque as Intel's CISC
chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``The RISC guys didn't really understand what their own idea was
about,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated and burned out, Ditzel told Sun's chief executive
Scott McNealy one day in March 1995 that he was going on sabbatical
_ and would probably not return.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two months he stayed at his house, where he lives
alone, in the foothills overlooking Silicon Valley. He took walks
each day and ``studied my navel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to clear my mind and think about the principles
for a computer design that would have both simplicity and
compatibility,'' he said. ``The key idea came to me like a light
bulb was going on: It's the battery, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, he concluded, lay not in silicon hardware but,
instead, in clever software _ code that might achieve compatibility
with the dominant Intel standard, but that might also reduce the
power needs of a computer's microprocessor. Saving power, he knew,
would be a key to succeeding in the post-PC era, in which handheld
devices, unhindered by power cords, are expected to become an
increasingly common way to compute and to connect to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, this tradeoff between hardware is not a new concept
in computing. But Transmeta's decision to radically simplify
hardware, and its potential for low-energy portable computing
devices, comes at a time when Intel is moving in the opposite
direction with its next-generation, IA64 chip architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Ditzel's appreciation for the tradeoff traces to his
undergraduate days at the University of Iowa in the 1970s, when he
used and attempted to modify a maddeningly inflexible
hardware-centric computer called the Symbol. His bachelor's degree
was a double major in computer science and electrical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't choose between hardware and software,'' he said of
his dual academic track.
</P>
<P>
   That indecision left him with an appreciation for the
interrelationship between circuitry and coding that many computer
designers lack.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, RISC had been overtaken in design circles by an
approach called VLIW, for Very Long Instruction Word. But the
philosophy was the same: Simplify the hardware and do more complex
things in software. VLIW, Ditzel knew, would be his starting point.
</P>
<P>
   As he had warned McNealy, he left Sun and began seeking out the
brightest people he knew in computing to tell them about his
gestating ideas and ask each person, ``Can it work?'' One by one,
each of them responded that it would not only work but that they
wanted to participate. Within a few weeks he had assembled
Transmeta's eight-member founding team, all working each day from
the living room of his home.
</P>
<P>
   To support the original group, with the help of another founder,
Doug Laird, he raised the seed capital for Transmeta by landing a
$300,000 consulting contract with Cray Research, a supercomputer
company that has since been acquired by Silicon Graphics. With that
contract, the group could pay itself small salaries for a short
time and move out of Ditzel's living room and into a temporary
office.
</P>
<P>
   But subsequent financing proved a bit harder to come by. Silicon
Valley's venture capitalists were obsessed with Internet-commerce
start-up companies and had scant attention for arcane-sounding new
computer designs. The challenge was to explain a key concept that
Transmeta referred to as ``dynamic software translation'' _ the
chameleonlike ability to mimic the instructions for other
microprocessors, which would be crucial for any new chip meaning to
crash Intel's party.
</P>
<P>
   Then late one night in the autumn of 1995, a Transmeta
programmer named Robert Cmelik _ a boyhood friend and longtime
co-worker of Ditzel _ coined ``code morphing'' for this concept.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by this hip, edgy-sounding term, the Transmeta team
drew up an amoebalike diagram to represent the software, which was
depicted surrounding a square box that represented the chip
hardware. The labels on the amoeba _ words like ``super scalar''
and ``complex addressing modes'' _ might be music only to a nerd's
ear. But the diagram and that catchy ``code morphing'' phrase now
gave the venture capitalists something to latch onto as Ditzel made
his sales pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he had commitments from two venture-capital firms:
Institutional Venture Partners and Walden Group. And when he
journeyed up to Allen's Seattle estate to make his presentation,
Allen immediately understood the concept and became enthusiastic
about the prospects for Transmeta.
</P>
<P>
   It took Allen only 90 minutes to make up his mind to become a
major backer of the company, which has now raised about $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   With financing, Transmeta was able to acquire some of the
world's best computer talent _ including Linus Torvalds, the
programmer better known for leading the development of Linux, the
freely distributed computer operating system with a growing
industry following. Transmeta's chips are meant to work with Linux,
as well as Microsoft's Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta also began handpicking graduate students from Stanford
University's computer science department, where it was soon labeled
``the cult.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, even with IBM planning to produce Transmeta's first
chips in volume by midyear, Ditzel and Transmeta are far from
proving their concept can be a commercial success. Even Ditzel's
former professor, David Patterson, expressed concerned when told
that at 700 megahertz, the company's new chip did not have quite
the clock speed of an equivalent Intel chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even being twice as fast isn't good enough,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But he brightened when he learned that the new chip might
consume as little as one-tenth the power of Intel's best portable
chips, which means it would run much cooler and have a much longer
battery life. ``I recently bought a portable computer and
discovered it had two fans,'' he said. ``It's really noisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditzel points out that fans, like complex computer chips that
run hot, require lots of power. Software, by contrast, is mainly a
matter of brainpower. ``The tradeoffs between hardware and software
were drilled into my head at a very early age,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, so was secrecy. But after thrusting themselves
into the spotlight last week, Ditzel and his chips no longer have a
place to hide.

CLINTON TO UNVEIL NEW SPENDING INITIATIVES IN LAST STATE OF THE
UNION ADDRESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With projected non-Social Security surpluses
expected to reach nearly $2 trillion over the next decade,
President Clinton will unveil a variety of new spending proposals
along with a modest tax cut when he delivers his eighth and last
State of the Union address Thursday night before a joint session of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes to convince Republican leaders that the country
can now afford to not only increase its current investments in
important areas such as defense, education and the Head Start
program, but also help poor people get the kind of health care
insurance coverage they deserve in a nation with a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton will offer a tax cut proposal targeted
at low-and middle-income Americans. Although the White House
declined to release any definitive numbers, Clinton aides have said
the proposal likely would be $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (surplus) numbers do argue that there's room for tax
cuts,'' White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart told reporters
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart cautioned against the kind of plan being pushed by
Texas Gov. George W. Bush in his presidential campaign, saying that
the governor's tax cut proposal would primarily benefit
higher-income Americans and spend too much of the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like, you know, `Who Wants to Please a Millionaire,'
not who wants to provide tax cuts to the middle class,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut issue is expected to cause some disagreement between
Clinton and Republicans, who appear ready to back Bush's plan,
which would cut taxes by $483 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   But even Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who spoke
with Clinton on Wednesday about what he plans to outline in his
State of the Union speech, predicted that both tax cut and spending
options would be modest when finally approved by Congress. He said
the Republican goals in budget negotiations this year would be
protection of Social Security and Medicare, while offering some
increases in the areas of education and defense spending. He also
suggested that the GOP leadership may be willing to dicker with
Clinton on the issue of increased funding to provide health care
coverage to the poor, but he stopped far short of endorsing
Clinton's plan to spend $110 billion over the next 10 years for
that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to work in the health care area,'' Lott said,
sounding more conciliatory toward Clinton's budget proposals than
in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also agreed that returning ``tax overpayments'' to working
Americans would be a top priority this year. The senator warned
Clinton that the Republican-controlled Congress would not look
kindly on ``a spending frenzy'' that could endanger the prospects
of keeping the budget balanced over the next few years and paying
down the nation's $3.7 billion public debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that he'll say some things (in his State of the Union
address) in terms of ... not wasting the budget surplus,'' Lott
said, adding that Clinton may have better than a 50-50 chance this
year in getting many of his proposals through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., wouldn't
go quite that far. But he agreed with Lockhart that the projected
surpluses over the next 10 years _ more than $1.9 billion in
non-Social Security money by Congressional Budget Office estimates
_ could prove sufficient to pay off the debt and allow new spending
and tax cuts at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici said he agreed with Lott, however, that all proposals
should be modest until the surplus figures are more certain.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton will call for a tax cut and offer a plan to
eliminate the debt by 2013, his speech will focus primarily on a
bold new set of initiatives centered on his health care proposal
and education programs.
</P>
<P>
   White House domestic policy adviser Eric Woo said Wednesday that
Clinton will propose a $1 billion expansion in the Head Start
preschool program and would double the afterschool program by
adding another $1 billion. He will ask Congress for another $1.75
billion for building more schools and hiring more teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But while the proposals may sound like ``a lot,'' Woo said,
Clinton's 2001 budget proposal would ``be grounded in the need to
maintain tough fiscal discipline'' in order to ensure that the
budget remains balanced and the nation's debt is paid off.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton would emphasize in his speech, to begin at 9:01
p.m. EDT, that future investments in important programs such as
education ``must be responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll hear that as the underlying theme of his
speech,'' Woo said.

Regulators try to find way to ensure drug safety 
By Irwin Spivak  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Spend 25$ _ get $25$ credit! Online
Pharmacy _ no prescription needed! Foreign pharmacy will give
discounts up to 75% for non-FDA approved drugs!''
</P>
<P>
   So go the pitches made by some Internet pharmacies. Others
tantalize consumers with promises of 30 percent to 50 percent
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Come-ons like these are hard to ignore if you are one of the 44
million uninsured Americans or among the 75 percent of seniors on
Medicare who lack prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers indeed might find some of the best prices by buying
prescription medicines over the Internet. But an informal survey
suggests the savings are generally modest and may vanish when
shipping charges are included.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drug shoppers may be able to match the best Web
prices by going to Publix or Costco, according to The Palm Beach
Post's survey of five local and five Internet pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing is an issue because corner drugstores are increasingly
being replaced with a click onto the Internet, where one can find
hundreds of Web sites selling prescription drugs and other health
products.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 Web sites dispense drugs but don't prescribe them,
according to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. The
association estimates that a far greater number of online
pharmacies provide prescriptions through ``patient questionnaires
and cyberspace consultations.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, online drug shopping can save money. A survey
last fall by Consumer Reports showed that buyers could save as much
as 29% by purchasing certain drugs online. But another 1999 study _
conducted by the University of Pennsylvania and published in the
Annals of Internal Medicine _ found that Viagra and Propecia cost
an average of 10 percent more online than at Philadelphia-area
pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   SENIORS BIGGEST MARKET
</P>
<P>
   The elderly, who make up 12 percent of the U.S. population,
frequently have little or no insurance coverage for prescription
drugs. At the same time, they're the biggest users of such drugs:
The National Association of Chain Drug Stores reports that the
typical 65-year-old takes nine different prescription medicines a
year at an average of about $38 per bottle. Refilling all nine
prescriptions once a month would cost more than $4,000 over a year.
But experts urge consumers to use caution online.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should use the same kind of common sense you use when
buying from any business,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, a medical
officer at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. ``You look for a
reputable dealer. You get recommendations from a friend. You check
the place out.''
</P>
<P>
   Online sales are booming because the Internet makes drugs easily
available for those who live far from the local pharmacy and makes
it easier to comparison shop. Some sites also offer a greater
variety of products, and consumers can order products and consult
with a pharmacist in the privacy of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   HOLES IN SAFETY NET
</P>
<P>
   Sales of drugs via the Web, however, make it easy to bypass the
FDA guidelines that protect consumers from harmful or ineffective
drugs as well as improper prescribing or dispensing. The FDA is
concerned about improper storage and shipping _ particularly of
drugs from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs offered by foreign Web sites are more likely to raise
safety concerns about contamination or subpotent strengths,
according to the FDA. The majority of drugs ordered from foreign
Web sites are coming in from Thailand, China, Mexico and
Switzerland, reports the U.S. Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials said they seized 9,725 packages of
prescription drugs ordered over the Internet last year because they
had not been approved for use in this country, did not comply with
American labeling requirements or fell below U.S. standards for
quality and purity. They also impounded almost 2 million pills and
tablets because they did not meet FDA guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has given us a lot more work,'' reported Raymond
W. Kelly, commissioner of the customs service, on the agency's Web
site. ``We've been deluged with prescription drugs coming in from
overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyers, however, rarely are prosecuted. Consumers can find
licensed pharmacies that comply with laws through a new service set
up by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. The VIPPS
program, or Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites, was created
to protect consumers by ensuring patients have privacy, secure
orders and the option to consult with pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacies that volunteer for the program and meet its criteria
can display the VIPPS hyperlink seal on their Web site. By clicking
on the seal, consumers are linked to the association's site _
www.nabp.net _ and can verify that the pharmacy qualified for the
program. Consumers also can check the association's Web site for an
Internet pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   PHYSICIAN'S INPUT NEEDED
</P>
<P>
   For Internet pharmacies to work properly, the patient's
physician should be involved in requesting the drug, said Jeff
Trewitt, spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America. Patients who buy drugs online without
their doctor's knowledge might receive inappropriate drugs or
suffer side effects _ particularly if they don't tell the Internet
pharmacist about other drugs that they're taking.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Zelman _ president of SaveWell, one of the newer online
pharmacies _ said people need to be smart shoppers. Some walk-in
pharmacies such as Publix and Costco may be able to match online
prices because they want to bring in customers who will buy other
products, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping electronically offers convenience, but consumers should
beware of ``rogue'' sites that use unapproved, imported drugs or
dispense drugs without prescriptions, Zelman said.
</P>
<P>
   States and the federal government are grappling with how to
police online pharmacies at a time drug sales are soaring. Last
year, pharmacists from walk-ins and the Web combined to fill nearly
2.8 billion prescriptions, according to the Consumer Reports Web
site. That figure is expected to jump to about 4 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has set up a task force to study the growing number of
questions arising about Internet drug sales.
</P>
<P>
   And last month, Michigan's Attorney General threatened to sue 10
online pharmacies because Michigan bars prescribing drugs without
having an in-person physical. President Clinton's administration
has proposed strengthening the penalties for selling drugs
illegally and giving the FDA more authority to investigate online
pharmacies. It also has recommended investing $10 million in a
``rapid-response team'' and FDA computer technology to identify,
investigate and prosecute illegal Internet pharmacies.

FREE E-MAIL FOR SIMPSONS FANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   News Digital Media, the online publishing arm of News Corp.'s
Fox Network, has joined the fray of companies offering free
Internet service. But unlike other companies, which provide access
through shopping sites and search engines, News Digital uses a fan
club.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Bart Simpson and family can now sign up for free e-mail
and Internet access at www.thesimpsons.com, a new World Wide Web
site whose debut marks the 10th anniversary of the animated sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes just after Kmart said it would provide
free Internet service through its shopping site, following similar
announcements by Yahoo, Excite(AT)home and others. America Online
offers free access in Britain through a Netscape-brand site.
</P>
<P>
   To create the new service, News Digital Media contracted with
1stUp.com, a San Francisco-based company owned by CGMI that
supplies advertising-based Web access.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 1stUp.com said it had a million subscribers to its
free service, indicating that the idea appears to be catching on.
</P>
<P>
   For free service via Simpsons.com, users must first download an
application that becomes an add-on feature to their browsers _ a
sponsored navigation bar that becomes part of the browser screen.
They are then given e-mail addresses at Simpsons.com.
</P>
<P>
   The site is supported by advertising, and is intended to
complement the TV show and give fans a place to congregate, said
Jordan Kurzweil, vice president of development for Fox.com in New
York. The site also helps Fox gauge viewer reaction to individual
episodes of the show, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is able to aim advertising at individuals based on
their usage of the site, Kurzweil said. But he added that Fox has a
strict policy against selling user information to other companies
or for use in direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   The company does not appear concerned that people might sign up
for the free service and then change their opening page to another
portal. Such users, Kurzweil said, would probably sign up for free
service from a search engine or other general site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assumed that if they're signing up through Simpsons.com
rather than through one of the portals that offer free service,
it's because they're a fan,'' he said.

Questions and answers about buying drugs online 
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Q: Some Web sites offer to prescribe a
medication for the first time based on a questionnaire. Is this
safe?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Many online practitioners issue prescriptions in the
absence of a physical exam or direct medical supervision. Patients
may receive an inappropriate drug and sacrifice the opportunity for
a correct diagnosis. The patient may have an underlying condition
unknown to the online pharmacist and could be hurt by the drug
dispensed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can consumers find out of they are paying too much for an
Internet prescription?
</P>
<P>
   A: Compare prices with your local pharmacy. An online pharmacy
may be able to offer a drug at a lower price because of lower
operating costs. However, sometimes, online pharmacies offer a drug
at a reduced price because the product is not the real thing or is
a foreign copy of a drug approved by the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is the FDA cracking down on Internet drug sales?
</P>
<P>
   A: FDA and state boards of pharmacy and medicine are responding
to the increasing number of Web sites offering prescription drugs
in violation of state and federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is FDA concerned about unlawful drug sales?
</P>
<P>
   A: Patients who buy prescription drugs from an illegitimate site
are at risk of side effects from inappropriately prescribed
medications, dangerous drug interactions, contaminated drugs and
possible ill effects from impure or unknown ingredients in
unapproved drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there any benefits to purchasing approved drugs online?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. The chief benefits are the speed and ease of
choosing and ordering and the relative privacy of the Internet. In
general, online pharmacies don't have a physical building and
significant savings can be passed on to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What charges will FDA bring against illegal Internet sellers
or prescribers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Depending on the nature and severity of the violation, a
person may face civil and criminal penalties, including seizure of
their product, fines and imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do foreign Web sites pose any greater danger to U.S.
consumers than domestic sites?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The FDA cannot ensure that imported drugs are made under
the same standards or stored and distributed under the same
conditions as drugs made for U.S. use.

HERE'S INSTANT ACCESS TO YOUR SECRETS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: If I use AOL Instant Messenger at work, is
there any record of my ``conversations'' on its server? Also, if I
check my home e-mail through a mail viewer on my work computer, is
there a record? _ Guilty Conscience
</P>
<P>
   Dear Guilty: OK, for the last time, never do any personal stuff
at work. Nobody's accusing you of carrying on a lurid, seamy,
disgusting online romance _ although I briefly had an interesting
fantasy about that _ but you shouldn't take the chance that your
boss is a prying weasel with no regard for your privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you have any. You're working on company equipment,
using company software, doing company business. Your letter to
HotPants202 is company property if you sent it from the office.
Your instant messages belong to the company, too.
</P>
<P>
   I would hope that most companies trust employees not to abuse
Internet access. Sure, everyone takes a quick surf to sites that
have nothing to do with business. Even I occasionally check the
lowest fares to Las Vegas, although I consider that to be
journalistic research in case I ever need to answer a question
about probability theory. Just be aware that the technology exists
to record your every keystroke and that any site you visit on the
Internet can be logged by a boss who really wants to.
</P>
<P>
   I was serious about that research. Honest. I even took notes.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: When I send pictures via Outlook Express, all
the recipients get is a jumble of text. _ Picture Imperfect
</P>
<P>
   Dear Imperfect: Wouldn't it be nice if everybody in the world
had the same e-mail program and used the same type of computer? Of
course, pigs will be airborne long before that ever happens,
especially with the way things are shaping up for the guys at
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook Express has a nice little feature that lets senders
embed pictures directly in a letter. Of course, you need a
compatible e-mail program to actually see the picture on the
receiving end.
</P>
<P>
   To send anything more complex than plain text, e-mail programs
convert files into strings of letters and numbers that represent
all the different bytes that make up your picture of Junior
drooling in his oatmeal.
</P>
<P>
   While not all programs understand embedded pictures, most of
them can handle attached files. Pick ``File attachment'' instead of
``Picture'' from the Insert menu.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: My aunt's e-mail service carrier is Microsoft's
Hotmail, which she uses for a business. However, for the past six
weeks, she has not been able to access any e-mail. _ Not So Hot
</P>
<P>
   Dear Hot: At least you're getting a level of service
proportional to what you're paying: nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Hotmail and all those other ``free'' e-mail services are fine
for many things. They let you check mail from any computer
connected to the Internet. They let you hide behind a flashy
nickname when you request information on Viagra. They even let you
receive mail from your regular Internet provider while you're on
the road. I'd never bet the business on a freebie mail account,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Your aunt's Internet provider should have its own mail server,
and if it doesn't, it's time to open the Yellow Pages. Remember,
nobody can force you to stay with a provider that doesn't give you
good service unless you sign a long-term contract. Did I mention
that you should never sign a long-term contract? &QL;

<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. _ Denny's, which has faced complaints of
racism over the years, is now sponsoring an essay contest for
students to write about influential African-Americans in their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Denny's, a subsidiary of the Advantica Restaurant Group Inc. of
Spartanburg, announced Tuesday that it would award $35,000 in
scholarships during its first Young Visionaries Essay Competition.
</P>
<P>
   The chain will work with the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund,
an organization providing leadership development and scholarships
for thousands of students, in an effort to pay tribute to
African-Americans who have touched the lives of students.
</P>
<P>
   The contest, which has been in the planning stages for several
months, is open to high school juniors and seniors nationwide.
Essays of up to 1,500 words must be written on the topic, ``The
Living African-American Who Most Inspires My Vision for the Future
of America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that the scholarships will be an incentive for
students to enter,'' said Debbie Atkins, the chain's public
relations manager. ``They can find rules and entry forms on the
Denny's Web site, www.dennys.com, or at participating Denny's
restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand-prize winner will receive a $25,000 scholarship. Ten
regional winners will get $1,000 scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   The grand-prize winner will also receive a trip to the 2001
Trumpet Awards in Atlanta. Black Issues Book Review will publish
the winning essay in its July/August issue.
</P>
<P>
   John Romandetti, Denny's president and CEO, said he hopes the
contest will help fulfill the dreams of students seeking higher
education.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and school administrators will be mailed letters this
week announcing the contest. The company also plans to advertise
the contest on the radio and in several magazines, including Ebony
and Jet.

WARNER'S TALE IS ONE OF RAGS TO RICHES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)  (bl) 
 By LOWELL COHN   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kurt Warner is you, and Kurt Warner is me.
</P>
<P>
   He is the ordinary guy down the street who has fantasies about
being famous, mere fantasies. But somehow, because of luck or
skill, or as Warner believes, because of God, every one of those
fantasies has come true. On Sunday, he will be the St.Louis Rams'
starting quarterback in the Super Bowl. It's as if you or I will be
starting, as if Warner is doing it as a proxy for us. Because of
that, his story is both heartwarming and totally unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   He threw 41 touchdown passes this season and was named the NFL's
Most Valuable Player, but before the season began no one ever heard
of him, except for his wife and a few close friends. I bet you
couldn't have picked him out of a lineup.
</P>
<P>
   His story is so strange, it reads like a fairy tale. It says in
the Rams media guide that he played college ball at Northern Iowa.
It doesn't say much else. They wrote the media guide before Warner
became famous. So he got about a page total. In the 49ers guide
Steve Young rates 28 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The thing about Northern Iowa is that Warner found the place
kind of frustrating. He didn't play until his fifth year, or as he
admitted Tuesday at Super Bowl Media Day, ``I didn't know if I'd
ever see the field in college.'' Oh, he saw the field, all right.
It just took him four years to get on it.
</P>
<P>
   After college, he didn't get drafted into the NFL, but the Green
Bay Packers, who already had Brett Favre, Ty Detmer and Mark
Brunell, signed Warner as a spare arm. It's no surprise that his
stay in Green Bay was short and unhappy. Favre tormented him,
calling him Pops, as in Pop Warner. Favre also made Warner carry
his helmet after practice, which Warner did until the Packers cut
him.
</P>
<P>
   So far, you'll admit, this story is not exactly uplifting _
except that Warner persevered.
</P>
<P>
   He took a job at the HY-VE Supermarket (pronounced High-Vee) in
Cedar Falls, Iowa. It was a night job stocking shelves for five
bucks an hour, and it let Warner keep his days free to practice
football. Sometimes if things were slow he'd toss a Nerf football
to the assistant manager near the green beans and broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   He would tell friends he'd make it back to the NFL, and they'd
shine him on. ``What are you going to say?'' Warner told reporters.
``You're not going to crush a person's dream and say, `You'll never
get back.' At the time I was working in a supermarket. People don't
expect you to get back. I can't blame them.''
</P>
<P>
   He left HY-VE and tried to get into the Canadian League. Were
they interested up north? Don't be ridiculous. Finally, he signed
on with the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena League, but he almost
got cut after a bad preseason debut. OK, the guy was great in three
seasons in the Arena League. So what? We're talking indoor football
here. We're talking smaller field. We're talking rinky-dink game
with players no one ever heard of or wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Based on his Arena performance, the Rams signed Warner and
shipped him off to NFL Europe, which is sort of an adjunct league,
or an afterthought league, not that anyone over here actually
thinks about it. Warner tore up the league for the Amsterdam
Admirals. On Tuesday, someone asked Warner if the fans in Amsterdam
knew a touchdown is worth six points. ``I don't know if they knew
it was six points,'' he said, ``but they knew it was good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams were sufficiently impressed to make him their
third-string quarterback last season. He was impressive with a
clipboard, but playing was another thing entirely. He didn't do
much of it, playing the fourth quarter of the last game of the
season. Period.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to protect players in the expansion draft for
the Cleveland Browns, the Rams most definitely did not protect
Warner. If Cleveland took him, so be it. Luckily for the Rams, the
Browns passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think Cleveland would draft me,'' Warner said. ``I
was a guy nobody knew. The Rams didn't even know about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow he was named No.2 quarterback behind Trent Green heading
into this season. The gap between No. 1 and No. 2 was Grand Canyon
in size. The Rams signed Green to a huge free-agent contract and
committed their future to him. Then he destroyed his knee in
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   How did head coach Dick Vermeil respond? He broke down in tears.
He was undoubtedly crying over losing Green. But he was also crying
over Warner and the thought of trusting the Rams to him. In the day
that followed, he wrestled with the idea of luring Jeff Hostetler
out of retirement. A reporter who covers the Rams says Vermeil had
to be talked out of Hostetler.
</P>
<P>
   And then Warner took over at age 28, for heaven's sake, and
became the most exciting quarterback in the NFL, maybe the most
exciting player. It's as if someone cast a magic spell, and the
magic could vanish on Sunday. ``There are people out there who
still don't believe I'm for real,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's story is not merely a sports story. In 1997, he married
his wife Brenda, who already had two children. Zachary, now 10, had
been dropped on his head when he was four months old, and was blind
and learning disabled. Warner adopted Brenda's children, and took
on the challenge of Zachary. He gets good-guy points for that.
</P>
<P>
   It is an astonishing fact that Warner earned the league minimum
of $250,000 this season, although the Rams recently kicked in
another half million as a bonus for being terrific. From Brenda
Warner's point of view, money is hardly an issue. ``Seven years
ago, I was on food stamps,'' she said. ``We didn't have enough
money to go get Happy Meals.''
</P>
<P>
   That's called putting things in perspective. Here's another
version of perspective, this time from MVP Warner. ``Three years
ago I had nothing,'' he said calmly. ``Now I have everything. Three
years from now I might have nothing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen.

ABORTION A FAMILY DECISION, MCCAIN SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ The abortion issue surfaced again Wednesday
after Senator John McCain, answering a hypothetical question about
what he would do if his 15-year-old daughter had an unwanted
pregnancy, said, ``The final decision would be made by Meghan.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Arizona Republican, already under fire from
conservatives who accuse him of not being staunchly against
abortion, quickly clarified his statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I misspoke,'' he said. ``What I believe I was saying is that
this is a family decision. This family decision will be made by the
family and not by (his daughter) Meghan alone. And other than that,
I believe it is a private family matter. I am sorry if there was
any confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue comes as independent voters and perhaps some moderate
Democrats are deciding whom to vote for in Tuesday's primary. One
deciding factor for that group may be the question of abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The issue comes at a critical time when New Hampshire
independent voters and perhaps some moderate Democrats who are
deciding who to vote for in Tuesday's primary and one deciding
factor for that group may be abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Republican contender Alan Keyes, a fierce opponent of abortion,
said McCain's clarification still suggested some element of choice
would be involved. He said that if one of his daughters were in
that situation, there will be no doubt about carrying the baby to
term.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter has been raised to believe that that's God's
decision and that it's already been made, and therefore I have no
fear of what she would do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Governor George W. Bush of Texas also has faced frequent
questions about his antiabortion convictions and previously was
asked a slightly different question: what he would do if one of his
relatives faced such a decision because of rape. ``It would be up
to her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During an earlier debate, conservative activist Gary Bauer said
under circumstances of rape he would pray for his daughter ``and
explain to her that she couldn't make right the terrible thing that
had happened to her by taking the life of her innocent, unborn
child.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the personal nature of the question upset McCain and
his wife, Cindy, who said they were going to call their daughter in
Phoenix, as well as warn the Catholic school she attends that the
campaign had involved her.
</P>
<P>
   The hypothetical issue arose during a freewheeling discussion
about abortion, an increasingly common topic on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would not impose an abortion litmus test on
Supreme Court nominees.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter then asked whether, if his daughter had an unwanted
pregnancy, ``would you tell her that she could not get an
abortion?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' McCain said. ``I would discuss this issue with Cindy and
Meghan. It would be a private family discussion that we would share
within our family and not with anyone else. Obviously, I would
encourage her to know that the baby would be brought up in a warm
and loving family. The final decision would be made by Meghan with
our advice and counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed on whether his answer were essentially a prochoice
decision, McCain said it was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's the choice position to say that my
daughter, my wife, and I are going to discuss something that is a
family matter,'' he said. ``I'm not going to talk about what I'm
going to do with my daughter in the most personal and painful kind
of a situation that I can imagine, outside of a terminal illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the discussion, McCain added that he is ``prolife, and
I will continue to hold that view, but there are areas that are
sacred to the family, and that's one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   About 90 minutes after McCain issued his revised statement, his
wife Cindy became upset when a reporter asked him to clarify
whether he would allow his daughter to terminate a pregnancy in the
case of rape or incest, exceptions he endorses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a 15-year-old daughter,'' Cindy McCain said, shaking
her head and struggling to hold back tears.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, clearly shaken, added: ``I simply will not discuss those
aspects of this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain has repeatedly said he is against abortion, in
recent days he has stated that he would seek to change the
Republican Party platform to allow abortion in cases of rape,
incest, and a threat to the life of the mother. Antiabortion
activists have targeted McCain, as a result.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said there was another reason for their attacks.
``Their arguments against me are strictly in campaign finance
reform,'' he said, referring to opposition to soft-money
contributions that antiabortion groups, among many others, receive
to run campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
   However, McCain pointed out he has ``17 years of prolife
voting'' and wants legislation to reverse the Supreme Court's
landmark 1973 decision, Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion. Such
legislation would allow states to decide the matter, he said. He
also supports parental notification and consent, which Arizona law
requires for minors seeking an abortion.

 TITANS' McNAIR DOESN'T PUT UP THE NUMBERS, JUST THE WINS  
(bl) 
 By DAVE WILLIAMS   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To find one player who represents the essence of the
Tennessee Titans, look no further than quarterback Steve McNair.
</P>
<P>
   He's a tough guy who gets the job done without flash or razzle
dazzle. And no matter how many good things he and the Titans have
done in the playoffs, they're always greeted by ``yeah ... but.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the AFC Championship against the Jacksonville Jaguars,
a team they defeated twice in the regular season, the Titans were
told:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but it's too difficult to beat the same team three
times.''
</P>
<P>
   With McNair leading the way, the Titans blew out the Jaguars to
reach the Super Bowl for the first time in the 40-year history of
the franchise. That performance converted some disbelievers, but
McNair and crew still have many detractors, particularly the
oddsmakers who have made the Rams a seven-point favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Hold it. Didn't the Titans beat the Rams, 24-21, in the regular
season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but that game was played in Nashville on grass. The
Super Bowl is in the Georgia Dome on artificial turf.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair has heard ``yeah ... but'' throughout his five-year
career, but shakes it off like oncoming pass rushers and, like the
Titans, keeps plugging forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like being labeled the underdog,'' McNair said. ``Regardless
of what people say, we've found a way to win. You can't control
what people say about your team, so the only thing you can do is go
out and win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, McNair finds himself in the same predicament as
Doug Williams. Both were African-American quarterbacks who were
first-round draft choices from predominantly black colleges in the
Southwest Athletic Conference. McNair attended Alcorn State;
Williams went to Grambling. In 1988, Williams led the Washington
Redskins to a Super Bowl victory over the Denver Broncos, who had
one of the game's glamour quarterbacks in John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   McNair is playing second fiddle to the Rams' Kurt Warner, the
league MVP who threw 41 touchdown passes this season.
</P>
<P>
   There is one subtle difference between McNair and Williams.
Williams was drafted by Tampa Bay but the Buccaneers basically gave
up on him when he didn't get the team into the Super Bowl in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   McNair is the first African-American quarterback to lead the
team that drafted him into the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug Williams definitely inspired me,'' McNair said. ``Even
playing against his alma mater was special to me. It was a blessing
for him to be able to get somewhere where he could win a Super
Bowl. But even still, to see what he was able to do at this level
was an inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair hasn't had to endure the smothering hype that surrounded
Williams, who was the first African-American to start at
quarterback in a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Winning football games hasn't brought McNair the widespread
acclaim that other quarterbacks in similar situations have
received. He gets knocked for not throwing touchdowns at warp-speed
rate, a la Warner. He's chided for not being the classic pocket
passer like Indianapolis' Peyton Manning.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't let the lack of respect bother him, nor do his
teammates, who realize that McNair may be the best athlete playing
quarterback. They know he's certainly one of the toughest hombres
in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   McNair missed five games because of surgery Sept. 19 to repair a
bulging disc in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really scared that my season would be over,'' McNair
said. ``That would have been a big disappointment because we felt
all along that we had a good enough team to get to where we are.
And it would have really hurt me had I not been able to be part of
all this.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair has played throughout the playoffs with a painful
turf-toe injury. He showed up at Tuesday's Media Day wearing a
protective boot on his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Those setbacks haven't stopped McNair from leading his team to a
12-2 record as a starter this season. And it's his ability to rise
above his personal adversity that has inspired unyielding loyalty
from his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``His attitude, his toughness ... that's what makes Steve what
he is,'' said Titans running back Eddie George, the team's vocal
leader. ``Steve is a guy who's going to find a way to beat you,
whether it's with his arm or his legs. And he puts it on the line
every single play. I've seen this guy take some hits that makes me
wonder how he does it. He just keeps battling back. He fights hard
through the pain. He's the typical throwback quarterback. He plays
hurt and just gets the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair, in his last 12 games, has thrown only eight touchdown
passes, including five in the 15th game of the season against
Jacksonville. Statistics from his playoff performances are
unimpressive. He was 14 of 23 for 112 yards with one scoring pass
and two touchdown runs in the AFC title game. The week before, he
was 13 of 24 for 112 yards and no touchdowns against Indianapolis.
And in the wild-card game against Buffalo, he was 13 of 24 for 76
yards and one rushing touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The perception is that McNair is riding the wave of the Titans'
aggressive defense. But there's been no doubt that McNair was the
superior player to Manning, Buffalo's Rob Johnson and
Jacksonville's Mark Brunell. All are considered prototypical NFL
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did they win or did they lose?'' McNair asked. ``Look, there
have been a lot of 300-yard passers who don't always win. I don't
go out trying to take over games. I know I've got a great cast of
players around me. There are a lot of guys on this team who can
make plays. I just try not to force anything or do stupid things
with the football.''
</P>
<P>
   Said 17-year veteran offensive lineman Bruce Matthews: ``One of
the things I love about Steve is that he understands that a group
of men can get a lot more done when no one worries about who's
going to get the glory.''

<P>
   Supply pipes are the thin tubes under a sink or toilet,
typically 3/8-inch in diameter, that carry water from the shutoff
valves up to the fixtures. The most common type is straight
chrome-plated copper pipe. All home centers, hardware stores and
plumbing suppliers stock it. Some stores carry the pipe with bright
brass or antique plating to match yellow-metal fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   Supply pipe comes in standard lengths. For most installations it
must be cut and bent to align with the fittings. You can use a
hacksaw to cut the pipe, but it is difficult to hold it securely
without crimping it; it is better to use a tubing cutter, a
clamplike tool with two cutting wheels, one fixed and one
adjustable.
</P>
<P>
   To use the cutter, place the pipe in the jaws and tighten the
handle to engage the cutting wheels. Rotate the cutter around the
pipe, tightening the handle after each revolution so the cutting
wheels bite deeper. Continue rotating the tool until the pipe is
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Supply pipe can be bent by hand, but this usually creates kinks
in the tube. Professional plumbers use a spring bender, available
for about $12 at most home centers. The bender is a large spring
with a funnel at one end. Slip the pipe through the funnel into the
spring end, and bend it to the desired shape. The spring will
support the pipe and keep it from kinking. Try to bend the pipe
only at the center, and keep the ends as straight as possible. This
will make it easier to mate the pipe to the fittings and prevent
leaks.
</P>
<P>
   If these techniques seem difficult, there are other types of
supply pipes that are easier to work with. These include braided
stainless steel, ribbed chrome and flexible plastic. They range in
price from $2 to $8.
</P>
<P>
   Braided stainless steel pipe is the most expensive. It is a
flexible pipe with a braided stainless steel covering. Some dealers
also stock the pipe with a white plastic covering or a braided
nylon covering. These pipes are also the easiest to install because
they are extremely flexible and require no cutting. Buy the
approximate length and bend it to fit between the fittings.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other types, braided stainless steel pipes already
have connector nuts attached to the ends. Hookup is simply a matter
of twisting the nuts onto the fittings.
</P>
<P>
   Ribbed chrome pipe is made so it can be bent by hand without
special tools. The ribbed structure keeps the walls from collapsing
as you bend it. One end has about 4 inches of straight pipe to
allow for cutting the pipe to length. A word of caution: this pipe
bends easily, but too much bending and flexing can cause it to
crack or break around the ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic supply pipe is cheap, can be cut to length with a
utility knife and is easily bent to fit into position between
fittings. Unfortunately it is also ugly, so it should only be used
where the plumbing is enclosed.
</P>
<P>
   When you buy a supply pipe, look carefully at the ends. One end
is straight; the other has a flange. Supply pipes for sinks have
cone-shaped flanges; supply pipes for toilets have flat flanges. Be
sure to purchase the right pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Before attempting to replace a supply pipe, close the shutoff
valve to stop the water flow. Bend the pipe so it mates with the
shutoff valve and the fixture nipple, then check to see if it is
the right length. Cut off any excess if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Slide the connector nuts onto the pipe. The nuts are standard
sizes and are supplied with the fixtures and shutoff valve. If they
are missing, you can purchase replacements at home centers or
plumbing suppliers. Connect the pipe to the fixture first.
Hand-tighten the connector nut, then use an adjustable wrench to
give it an extra quarter turn. Do not over-tighten the nut; you
could strip the threads.
</P>
<P>
   Before twisting the connector nut onto the shutoff valve, slip
the compression sleeve onto the pipe end. The sleeve is a small
brass ring that wedges between the supply pipe and the interior of
the shutoff valve to create a watertight seal. Sleeves, also
supplied with the shutoff valve, are not needed for braided
stainless steel supply pipes. If you are installing a plastic
supply pipe, buy a plastic compression sleeve and discard the brass
one.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the supply pipe is securely seated into the shutoff
valve fitting, then tighten the connector nut and open the shutoff
valve to restore the water flow.

 &HT;    Health care racial gap gets priority
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton delivers his final State of
the Union speech tonight, he will note that minorities are lagging
behind whites in nearly every measure of good health.
</P>
<P>
   And as one way to erase that gap, Clinton is expected to tout a
minority health care initiative proposed by Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.)
and Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will announce that his budget request for next year
includes $20 million to establish a new center for research on
minority health care at the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's proposal, the center's research staff
would study racial and ethnic disparities in health care across the
nation, exploring why minorities face such dilemmas as a higher
infant mortality rate than whites and a larger number of heart
disease and diabetes cases.
</P>
<P>
   That is the cornerstone of legislation introduced last fall by
Lewis in the House and Kennedy in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Kennedy expressed their pleasure at the development.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will go a long way toward eliminating the disparity in
minority health care,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased that as part of his continued commitment to
minority health and fair health care to all Americans, President
Clinton will raise this important issue,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is starting to gain momentum in the House, with
51 sponsors, including Georgia Democrats Sanford Bisop and Cynthia
McKinney, signing up over the last six weeks alone.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the congressional support is coming from the Asian
Pacific Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus and the Hispanic
Caucus, but key Republicans also have signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the Republican supporters is Rep. Charlie Norwood
(R-Ga.). Norwood, a dentist from Augusta, Ga., is a key ally on
health care measures. He convinced 68 Republicans to vote against
the wishes of House Republican leaders last fall and support his
legislation to overhaul the managed health care industry.
</P>
<P>
   Other key Republicans supporting the measure include Rep. J.C.
Watts (R-Okla.), a member of the House leadership, and Dr. Louis
Sullivan, president of the Morehouse School of Medicine and
secretary of health and human services in the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is troubled that minorities are still struggling to get
equal medical care more than three decades after the Civil Rights
Act was signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it shows that we still have a great distance to go
before we end the impact of racism in all aspects of American
life,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the factors behind the disparity in health care is lack
of health insurance, according to the Commonwealth Fund, a New
York-based nonprofit organization that studies health care issues.
A recent Commonwealth study found that while 14 percent of white
Americans do not have health insurance, 24 percent of
African-Americans and 38 percent of Hispanics report they are
without coverage.

COURT CONFIRMS CONSTITUTIONALITY OF ABORTION CLINIC BUFFER ZONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dealing a legal blow to anti-abortion demonstrators,
Massachusetts' highest court says a bill to create 25-foot,
protest-free buffer zones around abortion clinics does not violate
constitutional freedoms of speech and assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Judicial Court's opinion, which had been sought by
the state Senate, comes as Beacon Hill lawmakers again prepare to
debate the controversial legislation. The bill has twice passed the
Senate amid lengthy debate over its constitutionality, but died in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   Haunted by the 1994 shootings at two Brookline abortion clinics
that left two women dead, supporters of buffer zones have long
argued that they are necessary to protect clinic patients from
violence and frightening harassment. Abortion opponents, meanwhile,
say that buffer zones infringe on their First Amendment rights to
free speech and free assembly.
</P>
<P>
   But the high court, in a 12-page ruling Wednesday, noted that
the proposed zone still allows gatherings of any type and size by
protesters -- or supporters, for that matter -- and permits
demonstrators to communicate with persons entering or leaving
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demonstrators may still engage in all forms of protest as they
previously have done, but are simply constrained to do so outside
the buffer zone,'' the court wrote. ``To be sure, they cannot place
a leaflet directly in the hand of a patient within the zone, but
they can certainly show that they have one to offer, and an
interested patient can walk over easily to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Susan C. Fargo, a Lincoln Democrat who is the lead
sponsor of the measure, said she was ``thrilled'' by the opinion,
which she said confirms that the bill ``balances the public needs
of protecting public safety, First Amendment rights, and the right
of women to access health care.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed bufffer ``will not prevent anyone from expressing
their views about anything,'' Fargo said, but will protect clinic
patients from what US Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist
has called ``in-your-face harassment'': demonstrators who chase,
spit and scream at patients, and block them from leaving or
entering their cars.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's supporters also noted that many women visit
reproductive health clinics not to end pregnancies, but simply to
receive basic health care, yet are confronted by protesters
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights opponents roundly criticized the SJC's opinion,
saying it unfairly muzzles pro-life demonstrators and threatens to
open a ``Pandora's box'' of legislation restricting other types of
protesters, including organized labor, environmentalists, and
animal right activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wrongful infringement on the right of people to
express a viewpoint, and the only people who will be affected are
people who are expressing a view that's pro-life,'' said Quincy
Democrat Stephen A. Tobin, House chairman of the Joint Committee on
Criminal Justice, who tried to defeat the bill with a parliamentary
maneuver last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how this bill does anything but try to make
abortion factories a little easier to have access to and to run
more efficiently,'' Tobin added, vowing to vote against the bill if
it reaches the House.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the buffer zones would be the first enacted into
state law. Buffers have been created by court injunction at clinics
throughout the country, but none has been made permanent through
statute. And injunctions against protesters have been issued only
after they have disrupted clinics or made violent threats.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill becomes law, supporters said, Wednesday's opinion
hints at how the SJC would rule if the new law was challenged in
court.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion ``removed the central barrier that we faced, which
was a rumbling among some folks that this might not be
constitutional,'' said Melissa Kogut, spokeswoman for the
Massachusetts affiliate of the National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's opinion ``removes any doubt about that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts, which opposes
the bill, called the high court's opinion ``a defeat for the First
Amendment and a victory for a powerful special interest.''
</P>
<P>
   According to C.J. Doyle, executive director of the league,
buffer zones ``criminalize peaceful protests'' and ``do nothing
whatsoever to enhance the physical security of abortion clincs, and
everything to penalize law-abiding citizens practicing non-violent
opposition to abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The real purpose of the legislation, Doyle said, is to prevent
women seeking abortions from talking to so-called sidewalk
counselors who suggest alternatives to ending pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said he doubted that a buffer zone would have prevented
the murderous rampage by John Salvi, the shooter in the 1994
killings.
</P>
<P>
   But Pam Nourse, a spokeswoman for the Planned Parenthood League
of Massachusetts, said that while a buffer may not stop someone
like Salvi, ``What it will do is help protect public safety by
reducing the climate of anger and hostility in front of clinics
now.''

PAKISTAN CURBS INDEPENDENCE OF JUDGES  
</HEADLINE>
  (dal)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Pakistan's military government sharply
curtailed the independence of the nation's judiciary on Wednesday,
by requiring all higher court judges to swear an oath of office
that would bar them from challenging army decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice of the Supreme Court, Said-uz Zaman Siddiqi,
refused to take the pledge and was immediately replaced. Five more
of the court's 13 justices also declined, according to a state-run
Pakistani news agency.
</P>
<P>
   This demand for allegiance from judges coincided with the
opening of the much-delayed trial of ousted Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif, who, along with six others, is accused of multiple
offenses, including hijacking and attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   In a special anti-terrorism court in Karachi, defense attorneys
in the Sharif case asked for yet another postponement, this time
until the Supreme Court could act on a petition that challenges the
legality of the Oct. 12 military coup.
</P>
<P>
   The motion was denied and testimony began.
</P>
<P>
   That petition pending with the Supreme Court was filed by
Sharif's political party, the Pakistan Muslim League. A hearing is
scheduled for Monday, and, many observers say, the military was
concerned about a losing outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after taking power, Gen. Pervez Musharraf had sought to
avert such difficulties. He suspended the constitution and replaced
it with Provisional Order No. 1, which restrained the judiciary
from contesting his rule. Still, the courts have accepted several
challenges to military authority.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the army's stern hand, the general has tried to project
his government as benign, liberal and incorruptible. He has
repeatedly promised fair trials, even as he has kept several
members of the Sharif government locked up without being charged.
</P>
<P>
   Now, human rights advocates say even the pretense of impartial
justice is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``By its swearing of new allegiance, the judiciary has become a
creature not of the constitution but of the army chief of staff,''
said Afrasiab Khattak of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Fakhruddin G. Ibrahim, a respected jurist, said, ``Access to an
independent judiciary is the birthright of every citizen for which
everybody aspires. Now nobody knows about the fate of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's move was not entirely unexpected. Pakistan's
last military ruler, Zia ul-Haq, required similar oaths of loyalty
from judges.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf was present at one of Wednesday's swearing-in
ceremonies, listening to judges who agreed to abide by the
provisions of his 14-week-old emergency orders. His defense of the
proceedings was brief and boilerplate: ``Whatever has happened is
in the interests of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   After a day of hostile reaction, however, officials decided to
add a more polished reply with a written statement: ``The
government invites international observers to visit Pakistan and
observe the totally free and fair manner in which all court
proceedings take place.''
</P>
<P>
   The oaths were required of those judges presiding in the Supreme
Court, the High Courts and the federal Shariah Courts, which
administer Islamic law. At least nine High Court judges from three
provinces have declined to take the pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Siddiqi, who is 62 and due to retire in two years,
spoke to reporters after rejecting the vow. ``I have not
resigned,'' he said. ``I have refused to take oath under the
provisional constitution because it would mean that I am deviating
from my earlier oath.''
</P>
<P>
   In the anti-terrorism court, the Sharif case is being presided
over by Judge Rehmat Hussain Jafri. According to several lawyers,
Judge Jafri's position is too junior to require the new pledge.
</P>
<P>
   As the trial began, the prosecution called its star witness,
Aminullah Chaudhry, the former chief of the Civil Aviation
Authority and a codefendant in the case until he agreed to testify
against the others in exchange for an offer of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Sharif stem from Oct. 12, when he allegedly
conspired to prevent a commercial jetliner from landing safely
within Pakistan. Aboard the plane were 198 people, including
Musharraf, whom the prime minister had just fired as army chief.
The aircraft eventually touched down without damage in Karachi, but
only after the general's staff began the coup and took over the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif tried to make sure ``this particular flight should not be
allowed to land at any airport in Pakistan,'' Chaudhry said in
court.

 &HT;    Coke tries to soften blow of layoffs with generous parting
package
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Departing Coca-Cola workers will leave with one of the
more generous severance packages in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-year employee whose job is being eliminated stands to get
at least 40 weeks of pay, as well as 18 months of company-paid
health benefits under a plan outlined by company officials
Wednesday. Other factors could make that total even higher.
</P>
<P>
   The company is using a combination of measures to trim jobs:
early retirement, outsourcing and outright elimination of jobs. All
told, some 6,000 jobs will disappear worldwide, about 2,500 of them
in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The severance package is ``well above and beyond the standard
out there for other large corporations in the recent past,'' said
Daniel Rodriguez, an Emory University assistant professor who has
been tracking the economic impact of downsizings on workers since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Employees 52 or older with at least seven years with the company
are eligible for early retirement, said spokesman Rob Baskin. Those
who opt for early retirement will be credited with three additional
years of service, meaning they will be treated as 55-year-olds with
10 years of service, which means higher retirement benefits. They
also will get a bonus for taking retirement now, Baskin said.
</P>
<P>
   Affected workers also will get help with resume, job search and
other outplacement services, Baskin said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's parting package is the latest example of how
companies, hoping to soften the sting of massive job cuts, are
offering more generous severance packages than workers got in
downsizings in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, San Francisco-based Levi Strauss, a company known for a
no-layoff policy, stunned corporate America by cutting 6,400 jobs
and closing 11 plants. It gave workers a total of $200 million in
payments: three weeks' pay for every year of service, $500 when
they got a new job and a $6,000 allowance to relocate, retrain or
start a business. Such generosity is a turnaround from the
downsizing that took place in the 1980s, Rodriguez said. Back then,
many workers were let go without warning and little, if any,
severance pay.
</P>
<P>
   Now, by law, companies must give workers 60 days' notice when
their jobs are being cut. ``Companies have really gotten good at
taking care of folks they've displaced,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the layoffs and the severance packages have helped some
workers.
</P>
<P>
   When Turner Broadcasting was bought by Time Warner in 1996, a
number of executives lost their jobs. Many left with $500,000 to $1
million in severance pay, which they then used to start their own
companies. Former Turner executive Bert Ellis, for example, founded
Ellis Communication and later IXL.

<P>
   DUNKIRK, France _ Bruno Frydman had few illusions when he set up
shop in Paris in 1993 to build the kind of multiplex theaters that
helped revolutionize moviegoing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Though Frydman works for a subsidiary of a U.S. company, he is
French and well aware of how passionately attached the French can
be to homegrown culture. So, when he was asked by his company to
open multiplex movie theaters all around Europe, he based his
operations in Paris, thinking that if he could make it there, he
could make it anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it took him six years to get his latest and biggest
project built _ a 20-screen, 4,010-seat site in a harborside
shopping center in Dunkirk, a port city of 71,000 on the Straits of
Dover, known for its tragic role in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   His experience shows that he was right not to underestimate
French pride in their film heritage or the resistance of big
domestic multiplex developers like Gaumont, Pathe and UGC. And he
knew just how strong opposition in Europe can be to the way
suburban malls _ often anchored by multiplexes _ chew up the
landscape. Which is why he focused on urban projects.
</P>
<P>
   But although similar resistance to sprawl is growing in the
United States, in Europe the struggle to preserve historic towns is
even more crucial: Urban culture is what defines much of the
continent, and the old buildings and churches of inner cities are
as important to tourist appeal as are museums and natural beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this tricky atmosphere, Frydman (pronounced FREED-man),
whose company had been recruited by local officials and business
groups, managed to get the multiplex built. Success came in part
because local politicians, fearful themselves for the future of the
city center, blunted environmentalists' concerns by putting the
mall next to old downtown shopping streets. But it was also a
result of some tough and creative negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Frydman's company, AMC Europe SA _ a unit of AMC Entertainment,
the group that pioneered multiple-screen movie theaters in the
United States _ opened the $20 million theater complex here in late
November as part of a $110 million shopping mall. Featuring not
only American hits like ``Just Married,'' with Julia Roberts, but
also French films like the popular comedy ``Kennedy and Me,'' the
multiplex has been drawing 15,000 moviegoers a week, not far from
the 20,000 that AMC expects when it is at full speed.
</P>
<P>
   Dunkirk and its harborside multiplex illustrate a difficult
choice facing Europeans. While some fear for the future of local
film industries, developers and theater operators are convincing
local planners that downtown shopping centers anchored by large
multiplex movie theaters can help offset a decline in the vitality
of inner cities. (AMC has been using similar arguments in the
United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as multiplexes have spread across Europe in the last
decade, the number of moviegoers has soared, to 895 million in 1999
from 757 million just five years earlier. Thanks mainly to the
explosion of multiplexes, the number of screens rose to 27,466 from
23,108 five years earlier. In Dunkirk, where the decline of heavy
industries like steel and chemicals and a drop in port activity
have fostered decay in the inner city _ driving unemployment to 15
percent, well above the national average of 10.8 percent _ the
complex that houses Frydman's multiplex created 600 jobs. About
2,000 people applied for the 109 jobs created by the multiplex
alone, said Arnaud Charron, its managing director.
</P>
<P>
   But the spread of multiplexes has done little to solidify the
position of local filmmaking in Europe, where American-made movies
reign supreme at the box office and the commercial success of local
films is erratic. In 1998, for instance, the last full year for
which statistics are available, the share of American movies in two
of the biggest markets, Britain and Germany, climbed to more than
80 percent, from less than 70 percent in 1997, when strong European
entries like the British hit ``The Full Monty'' briefly bolstered
the European share. In France, the American share reached almost 70
percent, from slightly above 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Karsten Grummitt, managing director of Dodona Research, which
follows the film industry, said that ``in France and Italy,
particularly, where governments protect the film industry,
multiplexes are viewed as an intrinsically American plan that lead
to American domination of the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In another sting to European pride, the spread of multiplexes
has hastened the demise of the grand old movie palaces of the 1920s
and 1930s. In Britain, the preservation group English Heritage is
pressing the government to add 30 theaters from the glory days of
moviegoing before World War II to a list of 120 that enjoy
protected status, though some now serve as bingo halls or churches.
The mayor of Paris, Jean Tiberi, has asked the French government
for help in preserving La Pagode, a faux-Japanese movie theater
that is a Parisian landmark, and the Champollion, a movie buffs'
sanctuary that was once the haunt of the director Francois
Truffaut.
</P>
<P>
   Such conservation efforts have not slowed the spread of the
multiplex. In Barcelona, Spain, AMC is putting the finishing
touches on a 20-screen outlet in a megamall of 220 stores and
restaurants on the site of a former locomotive works. In
Manchester, England, developers are transforming a disused cotton
mill into a shopping mall anchored by a multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are not lacking. The Barcelona project is a joint
venture of Hines Interests, a Houston developer, and a French
partner, Jean Louis Solal. And the biggest financial backer of the
Dunkirk project was a Dutch pension fund, Wereldhave.
</P>
<P>
   After little more than a decade since the European debut of the
multiplex, some countries already face overbuilding.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, for example, a battle erupted earlier this year when
UGC of France announced that it would challenge a domestic company,
the Kinepolis Group, on its home turf. Kinepolis pioneered the
multiplex concept in 1988 with a 25-screen, 7,600-seat monster in
Brussels that remains Europe's largest. UGC hopes to capture at
least 20 percent of the Belgian market; Kinepolis has had well over
half.
</P>
<P>
   So many multiplexes have opened in Rome, where the number of
screens rose in the last year to 174 from 138, that Leandro Pesci,
managing director of the Safin theater chain of the Cecchi Gori
Group, recently complained, ``We're cannibalizing each other.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, none of this derailed the Dunkirk project. Among its
supporters is Bernard Montet, director of retail services of the
Dunkirk Chamber of Commerce, which backed the city's 1992 plan to
put a stop to suburban mall development (it ``sucked people out of
the center,'' he said) and promote a big shopping center near the
disused port site that would be anchored by a multiplex theater.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to create fresh retail space plus parking, so as to
draw people back into the city. Four local retailers and a Virgin
Superstore would move in along with five restaurants, including
McDonald's and the popular French seafood chain Leon de Bruxelles.
</P>
<P>
   To design the multiplex, the city sought out AMC. The French
theater operator Gaumont has a multiplex in nearby Calais and did
not want to create competition for its own screens. The other two
big domestic multiplex developers, UGC and Pathe, a unit of
Vivendi, took themselves out of the running for developer of the
project because they objected to details of the financing package,
which AMC was willing to accept.
</P>
<P>
   Though some local retailers feared the fresh competition that
the shopping center would bring, others welcomed it as a source of
fresh business, Montet said.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest disruption from the multiplex, of course, would be
faced by the two downtown movie houses _ an eight-screen outlet
along Rue Nationale and a 90-seat art house called Studio 43. So,
deals needed to be struck.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Nouveau, the city's chief finance official and a
supporter of the project, said the city negotiated an agreement
with its owners to close the Rue Nationale outlet, called Les
Arcades, and build apartments on the site.
</P>
<P>
   For Studio 43, the situation was trickier. The 90-seat theater
receives considerable financial support from the city and was
founded in the 1960's as part of the French government's effort to
sustain interest in high quality film and the national film
heritage. It shows French and foreign films, organizes film
seminars and visits by school classes and holds an annual film
festival.
</P>
<P>
   According to French law, the mall project required approval by a
seven-member commission that included representatives of the
national film industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nouveau and other city officials sought to convince Studio 43's
operators that the new multiplex would enhance film, rather than
hurt it. ``We argued that AMC would raise interest in films by
increasing people's taste for them,'' Nouveau said. `'Our goal, of
course, was to increase business in the downtown area.''
</P>
<P>
   Frydman aimed to convince Studio 43 that AMC was not likely to
be a fifth column for American movies: though many other multiplex
operators are part of big production and distribution companies,
Frydman said, AMC is solely in the business of running theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Fabrice Bassemon, a program director for Studio 43, said he
found himself in a quandary. The theater relies on city aid, yet
the city was now also the principal promoter of the new multiplex.
Indeed, the city's only other movie theater, Les Arcades, was to be
sacrificed to the development plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Studio 43 accepted a deal: the multiplex would be
built, and AMC would make several concessions to the theater. Among
them was an agreement that only Studio 43 would show non-French
movies, including popular American films, with the original
English-language soundtrack but with French subtitles; the
multiplex would show only dubbed versions. Moreover, leaflets with
the Studio 43 program would be distributed at no charge at the
multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   Bassemon is skeptical of the long-term effects of AMC's arrival,
though the development had been impossible to stop because of its
larger potential economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But the accord has brought short-term benefits, he acknowledged.
After all, Les Arcades, which was closed under the deal, had
competed with Studio 43 because it regularly featured on two of its
eight screens foreign films in the original soundtrack, with
subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   So, in December, while AMC showed dubbed French versions of
``Sleepy Hollow'' by Tim Burton and ``Sweet and Lowdown,'' the
latest from Woody Allen, Studio 43 featured them in the original
soundtracks with subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bizarre,'' Bassemon said, ``but that's the
accord.''
</P>
<P>
   Frydman says it was patience and the will to negotiate that
smoothed local acceptance of change. ``It's a political and
cultural process,'' he said. He paused, reflected, then added,
``Can we always stop the Concorde from flying?''

 &HT;    Dorsett comes into his own
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It must have been a blessing for Anthony Dorsett to
grow up in the shadows of a father who commanded spotlight
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Or was it a curse?
</P>
<P>
   The young safety for the Tennessee Titans has searched for his
own identity for years. Without the famous name stitched to the
back of his jersey, he would be just another football player, just
another face in the game program. Yet he is proud to be the son of
Tony Dorsett, Super Bowl hero and Hall of Fame running back.
</P>
<P>
   Proof can be found on the younger Dorsett's face. During an
hourlong interview Wednesday, nearly every question aimed his way
had something to do with his dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's it like to be Tony Dorsett's son?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember seeing him play in the Super Bowl?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Was there extra pressure on you in school because you had a
famous name?''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with a calm, even tone, Anthony Dorsett answered every
question with patience and a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody looks at me and thinks my life must have been
sugar-coated,'' said Dorsett, who replaces injured safety Marcus
Robertson in Super Bowl XXXIV. ``The name brings all the pressure
you can imagine. My jersey number (33) adds to it. All my life has
been an uphill battle, but my mother used to tell me I'm an
individual, too, and I must do the best for myself. My parents tell
me I made them proud.''
</P>
<P>
   They should be. Anthony played college football at the same
school _ the University of Pittsburgh _ where Tony won the Heisman
Trophy in 1976. Now in his fourth season in the NFL, Anthony has
become a reliable defensive back and a special teams demon. ``When
I was a little kid growing up in Thousand Oaks (Calif.), I knew I
wanted to play football, but never did I think I'd be here,
preparing for the biggest game of my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee-St. Louis game will be special for the Dorsett
family. Tony and Anthony will become just the third father-son
combination to play in the Super Bowl, and they will be the first
father-son combination to start in a Super Bowl. Anthony became an
emergency starter when Robertson broke his foot in Sunday's AFC
championship game against Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett's emergence brings back memories of one of the most
famous running backs in the history of the NFL. Tony Dorsett
reached the Super Bowl two consecutive seasons at the beginning of
his career. He remains one of the sport's icons, a player who
helped the Dallas Cowboys remain one of the league's elite teams.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony was 5 when Tony played in his first Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember all the Dallas games growing up, but I never
understood the impact my dad had on football when I was young,''
Dorsett said. ``It wasn't until I got to college that I began to
appreciate what he did. My dad played tailback at 185 pounds and
rushed for 1,200 yards a year and went to the Pro Bowl every year.
That's almost unheard of today with big backs like Eddie George and
Fred Taylor running at 235.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Dorsett made a name for himself this season. He will
represent the AFC as a special teams reserve in next month's Pro
Bowl. The honor did not surprise his coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Anthony Dorsett to be recognized for his work on special
teams, it shows that his time has come,'' Jeff Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett's best game came during a playoff victory two weeks ago
against Indianapolis. He was the main reason Indy punt returners
Jerome Pathon and Terrence Wilkins combined for only 4 yards on two
attempts. ``He played as well on special teams as any player I've
ever seen,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett said he had little desire to follow his dad's footsteps
by playing running back. The younger Dorsett played the position in
high school but got tired of the constant pounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather give a hit than take a hit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett plans to give a few hits Sunday against the Rams. It
will be a stiff challenge, considering that St. Louis has one of
the best group of wide receivers in the league. The Dorsetts have
tickets to see their son play. If the Titans win, Anthony will get
a Super Bowl ring, something he can share with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day,'' he said, ``I was looking at my hand,
wondering what finger I'd put it on.''

TO KNOW GOD'S WILL IS NO EASY THING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Chuck Swindoll talks, a lot of people listen.
</P>
<P>
   His calm, rational comments on how the Bible applies to our
lives are heard on his ``Insight for Living'' radio programs across
the nation. One of the best-known U.S. evangelicals, he has written
more than 25 books, many of them bestsellers.
</P>
<P>
   I'm intrigued by his latest book, ``The Mystery of God's Will,''
(Word, $21.99) in which Swindoll says that nobody can completely
understand God's will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer I live, the more I believe that one of the most
profound subjects of Christian life is the will of God,'' Swindoll
writes. ``The deeper we dig into it, the more we realize how little
we know.''
</P>
<P>
   That struck a chord with me. I've always wondered how
individuals claim they know exactly what God's will is for them.
</P>
<P>
   We want to know God's will. But how do we know what God is
thinking?
</P>
<P>
   Many lay people and high-profile evangelicals I have interviewed
gave me the impression they knew God's will completely. They
claimed to have talked to God about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Swindoll cautions against that kind of attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times have you heard someone say, `The Lord told me
to do so-and-so?' '' Swindoll writes. ``I confess to you, in my
unguarded moments I want to ask, `Was his voice a baritone or a
bass?' ... Of course when people say they have actually heard God's
voice, I get even more spooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Swindoll doesn't advocate seeking God's will through
prayer and meditation. One of the ways to find God's will, he says,
is to listen to the ``still small voice'' of the Holy Spirit.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not a fail-safe process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can testify from personal experience that you can believe
you really know God's will, and you may be dead wrong,'' Swindoll
writes.
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``I believe that God's will for us in this life is not
some black-and-white objective designed to take us to an appointed
destination here on earth as much as it is about the journey itself
... and what matters to him in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Swindoll found time to write his new book even though he is the
very busy president of Dallas Theological Seminary and pastor of a
booming suburban church he founded last year in Frisco, north of
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   I interviewed Swindoll last spring about the new church, which
sprang up almost overnight in one of the fastest-growing areas in
Texas. It has about 2,000 people attending each Sunday. A $7
million church building, only a first phase, is under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Although he feels he is on the right track, Swindoll has
struggled with finding God's will on many occasions, including when
he left a California church to become president of Dallas
Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Swindoll resisted the change at first, was convinced that it was
God's will that he remain as pastor of First Evangelical Free
Church in Fullerton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But it was God's Holy Spirit, he said, that finally convinced
him that he should take the presidency of the Dallas seminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing the will of God is rarely easy and uncomplicated,'' he
says. ``Because we don't know where he is taking us, we must bend
our wills to his.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that there is a spiritual element in seeking
God's will, he warns against what he calls ``superstitious''
attempts to determine God's plan for our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, I read about a man who was driving through
Washington, D.C., when his car stalled in front of the Philippine
Embassy. He took that to mean that he should be a missionary to the
Philippines.''
</P>
<P>
   Swindoll calls that ``voodoo theology.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he doesn't know all the answers, Swindoll says, God's
will is mainly revealed in searching the Bible and following God's
wisdom.

   People wanting to do God's will should obey divine teachings
such as loving one's neighbor, giving to the poor, treating people

HOMECOMING FOR REBELS, TO PUERTO RICO THEY NEVER KNEW 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ Luis Rosa had never seen El Yunque,
Puerto Rico's renowned rain forest. He had never tasted a seafood
stew like the one he ate the other day or tried many of the
tropical fruits people here pick from their backyard trees.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa, who was born and reared in Chicago, is only now getting to
know the country in whose name he took up a life of political
violence as a teen-ager and for which he spent more than 19 years
in a federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Puerto Rican radical nationalists granted clemency by
President Clinton last September in a firestorm of controversy,
Rosa, 39, said he had spent much of his four months of freedom
bursting into tears _ at the sight of El Yunque, hearing Puerto
Rican string music, gazing at a landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a real emotional experience,'' Rosa said.
``Everything that you fought for and dedicated yourself to, you
see. It's alive. It's tangible.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 Puerto Rican prisoners released last year _ 5 women and 6
men _ have spent most of their time catching up with life. Some
have gone to cemeteries to visit the graves of parents for the
first time. Others are getting reacquainted with their children and
meeting new nephews and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But the nine of them who decided to live in Puerto Rico have
also experienced a ``homecoming'' in a country that for most of
them _ whose roots were in New York and Illinois _ was until now
more a cause than home. The 11 were linked to a militant group that
sought independence for Puerto Rico, an American commonwealth with
limited self-governing powers.
</P>
<P>
   And while what they still call their armed struggle against the
United States is widely condemned on this island of 3.8 million
residents, many Puerto Ricans have welcomed them, some as patriots,
but most as people who have been punished and deserve a second
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should not be stigmatized,'' said Dorlizca Irizarry, 60,
who unexpectedly found eight of the former prisoners at Mass
recently as guests of the Archbishop of San Juan, Roberto Gonzalez.
``They should be supported so they don't fall again.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 received sentences of 35 to 90 years after convictions in
the early 1980s for seditious conspiracy and other charges in the
plotting of bomb attacks and armed robberies to finance violent
activities against the U.S. government. The other two, Alberto
Rodriguez and Alejandrina Torres, went to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   While none were convicted of any crimes that resulted in death
or injury, the 11 were accused of belonging to the Armed Forces for
National Liberation, known by the Spanish initials FALN, a group
that waged an armed campaign in the 1970s and 1980s to end what it
saw as Puerto Rico's colonial status. Federal law-enforcement
officials tied the group to more than 100 bombings in the United
States and at least six deaths.
</P>
<P>
   For those like Rosa, the passion for Puerto Rico developed in
the neighborhoods and households of Chicago and New York City where
Spanish was spoken and Puerto Rican culture nurtured. In separate
interviews, he and five of the other former prisoners said their
political commitment had been infused by personal experiences with
segregation and discrimination in the United States, and the
conclusion that Puerto Rico's economic problems and the need of
Puerto Ricans to migrate north stemmed from the island's status as
an American territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We identified the situation in Puerto Rico as the root of the
problems of Puerto Ricans in the states,'' said Carmen Valentin,
53, a former assistant school principal in Chicago who was arrested
with several of the others in a stolen van in Evanston, Ill., in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   The nationalists said an armed movement seemed a logical way to
advance the cause of independence in the wake of the civil rights
movement and with revolutions brewing in Latin America. The view
that violence was a legitimate weapon, the nationalists and other
independence supporters noted, also sprang up in response to the
Puerto Rican government's repression of pro-independence efforts on
the island.
</P>
<P>
   This pattern of harassment was acknowledged recently when Gov.
Pedro J. Rossello, of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party,
publicly apologized and offered restitution of up to $6,000 each to
thousands of Puerto Rican ``independentistas'' and others who were
spied on as ``subversives'' by a police intelligence unit starting
in the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa, who at the time of his arrest in 1980 was a college
student, said he saw violent action as a necessary propaganda tool
to draw world attention to Puerto Rico. ``It was louder than a
march,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the eyes of federal law-enforcement officials, victims of
FALN bombings and critics in the United States and Puerto Rico, the
nationalists were nothing more than terrorists.  &QL;

   ONLINE-REVIEWS (Undated) _ Literary assassinations. Anonymous
rave-ups. Online stalkers. Cyber-hustlers. Can this be the stuff of
21st-century book reviewing? Many publishing insiders are casting

Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com. Suddenly everyone's a critic.

   In granting clemency, President Clinton said he considered
humanitarian factors like the severity of the sentences. (Insisting
they were prisoners of war, most of the nationalists did not
present a defense at their trials.) But the offer set off fierce
criticism that Clinton risked reinvigorating the Puerto Rican
clandestine pro-independence movement, and speculation that the
president was trying to help Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate
campaign in New York, which has a large Puerto Rican population.
</P>
<P>
   Critics were also found in Puerto Rico, where independence
remains the choice of less than 5 percent of the voters in
referendums. Most residents are divided between maintaining the
commonwealth and seeking statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic crime they committed was to try to impose their
aspirations for Puerto Rico on the people of Puerto Rico against
their will,'' said former Gov. Carlos Romero Barcelo, the island's
resident commissioner in Washington and a statehood proponent who
opposed their release.
</P>
<P>
   But many more Puerto Ricans seem to have found extenuating
circumstances. Rigoberto Diaz Jr., 41, a banker here who also
supports statehood, said he found the sentences too harsh compared
with those for crimes like murder, and attributed the punishment to
prejudice against Puerto Ricans in the states.
</P>
<P>
   EL Nuevo Dia, Puerto Rico's largest daily newspaper, refers to
the group as ``ex-political prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The crime of sedition they were imprisoned for is
superarchaic,'' Diaz said. ``How can a few people overthrow the
government of the United States? They conspired, but the KKK and
the white supremacists have done worse.''
</P>
<P>
   While Puerto Rico remains a commonwealth, the 11 nationalists
remain fervently committed to independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What justifies the struggle for independence is not its
popularity but whether you're right or not,'' said Elizam Escobar,
51, who was born in Puerto Rico and left at 23 for New York City,
where he lived when arrested. ``For self-respect, we should take
our destiny in our own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   But bombings are not an option. The 11 were required to renounce
violence to be released.
</P>
<P>
   The nationalists noted that there had been a surge of
nationalism in Puerto Rico, more tolerance of independence
sympathizers and newfound unity among the three major political
parties for asserting Puerto Rican rights in the case of the U.S.
Navy's presence in Vieques, a nearby island the Navy uses for
target practice.
</P>
<P>
   All that can be channeled peacefully toward a final
determination on the island's political status, some of the
nationalists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's support for the commonwealth as it is
and there's no support in the United States Congress for statehood
either,'' said Edwin Cortes, 44, a former claim adjuster who was
arrested in 1983. ``Puerto Ricans are waking up to that reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the conditions of their release, the former prisoners may
not associate with one another. Only the two sisters in the group,
Alicia and Ida Luz Rodriguez, have been allowed to live together.
They declined a request for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the nationalists, most of whom are still living with
relatives or friends, have adjusted better than others. Some, like
Ms. Valentin, are still looking for jobs. Others, like Rosa, who
earned his bachelor's degree in prison, and Ricardo Jimenez, 43,
have enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Escobar, a painter, and Adolfo Matos, an artisan, are teaching.
Cortes is a clerk in a doctor's office, and Dylcia Pagan, 53, a
television producer and one of two New Yorkers in the group, is
planning a documentary about her first year back in Puerto Rico and
learning how to drive.
</P>
<P>
   All insisted there were no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it was well worth it,'' said Ms. Pagan, whose only son,
now 21, was reared by a family in Mexico. ``We've been examples of
people committed to struggle. If you believe in something that
much, you're prepared to suffer the consequences.''

STATE OF THE UNION GIVES CLINTON A CHANCE TO DO WHAT HE DOES BEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)  (nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has used his seven State of the
Union addresses to define and redefine himself in response to the
shifting tenor of the times. In successive years he has been budget
balancer and health care fixer, political penitent and moral
preacher, master of the classroom and savior of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   As he rises from the well of the House to the rostrum on
Thursday night, he will adopt yet another identity. What guise will
he assume in this, his last, legacy-defining State of the Union
address?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has used these set-piece speeches as mileposts of his
political pilgrimage. It has been a patchwork progression, marked
by a number of consistent themes and a few unexpected detours. The
speeches have sought to reposition the president when external
events like the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 and the
1998 year of scandal have forced him to adapt to changing political
realities.
</P>
<P>
   In them, he has seized the high ground of principle while deftly
delivering a partisan stiletto. He has made scores of promises only
to come back a year later to blame his opponents for failing to
deliver them. He has taken credit for Republican plans he bitterly
fought. He has been bombastic and demagogic, exhausting and
occasionally apologetic, and almost always highly effective.
</P>
<P>
   In his first speech to a joint session of Congress, in 1993, he
declared that government must do more and proposed $30 billion in
new spending; three years later he proclaimed the end of the era of
big government and demanded that Congress pass a balanced budget.
In 1995, he said he had been humbled by the collapse of his health
care plan and the public repudiation he received in the mid-term
elections of 1994; a year later he gloried in his victory over
Republicans in the budget battle that led to the closing of the
federal government, even as he stole many of their small-government
themes.
</P>
<P>
   Woven through this seeming crazy quilt are the president's
bedrock themes of opportunity, responsibility and community. The
themes appeared in his presidential announcement speech in October
1991 and are certain to be a part of his remarks this week and in
any farewell address he might give next January, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers say the State of the Union is the president's most
cherished public ritual. For an hour or more, Clinton commands a
national television audience and dominates the House chamber,
literally and figuratively looking down upon the assemblage of
lawmakers, judges, generals and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his favorite time of year,'' said Michael Waldman, the
president's former chief speechwriter who is writing a book about
his White House experiences. ``He loves the policy, he loves the
rewriting and rewriting, the politics and the polling and the
showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It combines everything he does well,'' Waldman said. ``He
knows when he walks in the chamber he's very good at this, and his
opponents are usually cowed at the end of the speech. And he'll
really miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is something of an oddity that Clinton each year has
delivered this address in the midst of some event that has
transfixed the nation or transformed his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the speech came the same month he was forced to approve
the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the
matters known together as Whitewater. In 1995, Clinton was driven
to defend his relevance as he faced a hostile new Republican
Congress. Two years later, he returned in triumph after winning an
overwhelming re-election victory over Bob Dole _ but had to compete
for the attention of viewers with the verdict in the O.J. Simpson
civil trial. In 1998, he delivered the State of the Union barely 24
hours after pronouncing one of the most memorable sentences in
American politics: ``I did not have sexual relations with that
woman, Ms. Lewinsky.'' Last year, he spoke in the middle of his
Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   In each instance, he has been able to capture the public's
attention and, when necessary, remake himself to meet expectations.
After his legislative and electoral losses of 1994, he refashioned
himself from prime minister responsible for passing laws to the
head of state straddling the two parties and standing above them at
the apex of a political triangle. In 1998, in a very real sense, he
saved his presidency by persuading the public that the Lewinsky
matter was a temporary distraction from the economic and social
progress the nation was making under his stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we've seen is an incredibly adaptable politician
conforming to the political necessities of the time,'' said Ross K.
Baker, professor of political science at Rutgers University. ``Far
from being rigid, the president is absolutely protean. He has the
ability to assume guises depending on the political weather and has
shown himself remarkably dextrous and able to come up with the
occasional dramatic gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has understood the value of the formal address to
Congress from the beginning. Although he did not give a formal
State of the Union speech in his first year, he did address a joint
session of Congress in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was a result of a chaotic drafting process and was
still being rewritten as the president went to the Capitol to
deliver it. Clinton proposed nearly $500 billion in taxes and
spending cuts to reverse growing federal deficits, but insisted on
including new spending on children, worker training, technology and
infrastructure to prepare the country for the digital economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a symbolic move, he seated Alan Greenspan, the dour chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board, in the balcony next to Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 speech was memorable for Clinton's pen-waving vow to
veto any health care plan that did not provide coverage for all
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, a sheepish Clinton acknowledged that he and Mrs.
Clinton ``bit off more than we could chew'' and proposed modest
steps to remake the health care system.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 speech was a model of the ``third way'' approach to
governing that Clinton has advocated since the Republican victories
in 1994. He declared ``the era of big government is over'' and
adopted Republican language on making government smaller and more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   There were few expensive new policy proposals and a heavy
emphasis on promoting family values and cleansing popular
entertainment of sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That speech put him in a commanding position to win the 1996
election,'' Waldman said. ``It set a pattern he's followed ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the 1997 speech to review the highlights of his
first term and to declare education to be the overriding priority
of his second. While Clinton has pursued several education
initiatives _ smaller class sizes, school construction programs,
national standards _ Congress has been stingy in paying for them
and his attention has often wandered.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 and 1999 speeches were memorable more for their context
than their content. On a blustery day in January 1998, the nation
held its breath, wondering whether Clinton would survive the
revelations of an affair with a young White House aide.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton strode to the front of the House chamber and declared
that the state of the union _ and, by implication, his own _ was
strong. He never once mentioned the scandal and left his audience
marveling at his resilience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton uses the State of the Union better than many of his
predecessors,'' said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential scholar at
the University of New Orleans. ``I have no doubt this speech will
be a great success, like most of the others. He's such a great
orator. Every time you see one of these speeches, you shake your
head and say, `He could have been a great president.'''

COUP MAY HAVE FAILED, BUT ECUADOR'S INDIANS VOW TO BE HEARD
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla.)   (nk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LATACUNGA, Ecuador _ Last week, the Indians marched by the
thousands from this Andean market town to overthrow the government
in Quito. This week, with a new president in place but all their
other demands unmet, those same protesters have been drifting back
to the farms and fields here, feeling defeated, angry and
embittered and warning of the fire next time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were betrayed by a treacherous clique of generals and
admirals,'' Antonio Vargas, president of the Confederation of
Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, the country's principal Indian
group, said after the rapid collapse during the weekend of the
three-man military-led junta of which he was also a member. ``But
our struggle is not over, and in the future we may have to be even
tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   To this country's largely white and Spanish-speaking elite,
those are powerful and disturbing words. Though the Indians here
constitute about one-third of the country's 12.5 million people,
they have been treated as second-class citizens, deprived of
economic and educational opportunities, with their languages and
culture ridiculed, for even longer than Ecuador has been a nation.
</P>
<P>
   Msgr. Raul Lopez, the Roman Catholic bishop in this commercial
center at the foot of the towering Cotopaxi volcano, points out
that not too long ago, newspaper advertisements ``offered haciendas
for sale with Indians included, as if they were cattle or horses.''
But in recent years, with financial support and advice from groups
in Western Europe and North America, indigenous peoples have
coalesced around demands for what they call ``a plurinational and
multiethnic state'' here.
</P>
<P>
   Though last week's uprising was the largest and most dramatic
and ambitious that Ecuadorean Indians have ever staged, it was by
no means their first. Such protests have been an effective and
favorite tactic of the increasingly better organized indigenous
movement since 1990, when what began as a civil rights protest soon
took on broader political dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were tired of bus drivers insulting indigenous passengers,
refusing to allow them to board or telling them to take off their
hats,'' said Cesar Umajinga, president of the Cotopaxi Indigenous
and Peasant Movement, the leading Indian group here. ``After
several of our people died from being thrown off buses, we decided
it was time to demand respect and an end to such abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference with foreign reporters on Monday, Gustavo
Noboa, the new president who took power on Saturday after the
collapse of the Indian-military junta, acknowledged past injustices
to indigenous peoples. He promised a ``dialogue'' with Indian
groups and expressed sympathy for many of their goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The indigenous theme is longstanding and hereditary, the
result of a lack of confidence,'' he said. ``The fact is that they
have been deceived for centuries and their demands are right in
part.'' Indians rose up last week, he said, because governments
``have not kept their word'' after making promises to and signing
agreements with indigenous leaders such as Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   Other nations throughout the Andes, as well as Central America
and Mexico, must also contend with restive Indian populations
demanding social equality and economic opportunity. But experts on
the region argue that the situation here is probably worse than
elsewhere precisely because of government neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecuador is a country that has basically forgotten about its
agricultural and rural base, so conditions in the countryside have
deteriorated in the last decade,'' said Eduardo Gamarra, director
of the Latin American and Caribbean Center at Florida International
University in Miami. The resulting ``process of pauperization in
the countryside,'' he added, ``marginalizes indigenous people
almost by definition'' because of their strong links to the land.
</P>
<P>
   That trend has only been accentuated by an economic crisis worse
than any this country has faced in 70 years. Inflation, at 60
percent for each of the past two years, is the highest in Latin
America, the government defaulted on half its $13 billion in
foreign debt four months ago, and the country's currency, the
sucre, lost 67 percent of its value against the dollar in 1999 and
another 20 percent this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price of seed, fertilizer and insecticide is tied to the
exchange rate of the dollar and has risen so high that some of us
can no longer afford to plant our crops,'' complained Gregorio
Chiguano, a 54-year-old farmer here who participated in the march
on the capital last week. ``But we get paid in sucres for the
potatoes and other products that we grow, and so we are suffering
terrible deprivation.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to address inequities, Ecuadorean governments have
since the 1960s carried out agrarian reform programs. But Indians
have not only ended up with most of the least fertile plots of
land, many of which have now been divided up as a result of
population growth to the point where they are barely productive,
but have also received little in the way of credit and technical
assistance from the government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Indian leaders from the countryside who were here
Wednesday to sell their wares at a weekly market all complained
that their villages are the last to receive electricity, water,
telephones and sewers. Struggling to fulfill the austerity measures
they have had to agreed to in order to secure loans abroad,
successive administrations have also reduced support for bilingual
education programs designed for speakers of Quechua and other
Indian languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is truly tragic,'' said Lopez, the monsignor.
``The government has cut the budget for everything in the social
sector in order to satisfy the demands of the International
Monetary Fund and to make payments on our foreign debt.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's decision earlier this month to make the
American dollar the country's new currency has further fed the
discontent. Indian farmers here are vehemently opposed, seeing the
measure as just another scheme by bankers and businessmen to
further impoverish them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dollar may be fine for mestizos and the big folks, but we
are peasants and do not know how to manage dollars,'' said
Apolinario Quishpe, a 51-year-old farmer who was another of those
who made the 55-mile march on Quito. ``Many of us do not know how
to read and write and do not understand what this is about. We feel
cheated.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian leaders and their supporters stress that their uprisings
and campaigns of civil disobedience also reflect frustration with
the nature of the political process here. Though candidates on the
right as well as on the left say they are concerned about the
advancing Indian interests and rights, no Indian has ever held a
Cabinet post, and until very recently, few had been elected to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about Ecuador that has always struck me is that the
Indians are not treated very well by white society,'' Gamarra said.
``Political parties spend very little effort to work with them, and
whatever representation occurs is usually done in a very
patrimonial way. They don't really have a voice or a party of their
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian leaders here say that their unexpected alliance with the
military, though temporarily unsuccessful, has gained them new
respect as a political force. But Lopez argues that last week's
coup and its chaotic aftermath are better seen as a setback for the
indigenous cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``By trying to achieve an unreachable utopia, they have deeply
angered and frightened the Ecuadorean population, which had been
sympathetic to many of their demands,'' he said. ``They broke with
the rules of the constitution, and that has cost them a lot of
support.''

<P>
   The Indigenous Parliament that represents the country's Indian
peoples is to meet here this week to try to draw lessons from the
failed uprising, devise a new strategy and prepare an agenda for
the next round of negotiations with the government, scheduled to
begin next week. But Umajinga warned that ``we are tired of being
marginalized and treated as orphans by the government'' and said
the day may soon come when the talking will have to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an armed uprising, and that may have been a
mistake that will have to rectified in the future,'' he said. ``We
do not even have weapons, and this is not the time to take up arms.
But I want to tell you clearly and emphatically that if this system
is not changed in the next five years, then you are going to see
our people take up arms.''

COMMENTARY: BESOTTED WITH POTTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ With the help of a tall blond model from Texas, the
British have just upheld the side of adult culture in the
English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   They resisted the pressure to award a top literary prize to J.K.
Rowling for her superselling series of Harry Potter books. Instead,
the top honor again went to the Irish poet Seamus Heaney, this time
for his translation of the medieval Anglo-Saxon epic ``Beowulf.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a relief. With the orphan wizard dominating best-seller
lists, the Harry Potter phenomenon needs a little perspective.
</P>
<P>
   These are children's books. Their glory is that their hero's
magical charm has captivated a world of kids, inculcating the
reading habit in pre-teens who otherwise would be seduced into
interactive games of mayhem. Getting children to read is no small
blessing, and Rowling has provided them with a key to literacy.
</P>
<P>
   These are not, however, books for adults. Unlike ``Huckleberry
Finn'' or ``Alice in Wonderland,'' the Potter series is not written
on two levels, entertaining one generation while instructing
another. Rather, it is in the category of Tom Swift and Dr.
Dolittle; I was hooked on reading by them, but have laid aside my
electric rifle and no longer talk to horses.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is not that children are being lured into belief in
witchcraft, as some tut-tutting clerics complain; Western
civilization has survived Merlin's magic in the tales of King
Arthur. Nor will poor children be corrupted by tales of life in
upper-middle-class English boarding schools.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that grown-ups are buying these books ostensibly
to read to kids, but actually to read for themselves. As Philip
Hensher warns in the Independent newspaper, this leads to ``the
infantilization of adult culture, the loss of a sense of what a
classic really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholarly tomes will be written about the underlying motifs of
the Potter series, justifying its adult readership. Steven
Spielberg will slip a little social significance into his movie
treatment, further furrowing academic brows. But this is not just
dumbing down; it is growing down. The purpose of reading, once you
get the hang of it, is not merely to follow the action of a plot,
but to learn about characters, explore different ideas and enter
other minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huckleberry Finn'' is a classic because it used the device of
a boy's coming of age to illuminate a nation's painful
transformation. When Lewis Carroll took us through the looking
glass, he dealt with madness and injustice in this world by mocking
a parallel world. Critics delight in annotating the allusions in
such books.
</P>
<P>
   Not in ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.'' That's the one
I read, noting its nice deployment of the standard tricks. I also
enjoy short films, featuring anthropomorphic porcine cartoon
characters, that end with ``Th-th-th-that's all, folks!'' But
prizeworthy culture it ain't; more than a little is a waste of
adult time.
</P>
<P>
   That's why my hat is off to Jerry Hall, the intelligent Texan
and mother of four, divorced from Mick Jagger, who still sort of
lives with her. She is reported to have cast the swing vote on the
judging panel for Seamus Heaney. That Nobel laureate accepted the
$35,000 prize with a line from ``Beowulf,'' ``Fate go ever, as fate
must'' (a somewhat fatalistic response). The Guardian headline:
``Heaney pips Harry Potter.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about time Potter was pipped (narrowly defeated). His
creator, Ms. Rowling, deserved the lesser award she received for
best children's book. But let us not exalt Potter, either, as a
cultural icon. Adults make a part of their lives only the works
that have meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Dorothy in her transforming red slippers in ``The
Wizard of Oz''? Frank Baum's book, cemented into our culture by the
1939 Victor Fleming movie starring Judy Garland, was a children's
fantasy, complete with a Wicked Witch of the West, but dealt deftly
with heartlessness, mindlessness and cowardice.
</P>
<P>
   Its symbols became part of our culture. Munchkins presume to
advise candidates following the yellow brick road to power, and
behind the curtain we discover that the fearsome wizard of bombast
is only a frightened Frank Morgan. For adults, Harry Potter may
reign over the best-seller lists, but he has yet to heave his
philosopher's stone over the rainbow.

 &HT;    Parnevik quits European tour
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure as the man ingests volcanic sand, this was bound to happen.
With Sweden's Jesper Parnevik atop the PGA Tour money list and
coming off a win in last week's Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, he
officially has quit the European Tour to devote his entire
attention to playing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always enjoyed playing in Europe but I wanted one year to
give myself a chance to play more than 15 or 20 tournaments (on the
U.S Tour), to see where I can finish on the money list,'' Parnevik
said from this week's Phoenix Open.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik said he plans to rejoin the European Tour next year to
be eligible for the 2001 Ryder Cup. Were he to remain a European
Tour member this year and fail to play his minimum 11 events, he
could have risked being banned for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to sustain his PGA Tour momentum, Parnevik said, ``The
way I'm playing right now is probably as good as I've felt the last
five years. My iron game is probably as good as it's ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia obsessed with the name game
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while Sergio Garcia, 19, acts his age. Last year
he didn't want to be called by his last name _ just Sergio. Now the
Spaniard feels he has outgrown his ``El Nino'' (The Kid) label.
``One of my wishes this year is for my nickname to drop out of
use,'' Garcia said. ``I've been called El Nino since I was 14. It
didn't really bother me, but wouldn't it be more normal to call me
Sergio?'' . . . Fast starts are starting to become standard for
Paul Azinger. When he won at Hawaii two weeks ago, it was the third
time in his career he has won his first event of the year. . . .
Scott Simpson will end his streak of playing with Bill Murray at
next week's AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. Simpson broke his
leg skiing, but still hopes to return by the Buick Invitational
later next month.
</P>
<P>
   Woods numbers boggle the mind
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods has 16 wins in 71 PGA Tour starts, a winning
percentage of 22.5. He has top 10s in 44 of the tournaments (62
percent) and 69 cuts made (97.2 percent) . . . Joanne Carner, 61,
who played in the LPGA's opening event at Naples, Fla., with
16-year-old Catherine Cartwright: ``How I would love to be 16
again. Then again, I'd would also love to be 58 again.'' . .
Reporters aren't the only one to notice David Duval's uneasiness in
interviews. His agency, the International Management Group, has
suggested he undergo media training. . . .Past champions Curtis
Strange and Tom Watson, two-time British Open champion Greg Norman
and Australian amateur Aaron Baddeley have been offered special
exemptions to the 2000 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, Calif., June
15-18. The U.S. Women's Open has done the same for four-time
runner-up Nancy Lopez of Albany, and past champion Pat Bradley . .
. After affiliations with Cobra and Maxfli, Norman will play
Titleist balls and clubs this year. . . Norman and fellow
Australian Karrie Webb will help carry the Olympic torch in its
100-day journey around Australia. . .. The United States Golf
Association has elected Trey Holland for a one-year team as
president, replacing Buzz Taylor. Atlanta's Walter Driver of the
Peachtree Golf Club was elected treasurer. . . Roswell's Krissie
Register has been named as an alternate to the U.S. Curtis Cup
team. . .Tom Watson, who withdrew from last week's MasterCard
Championship after his father, Raymond, died of a heart attack,
tentatively has agreed to remain in Saturday's Senior Skins Game in
Hawaii.

KOHL ADMITS ACCEPTING FREE FLIGHTS FROM BUSINESSMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Wednesday that after
he left office in 1998, he accepted six free flights provided by
the owner of one of Germany's largest media groups.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Kirch, who heads the Bavaria-based Kirch Group and is a
close friend of the former chancellor, paid for flights from
Germany to Italy and Austria, among other destinations.
</P>
<P>
   In a signed statement Kohl, who is still a Christian Democratic
member of the lower house of parliament, said, ``These flights had
nothing to do with my work as chancellor.'' He declined to comment
further.
</P>
<P>
   While in office, Kohl was known to be broadly supportive of
Kirch's businesses, and helped win European Union approval for a
pay television alliance that brought together the Kirch Group,
Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the flights, first reported in the weekly magazine
Stern, Kohl did nothing illegal. But a member of parliament
accepting several free flights from the owner of a major German
media group clearly lays himself open to the charge that he is
being bought.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has said he accepted more than $1 million in secret
payments while chancellor, but has refused to identify the donors
and insisted that, ``I am not, and have never been, for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Christian Democratic Union has now conceded the
existence of more than $13 million in illicit funding during the 16
years of Kohl's government. The uncovering of this system, and
Kohl's seeming contempt for a law that says the source of any
donation over $10,500 must be revealed, have generated a political
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Christian Democratic party, Kirch's name has
circulated as one possible provider of the secret payments to Kohl.
This speculation has been based on the Bavarian businessman's
closeness to the former chancellor. Kirch has declined to comment,
and no evidence of any payment from him has been found.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor is rampant in Germany precisely because Kohl has proved so
obstinate in guarding what now amounts to an affair of state as a
personal secret, and saying his ``honor'' justifies this stance.
</P>
<P>
   One of his closest former aides, Norbert Blum, unleashed a
blistering attack Wednesday on the former chancellor: ``As long as
Mr. Kohl refuses to say where he got the money, we are exposed to
all sorts of wild speculation and accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   Blum, labor minister in all four of Kohl's governments,
continued: ``He can't go on like this ruining his life's work. Mr.
Kohl has a talent for obstinacy _ he is ruining the concept of
honor when he tries to use that to justify breaking the law.''
</P>
<P>
   This statement was notable for its pugnacity and clarity _ in
marked contrast to those of many other Christian Democrats who fear
that open attacks on Kohl could cost them votes. The governing
Social Democratic Party, too, has been curiously limp or cautious
in its reaction to the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has spent most of his time saying
that what has happened does not amount to a state crisis,
expressing the hope that the Christian Democratic party will
recover because Germany needs a strong opposition, and generally
giving voice to magnanimous concern.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this curiously gentle approach has long been
clear enough: the Social Democrats have plenty to hide themselves.
On Wednesday, new evidence emerged that the Christian Democrats
were merely the most conspicuous and egregious practitioners of a
broadly shared system.
</P>
<P>
   In North-Rhine Westphalia, the largest German state, Heinz
Schlusser, the Social Democratic finance minister, faced growing
pressure to resign after he acknowledged this week that he had lied
about accepting free air travel for a woman friend. The woman
accompanied Schlusser on two flights to Croatia in 1990 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Schlusser lied to a parliamentary committee in the state that
has been investigating whether its Social Democratic politicians
benefited from free flights on jets provided by a bank partly owned
by the state government.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democrats have been in power in North-Rhine
Westphalia for decades but face a critical and potentially close
election in May.
</P>
<P>
   In Schroeder's home state of Lower Saxony on Wednesday, the
legislature voted to investigate whether Gerhard Glogowski, the
chancellor's successor as state governor, profited from his period
in office. Glogowski resigned last year after acknowledging that
local companies had paid for his wedding reception and honeymoon.

SHORT-TERM YIELDS RISE, WHILE LONG-TERM YIELDS FALL

   NEW YORK _ Yields on short-term Treasury notes rose in the bond
market Wednesday, while the yields on the 10-year note and the
30-year bond fell, leaving some short-term yields higher than
long-term yields.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in short-term yields, which came as Alan Greenspan, the
chairman of the Federal Reserve testified at his Senate hearing for
re-confirmation as Fed chairman, reflects the belief that the Fed
will raise short-term interest rates to slow growth and restrain
inflation. The first increase is expected to come when Fed policy
makers meet on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the fall in longer-term yields seems to
reflect confidence about the outlook for inflation in the years
ahead because investors expect the central bank to rein in price
increases.
</P>
<P>
   These conflicting forces are creating oddities in the Treasury
market. For example, the yield on the Treasury five-year note,
which rose to 6.59 percent Wednesday, was higher than the 6.57
percent yield on the 30-year bond, which fell from 6.63 on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year bond, which moves in the opposite
direction, rose 22/32 to 94 6/32.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the two-year note auctioned Wednesday was 6.43
percent, not far below the yield on the 30-year bond.
</P>
<P>
   Longer-term rates are normally higher than shorter term rates
because of the risk of rising inflation in the future. But this
type of interest rate inversion is common when the Fed is trying to
slow the economy by raising its short-term interest rate target,
the federal funds rate.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in issuance of new Treasury notes and bonds by the
Treasury and the plan to buy back existing Treasury debt _ all
because of the growing federal budget surplus _ is also affecting
Treasury yields. The yield on the 10-year note slipped Wednesday to
6.66 percent from 6.68 percent Tuesday, but is still well above the
6.57 percent yield on the 30-year bond. This is because investors
are paying a premium for 30-year bonds because there are fewer such
long-term maturities available now.

STORAGE NETWORKS GETS $103M TO GROW FROM 12 TO 60 CENTERS

<P>
   Storage Networks Inc., an 18-month-old supplier of
information-storage services to corporations has received a $103
million investment led by Dell Computer Corp. and Global Crossing
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing Waltham, Mass. company, which early last year
had 10 employees and now has 350, plans to double its work force in
the next 12 months, according to Peter Bell, company cofounder and
chief executive. He said the new funds, combined with earlier
venture-capital financings, brings to $205 million the sum that
Storage Networks has raised since its inception in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Storage Networks operates 14 company-owned information-storage
centers around the country in addition to its Waltham headquarters.
The new funds will enable the company to expand to 60 storage
centers in the next 12 months, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Storage Networks specializes in outsourcing information storage
to large corporations, which pay the company a monthly fee to store
and manage data services. The goal, according to Bell, is to have
corporations rent high-speed data storage as they need it instead
of purchasing large disk drives.
</P>
<P>
   He said the market for data storage as a utility is just
beginning and that Storage Networks has a nine- to 12-month lead
over its competitors, some of them based in California's Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   With the new corporate partners as investors, StorageNetworks
expanded its board of directors. The company named Michael Lambert,
a Dell senior vice president, and Thomas Casey, Global Crossing's
vice chairman, to the Storage Networks board.
</P>
<P>
   The new funding ``is a significant vote of confidence in our
business model,'' said Bell.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Many investors have seen their holdings in Russia wiped
out by several major stock dilutions over the last few years. But
now, a group of shareholders is exercising a new-found vigilance
and challenging the consolidation plans of AO Surgutneftegaz, one
of the country's largest oil companies and its most actively traded
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Surgutneftegaz plans to take over its parent company, NK Surgut
Holding, through a new-share issue and stock swap. But 15
shareholders, representing major Russian brokerage firms and
foreign investors and with stakes in the subsidiary or the parent,
sent a letter of protest to Surgutneftegaz management, objecting to
the terms of the consolidation and insisting that the process be
postponed until a plan that protects everyone's rights is
developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical that the company handle this consolidation
properly, because anyone who invests in Russia has invested in
Surgut,'' said William Browder, who runs the Hermitage Fund and is
one of the protesting investors.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was sent under the aegis of the Coordinating Center
for the Defense of Investors' Rights and Legal Interests, a new
watchdog group advocating better corporate governance and run by
the former head of the Russian federal securities commission,
Dmitri Vasiliev. The list of signers included a Russian lender,
Alfa Bank, the brokerage firms Troika Dialog and Nikoil, and such
foreign shareholders as the hedge fund NCH Advisers, the Leucadia
International Corp. and Regent Fund Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a civil society of shareholders,'' said Tom
Adshead, a senior analyst with Troika Dialog. ``In this unity,
there's a greater sense of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Investor alarm over the consolidation has contributed to a 19
percent fall in the share price of Surgutneftegaz this week, to 7.3
rubles, or 25.7 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about the company's consolidation plan are rooted in the
short history of private enterprise in post-Soviet Russia. When
private oil businesses were created in the early '90s, the holding
companies had limited control over subsidiaries, and the two often
traded as separate shares. More recently, oil companies have
streamlined business by merging subsidiaries and parent concerns
into a unified structure with one stock. Some conglomerates
consolidated their holdings equitably, while others, notably the
oil giant Yukos, diluted small outside shareholdings.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are to vote on the Surgut restructuring at a meeting
scheduled on Feb. 10. Shareholders critical of the consolidation
say the subsidiary, Surgutneftegaz, plans to issue as many as 12
billion new shares to swap for control of the holding company. But
the holding company owns about 16 billion shares of the subsidiary,
along with other properties, which would make it appear that that
the holding company is selling itself for a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Surgut executives have significant shareholdings in
the parent and the subsidiary, raising the question of why they
would structure a deal that would apparently generate losses.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors said the consolidation plan is aimed at diluting
the outside shareholders' position in Surgutneftegaz to 20.5
percent of the equity from their current 30.8 percent. At the same
time, management's interest in Surgutneftegaz would rise to about
76 percent from 71 percent now, giving management all but total
control of the company under Russian law.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Surgut, Aleksei Sukhaduyev, said the parent
company is consulting with shareholders to structure an equitable
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Some shareholders say that Surgutneftegaz's inexperience in such
deals, more than any malevolence, may explain the controversy. But
they too insist that Surgut be more open if it wants to preserve
its reputation and share price. ``They need to answer more of the
questions that are being put to them about the deal, which they
don't do now,'' said Peter Halloran, president of the $75 million
Pharos Fund.

 &HT;    Coke shares fall as investors await more details
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola's announcement of a new direction failed to
impress investors Wednesday as its shares fell as much as 4.7
percent before rebounding to finish at $63.06 1/4, down $2.81 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   More than 11.8 million shares changed hands, or more than 2.5
times average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently took a ``show me'' stance, preferring to
wait for moredetails from the company as to how it plans to turn
itself around before snapping up the shares.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives, in a telephone conference with analysts and
institutional investors, said they would provide some of those
details in 180 days, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they moved to shore up investor confidence in the
company, they made certain disclosures that raised additional
questions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, analyst Arthur Cecil, who tracks Coca-Cola for T.
Rowe Price Associates, said he wanted more information about the
buildup of concentrate inventories at some bottlers, such as those
in Japan, Germany and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola said Wednesday the reduction of concentrate
inventories at those bottlers in the first half of this year would
likely reduce after-tax earnings by about 12 cents to 14 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil, whose mutual fund company owns 3.1 million Coca-Cola
shares, worth nearly $200 million, is ``neutral'' on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think they have a ways to go,'' Cecil said. ``I'd like
to better feel they've gotten their hands around things.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cecil finds the shares of bottling companies, such as
Coca-Cola Enterprises, more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer new money here to go on the bottling side,'' Cecil
said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that Coca-Cola now seems more committed to
improving the profitability and financial strength of its bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a plus,'' Cecil said. ``To some degree, that's already
reflected in the bottling stocks, which have done pretty well in
the last month. It might be that the bottlers might do better for a
while than the parent concentrate companies. On the margin, I would
agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises, which finished Wednesday at
$25.68 3/4, up 12 1/2 cents, have gained 34.8 percent over the past
month.
</P>
<P>
   Money manager Phillip M. Larkins of Atlanta-based Legacy South
would stick with Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long term, I would rather be in Coke than the bottlers,'' said
Larkins, whose firm owns 200,000 Coca-Cola shares, worth about
$12.4 million. ``When you buy Coke, you're really honing in on the
global franchise, and I think that's what you want, the global
franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because Larkins believes Coca-Cola will be one of the
quickest beneficiaries of a worldwide improvement in living
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always easier to purchase a Coca-Cola than it is to
purchase a new car or other durable good,'' Larkins said.
</P>
<P>
   But at current prices, Coca-Cola's shares aren't cheap, Larkins
said, especially if the company lowers its long-term growth
targets, as it has indicated it might.
</P>
<P>
   The shares currently are trading at about 41.5 times estimated
2000 earnings of $1.52 a share. Analysts believe a more realistic
long-term earnings-per-share growth rate is 12 percent to 14
percent, instead of 15 percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock's price-to-earnings ratio is now about three times
the company's growth rate,'' Larkins observed. ``That's fairly
high. In today's market, a P/E of 2 to 2.5 times its growth rate
for such a stellar company such as Coke would be more in line. That
would put the stock at 15 to 20 percent lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkins believes Coca-Cola's shares aren't likely to plummet to
those levels but instead will trade in a narrow range.
</P>
<P>
   For one reason, earnings are now depressed. Because they are at
such low levels, they're likely to snap back over the next two
years at a faster rate than the long-term growth rate of 12 percent
to 14 percent that analysts forecast, Larkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market may not let it get that cheap because of improving
fundamentals with the new management team,'' Larkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term investors looking to put Coca-Cola in their portfolios
can buy now, Larkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't try to time it and wait for it to drop that much,''
he advised.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what an investor might do is to consider buying some now,
then if it pulls back, to (dollar-cost) average into it (and buy
more). That's what I would do.''

 &HT;    NASCAR crews begin mad scramble
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welding machines and grinders make theloud sounds at NASCAR
Winston Cup shops in the Charlotte area. Crew members are turning
sheets of raw metal and sticks of tubing into race cars.
</P>
<P>
   Cars are in various stages of completion. Some look like frames
_ chassis and roll bars only. Others have sheet metal and wheels in
place. Many of them haven't seen their first coat of paint.
</P>
<P>
   It is the ultimate mad scramble, because each shop has one goal
in mind: Being ready for NASCAR's ``Super Bowl,'' the Daytona 500
on Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The clock is ticking.
</P>
<P>
   This winter has been especially busy for teams using the Ford
Taurus and Chevrolet Monte Carlo. They are installing new sheet
metal, the outer body of the car. Pontiac teams are staying with
the shape they ran in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Hendrick, who owns the organization that fields Winston Cup
cars for Jeff Gordon, Terry Labonte and Jerry Nadeau, said his
workers have built 23 new cars this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, drivers escape for a few weeks of recreation in
November and December, although at least two _ Dale Earnhardt and
Mark Martin _ took the time off to have surgery to fix nagging back
injuries. Both say they're feeling much better.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace broke a shoulder blade in a snow-skiing accident
and is on the mend. Although they missed some test sessions, all
three are expected to drive in the races at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Earnhardt say they did not mind missing the tests,
which have been held at Daytona and Talladega, two tracks where
restrictor plates are used to limit engine performance in the
interest of safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restrictor-plate testing anybody can do,'' said Martin, who
for six weeks after his surgery had to lie flat on his back for 22
hours a day. ``It's not something that having me involved in it
will affect how the car runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin did run a few laps at Daytona last week and said his back
felt OK.
</P>
<P>
   The test sessions were easier for drivers and crew members this
year because NASCAR has implemented a new shock rule for Daytona
and Talladega. The change is intended to give the race tracks _ and
the drivers' backs _ a break.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, teams had been using ``no-rebound'' shocks that
let the car drop close to the track and stay there while the car
was running at high speeds. The shocks gave the car an aerodynamic
advantage, but the cars often gouged the race track surface, and
the bouncing left drivers in pain.
</P>
<P>
   In tests this month, the shocks are working as shocks are
intended to work. The change has slowed the cars but made them more
comfortable for the drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Before, when Dale Jarrett was going to run Daytona or Talladega,
he scheduled an appointment with his chiropractor. After his first
test under the new shock rules, he called from the track to cancel
the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip, who had the fastest Ford in a drafting session
at Daytona last week, said the cars are ``very, very stable'' at
speed. ``You don't mind running beside someone because you don't
think you're going to suck into them and wreck them,'' Waltrip
said.
</P>
<P>
   From Jan. 1, when NASCAR allows testing to resume, until
mid-February, for Speedweeks at Daytona, drivers will log hundreds
of miles in testing.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nemechek, who tested at AMS last week, said the ``off''
season at times can be busier than the ``on'' season. ``Since Jan.
1, we've been going wide open,'' Nemechek said. ``You're more tired
in the off season, because during the season they shut the garage
at 5 o'clock and you get to go out and relax,''he said. ``This time
of the year, you're at the race team working until 9, 10 or 11 at
night, whatever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the pressure to get a dozen or more cars per team
ready for a 34-race schedule is that the sport's biggest race is
its first event, the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   For almost all of February, the eyes of race fans everywhere are
on the ``World Center of Racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Daytona International Speedway opened in 1959,
drivers from across the United States came to Daytona to race on a
track that was half highway, half beach.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of racing at Daytona, teams have come to the
track with untried cars and often with new crews, but the spirit of
optimism is universally high.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip, who is predicting at least one win during his
final ``Victory Tour'' this year, will be making his last trip to
Daytona for the 500 _ as a driver, that is. He is as optimistic as
ever, despite a miserable 1999 season and several other
disappointing years that have come at the twilight of an otherwise
stellar career of three championships and 84 wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take a brand-new team that doesn't have a wrench in the
toolbox and they think they're going to have a great year,''
Waltrip said. ``The happiest time at the race track is just before
practice starts at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're walking around with your brand-new uniform on, you've
got your brand-new crew, brand-new car, got your brand-new truck,
got your brand-new everything, and you're going to win every
race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they go out on the race track. Some of them come back in
and feel the same way. Others say, 'Well, maybe I was a little too
optimistic.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the same boat,'' Waltrip said. ``I anxiously await the
first time on the race track to see if that optimism is going to be
true or not.''
</P>
<P>
   For drivers who have never run the Daytona 500, just being among
the entries is a major career milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Compton, one of seven rookies in Winston Cup this year,
will drive the No. 9 Melling Racing Ford. That car won four Winston
Cup events at Daytona in the days when Bill Elliott was its driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I've worked for all my life,'' said Compton, who
came to Winston Cup from NASCAR's truck series. ``I've been coming
to Daytona since I was six years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Jr. also has been watching Daytona races since he
was old enough to comprehend them. His dad dominated the track in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd almost sacrifice my whole career to get here,'' said
Earnhardt Jr., who won the NASCAR Busch Grand National title the
past two years. ``The only reason I've been driving a race car is
to get here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a phenomenal race track just to look at, let alone
race on,'' he said. ``There's been so much history since day one.''
</P>
<P>
   And the race is so important to Earnhardt that it could wind up
being a stumbling block for the rest of his year.
</P>
<P>
   He said his biggest obstacle to having a successful rookie
season would be missing the Daytona 500. ``Getting over that,''
Earnhardt said, ``getting that confidence back to go to the next
race, would be hard.''

BUSH, TRAILING MCCAIN IN POLLS, FAILS TO LIGHT UP CROWDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Governor George W. Bush awoke to some unpleasant
news Wednesday: He was still trailing Senator John S. McCain in
several New Hampshire presidential primary polls.
</P>
<P>
   But the real challenge here appeared to be the applause.
</P>
<P>
   The clapping was muted in Concord, where Bush spoke to a group
of Merrimack Republicans at breakfast time. Virtually no one
cheered in Hillsboro, when he addressed employees of a lightbulb
firm. The night before, more than 100 expected guests failed to
turn up at a Manchester Chamber of Commerce campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the weather has been miserable in recent days, and
Bush, fresh off a victory in the Iowa caucuses, may be suffering
from the complacency that sometimes strikes supporters of
front-running candidates. Yet his comparatively placid style on the
campaign trail has done little to turn up the volume _ and it is
helping give a dual shape to this year's primary race.
</P>
<P>
   On both the Democratic and Republican sides, there seem to be
two increasingly distinct styles: the calm appeal to voters versus
the frenetic attack on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Two candidates, Bush and Democratic challenger Bill Bradley,
appear to be taking the ``marathon approach'' to New Hampshire _
treating their personal campaigning as part of a long journey in
which they must pace themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The others, especially Democratic Vice President Al Gore and
McCain, are in a sprint. Their days are packed with events. Their
remarks are on the aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   And the fans, lining up to watch the race, are reflecting the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, Bradley is suffering in the primary polls, and not
because he fared so well in Iowa that voters assume he will win
here.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gore trounced Bradley into New Hampshire, then was
photographed frolicking in the snow on Tuesday, dressed in a
mustard-colored barn jacket. Bradley, wearing his long, formal
dress coat, as usual, gave one long, rambling speech that
afternoon, then disappeared until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, McCain has been on an energy offensive against Bush,
riding his campaign bus around the state and holding a total of 103
town meetings in recent months. On Tuesday night, while Bush was
greeting fewer than 100 people in Manchester, McCain was receiving
a rousing standing ovation from approximately 300 supporters at a
town hall meeting in Londonderry _ and that was after a day that
began at 7 a.m., included five major events and a bus breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   He outran not only Bush but also millionaire publisher Steve
Forbes, who had a light day of campaigning before Wednesday's
debate. Forbes has made just four appearances with New Hampshire
voters since returning from Iowa late Monday night. On Tuesday,
Forbes spoke to about 30 workers at a Hooksett beauty-supply
company, and later to around 100 people at Yoken's restaurant in
Portsmouth.
</P>
<P>
   Differing styles are even reflected in policy statements, and in
the amount of news each generates from day to day.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was pure aggression Wednesday, challenging Bradley to
reverse his opposition to welfare reform. He floated a new idea,
suggesting fathers who fail to pay child support should face
criminal penalties. Bradley generated the most news not with what
he said, but with what was said about him, following a new TV ad by
a grassroots organization in New Jersey accusing him of breaking
his own campaign fundraising stance.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, at least, the differing energy levels
seems to be as much a product of the supporters as of the
candidates. The insurgent nature of McCain's campaign appeals to
the New Hampshire independent streak, drawing out the most vehement
voters to public events.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush may also be suffering from the accusations that dogged
him earlier in the year: That he was taking the state and its
voters for granted. Thanks in part to his national focus, Bush
spent little time here compared to the other candidates before
hitting the trail full-force Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   His schedule is supposed to pick up dramatically and aides
pointed out that his lighter day on Tuesday followed his arrival in
Manchester at 2:30 a.m. the night before. Patrick W. Griffin, his
New Hampshire media strategist, insisted: ``He didn't have a day of
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see more and more and more of it,'' Griffin
said. ``(Thursday's) schedule is crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley aides, meanwhile, appeared caught off-guard by Gore's
foray Tuesday in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore dashed back out after an hour's sleep, Bradley slept
for three hours before appearing at his only event of the day, the
speech in Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had planned to attend a high school basketball game that
night, but the game was canceled because of the snow. His aides
sought another venue where he could mingle with voters with the
snow appeared to keep most people home, making even an impromptu
visit to a mall seem unproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his spokesman, Eric Hauser insisted, ``It was a fairly
full day for three hours of sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid criticism of his pace, Bradley has scheduled an uptempo
tour of New Hampshire for at least the next four days, including
several stops Thursday near the seacoast and at least two town
meetings Friday in Lebanon and Newport. On Saturday, he is
scheduled to campaign from Bedford, outside Manchester, to Berlin
and Hart's Location in northern New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley has a lot of zip,'' Hauser said. He described the
assertion that Bradley, at least when compared to Gore, is
campaigning at a more leisurely as ``a false perception.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley camp also said it will release tentative plans by
Friday for Bradley's campaign schedule the week after the New
Hampshire primary, reinforcing Bradley's contention that he has no
plans to pull out of the race, no matter how he fares in Tuesday's
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides were more than eager to underscore the differences
between the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is a scrapper, he is a fighter, he is feisty,'' Gore
spokesman Chris Lehane said. ``Senator Bradley is approaching this
as an academic exercise or salon-like atmosphere where grandiose
ideas are ruminated on over drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Complacency here can be the kiss of death, especially for
candidates who fail to campaign one-on-one in the final days,
longtime observers of the New Hampshire primary scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``This last week is the most important week,'' said Toni Pappas,
a former Hillsborough County Commissioner who is supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Walter Mondale was upended by Gary Hart here, as
Mondale traveled to Boston and Maine, neglecting New Hampshire
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't in New Hampshire and he wasn't walking the New
Hampshire walk,'' said Dayton Duncan, who was then Mondale's deputy
press secretary. ``If we had it to do over again, we'd do it
differently.''

GOP AD TO FEATURE BOB DOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Bob Dole, the 1996 GOP nominee, will enter
the primary fray Thursday in a television ad hammering Steve Forbes
for giving comfort to Democrats by aiming negative ads at
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial is paid for by the Republican Leadership Council,
a Washington-based group with numerous ties to Texas Governor
George W. Bush, though there is no evidence that Bush had anything
to do with the ad. This is the second spot aired by the RLC and
targeted at Forbes, though many political observers, such as the
state Republican chairman, have said Forbes is getting a bum rap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I emerged the Republican nominee, battered, bruised and broke
and a much easier target for the negative Clinton-Ggore fall
campaign,'' the announcer in the ad says, quoting Dole. ``I speak
up now only because it may be happening again. I believe the
Republican party and our eventual presidential nominee could be
damaged again.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcer then concludes, ``Mr. Forbes, stop the negative
ads. Don't help the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Miller, the executive director of the RLC, said his group
will air the ad more than 100 times on Boston and Manchester
television between now and Monday's primary. Miller said the RLC
put up the spot because Forbes is running an ad that criticizes
Bush for breaking a pledge against raising taxes in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to hammer our message that we need to unite to
win,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Forbes launched an advertising blitz in New Hampshire
that many believe was responsible for seriously damaging Dole's
chances here. He came in second after Patrick J. Buchanan. In the
2000 race, most candidates have been exceedingly fearful that
voters will view them as negative. The result has been that
candidates have taken a more gentle approach to one another this
primary season, and candidates who criticize on the issues have
been immediately accused of negative attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday officials from the campaigns of both Forbes and John
McCain charged the Bush campaign of orchestrating the ad in order
to shore up Bush's support among Republican voters at Forbes'
expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where were their ads when Governor Bush started attacking
Senator McCain here in New Hampshire?'' asked Greg Mueller, Forbes'
spokesman. ``This is just further evidence that they have growing
concern about our surging independent cmapaign. They are obviously
in cahoots with the Bush campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Mike Dennehy, McCain's New England director, ``Everyone
understands that the RLC is an extended arm of the Bush campaign.
The Bush campaign is seeing poll results that probably show Steve
Forbes cutting into George Bush so they're using the RLC to take
Steve Forbes down a notch.''

 &HT;    Coke severance package includes waiver asking employees not to
join bias lawsuit
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. is asking employees who will be laid off
and given severance packages to sign a waiver agreeing not to join
a race discrimination lawsuit currently pending against the
company.
</P>
<P>
   As is standard in most severance packages, Coca-Cola employees
will be asked to sign waivers agreeing not to take legal action
against the company.
</P>
<P>
   But the severance package being offered to employees affected by
Wednesday's layoffs will include waivers that specifically identify
the discrimination lawsuit against the company, said Ben Deutsch,
company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus Mehri, lead lawyer in the discrimination case, said
plaintiffs' lawyers will closely monitor the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it appears that the company is trying to coerce class
members to waive their civil rights or to buy their silence, we
will fight it every step of the way to protect the rights of our
class members,'' Mehri said.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch said all employees offered severance packages will be
clearly notified of their rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company's commitment is to be sensitive of all employees
and their families and implement this plan with the dignity and
respect that Coca-Cola people deserve,'' Deutsch said. ``All
employees who are affected by today's realignment will be treated
equally, fairly and with the utmost sensitivity and compassion by
the Coca-Cola Co.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch said waiver forms will state that if affected employees
are plaintiffs in the case or prospective class members, they can
contact local plaintiffs' lawyers. The attorneys' phone numbers
will be included on the waiver forms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mehri represents eight current and former Coca-Cola employees in
a lawsuit that claims African-Americans have been discriminated
against in pay, promotions and performance evaluations. The lawsuit
seeks to expand the case to class-action status and represent more
than 2,000 black employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has strongly denied the allegations. It also opposes
the plaintiffs' attempts to make it a class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   An employment law professor on Wednesday said Coca-Cola should
be extremely careful in how it handles its layoffs because of the
pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company should be really careful,'' said Dawn
Bennett-Alexander, law professor at the University of Georgia. ``It
could make what appears to be a perfectly good business move and
something that's done for all the right reasons . .. But if you've
got these considerations hanging over you, like this lawsuit,
sometimes you have to make sure or make adjustments so any layoffs
don't fall unevenly on groups that would be affected by law.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate E. Clayton Scofield III recently granted the
plaintiffs permission to amend their complaint, which now contends
Chairman and Chief Executive M. Douglas Ivester and other company
senior managers knew about ``companywide discrimination'' against
black employees since at least 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, U.S. District Judge Richard Story in Atlanta will
decide whether the class will attain class-action status.

IN REACHING SEMIFINALS, NORMAN JOINS THE ELITE
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ The fan with the bright yellow wig and
his painted friends returned content to their budget hotel rooms on
Wednesday night. A fellow Swede is again prospering in Melbourne.
But it is unlikely that the German Nicolas Kiefer sauntered off
singing into the persistent drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-seeded Kiefer remains the most accomplished player
who has yet to advance past a Grand Slam quarterfinal, despite
deciding to forgo the Davis Cup this year to concentrate on the
game's major individual events. To add to Kiefer's frustration, his
exit was engineered by a player who serves for his country's Davis
Cup team whenever he is asked.
</P>
<P>
   Magnus Norman may not yet be a household name, even in
Stockholm, but he won five tournaments in 1999 _ as many as Pete
Sampras and Andre Agassi. The problem was that Norman's victories
came in places like Long Island and Shanghai instead of in London
and Paris. But after his 3-6, 6-3, 6-1, 7-6 (4) victory over
Kiefer, the 12th-seeded Norman is truly in Sampras' and Agassi's
company _ in the semifinals of the Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm the happiest man on earth right now,'' said
Norman, a sturdy 23-year-old from Filipstad who will face
second-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the defending champion, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Agassi and Sampras will meet in the first and
much more anticipated men's semifinal. The women's semifinals,
which will also be played on Thursday, will match second-seeded
Lindsay Davenport against Jennifer Capriati, and top-seeded Martina
Hingis against Conchita Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   A finalist here in 1998, Martinez put her once common, but now
unusual, heavy topspin forehand to fine and frequent use on
Wednesday to defeat Yelena Likhovtseva, 6-3, 4-6, 9-7. Hingis, the
three-time defending champion in singles and doubles, defeated
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, 6-1, 6-1, in Wednesday's other
quarterfinal. It was Hingis' 13th consecutive victory over the
Spanish baseliner, a former world No. 1, and No. 10 Martinez,
another Spaniard, will not be expected to fare much better. She has
lost to Hingis seven times in a row without winning a set.
Kafelnikov defeated the tournament's most surprising
quarterfinalist, Younes el-Aynaoui of Morocco, 6-0, 6-3, 7-6 (4),
on Wednesday. He then seemed as interested in talking about his
passion for golf as about defending his title. ``If the weather is
bad, I'm still going to go golfing tomorrow,'' he said, ``no matter
what.'' Norman also has two sports on his resume: tennis and bandy,
which is roughly ice hockey played with a ball. When he was 16, he
received two invitations in the mail on the same day. ``The Swedish
bandy federation invited me to go with them to Russia, and the
Swedish tennis federation invited me to go to Florida,'' Norman
said. ``It was wintertime. Which do you think I chose?''
</P>
<P>
   His choice _ and his talent _ led him onto the ATP Tour. But
Norman had to take a major detour when it was discovered that he
had inherited a heart-valve condition from his mother, Lena, a
former member of the Swedish national swimming team. On Dec. 1,
1997, the day after the Swedish Davis Cup team defeated the United
States in the final, Norman underwent heart surgery Kiefer has been
reading about himself since he was a successful junior and being
compared and contrasted, like every promising German, to Boris
Becker. And Wednesday night, after serving brilliantly in the first
set and going up by 15-40 on Norman's serve in the opening game of
the second set, it appeared he might be headed for his first Grand
Slam semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Norman saved five break points in that first game and
then broke Kiefer's serve in the next game, which ended with a
double fault. The German was never quite the same confident and
precise player after that, falling prey to his own versatility by
failing to find the right blend between staying back and pushing
forward. Norman won the decisive tiebreaker on another Kiefer
double fault.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, overwhelmed, was soon leaning forward on his racket as
the fellow Swede in the bright yellow wig and his painted friends
chanted his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking that I actually made it, that I was actually
going to be in the semifinal of a Grand Slam event,'' he said.
``It's huge. I can find no words for it.''

COMMENTARY: WOMEN VOTE TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women.
</P>
<P>
   Remember them?
</P>
<P>
   It seems at times as if the presidential candidates, especially
on the Republican side, are blissfully unconcerned about a number
of issues that are of great concern to a large number of women.
</P>
<P>
   When the Republicans gather to debate, there is basically one
women's issue _ abortion. And in the minds of all the candidates,
the matter is settled. Daddy has already decided you can't have
one.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the candidates trudge into snowy New Hampshire, comes a
brand new poll, commissioned by Lifetime Television, that looks
beyond abortion and finds there are several issues that large
numbers of women feel are important and deserve more attention from
candidates in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Among the matters of concern to the women polled were inequities
in pay between men and women, workplace discrimination, the amount
of resources being committed to the fight against breast cancer,
the availability of reliable child-care options, violence against
women, paid medical leave for new parents and _ in two issues that
are getting a fair amount of attention in the campaign _ the effort
to shore up Social Security and the cost and availability of health
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Looking strictly at those issues, the Democrats seemed to hold
an edge over the Republicans in the poll. And in response to one
key question _ ``Overall, which party, the Democrats or the
Republicans, do you trust to do a better job coping with the main
problems the nation faces over the next few years?'' _ the
Democrats held a clear advantage. Forty-three percent of the women
said they trusted the Democrats more, and 28 percent said the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked to make a choice in a hypothetical match-up of
four major candidates _ George W. Bush, John McCain, Bill Bradley
and Al Gore _ 25 percent of the women said they would choose Bush,
24 percent said Gore (a statistical tie), 8 percent said they would
vote for McCain and 8 percent for Bradley. A third of the
respondents said they were not yet able to make a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime, a cable network that bills itself as ``Television for
Women,'' has been conducting what it describes as ``a multimedia
campaign to insure that women's voices are heard during the
presidential race.'' The network is sponsoring a presidential
candidates' forum in New Hampshire that will be televised Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted by EDK Associates, a public opinion
research firm in New York City. Among its findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ That 72 percent of the respondents felt that guaranteeing
Social Security benefits to future generations should be a higher
campaign priority than tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   _ That 69 percent worried ``a great deal'' that their family's
medical benefits might be reduced or eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   _ That 67 percent felt that discrimination against women in the
workplace remained a problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ That 63 percent were ``very concerned'' about the potential
health risks of environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues that are in this national poll are the issues we
hear about all the time,'' said Carole Black, the president and CEO
of Lifetime Entertainment Services. ``But many women feel that the
candidates are not paying sufficient attention to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has made universal health care a cornerstone of his
candidacy and has talked a great deal about children's issues. But
for a variety of reasons, including the low-key nature of his
campaign and the peculiar line-up of the early primaries, his
message has yet to filter into the consciousness of most Americans.
Time may be running out for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In a race between Bush and Gore, the front-runners in the
Lifetime poll, it would seem easier for Gore to make some headway
on the issues of most concern to women. Bush has tried to sing a
song of compassionate conservatism but is being fairly hamstrung by
the hard-right wing of his party.
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, these are traditionally Democratic
issues. The master at turning them to his advantage is in the White
House at the moment, preparing his final State of the Union
address.

PEACE WON'T SOLVE PROBLEMS OF SYRIAN BUSINESSMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ They have luxury cars, marble-floored offices,
satellite dishes, tailored suits and high-end computers. But young
Syrian entrepreneurs, anxious to catch up with their contemporaries
in other Arab countries, are feeling distinctly bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   On the horizon, they can see the outlines of a new world, one in
which Syria's inefficient and inward looking producers will have to
compete in a newly energized Middle East free of trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   And while an end to the 52-year-old state of war between Syria
and Israel is also in sight, with its promise of access to Western
markets and investment, many businessmen here fear they will not be
able to reap any of the economic dividends of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``With or without peace, we will be left behind,'' said Hashem
Akkad, an outspoken member of the traditionally quiescent Syrian
Parliament and a director of his family's bottling and advertising
concern. ``I told the government, `If you don't make changes, in
five years all our plants will be shut down.'''
</P>
<P>
   For restless business executives like Akkad, who said he had
given up trying to open new factories in Syria, the question of
whether they will do business with Israelis after a peace treaty is
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   They say their more pressing concern is how much longer Syrians
will be able to do business at all, given their country's lack of a
private banking system, the morass of regulations choking
investment and the peculiar pricing policy that makes Syrian goods
more expensive than better quality items produced in neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations during the last week, a number of Syrian
businessmen displayed a striking sense of anxiety about their
country's near-term future, even as they gingerly welcomed the
prospect of peace for its own sake.
</P>
<P>
   These men, all in their 30s and 40s and owners of small- and
medium- sized factories and service companies, are among the few
who took the risk of trying their hand at private enterprise after
President Hafez Assad relaxed some investment rules at the end of
the Persian Gulf War nearly nine years ago and opened the borders
to some imports.
</P>
<P>
   But those reforms turned out to be the last step instead of the
first toward liberalizing an economy built on socialism and
cronyism.
</P>
<P>
   Jamil Samin, 45, a businessman in Homs, an industrial city about
100 miles northeast of Damascus, at first jumped at the chance to
start his own company. But he has since found that there are
built-in limits to how much he can expand.
</P>
<P>
   Purchasing power is low in a country where the average per
capita income is estimated by international economists at about
$900 a year. Like other importers of goods besides sugar, oil and
other commodities, Samin has no access to credit and can acquire
hard currency to pay his Italian supplier only by buying dollars
from a Syrian exporter who has earned them.
</P>
<P>
   In practice that means he asks around to find, say, a farmer who
has sold vegetables for dollars to a neighboring country. The
farmer, who may have earned $20,000, is required to sell one-fourth
of the dollars to the government. The rest he can sell for Syrian
pounds to an importer who tracks him down, but only through the
government-owned commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It restricts my ability to grow,'' said Samin, who knows
something of conventional business practices because he worked for
an insurance company in the United States for a few years after
finishing college. ``Syria just does not have yet the structures
necessary to provide financing for import and export.''
</P>
<P>
   But its natural trading partners in the region do have them.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Turkey and the Persian
Gulf states have largely unleashed their entrepreneurs, created
capital markets and opened their economies to investment. Unlike
most Syrians, products of an insular political regime, many of the
new Arab entrepreneurs in those countries have traveled and lived
outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not so long ago, it was the Gulf countries that hired Syrians
to come and give technical and business advice,'' said Thaer Laham,
the owner of a can factory who was exposed to another way of doing
business during his college years in California. ``Now look at
them. They are ahead of us and export their own products to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases the imports coming from other Arab countries are
cheaper than the same Syrian-made goods, which cost more to produce
despite the country's low wages. One reason is the government's
pricing policy for Syria's own resources. Domestic clothing and
textile manufacturers, for example, pay 150 percent more than
European importers for the same Syrian-grown cotton.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is likely to become tougher in the coming years,
regardless of whether Israel is part of the regional trading mix,
because of a 1997 agreement among Arab states, including Syria, to
gradually eliminate all trade barriers. The effect will be a flood
of tax-free imported goods that may well be less expensive and of
better quality than Syrian-made products.
</P>
<P>
   ``A restructuring effort at all levels is needed,'' said Nabil
Sukkar, a former World Bank economist who runs the Syrian
Consulting Bureau in Damascus. ``The name of the game is
competition, within the domestic economy and with the outside
world. Other countries in the region are facing the same economic
challenges, but they started restructuring long before.''

BUSH'S `HISTORIC' WIN IN IOWA CAUCUSES WAS NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB RAY SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite his record-breaking showing in the Iowa caucuses _ a
feat that ``surprised'' and ``humbled'' him once again _ Texas Gov.
George W. Bush left the Hawkeye State a loser early Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I saw the numbers: Bush, 41 percent; publisher Steve
Forbes, 30 percent; radio commentator Alan Keyes, 14 percent;
conservative activist Gary Bauer, 9 percent; Sen. John McCain, 5
percent; and Sen. Orrin Hatch, 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Before the caucus voting, Bush tried to play down his
expectations, saying he'd be happy to win 35 percent of the vote in
a field of six candidates. The truth is, his campaign staff was
hoping that he would get more than 50 percent. Anything less than
that would not be a win for the governor who has been all but
crowned president.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, 41 percent is nothing to sneeze at, but considering
the time and money the governor spent in Iowa, he should have done
a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, 59 percent of Republicans voting in the Iowa
caucuses did not vote for Texas' favorite son. Then consider that
Forbes and Keyes, the two people who have the least chance of ever
becoming president of the United States, together outpolled Bush by
3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the fact that the real No. 2 man in the Republican
presidential race, McCain, didn't even take part in the quadrennial
Iowa sweepstakes, and the Bush victory looks even dimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called his showing ``historic,'' and he tried to look
enthusiastic about the outcome. But he seemed somewhat tentative to
me, and he wasted no time getting to New Hampshire to campaign for
the first primary next week.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important number coming out of the Iowa
caucuses was the 30 percent that Forbes received, giving him just
enough reason to hang on a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Bush needed to happen in the early going was for
his chief nemesis to get any encouragement to hang around a little
longer.
</P>
<P>
   That means the publisher is likely to stay on the attack, saying
those things that really irritate the governor and spending a lot
more money to do it.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Bush will have to spend more money, but he's got it to
spend.
</P>
<P>
   In his last days in Iowa, the governor had stopped holding his
daily news conferences, primarily to avoid being pinned down by the
press on the abortion question and to dodge any more queries about
that dad-burned Confederate flag issue.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, his campaign just wanted to stick with its
hand-picked issue of the day _ handing out news releases and
expecting the media to publish the propaganda without any
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   That dog won't hunt in New Hampshire, South Carolina and the
host of states to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will have to answer questions, and he won't be able to hide
behind those answers that include his belief in, and support of,
``states rights'' and ``local control.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how many people stay in the Republican race for
president, and no matter how long they stay in, things will not get
easier for Bush. He's going to have to face the music, including
the tune, ``Dixie''.
</P>
<P>
   If he thinks the Republican primary race has been a little
rough, just wait until he has to face Vice President Al Gore, who
was the real big winner in Iowa on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, garnering about 64 percent of the vote against rival Bill
Bradley, also had tried to lower expectations, knowing all the time
that he'd do quite well.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president loves to be underestimated, and he actually
prefers to start in the underdog position.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you least expect it _ and Bush may learn this the hard
way _ the underdog jumps up and bites you.

 DAMASCUS, SYRIA: long before.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one knows what rules might apply to trade with Israel. Syria
has insisted that the border between the countries must be decided
before, or at least at the same time as, the shape of future
relations. But many Syrian businessmen regard Israel as a market
much like Europe and the United States _ that is, an impenetrable
juggernaut that could roll right over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is Syria going to face European states that are free and
open while Syria is the least developed in terms of its industry?''
Rateb Shallah, the president of the Federation of Syrian Chambers
of Commerce and Industry, said at a symposium on trade between
Syria and the European Union last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not feasible to postpone decision-making, because we
will lose the chance for reform,'' he added, in a direct and public
admonition that not long ago would have been unthinkable from such
an establishment figure.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Syria's political debate is conjecture and
interpretation of small hints from above, and like everyone else,
businessmen take their cue from the government-controlled
television and newspapers about what is permissible to discuss
openly. Lately, at least in the view of some people, the signals
from the top have encouraged their hopes for change.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last March, Assad spoke generally about the need for
creating new economic institutions but did not give a timetable.
Lately, some businessmen said, the press has featured stories about
scandal and corruption in branches of the state banks, perhaps in
preparation for introducing a new policy.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these Syrian entrepreneurs also say they believe they
have a silent ally in Assad's son, Bashar, who is widely seen as
his father's chosen successor.
</P>
<P>
   He has not said anything publicly about economic policy, or much
of anything else. Still, based on little more than what one Syrian
businessman called ``Damascus chitchat'' and the fact that he was
educated in England, the younger Assad is widely presumed to be
open to free market ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Once one of the most industrialized countries in the region,
Syria has depended for 30 years on two mainstays: its limited oil
reserves and foreign aid. But now the Persian Gulf states, like
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, no longer subsidize the Syrian budget, as
they did from the 1970s until the late 1980s. Growth has now fallen
to 2 percent or less a year, said Sukkar, the economist.
</P>
<P>
   The dismal situation has left many of the most energetic of
Syria's entrepreneurs sitting in their well-appointed offices
wondering what the future holds.
</P>
<P>
   Mamoun Hallek, for instance, runs a school that employs 70
people who teach courses in business management, computers,
English, marketing, sales and more. His Mamoun International Center
in Damascus is a gleaming three-story complex built around a
pristine courtyard garden.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the 2,000 young men and women who graduate each year
from his institute cannot find managerial work in Syria's
stagnating economy and end up leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hallek's obvious financial success _ his gleaming black
Mercedes, cashmere jacket and mahogany office suite _ he said he
has reached the limit of what he can do without an infusion of
capital from outside investors. ``If I had to start again now,'' he
said, ``I wouldn't choose this kind of work.''
</P>
<P>
   He is thinking of shifting his attention to tourism, which
remains quasi-governmental, hoping to open a hotel management
school and a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``After peace, tourists will feel more at ease,'' Hallek said.
``That's what I hope _ that our image will improve. Right now, when
I go to America, people hear I am Syrian and they think I'm
carrying bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   But many others say the answers lie closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a mentality here that is unique in the world,'' Akkad
said. ``I established a pasta plant five years ago. Now it is
practically closed. Why? Because the government wants me to buy
local wheat. OK, I would encourage that, but they want to send me
low-quality wheat at $500 a ton. I can import wheat from Europe at
half that price. Is that the way the government wants to encourage
investment?''
</P>
<P>
   Akkad's litany of outrages seemed limitless. A billboard rented
for 15 days to an advertiser brings his company $1,000, he said,
while in Lebanon a company like his can charge $24,000. Customs
duties on many goods imported from Lebanon, meanwhile, will soon be
eliminated, even as Syrian producers pay high import duties on raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Even with peace, Syria will be a loser economically because it
will not be able to compete even with its Arab neighbors, according
to Akkad, who voiced what many other businessmen said were their
own fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``After peace, there will be no paradise like some people
think,'' he said. ``Since the right atmosphere is not available
nobody will come here. They will go to Lebanon and have a door open
to Syria without the problem of paying taxes to export their
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only logic I can see in this system is that someone wants
the industry in this country to be killed.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNKIRK, France _ Bruno Frydman had few illusions when he set up
shop in Paris in 1993 to build the kind of multiplex theaters that
helped revolutionize moviegoing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Though Frydman works for a subsidiary of a U.S. company, he is
French and well aware of how passionately attached the French can
be to homegrown culture. So, when he was asked by his company to
open multiplex movie theaters all around Europe, he based his
operations in Paris, thinking that if he could make it there, he
could make it anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it took him six years to get his latest and biggest
project built _ a 20-screen, 4,010-seat site in a harborside
shopping center in Dunkirk, a port city of 71,000 on the Straits of
Dover, known for its tragic role in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   His experience shows that he was right not to underestimate
French pride in their film heritage or the resistance of big
domestic multiplex developers like Gaumont, Pathe and UGC. And he
knew just how strong opposition in Europe can be to the way
suburban malls _ often anchored by multiplexes _ chew up the
landscape. Which is why he focused on urban projects.
</P>
<P>
   But although similar resistance to sprawl is growing in the
United States, in Europe the struggle to preserve historic towns is
even more crucial: Urban culture is what defines much of the
continent, and the old buildings and churches of inner cities are
as important to tourist appeal as are museums and natural beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this tricky atmosphere, Frydman (pronounced FREED-man),
whose company had been recruited by local officials and business
groups, managed to get the multiplex built. Success came in part
because local politicians, fearful themselves for the future of the
city center, blunted environmentalists' concerns by putting the
mall next to old downtown shopping streets. But it was also a
result of some tough and creative negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Frydman's company, AMC Europe SA _ a unit of AMC Entertainment,
the group that pioneered multiple-screen movie theaters in the
United States _ opened the $20 million theater complex here in late
November as part of a $110 million shopping mall. Featuring not
only American hits like ``Just Married,'' with Julia Roberts, but
also French films like the popular comedy ``Kennedy and Me,'' the
multiplex has been drawing 15,000 moviegoers a week, not far from
the 20,000 that AMC expects when it is at full speed.
</P>
<P>
   Dunkirk and its harborside multiplex illustrate a difficult
choice facing Europeans. While some fear for the future of local
film industries, developers and theater operators are convincing
local planners that downtown shopping centers anchored by large
multiplex movie theaters can help offset a decline in the vitality
of inner cities. (AMC has been using similar arguments in the
United States.)
</P>
<P>
   As multiplexes have spread across Europe in the last decade, the
number of moviegoers has soared, to 895 million in 1999 from 757
million just five years earlier. Thanks mainly to the explosion of
multiplexes, the number of screens rose to 27,466 from 23,108 five
years earlier. In Dunkirk, where the decline of heavy industries
like steel and chemicals and a drop in port activity have fostered
decay in the inner city _ driving unemployment to 15 percent, well
above the national average of 10.8 percent _ the complex that
houses Frydman's multiplex created 600 jobs. About 2,000 people
applied for the 109 jobs created by the multiplex alone, said
Arnaud Charron, its managing director.
</P>
<P>
   But the spread of multiplexes has done little to solidify the
position of local filmmaking in Europe, where American-made movies
reign supreme at the box office and the commercial success of local
films is erratic. In 1998, for instance, the last full year for
which statistics are available, the share of American movies in two
of the biggest markets, Britain and Germany, climbed to more than
80 percent, from less than 70 percent in 1997, when strong European
entries like the British hit ``The Full Monty'' briefly bolstered
the European share. In France, the American share reached almost 70
percent, from slightly above 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Karsten Grummitt, managing director of Dodona Research, which
follows the film industry, said that ``in France and Italy,
particularly, where governments protect the film industry,
multiplexes are viewed as an intrinsically American plan that lead
to American domination of the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In another sting to European pride, the spread of multiplexes
has hastened the demise of the grand old movie palaces of the 1920s
and 1930s. In Britain, the preservation group English Heritage is
pressing the government to add 30 theaters from the glory days of
moviegoing before World War II to a list of 120 that enjoy
protected status, though some now serve as bingo halls or churches.
The mayor of Paris, Jean Tiberi, has asked the French government
for help in preserving La Pagode, a faux-Japanese movie theater
that is a Parisian landmark, and the Champollion, a movie buffs'
sanctuary that was once the haunt of the director Francois
Truffaut.
</P>
<P>
   Such conservation efforts have not slowed the spread of the
multiplex. In Barcelona, Spain, AMC is putting the finishing
touches on a 20-screen outlet in a megamall of 220 stores and
restaurants on the site of a former locomotive works. In
Manchester, England, developers are transforming a disused cotton
mill into a shopping mall anchored by a multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are not lacking. The Barcelona project is a joint
venture of Hines Interests, a Houston developer, and a French
partner, Jean Louis Solal. And the biggest financial backer of the
Dunkirk project was a Dutch pension fund, Wereldhave.
</P>
<P>
   After little more than a decade since the European debut of the
multiplex, some countries already face overbuilding.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, for example, a battle erupted earlier this year when
UGC of France announced that it would challenge a domestic company,
the Kinepolis Group, on its home turf. Kinepolis pioneered the
multiplex concept in 1988 with a 25-screen, 7,600-seat monster in
Brussels that remains Europe's largest. UGC hopes to capture at
least 20 percent of the Belgian market; Kinepolis has had well over
half.
</P>
<P>
   So many multiplexes have opened in Rome, where the number of
screens rose in the last year to 174 from 138, that Leandro Pesci,
managing director of the Safin theater chain of the Cecchi Gori
Group, recently complained, ``We're cannibalizing each other.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, none of this derailed the Dunkirk project. Among its
supporters is Bernard Montet, director of retail services of the
Dunkirk Chamber of Commerce, which backed the city's 1992 plan to
put a stop to suburban mall development (it ``sucked people out of
the center,'' he said) and promote a big shopping center near the
disused port site that would be anchored by a multiplex theater.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to create fresh retail space plus parking, so as to
draw people back into the city. Four local retailers and a Virgin
Superstore would move in along with five restaurants, including
McDonald's and the popular French seafood chain Leon de Bruxelles.
</P>
<P>
   To design the multiplex, the city sought out AMC. The French
theater operator Gaumont has a multiplex in nearby Calais and did
not want to create competition for its own screens. The other two
big domestic multiplex developers, UGC and Pathe, a unit of
Vivendi, took themselves out of the running for developer of the
project because they objected to details of the financing package,
which AMC was willing to accept.
</P>
<P>
   Though some local retailers feared the fresh competition that
the shopping center would bring, others welcomed it as a source of
fresh business, Montet said.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest disruption from the multiplex, of course, would be
faced by the two downtown movie houses _ an eight-screen outlet
along Rue Nationale and a 90-seat art house called Studio 43. So,
deals needed to be struck.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Nouveau, the city's chief finance official and a
supporter of the project, said the city negotiated an agreement
with its owners to close the Rue Nationale outlet, called Les
Arcades, and build apartments on the site.
</P>
<P>
   For Studio 43, the situation was trickier. The 90-seat theater
receives considerable financial support from the city and was
founded in the 1960's as part of the French government's effort to
sustain interest in high quality film and the national film
heritage. It shows French and foreign films, organizes film
seminars and visits by school classes and holds an annual film
festival.
</P>
<P>
   According to French law, the mall project required approval by a
seven-member commission that included representatives of the
national film industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nouveau and other city officials sought to convince Studio 43's
operators that the new multiplex would enhance film, rather than
hurt it. ``We argued that AMC would raise interest in films by
increasing people's taste for them,'' Nouveau said. `'Our goal, of
course, was to increase business in the downtown area.''
</P>
<P>
   Frydman aimed to convince Studio 43 that AMC was not likely to
be a fifth column for American movies: though many other multiplex
operators are part of big production and distribution companies,
Frydman said, AMC is solely in the business of running theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Fabrice Bassemon, a program director for Studio 43, said he
found himself in a quandary. The theater relies on city aid, yet
the city was now also the principal promoter of the new multiplex.
Indeed, the city's only other movie theater, Les Arcades, was to be
sacrificed to the development plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Studio 43 accepted a deal: the multiplex would be
built, and AMC would make several concessions to the theater. Among
them was an agreement that only Studio 43 would show non-French
movies, including popular American films, with the original
English-language soundtrack but with French subtitles; the
multiplex would show only dubbed versions. Moreover, leaflets with
the Studio 43 program would be distributed at no charge at the
multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   Bassemon is skeptical of the long-term effects of AMC's arrival,
though the development had been impossible to stop because of its
larger potential economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But the accord has brought short-term benefits, he acknowledged.
After all, Les Arcades, which was closed under the deal, had
competed with Studio 43 because it regularly featured on two of its
eight screens foreign films in the original soundtrack, with
subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   So, in December, while AMC showed dubbed French versions of
``Sleepy Hollow'' by Tim Burton and ``Sweet and Lowdown,'' the
latest from Woody Allen, Studio 43 featured them in the original
soundtracks with subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bizarre,'' Bassemon said, ``but that's the
accord.''
</P>
<P>
   Frydman says it was patience and the will to negotiate that
smoothed local acceptance of change. ``It's a political and
cultural process,'' he said. He paused, reflected, then added,
``Can we always stop the Concorde from flying?''

RIGHT-WING POLITICIAN'S COALITION TALKS STIR NEGATIVE REACTIONS
OUTSIDE AUSTRIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By DONALD G. MCNEIL JR.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Several countries reacted with dismay on Wednesday to
the news that Jorg Haider, leader of the right-wing Freedom Party,
was in negotiations to form a coalition government in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, whose party came in second in October elections, is best
known abroad for his anti-immigrant stance and for remarks he has
made expressing sympathy for Third Reich labor policies and Nazi SS
war veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the parties that came in first and third said
efforts to rebuild their longtime ruling coalition had collapsed
after three months of talks. Haider's party has spent two days
negotiating with the Austrian People's Party, which has a
conservative, pro-business, pro-church stance and is led by the
current foreign minister, Wolfgang Schussel.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Haider would not become chancellor because he is
presently governor of the southern state of Carinthia, but he
remains the party's chief strategist and rules it with a tight
grip.
</P>
<P>
   News of the negotiations prompted Israel's foreign minister,
David Levy, to announce that his country would ``re-evaluate our
relations'' with Austria. In the past, Israel has threatened to
break off diplomatic ties if Haider becomes part of a ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The German government, in a statement worded carefully to avoid
appearing to interfere with its small neighbor, which it annexed
before World War II, acknowledged the ``voices of concern raised
inside Austria and abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   The French were significantly stronger, issuing comments from
the foreign minister saying Austria would put itself in a
``deplorable position'' with Haider in government. Quoting Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine, a government spokeswoman said exciting
imaginary fears to create populist movements was ``detestable.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's prime minister, Goran Persson, said developments in
Austria were ``not in line'' with the values of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   And Prime Minister Milos Zeman of the Czech Republic compared
Haider to other leaders of right-wing political parties in Europe,
including Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, Jean Marie Le Pen of France,
Vladimir Meciar of Slovakia and Vladimir Zhirinovsky of Russia.
Reuters quoted him as saying they all ``represent danger for
democratic life,'' and ``Haider represents risks for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   European Jewish groups, student groups and labor groups also
reacted negatively to the news of Haider's ascendancy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, foreign leaders condemned and avoided Austria after
Kurt Waldheim, a former U.N. secretary-general, was elected
president. Waldheim was found to have lied about his wartime past,
during which he was in a unit involved in atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   But today Austria is not a small neutral country but a member of
the European Union and in line to preside over the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is playing a leading role
in policing the former Yugoslavia and building democracy in the
countries of the former Soviet bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, who turned 50 on Wednesday, apologized for his remarks
in November, saying he was sorry he hurt the feelings of those who
suffered under Naziism and insisted that Naziism had no part in his
personal values, which he described as ``tolerance and humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Sichrovsky, a Jewish leader in Haider's party, called them
``a couple of stupid remarks that are constantly quoted.'' On a
recent tour of the United States, where he long ago took his
daughters to visit the Holocaust Museum, Haider insisted he was ``a
pure democrat.'' His parents were avid followers of Hitler, but
many postwar baby boomers are in the same position.
</P>
<P>
   A witty, relaxed speaker whose October campaign featured
narcissistic commercials lingering on images of his tanned face,
Haider endorses a total ban on immigration, uses words like
``uberfremdung'' (over-foreignization) that are redolent of the
Third Reich, and raises the chilling specter of drug dealers taking
over his country, which is a tranquil Alpine land with minuscule
crime rates. His adherents say his anti-immigrant stance is not
race-based, but stems from fear that cheap laborers from eastern
Europe will take the high-paying jobs of his unionized followers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, while in Stockholm for a conference on the
Holocaust, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel told reporters,
according to Reuters, that ``for every Jew in the world, the rise
to power of an extreme right-wing party in Austria is a highly
disturbing signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider has denied having any anti-Semitic feelings and
anti-Semitism has never been part of his campaign platforms.

SECURITY COUNCIL SETTING STAGE FOR PEACEKEEPING OPERATION IN
CONGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Laying the groundwork for an eventual U.N.
peacekeeping operation for the war in Congo, the Security Council
Wednesday urged African nations involved in the conflict to put
into effect a peace accord they negotiated last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, signed in Lusaka, Zambia, on July 10, was
intended to lead to an immediate cease-fire, the integration of
rebels into the national army and discussions on the country's
future government. But no progress has been made apart from the
appointment in December of a mediator, Sir Ketumile Masire, a
former president of Botswana.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's Security Council action, in the form of a unanimous
``presidential statement,'' reasserted the goals of the Lukasa
accord and asked that the withdrawal of foreign forces from Congo
be a priority. Half a dozen nations are involved in the war. Congo
is supported by Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia. Congolese rebels are
backed by Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Tuesday, President Laurent Kabila said
he would have no trouble starting a dialogue with the armed
opposition in Congo if the Ugandans and Rwandans _ who first put
him in power and then turned against him _ would leave the country.
Uganda and Rwanda argued here this week at a meeting of African
leaders with the Security Council that they can't withdraw until
their borders with Congo are secure.
</P>
<P>
   In Rwanda's case, officials say that up to half a million Hutu
associated with massacres of Tutsi in 1994 are still in eastern
Congo, from which they launch attacks on both Rwanda and Burundi,
both with Tutsi-led governments.
</P>
<P>
   The Congolese rebels did not sign the Lusaka peace accord
because they squabbled at the last moment over who would represent
one of their groups. Several rebel leaders were in New York this
week, but did not speak at any formal U.N. sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Seven presidents who have been in New York for Security Council
meetings and private talks this week pledged their support for
Wednesday's declaration. In addition to Congo, they came from
Uganda, Rwanda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Angola and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   As work begins on a resolution creating a U.N. mission for
Congo, beginning with 500 cease-fire monitors backed by a force of
about 5,000 troops to protect them, council members say they are
all aware how dangerous any Congolese operation is likely to be for
independent relief workers as well as soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement issued Wednesday, the council said it
``underlines the absolute necessity of security and access for
United Nations personnel deployed in support of the Lusaka process
and stresses that such a climate is an essential prerequisite.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Kabila, who overthrew Mobutu Sese Seko in what was then
Zaire in 1997, the U.N. and private relief groups have had serious
problems in Congo, some of them with Kabila himself. In the year
after taking power, he prevented Secretary-General Kofi Annan from
sending a human rights team into the countryside to investigate
reports of human rights abuses by Kabila's followers.
</P>
<P>
   For almost four decades the United Nations has also had the
memory of one of its greatest tragedies hanging over Congo. In 1961
Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold was killed there in a plane
crash on a mission of peace.

GROUP SAYS JEFFERSON PROBABLY FATHERED SLAVE'S CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly 200 years after Americans first whispered
that one of their presidents might have fathered the children of a
slave, the foundation that runs Thomas Jefferson's estate has
concluded that Jefferson almost certainly was the father of at
least one, if not all six, of slave Sally Hemings' children.
</P>
<P>
   After DNA evidence was reviewed, more than 100 descendants of
Jefferson's slaves were interviewed, and papers related to
Jefferson's Monticello home were reviewed, ``the weight of the
evidence was compelling and persuasive,'' Daniel P. Jordan,
president of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure adds another complication to the study of a man
seemingly at war with his attitudes toward African-Americans and
slavery, and reflects the nation's deep and tumultuous struggle in
the area of race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, whom schoolchildren study as the freedom-loving
author of the Declaration of Independence, was himself the owner of
as many as 170 slaves. Jefferson once called slavery ``an
abominable crime,'' yet he himself freed just a handful of his own
slaves.
</P>
<P>
   In none of the many thousands of papers Jefferson left does the
former president refer to such a relationship with Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very complicated, but slavery was a complicated
institution,'' Jordan said. ``And race relations today are
complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Six of the slaves freed by the country's third president were
Hemings' adult children, fueling the belief that Jefferson was
indeed their father.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the foundation, which owns Monticello, was
released Wednesday in response to a 1998 DNA test that showed that
a Jefferson male likely was the father of Hemings' youngest son,
Eston.
</P>
<P>
   The report gives official weight to what Hemings' descendants
have argued for many years. ``It's pretty amazing that it's coming
out of Monticello,'' said Scot French, assistant director of the
Carter G. Woodson Institute for African and African-American
Studies at the University of Virginia. ``It should put the matter
to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Jordan said the foundation's findings are ``not 100
percent proof, not an absolute establishment, of paternity. There
are still gaps. We are open to new evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``we believe there is a high probability'' that President
Jefferson fathered one or more of Hemings' offspring, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time that someone is validating what oral history
has confirmed for years,'' Shay Banks-Young, a Hemings descendant,
told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The Monticello Association, a group of descendants from
Jefferson daughters Martha Jefferson Randolph and Maria Jefferson
Eppes, declined to comment on the foundation's findings because its
director had not seen the report, the Associated Press reported.
The Monticello Association has not generally backed the idea that
Jefferson and Hemings had a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson would have fathered the children before the years of
his presidency, 1801-1809. Public speculation about Hemings and
Jefferson began in 1802, when a political foe of Jefferson's, James
Thomson Callender, published an account of the relationship in a
Virginia newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The story was picked up by partisan newspapers and was often
mentioned during Jefferson's presidential tenure, according to an
historical account by the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear whether Jefferson and Hemings had a consensual
relationship, though the suspected, decades-long length of the
liaison suggests that it was at least mutually sexual, if not
romantic, said Joseph Ellis, history professor at Mt. Holyoke
College and author of ``American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas
Jefferson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``DNA can tell you the physical, but it can't tell you the
emotional,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans, Ellis said, tend toward the romantic tale, in
which two people of different races and vastly divergent levels of
social and political power were tragically forced to keep their
love secret to assauge public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In an upcoming, mid-February CBS miniseries on Jefferson and
Hemings, ``Sallie Hemings and Thomas Jefferson: an American
Scandal,'' the two are portrayed as lovers. Hemings comes off as
the more sympathetic character, one who remains true to her lover
and her master.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson is cast as someone true to his love, but also to his
life as a powerful politician and plantation owner, a man capable
of great love and affection, but also of duplicitousness.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson ``was a racist,'' Ellis said, a man who once contended
that blacks were inferior to whites. The former president had a
paternalistic attitude toward his slaves, and said that freeing
slaves after a lifetime in captivity would be ``like abandoning
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians have long suspected the relationship, but could never
prove it, Ellis said, since neither Hemings nor Jefferson made any
reference to it in their letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was really difficult for historians to comprehend was
how, for that length of time, Sally and Tom would have lived this
double life of being master and slave, and also husband and wife,
with more than a hundred slaves around them'' at Monticello, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibits at Monticello will be changed in the future to
include the findings about Jefferson and Hemings, Jordan said,
though it's not yet clear what the format will be.
</P>
<P>
   The academic investigation of the relationship between president
and slave is part of a new approach the foundation has taken over
the last two decades, one in which the African-American history of
Monticello is included. The current exhibit at the plantation site
features oral histories by descendants of Monticello slaves.

 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has used his seven State of the
Union addresses to define and redefine himself in response to the
shifting tenor of the times. In successive years he has been budget
balancer and health care fixer, political penitent and moral
preacher, master of the classroom and savior of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   As he rises from the well of the House to the rostrum on
Thursday night, he will adopt yet another identity. What guise will
he assume in this, his last, legacy-defining State of the Union
address?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has used these set-piece speeches as mileposts of his
political pilgrimage. It has been a patchwork progression, marked
by a number of consistent themes and a few unexpected detours. The
speeches have sought to reposition the president when external
events like the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 and the
1998 year of scandal have forced him to adapt to changing political
realities.
</P>
<P>
   In them, he has seized the high ground of principle while deftly
delivering a partisan stiletto. He has made scores of promises only
to come back a year later to blame his opponents for failing to
deliver them. He has taken credit for Republican plans he bitterly
fought. He has been bombastic and demagogic, exhausting and
occasionally apologetic, and almost always highly effective.
</P>
<P>
   In his first speech to a joint session of Congress, in 1993, he
declared that government must do more and proposed $30 billion in
new spending; three years later he proclaimed the end of the era of
big government and demanded that Congress pass a balanced budget.
In 1995, he said he had been humbled by the collapse of his health
care plan and the public repudiation he received in the mid-term
elections of 1994; a year later he gloried in his victory over
Republicans in the budget battle that led to the closing of the
federal government, even as he stole many of their small-government
themes.
</P>
<P>
   Woven through this seeming crazy quilt are the president's
bedrock themes of opportunity, responsibility and community. The
themes appeared in his presidential announcement speech in October
1991 and are certain to be a part of his remarks this week and in
any farewell address he might give next January, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers say the State of the Union is the president's most
cherished public ritual. For an hour or more, Clinton commands a
national television audience and dominates the House chamber,
literally and figuratively looking down upon the assemblage of
lawmakers, judges, generals and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his favorite time of year,'' said Michael Waldman, the
president's former chief speechwriter who is writing a book about
his White House experiences. ``He loves the policy, he loves the
rewriting and rewriting, the politics and the polling and the
showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It combines everything he does well,'' Waldman said. ``He
knows when he walks in the chamber he's very good at this, and his
opponents are usually cowed at the end of the speech. And he'll
really miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is something of an oddity that Clinton each year has
delivered this address in the midst of some event that has
transfixed the nation or transformed his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the speech came the same month he was forced to approve
the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the
matters known together as Whitewater. In 1995, Clinton was driven
to defend his relevance as he faced a hostile new Republican
Congress. Two years later, he returned in triumph after winning an
overwhelming re-election victory over Bob Dole _ but had to compete
for the attention of viewers with the verdict in the O.J. Simpson
civil trial. In 1998, he delivered the State of the Union barely 24
hours after pronouncing one of the most memorable sentences in
American politics: ``I did not have sexual relations with that
woman, Ms. Lewinsky.'' Last year, he spoke in the middle of his
Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   In each instance, he has been able to capture the public's
attention and, when necessary, remake himself to meet expectations.
After his legislative and electoral losses of 1994, he refashioned
himself from prime minister responsible for passing laws to the
head of state straddling the two parties and standing above them at
the apex of a political triangle. In 1998, in a very real sense, he
saved his presidency by persuading the public that the Lewinsky
matter was a temporary distraction from the economic and social
progress the nation was making under his stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we've seen is an incredibly adaptable politician
conforming to the political necessities of the time,'' said Ross K.
Baker, professor of political science at Rutgers University. ``Far
from being rigid, the president is absolutely protean. He has the
ability to assume guises depending on the political weather and has
shown himself remarkably dextrous and able to come up with the
occasional dramatic gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has understood the value of the formal address to
Congress from the beginning. Although he did not give a formal
State of the Union speech in his first year, he did address a joint
session of Congress in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was a result of a chaotic drafting process and was
still being rewritten as the president went to the Capitol to
deliver it. Clinton proposed nearly $500 billion in taxes and
spending cuts to reverse growing federal deficits, but insisted on
including new spending on children, worker training, technology and
infrastructure to prepare the country for the digital economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a symbolic move, he seated Alan Greenspan, the dour chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board, in the balcony next to Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 speech was memorable for Clinton's pen-waving vow to
veto any health care plan that did not provide coverage for all
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, a sheepish Clinton acknowledged that he and Mrs.
Clinton ``bit off more than we could chew'' and proposed modest
steps to remake the health care system.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 speech was a model of the ``third way'' approach to
governing that Clinton has advocated since the Republican victories
in 1994. He declared ``the era of big government is over'' and
adopted Republican language on making government smaller and more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   There were few expensive new policy proposals and a heavy
emphasis on promoting family values and cleansing popular
entertainment of sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That speech put him in a commanding position to win the 1996
election,'' Waldman said. ``It set a pattern he's followed ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the 1997 speech to review the highlights of his
first term and to declare education to be the overriding priority
of his second. While Clinton has pursued several education
initiatives _ smaller class sizes, school construction programs,
national standards _ Congress has been stingy in paying for them
and his attention has often wandered.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 and 1999 speeches were memorable more for their context
than their content. On a blustery day in January 1998, the nation
held its breath, wondering whether Clinton would survive the
revelations of an affair with a young White House aide.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton strode to the front of the House chamber and declared
that the state of the union _ and, by implication, his own _ was
strong. He never once mentioned the scandal and left his audience
marveling at his resilience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton uses the State of the Union better than many of his
predecessors,'' said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential scholar at
the University of New Orleans. ``I have no doubt this speech will
be a great success, like most of the others. He's such a great
orator. Every time you see one of these speeches, you shake your
head and say, `He could have been a great president.'''

 &HT;    Rams credit Faulk for success
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ His work off the field has been just as important to
the Rams as his work on it.
</P>
<P>
   When they acquired Marshall Faulk last offseason, they got what
they expected. The 26-year-old running back was brilliant, leading
the league in rushing with 1,381 yards. He had seven rushing
touchdowns and 87 receptions for another 1,048 yards and five
scores. The combined yardage was an NFL record.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of production that helped catapult the Rams from
substandard to Super Bowl status. And to a man, they credit Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   The yards and touchdowns mattered. But Faulk also added
professionalism, work ethic, commitment and toughness _ necessary
intangibles that help shape a quality club. He has given new
meaning to the phrase ``all-purpose'' back.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, Marshall's the MVP,'' said
quarterback Kurt Warner, who actually won the award. ``He has had a
huge impact. He's just an incredible player. He has all the skills.
From a running and receiving standpoint, he can do pretty much
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on top of that, he is very, very intelligent. He really
knows what's going on. He understands the scheme of things,
understands what the defenses are trying to do. And I think that's
what makes him so special there. There are a lot of guys that have
physical talents, but when you put his physical talents, his
versatility together with his intelligence, I think that's what
really sets him apart and makes him such a special player.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk is a typical running back when it comes to his desire to
carry the ball. He wants it. But he's atypical when it comes to
assessing his responsibilities to his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a football player,'' he said. ``I think that sums it up. I
run the ball because that's my position. But as a total football
player, I do whatever has to be done to help the team win.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes little things. Like when the Rams played at
Carolina on December 5. During a frantic drive, receiver Az-Zahir
Hakim took a hard shot after a catch that left him writhing in pain
on the grass. St. Louis was in a hurry-up offense and had no time
to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Hakim knew he needed to line up for the next play, but was
unable to get up. Faulk rushed over and lifted him by the jersey so
he could line up and the drive could continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tells you that he's aware of everything that's
happening,'' Hakim said. ``Time was precious. I don't know if I
could have gotten up. But Marshall did what he had to do to get me
in a position so we could save time. That's a professional who's
trying to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk's approach to the game has been described as professional
by his teammates and coaches. And influential, in that young and
old players alike witness his approach to the game and copy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm going to let it sink in, because there's
another goal I want to attain, and I'm sure my teammates feel the
same way,'' said Faulk, who grew up in New Orleans and played
college ball at San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marshall is better than I thought,'' coach Dick Vermeil said.
``I expected him to be what he's been on the field. He's an awesome
talent. But the way he is with the guys, the way he studies film,
comes to work everyday to accomplish something. ... Our guys have
picked up on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk picked up big respect among his teammates in the NFC
Divisional Playoff game against Minnesota. Late in the Rams'
blowout victory, the frustrated Vikings made an aggressive assault
on Warner after a play ended. Before anyone could react, the
5-foot-10, 211-pound Faulk broke things up and kept the Vikings off
his quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw what was happening and I just re-directed them to their
bench,'' is how Faulk put it.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Roland Williams put it differently. ``Marshall's a
tough guy,'' he said. ``He wasn't having any of that. He protects
his teammates. He's all about winning and winning as a team. You
can tell it's important for him to be a good teammate. And when you
see a star like him being that committed, it has to rub off on
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk goes about his business sparing words and leading through
actions. And not just with the way he turns screen passes into
57-yard touchdowns. More significantly, it's Faulk's willingness to
go at it with the big guys.
</P>
<P>
   In passing situations when he's blocking, Faulk plays as hard as
he does a sweep around left end.
</P>
<P>
   ``He not only runs, but he blocks,'' offensive tackle Fred
Miller said. ``I've seen veteran backs who didn't care about
anything but running the ball. They just ran to daylight. Marshall
takes all parts of the game seriously. He delivers licks back there
as a blocker. As an offensive lineman, you respect that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's so good at picking up the blitz because he's a
student of the game. You can tell by the things he says in the
huddle. Marshall has been really important. He's a character
player, a character guy. He's brought a lot to the team, more than
the yards. He has been our MVP. All you have to do is look at our
team when he's out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not very often, as his status as the team's leading
rusher and receiver attests. And that's just the way he wants it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew my role would be what it's been when they brought me
here,'' he said. ``If I'm called on to run it a lot, catch it a
lot, block a lot, that's what I'll do. I do what it takes to win.
And I think that's the attitude the team has taken on. There is no
one selfish on the team. That's why this is so special because
we've come together in a short time.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk's expression will get more serious as Sunday approaches.
``I won't let myself get distracted,'' he said. ``Within the
parameters of the whole thing, you have to keep in mind that there
is a football game you have to play on Sunday, maybe the biggest
game of your life. Not a lot of people get a chance to play in the
Super Bowl, and through all of that you have to go out there and
play your normal game and have fun with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not as friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Rams' victory against Tampa Bay in the NFC title game,
Faulk took a moment from the jubilation of the locker room to take
a deep sigh. He in front of his locker wearing has uniform pants
and a t-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk had been neutralized by the Buccaneers' defense, but his
impact on the team was not lost. As he finally rose to his feet, an
unidentified teammate awash in sweat and champagne halted his
celebration for just a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you very much, Marshall,'' he said. ``You got us here.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk nodded without looking up. ``The goal is always to win,''
he said. ``That's the only thing that matters.''

MEXICAN GOVERNMENT REPORTS DRAMATIC PROGRESS IN WAR ON DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By SAM DILLON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The Mexican government on Wednesday asserted that
its soldiers and police seized far more drugs last year than
previously, partly as a result of increased spending on high-tech
gadgetry, aircraft and naval vessels deployed in the narcotics war.
</P>
<P>
   The secretaries of defense, navy and interior and the attorney
general described dramatic progress against the drug trade in an
annual joint appearance before journalists. The cabinet officials'
statements appeared timed to cast Mexico's anti-drug efforts in a
positive light one month before President Clinton must report to
Congress on how foreign governments are cooperating in the
narcotics war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made very substantial advances,'' said Interior Minister
Diodoro Carrasco Altamirano, summing up a slide show and the
reports of his three colleagues, delivered in an auditorium at the
Interior ministry. ``We achieved better coordination among our
institutions, and we deployed better-trained Mexicans in the
anti-drug struggle. We employed new, cutting-edge equipment. We
spent government resources like never before, and we used them
better. Our results this year were, frankly, very encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   That description of Mexico's progress contrasted dramatically
with testimony to the U.S. Congress in September, when Richard
Fiano, head of operations for the Drug Enforcement Administration,
painted a picture of a Mexican anti-drug force that was
under-equipped, understaffed and underpaid. He specifically
belittled the work of Mexico's most elite anti-drug units, the
Border Intelligence Units, known as BIUs, and the Sensitive
Intelligence Units, the SIUs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigative achievements of the BIUs and the SIUs as
related to cases against the major drug-trafficking organizations
are minimal,'' Fiano said. Only a few of 343 Mexican police
officers who had graduated from a training course in the United
States and had won the confidence of American officials had been
given significant anti-drug assignments after their return to duty
in Mexico, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official who works for Mexico's attorney general, asked
to respond to Fiano's remarks Wednesday, bristled slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask the DEA why they haven't captured the top traffickers in
the United States,'' the Mexican official shot back.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate briefing on Wednesday, Mariano Herran Salvatti,
Mexico's Special Prosecutor for Drug Crimes, told three foreign
journalists that Fiano had erred in several of his statements to
the Congress. Herran said that two anti-drug operations carried out
this fall by Mexican officials had significantly disrupted the drug
mafias, and he asserted that Fiano himself had been impressed by
the Mexican advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiano's views have changed,'' Herran said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Mexican officials are often at loggerheads over their
governments' respective drug efforts. They frequently disagree even
about what criteria to emphasize in evaluating progress. DEA
officials say that the most important anti-drug task facing Mexico
is to arrest the country's top narcotics chieftains.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials, in contrast, stress how much they are
spending on the anti-drug efforts: more than $463 million in this
fiscal year, Madrazo reported on Wednesday. They also emphasize the
quantities of drugs they are confiscating; and seizures of
marijuana, heroine, and opium paste increased dramatically from
1998 to 1999, Madrazo said. For example, the number of kilograms of
heroine confiscated increased to 222 in 1999 from 122 in 1998, he
said. Cocaine seizures increased to 26 metric tons from 24, he
said.

 &HT;    With the bash comes a bashing
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Perhaps this is a few days late. You should have been
forewarned. When the Super Bowl comes to town, be prepared to be
taunted, tweaked, even bashed, and Atlanta is one of the most
vulnerable. You know, we've got Bubba. Pickup trucks and gun racks.
Bar-B-Q on light bread. Our drawl. Y'all. Come back, y'hear.
Vendors squabbling about places on the street, the kind that made
downtown look like a flea market during the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   So tuck in your pride. Grit your teeth and be prepared for an
outbreak of columns no less than insulting, all in the interest of
good yucks. I'm just sorry Lewis Grizzard isn't still around to
help you fight back. If ever a man hated anything north of Athens,
it was Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta began growing up, and out, all of a sudden. Got awful
big for its britches. It had the foundation of Coca-Cola and Delta
Air Lines, then the Braves moved in from Milwaukee during the reign
of Ivan Allen Jr., and the sprawl was on.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have a mayor with embarrassing bias. Bill Campbell, I
hear, says he's pulling for the Titans because they have a black
quarterback. Should Gov. Barnes pull for the Rams because their
quarterback is white? I've never understood these mayors who feel
compelled to get involved in sports events, with some sort of
idiotic bet, in which only some secretary is interested. Get out of
sight. It's for athletes, not political poachers. Get back to work
on the sewage problem, mayor.
</P>
<P>
   About the weather. Sorry, but that's under control of a higher
authority. Not many realize that Atlanta is at the second-highest
altitude in the major leagues, next to Denver. There are times when
Atlanta is colder than Anchorage. Snow strikes all of a sudden, 8
to 10 inches. Then, of course, it's gone two days later. It was
cold when the Super Bowl passed this way the last time, near about
froze out Nick Nicolosi's charity golf tournament at Golf Club of
Georgia. That's up north, of course. Several tenderfoot teams
picked up after nine holes.
</P>
<P>
   You don't like the weather here? How about Pontiac, the year of
the blizzard? How about Minneapolis, where snow was axle deep? Palo
Alto, where I had my wallet lifted? It's my conclusion that the
game should rotate, like All-Star games. Don't you miss the frozen
tundra? What the Super Bowl needs is a repeat of the ``Ice Bowl.''
How I'd like to see these players skate around on Lambeau Field
once again.
</P>
<P>
   You've read and heard of shots fired on the state flag, led
usually by a free-lance itinerant who lusts for headlines. I would
mention Jesse Jackson's name here, but he isn't the only one. There
are references in sports columns, written by some who call it a
``Confederate flag.'' It's the state flag with the Confederate
battle symbol super-imposed. Frankly, I don't care what kind of
flag they wave. It won't reduce taxes or improve the flow of life.
</P>
<P>
   You may have noticed that Atlanta has taken the ice plunge again
and, in the thrust of it, revived a name that this readership never
realized before. Atlanta began as Thrasherville, named for ``Big
John'' Thrasher, who started it all. A historical plaque at
Marietta and Spring streets confirms all this. It later became
Terminus, then Marthasville and finally Atlanta, just in time for
Sherman to torch it. The hockey Thrashers have no connection with
``Big John,'' but a bird.
</P>
<P>
   There are some brighter points to Atlanta, as summarized by Jon
Saraceno in USA Today, softening a harsher tone. Coca-Cola, the
bars in Buckhead, CNN Center, Martin Luther King's birthplace,
Underground, and I'll have to take his word for that. That's past
my bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any state that produced Margaret Mitchell, Little Richard and
Kim Basinger can't be all bad,'' he concludes. Hmmm, at least it's
on the positive side, but I could add Chateau Elan, Callaway
Gardens, Sea Island and the Masters and give it a boost.
</P>
<P>
   It's a riot, the Super Bowl. It just makes a city want to snap
its galluses. It has the world at attention, for otherwise it's
just another day on the calendar in the dull of winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Super Bowl is no more just a football game than the
Kentucky Derby is just another horse race,'' it is written.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl is no more just a football game than the United
Nations is united, I say.

 &HT;    Bush strikes Super Bowl gold twice
 &HT;    By Tim Tucker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The odds of a player reaching the Super Bowl twice in
two years are long. The odds of doing it with two different teams
are longer. And the odds of doing it with the Atlanta Falcons and
St. Louis Rams, of all teams, are unfathomable.
</P>
<P>
   Devin Bush is on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at this time, he was in Miami, getting ready for
Super Bowl XXXIII with the surprising Falcons. This week, he is in
Atlanta, preparing for Super Bowl XXXIV with the shocking Rams. For
him, the second time is better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't feel a part of it last year,'' he said. ``The
experience was so bitter for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' first-round draft choice in 1995, he started all
but one game at safety in '96 and '97. Last season, he was not a
starter, playing mostly on the nickel unit. By Super Bowl week, he
had lost even that role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Went through some rough years with the Falcons,'' he said,
``and when the team got successful, I was left out of the picture.
It was hard to swallow. . . . When the clock hit double zeroes at
the end of the Super Bowl, I knew that chapter of my life was
over.''
</P>
<P>
   A free agent, he signed quickly with the Rams, the NFL's
losingest team of the '90s. ``I got this question a lot: `Why would
you go from a Super Bowl team to the Rams?''' Easy answer. They
wanted him.
</P>
<P>
   He opened this season playing on special teams and backing up at
free and strong safety. A low point came Oct. 17, when he played
sparingly against the Falcons here. ``I had wanted to show those
guys `you shouldn't have let me go, I'm gonna make you pay for
it.''' After the game, cornerback Todd Lyght told him: ``Keep your
head up. We're going to need you at free safety if Keith (Lyle)
gets hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks later, Lyle _ who had started 73 consecutive games _
suffered a bruised nerve in his neck and left shoulder. Bush has
started the nine games since then, including two in the playoffs.
Lyle finally returned to action last week, for about 20 plays, but
even with him back in the mix, Bush knows he'll have a far greater
role in this Super Bowl than in the last one. And this one is being
played in, of all places, his former team's home stadium.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, that part of it, he insists. ``It's not like we're
playing against the Falcons. It's not like the Georgia Dome shunned
me. The team did. . . . It's just a blessing to come back to the
Super Bowl and be a part of it. It erases all the bad memories of
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   He apparently came close to creating another bad memory after
the NFC title game: He and 340-pound Tampa Bay guard Frank
Middleton had an altercation _ variously described as a fight or a
near-fight _ in the tunnel at the Trans World Dome. Police officers
intervened and told the players to break it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to shake the guy's hand _ I was like, `That stuff said
on the field, leave it on the field' _ and he started to take it in
another direction,'' Bush said. Middleton called the Rams ``a bunch
of punks'' who ``don't win right.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning is new to them, that's for sure. Between them, the Rams
and Falcons franchises made it to just one of the first 32 Super
Bowls _ the 1979 Los Angeles Rams. Now, the Rams and Falcons have
made it to two Super Bowls in two years, Devin Bush along for both
rides. Talk about being in the right place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   You think the Saints should sign him next?

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Holding forth on subjects including the stock
market, immigration, the budget surplus and his own pay, Alan
Greenspan went before the Senate Banking Committee Wednesday
seeking the panel's recommendation for a fourth term as chairman of
the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties heaped praise on Greenspan and predicted
that his nomination would sail through the committee and be
promptly confirmed by the full Senate, perhaps as soon as next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were forced to narrow down the credit for the golden
age that we find ourselves living in,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, the committee's chairman, ``I think there are many people
who would be due credit, and there are more who would claim credit.
But of those who are in a position of authority, I think your name
would have to be at the top of the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, in his prepared testimony, provided no insights into
his thinking about the strength of the economy as the Fed prepares
for a monetary policy meeting next week at which it is expected to
raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But in response to a question from Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
Greenspan suggested that he remains concerned about the possibility
of a speculative bubble in the stock market. Asked if he was
troubled by a surge among investors' stock purchases on margin _
with money borrowed from brokers _ the Fed chief said that he was,
and that the Fed was studying how best to respond, especially after
a sharp upturn in margin buying late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly the case that the numbers that you cite,
especially for November and December, have caught our attention,''
Greenspan said. ``They have moved up at a pace which has created a
good deal of evaluation on our part and, obviously, the supervisory
regulators.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the central bank had no plans to raise margin
requirements, a step that he said would have little effect.
Instead, he said, the Fed is studying other ways of responding to
the increasingly leveraged positions of some investors, although he
did not specify what they might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, obviously, have also been discussing what alternatives
there are,'' Greenspan said. ``And you have to be careful. It's
very easy to invent all sorts of new schemes that allegedly are
going to do something and, when put into practice, turn out to be
less than perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to suggest that we're about to do anything at
this stage,'' Greenspan added, ``but I would confirm that we
obviously are doing a good deal of thinking about the whole
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether increased immigration would help the labor
shortage affecting some industries, Greenspan said that it could.
The current unemployment rate is 4.1 percent, the lowest in 30
years, and tight labor markets are one of the Fed's main concerns
as it assesses the possibility of increased inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand is putting very significant pressures on an
ever-decreasing available supply of unemployed labor,'' Greenspan
said. ``The one obvious means that one can use to offset that is
expanding the number of people we allow in, either generally or in
specifically focused areas. And I do think that an appraisal of our
immigration policies in this regard are really clearly on the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated his frequent calls for Congress not to go on a
spending binge in coming years, especially in light of new surplus
estimates from the Congressional Budget Office suggesting that
legislators from the two parties could have as much as $1.9
trillion in excess revenue to divide up over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Greenspan said when asked that he did not need a
raise in his $140,000-a-year salary because he had already become
wealthy before he took up his post in 1987. But he said that some
Fed governors over the years left the central bank because they
needed to make more money, and that it would be a shame if the bank
could not attract and retain the brightest possible people because
of salary levels.

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ All last week, the St. Louis Rams were asked questions
about the Tampa Bay defense.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They listened to the out-of-town media and watched the national
highlight shows. Most seemed to center on whether the Bucs'
dominating defense could stop the Rams' dazzling offense.
</P>
<P>
   All week, the Rams' defensive players simply watched the show,
wallflowers instead of participants.
</P>
<P>
   Until the game started. Sixty minutes later, it was ends Kevin
Carter and Grant Wistrom, tackle D'Marco Farr, linebacker London
Fletcher and the rest of the Rams defense that were surrounded by
the cameras after limiting Tampa Bay to two field goals in St.
Louis' 11-6 NFC Championship Game victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known all along that we had a very solid defense,''
Carter said. ``The numbers speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The two numbers that stand out most are six and one, as in sixth
in the league in overall defense and first against the run in the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Carter may be the biggest reason why. The former Florida
All-American, in his fifth NFL year, had a league-high 17 sacks
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushing the quarterback and sacking him is like an
addiction,'' Carter said. ``It's a rush, a feeling of
accomplishment. Closing in on a quarterback, your eyes just get
wide, and the anticipation is just hard to contain.''
</P>
<P>
   He experienced it 12 times last season, but the feat went
largely unrecognized. Carter wasn't voted to the Pro Bowl, which
first embittered him, then motivated him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I thought was a curse, not making it last year, was an
inspiration to me to work harder, to do that much more,'' Carter
said. ``I said, `Well, if you lead the league in sacks, they can't
keep you out of the Pro Bowl, can they?' I want to let everyone
know who can do it, who can play the run, who can play the pass,
who can do it all and do it consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he might not have gotten the recognition from his peers
that he so craved until this season, Carter has long had it from
his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin's the type of guy that has to be accounted for on every
play,'' said Wistrom. ``A lot of times you've got to have two
people blocking him, sometimes a third guy chipping him. There's
very few guys who can block him one-on-one. He's going to be one of
the most dominant defensive players for many years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't come as a surprise to perennial Tampa Bay Pro Bowler
Warren Sapp, who played alongside Carter in a Florida-Georgia
all-star game during their high school careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin was so physically gifted, so big and fast, that he stood
out as someone who has what it takes,'' Sapp said. ``I knew he was
going to be a great one way back then. It just took everyone else a
lot longer to figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   If Carter hasn't gotten much time in the spotlight in the past,
that should change Sunday. He'll get the responsibility of chasing
elusive Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair, who's just as likely to
get outside and run as to stay in the pocket and throw. This past
Sunday, McNair ran for two touchdowns and threw for a third in the
Titans' AFC Championship Game victory over Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It's) almost like trying to tackle a running back with how
hard he runs,'' Carter said. ``He's very elusive, and it's tough to
get a good shot on him because he can run so well and is so
athletic. It's much easier to rush a passer if he is standing
still, and that's definitely not something McNair does.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter is also a solid run stuffer and a significant reason why
the Rams have not allowed a 100-yard rusher all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get pressure on the quarterback,'' Carter said when
asked about keys to victory. ``We can't allow them to just set up
and pick us apart. We can't allow them to throw the ball on us once
he's out of the pocket. Eddie George is a great running back, and
they have a big, physical offensive line who will try to play
smash-mouth with you. We have to beat them at their own game.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter generally does, yet Rams coach Dick Vermeil doesn't think
he has seen Carter's best yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never say he's reached his potential,'' Vermeil said. ``I
think there's so much talent there, so much to give, that I keep
looking for the next level. We've seen it from time to time this
year. Once he gets there and finds out what it's all about, 17
sacks will be a routine.''
</P>
<P>
   It could someday become routine as well for Wistrom, who had 6{
sacks in his second NFL season. He also led the St. Louis linemen
with 60 tackles and nabbed a couple of interceptions in the regular
season. Both were returned for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter and Wistrom aren't the only Rams defenders deserving
of praise this season. Carter will be joined at the Pro Bowl by
cornerback Todd Lyght, who had a career-high six interceptions this
season. Farr and Fletcher are Pro Bowl alternates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the No. 1 rush defense in the league, which I don't
think anyone gives us much credit for,'' Fletcher said. ``You look
at our yards average per (pass) attempt against us, it is right up
there with the tops. We are tied for No. 1 in sacks in the NFL as
well and second in interceptions. You look at all those things, and
how can you overlook our defense? We definitely will be out to
showcase our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest show there is in football, the Rams' defense is
determined to make people sit up and notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here the whole time,'' Carter said, summing up the
feelings of the defensive unit as a whole. ``You guys just weren't
paying attention to me. Look it up. I have been getting better all
the time, but you just didn't notice.''

ANTHONY HAS A CHANCE TO ADD TO DORSETT SUPER BOWL GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He was born the day his dad played his first game for
the University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Titans strong safety Anthony Dorsett Jr. was 3 years
old when his dad won the Heisman Trophy. He was 4 when rookie
running back Tony Dorsett ran for a touchdown in the Cowboys' 27-10
victory over Denver in Super Bowl XII at New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Now Anthony is 26 years old and scheduled to start Sunday for
the Titans in Super Bowl XXXIV at the Georgia Dome in Cold-lanta.
The Dorsetts will be the first father-son starters in Super Bowl
history. Anthony talks to his dad every day, but he's still not
sure pop will be at the Georgia Dome on Super Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the season started he committed to make an appearance
on Super Bowl day,'' Anthony said Wednesday. ``It's either in
Atlantic City or Vegas. He's having trouble getting out of it and
the people really don't want to cooperate. If he can't make it, he
can't make it. Business is business. But if those people are
listening, man c'mon. This is a big deal right here.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony's been a very big deal with the national sports media.
Story-starved columnists (like me) are flocking to Dorsett's
interview table. It's a little like when Grant Hill _ son of Calvin
_ led Duke to the NCAA Final Four. It's probably an easier
situation when the son is a better player than the dad, like Ken
Griffey Jr. and Cal Ripken Jr., but Dorsett is handling Super Bowl
week like a veteran star.
</P>
<P>
   He is not a star. Anthony Dorsett was a sixth-round pick out of
Pittsburgh and plays on the other side of the ball. He's a special
teams honorable mention for the Pro Bowl (Dorsett is a kamikaze
``gunner''), but he's only started one NFL game in his four-year
career.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett is starting Sunday because veteran Marcus Robertson
broke his fibula in the Titans AFC Championship Game victory last
Sunday in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthony will be prepared,'' said Titans coach Jeff Fisher.
``He's played a lot of snaps this year and will do a good job. And
Marcus will do anything he can to prepare Anthony.''
</P>
<P>
   It's tough enough going through life as Tony Dorsett's son,
especially when you are not quite as good as your dad (who is?).
Anthony's carved out a nice career as a special teams star and
backup safety (think of him as a shorter Larry Whigham), but now
he's got to make his second pro start in a Super Bowl against the
aerial circus that is the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to attack anybody,'' said Dorsett. ``I don't
think they're just trying to throw at me. They've attacked guys
who've been playing much longer than I have and they've beaten
them. I don't think I'm going to be a target. I think they're going
to go with their game plan. I'm not the only person back there in
the secondary, so it won't be anything I haven't seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of Tony and Karen Dorsett is a sculpted 5-foot-11-inch,
200-pounder with perfect teeth, long eyelashes, the obligatory
biceps tattoo, and plenty of gold and silver adorning his head and
neck. He was born in Aliquippa, Pa., and raised in Thousand Oaks,
Calif., and Dallas. He played wide receiver and cornerback for J.J.
Pearce High in Dallas, then four years of defensive back at Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started off playing tailback in Pop Warner,'' he says. ``It
was good for me, but I got tired of being hit. I'd rather hit
people than be hit so I felt like it was not for me to be a
tailback.''
</P>
<P>
   The son is comfortable talking about his famous father. There
are no Daddy Dearest stories. Junior is reverent, yet realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely harder for me than it was for him,'' says
Anthony. ``My dad and I can sit down and talk about a lot of
things, but he hasn't had the experience going through a lot of
things that I went through. He can't talk about playing special
teams because he's never done that. He won a national championship.
When I was at Pitt, we barely won anything. Coming here, my rookie
year we were 8-8. His rookie year he went to the Super Bowl and
won. We've gone two different roads, but one thing about it,
football is football.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that stays in my head is that ring every time I see
it. He doesn't wear it a lot. Whenever he pulls it out, I see it.
It's like being a kid again, picking up a new toy. I just want to
look at it and study it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not be compared to a guy who's done so many great things
in sports? I am Anthony Jr. That's just part of me. It's something
I've lived with my whole life. I'm not trying to do anything
extraordinary. He's father. It's not something I'm ashamed of or
embarrassed of or anything. I'm not going to downplay it. My dad
was a great football player. Any comparison, bring 'em on. I'd like
to be mentioned in the same breath with him anytime.''

   ``Saving Faith'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   by David Baldacci &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fiction &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Warner, $26.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to say that the best thing about David Baldacci's
latest bestselling novel, ``Saving Faith,'' is the title. That's
because, despite some unusual characters and an innovative plot,
the story line is simply unbelievable. That's not to say it's a
lousy book, just one that's difficult to take seriously.
</P>
<P>
   A jacket blurb maintains that ``Saving Faith,'' Baldacci's fifth
novel, provides readers ``an astounding vision of the inner
sanctums of our government'' and poses stunning questions ``about
the rules we live by, the rules we are governed by _ and what
happens when some people make rules of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be swell, if true. But the ``astounding vision'' is
just that _ too astounding to be plausible.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Faith'' we're trying to save here is Washington lobbyist
Faith Lockhart, who in the opening pages is targeted for
assassination by an aging cabal of superpatriots. This grim little
group is composed of members of the primary U.S.
intelligence-gathering agency, the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a ruthless, cunning, manipulative but widely respected
CIA official named Robert Thornhill, the villainous gang is little
concerned that the agency is prohibited by presidential executive
order from engaging in assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Thornhill insists that Faith must die before she spills
embarrassing secrets to the FBI, which he detests. If an FBI agent
must also be murdered, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that killing a fellow agent is deplorable,'' Thornhill
tells his colleagues. ``But to shirk our duty now would be a
catastrophic mistake. You know what we've invested in this
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith and her boss, Danny Buchanan, are lobbyists with flawed
hearts of gold; they bribe U.S. lawmakers, not on behalf of wealthy
and powerful self-interests, but to obtain humanitarian aid for the
most impoverished countries. The global poor and helpless are not
so such much their clients as their wards.
</P>
<P>
   But however well-intentioned, bribery is, after all, bribery.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters decidedly worse, Buchanan has fallen
inexplicably into the clutches of the evil Thornhill, who uses him
in a congressional blackmail scheme to advance his hidden agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Into this caldron of intrigue and betrayal stumbles a
good-hearted but star-crossed private investigator named Lee Adams.
After an early shootout with Thornhill's hit man, a former KGB
assassin, Lee takes on the dubious and dangerous task of saving
Faith from the FBI and a killer. A relentless chase ensues,
punctuated with romantic interludes as Lee and Faith struggle to
overcome their individual and collective demons.
</P>
<P>
   The author does conjure up some unexpected twists in the late
stages, but the ending is borderline predictable and at the same
time illogical, and I doubt that even die-hard Baldacci buffs will
find it persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the title really is the best thing about this book.

SALES GROWING, EMC PLANS FURTHER HIRING IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EMC Corp., whose fourth-quarter profits rose 38 percent on
growing sales of data-storage systems, plans to continue hiring
steadily in Massachusetts, it says.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in the last quarter of 1999 grew nearly 21 percent to
$1.88 billion, up from $1.56 billion in the 1998 quarter, the
Hopkinton, mass. company reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors had hoped for an even greater fourth-quarter
revenue increase. They drove EMC shares down by 9 on the New York
Stock Exchange, where they closed at 111. That is still the level
at which they were trading two weeks ago, however.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with investors, chief executive Michael
Ruettgers said that EMC is still on track to achieve its revenue
target of $12 billion in 2001 as computerized storage grows in
importance to electronic commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have created a market with no visible limits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial results included EMC's $1 billion acquisition in
October of the computer hardware maker Data General Corp. of
Westborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The deal resulted in fourth quarter after-tax charges of $170
million, or 15 cents per diluted share, higher than previously
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Combining results for EMC and Data General, but excluding the
charge, EMC said fourth-quarter net income grew 38 percent to
$376.5 million, or 34 cents a diluted share, from $272.9 million,
or 25 cents a share, for the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The results were above expectations of fourth-quarter income of
31 cents a share, according to a survey of 23 analysts by Nelson's
Investment Research.
</P>
<P>
   A Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst, Phil Rueppel, said the
results were sufficient to maintain his forecast of $1.47 a share
in profit this year, on revenue of $8.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've given a lot of detail, and the pricing pressure they
face is fairly benign,'' he said, calling the drop in the company's
shares an ``overreaction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, they've delivered what they said they would,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1999, EMC's earnings were $1.18 billion, up 50
percent from a year earlier. Sales last year rose 24 percent, to
$6.72 billion.
</P>
<P>
   EMC reported that it had 17,500 employees worldwide at the end
of 1999, including 6,700 in Massachusetts, up from 3,800 a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the local increase is related to its Data General
acquisition, while the other half were new hires, EMC said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of September, Data General employed about 1,700
people locally, EMC said. About 250 of those jobs were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   EMC said it expects to hire 4,000 more people this year,
including 1,000 in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it has integrated Data General's
storage-product line into its own offerings of systems, which are
aimed at small and midsized businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The other component of Data General's business, the design and
production of server computers, will continue as a separate
division of EMC, headed by Robert Dutkowsky, formerly EMC executive
president for markets and channels.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it plans an announcement Thursday with
AT&AMP;T Corp., International Business Machines Corp., Cisco Systems
Inc., and Sun Microsystems Inc., but declined to give details.

 &HT;    Rams' Gruttadauria draws life outside of football
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ His is a portrait of the artist as a young center.
</P>
<P>
   Of a kid who came late to football, then became so enamored with
the game he taped free weights to his body, hidden beneath his
clothes, to bulk up and impress NFL scouts. Anything to keep
playing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's the St. Louis Rams' starting center in Super Bowl
XXXIV. But long before he ever snapped a football, Mike
Gruttadauria loved to draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I collected comic books as a kid,'' he said. ``Not for
reading, for drawing.''
</P>
<P>
   His favorite? Conan the Barbarian. ``I don't know why,''
Gruttadauria said. ``I just remember really wanting Conan comics. I
remember getting older and thinking, why did I like Conan? He had
no super powers.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Conan was cool to draw. Even the time a math teacher
walked by and found Gruttadauria had doodled a drawing of Conan
sticking a sword through a math equation. Years later, the subject
matter has changed, but the allure of the No. 2 pencil is even
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Why art? ``It frees your mind, is the best way I can describe
it,'' Gruttadauria said. He majored in graphic design at Central
Florida and worked in many mediums, from freehand drawing to
pottery to painting.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, though, when drawing served to occupy a
youngster's mind. ``A lot of kids, when they're friendless, would
draw,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that Gruttadauria had no friends; he just had no
inclination to make many new ones. His family moved often when he
was young. His father had a tire-recycling business in California
and later worked in real estate throughout South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had friends in different states from moving around,''
Gruttadauria said. ``But it seemed to me like, `What's the use of
going out and making friends if we're going to move around so
much?'''
</P>
<P>
   So he drew. The moving enhanced Gruttadauria's artwork, bit it
did nothing for him athletically. ``I was never familiar with
organized sports,'' he said. ``I never knew about Little League.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after the family settled in Tarpon Springs, Fla., when
Gruttadauria was in the eighth grade, his football career began by
playing in the street with his older brother Mark. Not until his
senior year at Tarpon Springs High did Gruttadauria take up
football, encouraged by his teacher in a weightlifting class.
</P>
<P>
   He played tight end well enough to choose a half scholarship to
Central Florida, then in Division I-AA, over a partial scholarship
to art school. Switched to center, Gruttadauria started for four
years. At just 6 feet 3 and 260 pounds, he would bulk up by taping
a 5-pound free weight to his lower back and a 2 1/2-pounder to his
hip when pro scouts dropped by. However, Gruttadauria wasn't
drafted, and, although he signed as a free agent with Dallas in
1995, he didn't cut it with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   After signing with St. Louis in '96, he has become the Rams'
starting center and a 297-pound pivotal figure in an offensive line
that gave Kurt Warner enough protection to pass for 4,353 yards and
41 touchdowns this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to describe what I do, other than blocking, is
traffic director,'' Gruttadauria said. ``With (offensive
coordinator) Mike Martz's offense, one play can be blocked several
different ways, depending on what I call. But I block, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He also still draws, but not as often during the season. When
he's through playing, Gruttadauria hopes to have his own studio in
his house, complete with potter's wheel and drafting table. He
would like to travel the Florida art-show circuit with his wife and
display his work while sipping a cold drink and talking to
customers. Folks might even pay more than the artwork Gruttadauria
sold in college for anywhere from $20 to $50. ``I wish I still had
them (the artwork) now, but that was food for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And what might an original Mike Gruttadauria, which once bought
$50 worth of groceries, go for now that he's in the Super Bowl.
``Oh, probably $55,'' said the artist, starving no more.

 &HT;    Fletcher's past wasn't prologue
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The St. Louis Rams' middle linebacker and leading
tackler is a former college point guard in his fifth year of
organized football. For his next act, London Fletcher plans to
elevate the club's defensive unit from obscurity to prominence.
</P>
<P>
   With his improbable achievements so far, don't bet against him.
Fletcher came to St. Louis after starting his collegiate athletic
career at St. Francis, Pa., where he was a powerful point guard.
</P>
<P>
   He transferred to John Carroll University in his hometown of
Cleveland and switched to football, where he showed promise but not
enough to get drafted in 1998. However, he was signed as a free
agent by the Rams, an opportunity he would not fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think I'm best for the Rams' defensive unit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it has worked out. Fletcher, 5 feet 10, 241 pounds,
won the starting job from former Georgia player Charlie Cleamons
and Lorenzo Styles with a strong preseason. Fletcher justified his
position by leading the team in tackles during the regular season
with 138.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Rams in the Super Bowl, Fletcher seems to believe
one more stellar game can boost the St. Louis defense into the
national spotlight over its high-flying offense. Or at least
alongside it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very good defense that's overshadowed by a potent
offense,'' he said. ``We have a lot of playmakers on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents aren't thinking of Fletcher as a basketball player,
although he is quick to the ball, slicing between blockers as a
speedy point guard would a double team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how basketball helps you in football,'' Fletcher
said. ``I played basketball because I love the game, the speed of
the game. But I've always loved football, the physical part of it.
I just hadn't played it at an organized level.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a force at John Carroll, so much that he thought he
should give the NFL a shot. But he did not imagine that two years
removed from Division III football he would be a defensive leader
on a Super Bowl team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said smiling, ``my transition has been more rapid
than I expected.''
</P>
<P>
   To get where he is, Fletcher had to overcome personal troubles.
His mother, Linda, has struggled with drug addiction for the past
decade. A dozen years ago, his sister, Kecia, was raped and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the games served as a form of counseling, an outlet from
the anguish.
</P>
<P>
   ``From time to time, I find myself sort of taking a seat and
realizing how far I've come,'' Fletcher said. ``But I also expected
it. And I want more. I'm not satisfied or content where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever success comes his way, Fletcher will be able to handle
it. His humble beginnings guarantee that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I've come from, the things I've had to deal with in my
life, I know what it's like to work hard and to appreciate whatever
I get,'' he said. ``Whatever I get, I'll earn.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Titans get in the running game Sunday, they will
earn; Fletcher plans to see to that. He is small by linebacker
standards _ he was listed last season at 6-0 but told the Rams'
public relations staff to go by his real height, which is 2 inches
shorter. But size does not matter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not in football,'' Fletcher said. ``It's about having the
desire to make a play and then going out there and making it. We
have a defense that's as good as anyone's. We don't get the
attention. But that's all right. We can change that.''

   Junflappable
</P>
<P>
   By Glenn Sheeley
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even for Jeff Fisher, who enjoys being the anti-Ditka,
this profile was just above basement level. Stepping to the podium
upon the arrival of his Titans in Buckhead on Monday night, the
coach was addressed as ``Steve Fisher.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. An opening jab, right to the ego. Fortunately, a stable
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I got a kick out of that,'' Fisher said Wednesday as
he left the Titans' interview area at the Buckhead Grand Hyatt.
``My first press conference at the Super Bowl and I'm called
Steve?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that far from acceptable for the 41-year-old Fisher,
whose laid-back style has been a perfect fit for
Houston-Memphis-Tennessee-Oilers-Titans, who somehow find
themselves in a Super Bowl after decades of watching others hoist
the AFC trophy. Could you imagine a past Bud Adams coach, such as
Bum Phillips or Jerry Glanville, in the same situation? A reporter
asked Fisher to measure the difficulty of putting up ``that
unflappable front'' the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A front?'' Fisher repeated. ``It wasn't a front. That was just
the way it was. I was not going to let things bother us. We're
getting paid to do our jobs, whether we're playing in front of 20
or 20,000 or 200,000. You look back now, those were tough times,
but those tough times helped to put us where we are now, because we
went through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Titans players credit Fisher for much of the mental glue they
needed to survive the nomadic zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff, when he says stuff, it's all for a reason,'' said Titans
guard Bruce Matthews, who has played 17 NFL seasons. ``He's not
into how many sound bites he can score or how many times he can get
on `SportsCenter.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a young coach, and he's more in touch with the players
today,'' defensive tackle Josh Evans said. ``He played the game, so
he knows what the players are going through.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews said, ``Jeff had always said, when we get to Nashville
it's going to be this special thing, something that is beyond any
of our expectations, and the first two years in Tennessee were
everything but that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher admires Buddy Ryan, who taught him the ``46'' defense,
but no fashion or fitness tips. Fisher wears designer suits and
hair mousse and could pass for an agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see too many coaches that look as good as our coach,
either,'' Evans said. ``He's a perfect match for our team.''
</P>
<P>
   After a long line of volatile, distracting coaches employed by
the former Oilers, Fisher became the guy to develop his players,
not degrade them.
</P>
<P>
   ``His personality allows you to breathe,'' offensive tackle Brad
Hopkins said. ``He's not controlling. He's not an ogre on the
field. He allows you to work. He's been in our shoes, and we can
give him a little more respect because he's done what we're doing
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher played defensive back and returned kicks for the
undefeated Bears of 1985, playing for Ryan. When Ryan went to
Philadelphia to coach, he pushed Fisher, who had incurred a serious
ankle injury, into joining him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't certain at that point if I was finished playing,''
Fisher said Wednesday, ``and I said that in so many words to Buddy.
He said, `You and Julie getting married?' I said, `Yeah, this
spring. Why?' He said, `Why don't you tell your fiancee to throw
you a retirement party? You're done. You can't play anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``These games are won by players,'' Fisher said. ``It's won by
team effort. A coach doesn't win ball games. Players win ball
games. It's our job to get them in position, to teach them, to
educate them. The credit needs to go throughout the whole
organization, not just the head coach. That's my philosophy, and I
really believe that.''

 &HT;    Have punts, will travel is Horan's calling card
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mike Horan looks a bit like an old junkyard dog, with
deep lines creasing his weathered face and enough gray hair to look
like a man who will turn 41 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL can't keep the man on its junk heap.
</P>
<P>
   Six times the punter has been out of pro football. Six times
he's scrapped his way, or been pulled, back in.
</P>
<P>
   A loan officer for a Littleton, Colo., mortgage company in
October, Horan will be the oldest player in the Super Bowl on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   When Rams punter Rick Tuten suffered a torn a thigh muscle in
the middle of the season, Horan got the call at home in Colorado.
This has happened before.
</P>
<P>
   After punting for the Eagles in 1984-85, he was out of pads in
1986 until coach Dan Reeves hired him 13 weeks into the season to
punt for the Broncos. Horan worked for the Broncos until suffering
a knee injury in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In '93, Reeves was coaching the Giants when he cut Sean Landeta
and replaced him with Horan at midseason. He kicked there until
Reeves was fired after the '96 season. In '97, the Rams cut Will
Brice after six games and hired Horan. In '98, Horan replaced the
injured Todd Sauerbrun with the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kick three or four days a week (in the offseason) and work
out two or three days a week,'' Horan said. ``I'll keep doing this
as long as the phone doesn't ring any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Rams had the NFL's No. 1 offense, Horan had just 26
punts in the final eight games of the regular season, and he
averaged 40.3 yards. He's one of the league's best directional
punters, which is practically mandatory under special-teams coach
Frank Gansz.
</P>
<P>
   Horan has punted 1,003 times in the NFL, 10th in history, and
averaged more than 42 yards per kick in a 16-year career. But he
got off to a slow start. The Falcons drafted him in the ninth round
in 1982. Pro Bowl punter John James was still around, and coach
Leeman Bennett cut Horan in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got married two weeks before and didn't work out like I
should have,'' he said. ``I didn't deserve to make the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Horan went back to school, got a degree in mechanical
engineering and worked for Hughes Aircraft. Designing and building
radar and sonar equipment was boring, so Horan tried out for and
made the Eagles in '84.
</P>
<P>
   The long road has included 205 regular-season games and three
Super Bowl losses.

CELLUCCI OFFERS $21.3 BILLION BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE AND JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Governor Paul Cellucci Wednesday unveiled a $21.3
billion budget for next fiscal year that would slightly boost
education aid, divert 50 percent of the tobacco settlement to
health care, and combine a modest expansion in social services with
his annual goal of cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, with seeks a 6.9 percent increase over the
governor's recommendation in 1999, is a fiscally conservative
document that ``fully funds our priorities,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fiscal blueprint invests record amounts in local aid,
shows a continued commitment to education reform, addresses our
current health care needs, and points to a solution to the housing
crunch,'' the governor said at a news conference at state
Department of Revenue offices in Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, slightly larger than the state's $20.9 billion
budget for fiscal 2000, received almost instant criticism from
Democratic leaders and municipal lobbyists across the Tobin Bridge
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, an architect of education
reform, said the governor's plan to increase local school aid by
$132 million would stall the productive momentum generated by seven
years of dramatically increased funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most charitable description of the governor's
proposal is that we will simply be running in place,'' Birmingham
said. ``Running in place, treading water, is not going to do the
job, and it's simply not fair; it's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an increase would be the smallest since fiscal 1992, said
Geoffrey Beckwith, executive director of the Massachusetts
Municipal Association, who added that New Bedford's education aid
would drop by $1 million under the governor's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham noted that the state has increased the education
budget by $200 million to $250 million each year for the last seven
years. ``That's an order of magnitude that I remain comfortable
with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, however, scoffed at his critics. ``Only the liberal
Democrats would argue that $132 million is a retrenchment,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor emphasized that his budget addresses a wide array
of education needs, such as providing funds to reduce class size in
kindergarten through grade 3 in low-income areas, overhauling the
school construction program, and demanding greater accountability
from teachers.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal, to create so-called sanctuary schools, would allow
parents to transfer children from unsatisfactory districts to
better schools or districts.
</P>
<P>
   Other recommendations would give superintendents greater
management powers over their staff, fund basic-skills tutoring, and
increase the cap on charter schools to 120.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also could create the Office of Educational Quality
and Accountability, an independent watchdog to monitor school
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education reform remains our No. 1 priority,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Birmingham said that the governor's education funding
is setting the state up for a ``train wreck'' in 2003, when
students will be required to pass the MCAS tests to graduate, the
chief budget writer in the House of Representatives said that
annual increases of $200 million and greater might not be wise.
</P>
<P>
   Many other areas of state government are financially strapped,
said Representative Paul Haley of Weymouth, the House Ways and
Means chairman. For example, he said, the labor market is so tight
that contractual services for such things as health care are bound
to become more expensive. And the state will face increasing costs
for the health industry, for nursing homes, and for services for
seniors, Haley said.
</P>
<P>
   In health care, the budget would use $140 million from the
tobacco settlement to fund new and expanded programs. Another $140
million from the settlement would be placed in a trust fund for
future health care needs.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have hit the governor for taking some money meant for
the state's tobacco-prevention programs to help fund other health
initiatives. Cellucci Wednesday countered that Massachusetts is
already spending more per-capita on tobacco prevention than any
other state in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also recommends $230 million to expand MassHealth and
extend health insurance to an additional 45,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Haley criticized the governor's plans to spend 50 percent of the
tobacco settlement funds, rather than letting them grow in a trust.
But Birmingham, who lobbied hard for spending some of the
settlement funds last year, praised that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good judgment delayed is better than good judgment denied,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also was criticized for his proposed reallocation of
$47 million in local aid to fund an incentive program to build low-
to moderate-income housing. While the governor lauded the
initiative as a way to address the housing crunch felt by many
state residents, Beckwith of the Massachusetts Municipal
Association said that many communities will suffer reductions in
local aid for which they plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take those funds away is to rob Peter to pay Paul,'' said
Beckwith, who noted that discretionary local aid _ which
communities can spend in any way _ would drop from $476 million to
$429 million under the governor's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith's concerns were echoed by Lewis Finfer, of the Greater
Boston Interfaith Organization, who said that the incentive program
``is not going to result in much production of housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham and Senate Ways and Means Chairman Mark Montigny
joined those critics. Communities have traditionally used those
funds for essential services, such as police and fire, Birmingham
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not since the fiscal crisis in the late '80s has the
administration actually gone out and cut'' local aid, Montigny
said.

   ``Why She Left Us'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   by Rahna Reiko Rizzuto &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fiction &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HarperCollins, $24 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The title of ``Why She Left Us'' implies answers, but the novel
revolves around questions. It is the story of three generations of
the Okadas, a Japanese-American family. The family is headed by
Mitsuo and his wife, Kaori; they have three children, Jack, Will
and Emi. Before World War II, the teen-age Emi left her family,
became pregnant with Eric, gave him up and returned home pregnant
again as the remaining Okadas were being sent to an internment
camp. Kaori finds her grandson Eric and brings him home to a family
torn apart by interlocking secrets, divided loyalties, clashing
cultures and warring generations.
</P>
<P>
   When Emi prefers Mariko, her baby born in the internment camp,
over Eric, each generation feels the effects of that choice. And
when, 50 years after the war, Mariko applies for reparations, there
are mysteries to be solved.
</P>
<P>
   Always, the author's emphasis is on those mysteries. According
to the matriarch Kaori: ``There are secrets that are hard to keep
and secrets that are hard to tell. And, in our family, there are so
many because we never told the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth is elusive because each person knows only part and doesn't
always reveal even that. The novel thus becomes a puzzle whose
pieces don't quite fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why She Left Us'' is Rahna Reiko Rizzuto's first novel, and
her style is noteworthy. The narrative is episodic and nonlinear,
with time shifting back and forth from the 1940s to the 1990s, with
occasional stops in the '50s and '60s. Rizzuto also uses shifting
narrative points of view, switching between Eric, Mariko, Jack and
Kaori. At times, the novelist shifts into present tense, taking the
reader more directly into the events and emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Kaori's early contribution is a good example: ``My life doesn't
return to me in any order. Moments flip-flop, overlap _ sometimes
they come only in splinters.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Why She Left Us'' is a character-based story, it also
contains action, some of it disturbing and violent. There are
incidents of childbirth, abortion, discrimination, senility and
family brutality. The description is sufficiently vivid to let the
reader ``live'' the experience, but it is never sensationally
graphic.
</P>
<P>
   The background is the treatment of Japanese-Americans during and
after World War II. The author's mother and her family lived in an
internment camp, and the author interviewed others who had been
similarly held. The facts, memories and emotions add depth to the
novel.
</P>
<P>
   There is a temptation to read this novel quickly; the plot and
its well-crafted characters lend a sense of urgency. But rushing
through ``Why She Left Us'' would be a mistake, not only because
time is needed to sort out the shifting viewpoints, but because it
would be a shame not to savor the author's lyrical prose. She
wastes no words, and each word contributes to the whole.

NEW STUDY LINKS HORMONES AND BREAST CANCER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A study of 46,355 women has confirmed earlier findings that
long-term use of hormone replacement after menopause can increase
the risk of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said the new study, done at the National Cancer
Institute, provided relevant information but still did not resolve
the dilemma faced by millions of women who are trying to weigh the
pros and cons of hormone replacement. Breast cancer is just one of
a panoply of serious conditions affected by the hormones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always issues of competing risks,'' said Dr. Larry
Norton, head of the division of solid tumor oncology at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who was not involved in the study.
``Every individual has to balance benefit and risk. Individualizing
care is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Hormone replacement eases menopausal symptoms like hot flashes,
insomnia and vaginal dryness. It is known to prevent osteoporosis,
a serious weakening of the bones, and it is thought to protect
women against cardiovascular disease. Preliminary studies suggest
that it may also help prevent Alzheimer's disease, colon cancer and
macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness.
</P>
<P>
   The drawbacks of the treatment include an increased risk of
breast cancer and of blood clots, which can be life threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should not
use hormone replacement, Norton said. Those with a low risk of
breast cancer and a high risk of fractures from osteoporosis would
clearly benefit from the hormones, he said. But the decision is
rarely so clear cut.
</P>
<P>
   Most women taking hormone replacement take two hormones:
estrogen and progestin. The estrogen replaces what the body lacks
because the ovaries shut down at menopause, and provides the
treatment's benefits. But given alone, estrogen also increases the
risk of uterine cancer. Progestin counters that risk, which is why
the hormones are given in combination. The only women advised to
take estrogen alone are those who have had hysterectomies and
therefore do not have to worry about uterine cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies had found a small increased risk of breast
cancer among women taking estrogen and progestin, but the risk was
attributed largely to the estrogen. The new study suggests that
some of the risk is due to the progestin.
</P>
<P>
   The study included post-menopausal women from 29 breast cancer
screening centers who took hormone replacement treatment for some
period from 1980 to 1995. The researchers relied on the women's own
reports from memory of what hormones they had taken.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, led by Dr. Catherine Schairer, an
epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute, found that women
who took the hormone combination for five years had a 40 percent
increase in the risk of breast cancer, compared with those who did
not take the treatment. Women who took estrogen alone had a 20
percent increase. The risk increased with the duration of
treatment, but existed only for women who were current users of the
hormones or who had taken them during the past four years. The
study did not provide any information about death rates among the
women.
</P>
<P>
   The risks applied only to women of normal weight, and not those
who were overweight. The researchers were not sure why.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Schairer said one way to illustrate the increased risk is to
consider a group of 100,000 normal-weight women, aged 60 to 64,
none of whom take hormone replacement. During a five year period,
350 cases of breast cancer would be expected. But if all the women
took combined hormone replacement for five years, about 560 cases
would be expected.

MICHAEL PENN IN FOR THE LONG HAUL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Friday, Jan. 28) 
 
 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Singer-songwriter Michael Penn takes his early-'90s success with
a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
   Penn, older brother of actor Sean Penn, is perhaps still
best-known for his song ``No Myth,'' which earned him a best new
artist trophy from MTV in 1990 and landed at No. 13 in the charts.
For Penn, it was a strange period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was part of a cycle where the label (RCA) had to put out new
product to see what might stick,'' Penn said. ``Someone decided to
pull the switch on me, and they promoted the song to MTV and radio,
and the thing took off. It was a slow build. I lucked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Married for two years to fellow singer-composer Aimee Mann,
whose songs play a pivotal role in Paul Thomas Anderson's acclaimed
film ``Magnolia,'' Penn knows too well the ebbs and flows of the
pop music world.
</P>
<P>
   He finished his fourth and latest album, ``MP4 (Days Since a
Lost Time Accident),'' last summer but had to wait for the label to
decide whether to release it. If Epic hadn't put it out, Penn says,
he would have sold his next album on the Internet and at shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business is all about the bottom line,'' Penn said.
``Record companies are like cat breeders who find a breed they can
make some money off of, in-breed it until it's sickly and dying
off, and then move on to the next breed.''
</P>
<P>
   New York-born Penn, 41, was reared around show biz. His mother,
actress Eileen Ryan, worked on stage and screen while his
director-actor father, Leo, was blacklisted during U.S. Sen. Joe
McCarthy's notorious reign of terror in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Penn began playing in a cover band as a teen-ager; by the
mid-'80s, he'd joined up with keyboardist Patrick Warren in the
post-new wave group Doll Congress. His solo debut, ``March,'' which
spawned the folky hit single, led to relentless road work.
</P>
<P>
   He developed his songwriting skills on ``Free-for-All'' and
honed his ability with his third disc, ``Resigned.'' In 1997, Penn
drew enthusiastic crowds on a summerlong tour with Sheryl Crow and
around that time scored two well-received films, Anderson's ``Hard
Eight'' and ``Boogie Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he's about to embark on a co-headlining tour with
Mann and is co-producing the next Wallflowers album with Andrew
Slater, the band's manager. A Los Angeles date on the Mann-Penn
trek is expected but has not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work separately, but we do run ideas by each other,'' Penn
said of life with his wife. ``It's nice to have someone so
understanding of what we do so close. We've never written together
because we are so similar, we cancel each other out.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album, which Penn produced himself, looks at desire,
love and loss, from the track ``Perfect Candidate,'' a song about
somebody searching for that one person who'll make everything
right, to ``Bucket Brigade,'' a vignette about a relationship in
flames. ``Beautiful'' muses on appearance and artifice, while
``Don't Let Me Go'' deals with the complexities of need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved working in the studio,'' he said. ``I can
point up nuances and detail in songs that I can't live.''
</P>
<P>
   To back his own guitar and bass, Penn worked with longtime pals
Warren and Victor Indrizzo on drums. Mann and Penn's brother
Christopher, also an actor, sang harmony vocals, as did Grant Lee
Phillips (of Grant Lee Buffalo), Buddy Judge (the Grays) and Rage
Against the Machine producer Brendan O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the importance of radio play, Penn counters that
airplay is never a consideration when writing and recording.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a song on radio requires an enormous amount of money
and cooperation,'' he said. ``The company has to have a regime in
place willing to go to those extreme lengths for you. And that
regime has to be connected to you in a way where they will get
credit if you are a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn grew up in Los Angeles listening to the Beatles and at
Santa Monica High School began writing what he once called
``earnest, downbeat'' songs. After ``March,'' the success of ``No
Myth'' and the completion of his next two albums, Penn started
hanging out at Largo, a Hollywood club with an imaginative booking
policy open enough to include nearly all genres.
</P>
<P>
   Mann and Penn frequently shared the Largo stage with comedians,
prompting the pair to include some comedy in their current tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for us, because we can have a show while we're up
there,'' Penn said. ``Between-song banter has never been Aimee's or
my own strongest suit, so it's great to have people we like and
enjoy do some of the talking for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ups and downs of the record business, Penn insists
he is pleased to be able to make a living doing the thing he loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoy getting to make records,'' he says. ``I get to
do something for a living I really love doing. How many people can
say that these days?'' &QL;

HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO DRAFT BILL ON MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders said Wednesday that they
would soon create a group of about a dozen Republican lawmakers to
draft legislation providing coverage of prescription drugs for
Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The step comes as millions of elderly people are complaining
that they cannot obtain or afford the drugs they need.
</P>
<P>
   Internal working papers from the House Republican leadership
say, ``If a prescription drug benefit is added to Medicare, it
should be delivered through the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Under one proposal favored by some House Republicans, the
federal government would subsidize private insurance covering drugs
for elderly people with low incomes. Such insurance would be
similar to the private insurance that many beneficiaries now buy to
fill gaps in Medicare. But, unlike such Medigap policies, it would
cover only drugs.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Democrats in Congress are demanding
Medicare drug benefits of some type. The drug industry says it
supports Medicare coverage of drugs in theory, but adamantly
opposes price controls.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican aides said the working group would be appointed
this week by Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The group will have 30 to 45 days to report to the leadership.
It will try to develop a unified Republican approach by
coordinating the work of the two committees that share authority
over Medicare, the Ways and Means Committee and the Commerce
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance
Association of America, said few insurance companies would want to
offer free-standing policies to cover drug costs. ``It would be
like providing insurance for haircuts,'' because so many elderly
people need prescription drugs, he said.  &QL;

 &HT;    Despite boom, job cuts occur
 &HT;    By Lynn Hulsey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON _ The economy is fabulous. The United States is nearing a
record 107 months of economic expansion. Life is grand.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Coca-Cola said Wednesday it will eliminate 6,000 jobs in a
company restructuring. And Lockheed Martin announced Wednesday a
shakeup that could result in 2,500 fewer jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade as the economy boomed, the Miami Valley
felt the sting of layoffs at such companies as Huffy Corp., NCR
Corp., Lexis-Nexis, Meritor Automotive and, just Tuesday, Midwest
Micro Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem odd for people to lose jobs as the economy roars and
business owners bemoan a shortage of workers. But economists say
this record economic expansion can be tied in part to low inflation
combined with higher productivity and profitability.
</P>
<P>
   That means companies are holding the line on wages and doing
more work with fewer people _ using automation and other technology
to cut costs and boost the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the things that's curious about this golden age.
There are winners and losers among people,'' said John Weiler,
director of the University of Dayton's Center for Business and
Economic Research.
</P>
<P>
   One laid-off Dayton man knows first hand what it is like to be
on the losing end. After the local manufacturing firm where he
worked for 27 years shriveled during repeated restructuring and
sales, he was laid off.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who is in his 50s and asked that his name and that of
his former employer not be published, has had no luck finding a job
since his September layoff. He is getting help from a Sinclair
Community College program for displaced workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I going to do as an old man? I'm trying to get into
the job market again,'' he said. ``You know, when you get about
this age, you get planning on your retirement because you've just
got a short period of years to go. (Layoffs) put a stop to
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The drive to boost profits and improve shareholder value comes
as companies face unyielding global competition. Customers want the
lowest price possible and competitors are willing to oblige them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies now face a much broader competitive field,''
Weiler said. ``That means that they're not able to pass cost
increases on to their customers as readily as if our markets were
more insular.''
</P>
<P>
   The current economic expansion began in March 1991 and on Feb. 1
will hit the record 107th month, beating the expansion that lasted
from February 1961 to December 1969. Much has happened during this
most recent boom, including a stock market that has performed
beyond all expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But shareholders don't buy stock just to play the game. They
want profits.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings momentum is important to investors, who want to see
companies not just meeting, but beating, earnings expectations,
said John Schmitz, director of portfolio management for Fifth Third
Bank in Cincinnati. That pushes companies to cut costs, especially
in payroll, often among a company's biggest expenses.
</P>
<P>
   That could lead companies to make bad decisions, economists
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are companies that feel the pressure to get that stock
price up tomorrow. So they try to cut costs today,'' said Tom
Traynor, associate professor and economics department chairman at
Wright State University. ``If in fact the quality of their product
and production goes down because of all that ... it might hurt them
in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Scott doesn't need to be convinced. The spokesman for the
United Steelworkers of America said the nation needs to value the
workers who have made the economic expansion possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its too bad we haven't developed an ethos or a philosophy that
treats maintaining employment as an important thing,'' said Scott.
``We don't take enough consideration of the social costs of these
corporate decisions.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By any measure, April 18, 1988, was a frustrating day
for Albert Gore Jr. It began at 7:30 a.m. at a subway station on
Manhattan's Upper East Side, with Gore, who had just turned 40 and
was running for president for the first time, standing in visible
shock as Mayor Ed Koch bellowed a morning greeting to commuters:
``Hi, everybody, it's us! Al Gore and me!''
</P>
<P>
   The day ended, or it might as well have, a few hours later with
Koch, who had endorsed Gore and then effectively seized command of
his New York campaign, fiercely accusing the Rev. Jesse Jackson of
``contempt and arrogance'' for skipping the ``Salute to Israel''
parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I said that about a white candidate, would anyone say that
was unfair?'' Koch inquired. Gore turned ashen.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had never really expected to win the New York primary in
1988, or for that matter, the Democratic nomination for president.
But when the votes were counted the day after he campaigned one
last time at Koch's elbow, Gore, the senator from Tennessee, had
stumbled into third place, with less than 10 percent of the vote,
behind Michael Dukakis and Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Gore emerged from New York viewed even by his supporters not as
a noble loser laying the groundwork for the future but as a naif
who had been manipulated by sophisticated forces advancing their
own interests. He had, it seemed, engaged in the clumsiest kind of
negative campaigning, and countenanced a harsh and racially charged
strategy to advance his own improbable candidacy. From that
perspective, the fact that Gore's campaign shut down less than 48
hours after the polls closed in New York was the least of his
problems. At 40, the defining goal of his life _ being elected
president _ was suddenly in peril.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore prepares to return to New York for a second primary, on
March 7, this time as the vice president of the United States and
the favorite to be his party's presidential nominee, he is, in many
ways, a very different candidate from the one whose campaign
collapsed on the steps of Koch's City Hall in 1988. And there is
probably no better place to chart that evolution than in this same
state that provided Gore with a brutal lesson in presidential
politics that he and his friends remember bitterly to this day.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate who was scolded for negative campaigning by Gov.
Mario Cuomo in 1988 has learned the subtle form of the acceptable
if devastating political attack (``He's negative on the
substance,'' Cuomo said approvingly the other day). The candidate
who was dizzied by the cross-currents of New York ethnic politics
has this time finessed them, deftly standing in the background as
they consume another newcomer to New York politics, Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Gore ran with barely any organized political support
and then proceeded to give up complete control of his campaign to
Koch and to David Garth, the political consultant. This time, Gore
has systematically recruited Democratic leaders across New York to
his campaign, and has made clear that he intends to cede control of
the New York effort to no one.
</P>
<P>
   The last time he ran for president, Gore neglected to tend to
the most basic political chore of appealing to the various blocs of
voters that make up the Democratic primary electorate. Last week in
Manhattan, by contrast, Gore spent the afternoon meeting first with
blacks, then with Jews and then with gays and lesbians. That
evening, it was off to the latest in a series of private sit-down
suppers with figures from New York's media and political worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers, those who worked for him in 1988 and those who
work for him today, are quick to point to all these factors as
evidence of the vice president's evolution. Indeed, they announced
the details of Gore's meetings last week, drawing an implicit
comparison with Gore's mistakes of 1988. For them, Gore as a
candidate in New York in 2000 is a story of growth and maturity.
</P>
<P>
   But for the candidate himself, those two weeks in 1988 remain a
dark memory. He recoiled when asked to discuss the experience the
other day, groping around for an answer when asked what lessons he
might have drawn from it, or for some details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' the vice president finally said in an interview, ``I
was hoping I had read the last story about that primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign had sparked to life on March 8, when he won
seven of the 20 states that had primaries on that day, most of them
in the South. His strategy had been to ignore the Iowa caucuses and
the New Hampshire primary, and focus his limited resources in his
home region, in the calculation that a strong showing that day
would thrust him into the front circle of presidential contenders.
</P>
<P>
   It did not work out as he had hoped. Gore suggested the fault
lay with the media. ``We didn't capture the spotlight of the
television news coverage even after winning seven states,'' Gore
complained at the time to Sidney Blumenthal, a reporter for The
Washington Post who later became a White House communications
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   But other Democrats thought the problem lay with Gore himself.
The novice candidate had not planned beyond the March 8 primaries,
and was not prepared to take advantage of his moment. Deep in debt,
he bounced around from message to message, and from state to state,
losing in Illinois, Michigan, Connecticut and Wisconsin, finally
ending up in New York.
</P>
<P>
   By the start of April, there really was not much of a chance
that Gore would capture the Democratic presidential nomination, and
the candidate and his advisers knew it. Dukakis, the governor of
Massachusetts, had a commanding lead in delegates, and his biggest
fear was not Gore but Jackson, then at the peak of his influence in
Democratic presidential politics. Accordingly, Gore's advisers came
to view New York as a place where the little-known southern senator
could make a respectable showing and a graceful exit from the race,
leaving an impression that, they hoped, would be remembered when it
came time to pick a presidential candidate in four or eight years.
</P>
<P>
   And that might have happened, were it not for Koch.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his staff were elated at first when the popular New
York mayor, after summoning both Dukakis and Gore to City Hall for
interviews, said he was endorsing Gore. When reporters at the
bustling news conference where Koch disclosed his selection
suggested that this could produce the exact result that Koch said
he most feared _ draining enough votes from Dukakis to produce a
Jackson victory in New York _ the mayor shouted back: ``It's
irrelevant, irrelevant!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dukakis came over with a veneer as thin as a dime, and on
issues very glib, and Al Gore came over as someone who has the
potential to be a great president,'' Koch said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor certainly knew how to grab a headline, and from the
moment he signed up with Gore, he did precisely that, even if the
result was that the endorser soon loomed large over the endorsee.
``Every time we were together, I would raise the issue of Jesse,''
Koch says, hastening to add that he and Jackson are friends now.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore recalls the contest, it was Koch who carried the weight
of the attacks on Jackson. ``That was him on his own,'' Gore
asserted.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gore _ who is trying to win Jackson's support for the
current race _ had been attacking Jackson's credentials on foreign
policy for weeks. Gore told one audience of Jewish leaders, for
example, that he had been ``dismayed'' by Jackson's ``embrace of
Arafat and Castro'' and critically observed that Jackson had ``not
had a single day's experience in the national government or a
single day's experience in foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed on why he was attacking the civil rights leader,
Gore responded, ``If the country is going to mature to the point
where we are color-blind and see candidates in terms of their
ability and leadership, then we must be prepared to engage in the
rough and tumble of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats saw another reason for Gore's attacking Jackson
so hard and so soon: to play to Koch, who even before the primary
was one of Jackson's harshest national critics.
</P>
<P>
   As primary day approached, Gore and Koch came under criticism
for exacerbating tensions between black and Jewish voters, tensions
were particularly raw in New York in 1988, the year before the city
elected its first black mayor, David N. Dinkins. Jackson compared
the attacks on him to shouting ``Fire!'' in a theater. Cuomo, the
governor and a senior figure in the national party, scolded Gore
for the tone of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him some advice: It was to be positive, and not to be
negative, because he was not yet well-established enough in New
York to earn the right to be negative,'' Cuomo said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   That advice was not taken, as Gore stepped up and expanded his
attacks, even at the risk of coming across as brash. As Bill
Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic presidential nomination
this year, noted while campaigning recently, it was Gore who first
raised the issue of Willie Horton, the black inmate who committed
rape while on release from a Massachusetts furlough program,
mentioning it while debating Dukakis in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not mention Horton by name or refer to the fact that he
was black, and the issue attracted little attention at the time.
But after the primary season, supporters of Vice President George
Bush used the Horton case to devastating effect against Dukakis. At
one point in the campaign, Bush supporters circulated a flier with
a picture of Horton, prompting sharp complaints from Democrats that
Bush was injecting a racial element into the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If attacking Jackson was part of some grand strategy _ Gore,
Koch and Garth all say today that it was not _ it was a failure.
Jackson's supporters rallied around him, as some of Dukakis'
supporters turned Gore's attacks on Jackson to their advantage by
asserting that a vote for Gore would ensure that Jackson would
defeat Dukakis in New York.
</P>
<P>
   With each passing day, Gore seemed more out of place in the
state, which was turning into the site of his last political stand.
At one debate, Gore talked about his distress at growing up in the
South and coming across a ``whites only'' sign. He intended his
remarks as a way of demonstrating his concern with discrimination;
some of Jackson's supporters in the audience burst out laughing at
what struck them as patronizing. ``I don't know what's so funny,''
a perplexed Gore said as the audience continued hooting.
</P>
<P>
   Garth, the political consultant who handled Gore's television
advertisement, says he did not believe that Koch's attacks were the
cause of Gore's defeat. ``But it cost him a strong second-place
finish,'' Garth said. Cuomo said he called Gore after the vote,
saying that he should not lose heart, ``I think you'll make a
terrific candidate some day,'' Cuomo recalled telling Gore. ``You
made a mistake in the way you handled this particular thing in New
York. You miscalculated, but I don't think it's going to affect you
long-term.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the end the New York contest overshadowed the end of
Gore's candidacy, producing what to many of Gore's advisers was the
worst possible outcome. ``There was something dyspeptic about the
way the New York campaign ended the campaign,'' said one of Gore's
closest friends. ``You never want to end on a sour note.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore laughed darkly when asked if he thought he had been hurt by
his experience in New York in 1988. ``Do you?'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking that I had a lot to learn,'' Gore said.
``And I went about learning.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not wait long. The night of the primary, Gore joined Koch
for dinner where, Koch said, the senator expressed his appreciation
for his help. ``But I never heard from him again,'' said Koch, who
is supporting Bradley this time.
</P>
<P>
   From dinner with Koch, Gore than headed quietly to the hotel
where Jackson had settled in for the night, knocking on the door of
Jackson's suite and sitting down for a drink and a moment of
contrition with the candidate he had attacked so relentlessly. Gore
was a day away from abandoning his 10-month-old effort to become
president in 1988. But his next campaign for the White House had
already begun.

 &HT;    Former football great Brooks bound by hard times
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Alexander Saulsbury wanted to write the letter himself
to the father he knows only through baby snapshots in the photo
album. But he had the typical first-grader's imprecise handwriting,
so instead he dictated to his mother:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Dad. Are you really my Dad? I love football. I like
Pokemon. Do you?''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Saulsbury sealed the letter, along with the boy's sketches
of his favorite Pokemon characters. She mailed the envelope last
Thanksgiving eve to lawyer Mike Barrett, who vowed to deliver it to
his incarcerated client _ the fallen football star, James Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Young Alexander still waits for a response.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Brooks represents much of what Americans
admire and abhor about its accomplished athletes.
</P>
<P>
   By seventh grade in Warner Robins, Ga., just south of Macon, he
was foretelling his teachers and friends to watch him perform
Sunday afternoons on TV some day, and his off-the-charts football
work ethic eliminated doubters. Brooks lugged his teams a long way,
from an uncertified national high school title to a Super Bowl gig.
Although he topped off at 5-foot-9 and 180 pounds, he trails only
Bo Jackson among career rushing leaders at South Tailback U.,
Auburn, and is valedictorian of the Cincinnati Bengals'
ground-gaining honor roll.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Bengal teammates describe him as they would a champion boxer
in a lighter weight class; ``pound for pound, the toughest player I
ever saw'' was the refrain. Sports Illustrated placed him 19th
among premier Georgia athletes of the 20th century. The man who
prosecuted him applauds his sports achievements and acknowledges
his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   REPAYING DEBTS
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brooks played the educational system like a fool, sailing
through 16 years of school with such little retention of knowledge
that there is some question as to whether he can read his son's
letter.
</P>
<P>
   And even though his pro salary maxed out at $1 million, Brooks
provides scant support for the five children he sired with four
women, two of them wives. Brooks, 42, says he's broke, blaming a
divorce and general financial carelessness; the mothers say he
simply does not care. Either way, Brooks ranked near the top of yet
another list, one released last year by the county prosecutor's
office in Cincinnati. Few of the 69 deadbeat dads on it owed more
than the $107,704 Brooks did to two of his children cited in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks had moved in 1996 to England, where he was a washout as a
semi-pro player, took a 19-year-old as his third wife and worked
for modest wages as a security guard. Ever since he flew back to
the United States and was arrested as he got off a plane at
Hartsfield International Airport, home has been a three-story,
tightly secured ``halfway house'' in Cincinnati, with peeling red
paint on a stretch of road pock-marked with abandoned warehouses
andfactories. Each weekday morning, he is picked up and driven to a
work site for a full shift with a concrete company, which pays him
$9 an hour. He accepts few guests and no representatives of the
news media.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to be released by March but must remain in the
area to complete 300 hours of community service. He was required to
surrender his passport, although some women in his past allege that
established aliases will allow him to flee.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Brooks told Judge Steve Martin that because of his
football prowess he was unburdened of classroom work and that he
considers himself illiterate. The revelation shocked many from his
past. Others are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   TROUBLE WITH LEARNING
</P>
<P>
   Robert Burgess, Brooks' middle-school social studies teacher,
tutored him phonetically, sounding out each word. ``He didn't read
well at first,'' Burgess recalled, ``but it didn't take him long to
catch on. Once I started working with him, he made tremendous
strides.''
</P>
<P>
   Burgess estimated that Brooks read on a seventh-grade level when
he advanced to high school.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Greg Edenfield remembered taking an algebra class with
Brooks. ``He did the work in there, with no special favors,'' said
Edenfield, who cringes to this day at the memory of Warner Robins
coaches paddling players as punishment for a poor grade. He cannot
recall Brooks having to bend over.
</P>
<P>
   But longtime friend Al James said, ``James wasn't trying to
learn. Teachers passed him on. How he got into college baffles me
to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   At Auburn, Brooks roomed on the road with Joe Cribbs, No. 3 on
the Tigers' rushing hit list. ``If he did have a reading problem,
he did a magnificent job of covering it up,'' Cribbs said. ``Maybe
he was a real good actor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised to hear'' of alleged reading failures, said
Auburn sidekick William Andrews, an ex-Falcon. ``With all the
resources Auburn had, I can't believe they wouldn't take care of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Brooks charged in court, he was allowed to skip class
regularly. And he told Cindy Saulsbury that imposters took his
tests and wrote his term papers.
</P>
<P>
   A disbelieving Cribbs said, ``I was as good an athlete as was
there, and I never got any deals like that done for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Auburn President William Muse dispatched a letter to
Martin in which he extended an olive branch to Brooks, inviting him
to join Operation Follow-Through, a studies program available to
all Auburn athletes who leave without degrees, and to pay for
literacy classes in Cincinnati. At the same time, he brandished a
sword, writing in an op-ed article for a Cincinnati newspaper _ to
be reprinted Sunday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's
Perspective section _ that the student bears considerable guilt for
lack of education. ``Learning occurs internally,'' Muse said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Muse checked with Brooks' onetime teammates. ``They shared with
me what I suspected had been the case _ James had some problems
with learning and made very little effort to correct that. He found
ways not to go to class, and he took easy courses.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding accusations that Auburn was a party to academic fraud,
Muse observed that Brooks enrolled more than 20 years ago and that
nearly all of the academic support personnel from that era are
gone. He said an inspection of current procedures was found to be
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   As for Brooks' reading ability, retired Bengal Keith Walker
alluded to Dexter Manley, who duped nearly everyone through his pro
career before confessing that words on a page befuddled him. ``I
couldn't fathom getting through one semester of college without
reading,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS ILLITERACY
</P>
<P>
   Another Bengal, Tim Curtis, said, ``If an athlete is well-spoken
and educated, he stands out.'' Brooks did not, Curtis said. ``But
if you can master the terminology of a football playbook, which he
could, you damn sure can read a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Even two people in an ideal position to know _ ex-girlfriends
Lisa Mason and Saulsbury _ differ.
</P>
<P>
   Mason recalled that Brooks would arrive early for dates and pass
the time scanning a newspaper. ``He would do what the average man
would do _ read the sports section,'' said Mason, 31, a college
student who was Brooks' girlfriend for two years and had a child
with him, Briana, now 4. ``I watched him read things. I even had
some legal stuff he worked on. (Labeling him) illiterate is
extreme, in my opinion. I believe it's part of his whole story not
to pay child support.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Saulsbury, bitter as she is toward Brooks, buys the
illiteracy claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``He avoided reading at all costs,'' she said. ``It was always,
`Hey, read this to me.' He wouldn't read a menu. Wouldn't even open
it. He'd just ask the waiter, 'Do you have grilled chicken?'''
</P>
<P>
   Saulsbury grew weary reading the sports pages to him, especially
coverage of Bengals games. Once, she handed him a personalized
greeting card in her cursive writing and pleaded for him to read
it. She felt hurt when he tossed it aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he got lost in the shuffle of a large family,'' she
said. ``Academics wasn't something they encouraged. It was go out
and shoot the basketball or throw the football.''
</P>
<P>
   A `CLEVER,' `VERY INTELLIGENT MAN'
</P>
<P>
   An attorney in the divorce case with Brooks' second wife,
Simone, said Brooks could not read a stolen-check affidavit. On the
witness stand, Brooks was unable to identify documents shown to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, his current attorney, convinced prosecutor Mike Allen
that Brooks was illiterate. ``I was somewhat skeptical,'' Allen
said. ``Coming out of college, you should have some expectation of
being able to read or write. But I trusted (Barrett).''
</P>
<P>
   Ask acquaintances to rate Brooks' intelligence, and answers fly
from all directions.
</P>
<P>
   Saulsbury says he cannot write a check or count out change and
that he sometimes signs his first name ``Jams.'' Yet, she said, he
could solve Rubik's Cube. ``He's a very clever person to have
gotten this far.''
</P>
<P>
   Most agree that his command of the language was weak. Brooks
once described a contract he signed with the Chargers as having a
three-year ``auction,'' meaning option.
</P>
<P>
   His consumer decisions were dreadful. Even with his large
salaries, he tended to rent instead of own. He did purchase a new
sports car _ the same month he applied for unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Bengal Cris Collinsworth, now an NFL commentator on Fox,
said, ``I've played with a lot of guys who can't remember to go in
the right direction. No problem there with James. He's not a dumb
guy, by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconding that notion is Burgess, his high school teacher.
``Most people talk about him as if he were an idiot. Not true. He
was very bright.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A very, very intelligent man,'' Mason concurred.
</P>
<P>
   Saulsbury, a 32-year-old elementary school teacher, questions
her own intelligence for having dated Brooks over five years, all
the while believing that his divorce proceedings were winding down.
In fact, she said, Brooks led two lives _ one in his own family's
residence, the other in a house with her _ and she ultimately
discovered that the divorce had been filed much later than he
indicated.
</P>
<P>
   They met at a birthday party for a Bengals player. Saulsbury was
dating a guy who became abusive because she and other white women
were dancing with black players. Brooks intervened and told the
boyfriend to back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became my best friend,'' she said. Then lovers. He told her
it was unnecessary to practice birth control because they could
conceive a child and stay together.
</P>
<P>
   TROUBLED TIMES
</P>
<P>
   When Brooks left the Bengals for the Cleveland Browns, he called
daily to check on her pregnancy. She said Brooks shed tears of joy
when he held the newborn Alexander. Later, he swept their driveway
free of snow, brought diapers, did everything Saulsbury could ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I asked for help with day-care (expenses) and other
bills, he said, `You can't make me do anything,''' she said. ``I
realized I'd been a fool for all those years.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, citing stress as the reason for backing away from
full-time work, Saulsbury limits herself to substitute teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' ``first'' family remains in Warner Robins. Ex-wife Donna
lives with Tianna, 16, in a small apartment in need of repair. His
oldest son James Jr., called Jay, is 20. His 73-year-old mother,
Eula, recently foreclosed on Donna's home. Friends could not
remember his last visit there.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks recently submitted to a literary test to determine the
level for his court-mandated reading lessons. ``He doesn't need
that,'' Saulsbury said. ``He needs counseling. Somebody to ask him,
`These kids are yours _ what part of this don't you understand?' ``
</P>
<P>
   She and Mason are not counting on the child-support payments to
push them into a higher tax bracket. Saulsbury acknowledged that
Brooks' reading limitations doom him to a low-paying job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, he would be a good salesman,'' she said. ``He could
talk a cat into hanging out with a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, behind locked doors, Brooks will have time to watch
the Titans and Rams, 11 years after he gained 44 yards for the
Bengals in their pulsating 20-16 loss to the 49ers at Super Bowl
XXII.
</P>
<P>
   Or he can try to read the words of a lonely 7-year-old who
misses his father:
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a picture of me. Would you send me a picture of you? .
. . Will I ever get to see you?''

Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham/``Moments From This Theatre'' (Proper)
<TEXT>
<P>
   To students of Southern soul, Penn and Oldham need no
introduction. Thirty years ago, Penn co-authored such stirring r&AMP;b
classics as ``Dark End of the Street,'' ``I'm Your Puppet'' and
``Do Right Woman, Do Right Man,'' among others; with Oldham, Penn
co-wrote ``Cry Like a Baby,'' ``Out of Left Field'' and ``A Woman
Left Lonely.'' Here, this grizzled pair of good old boys are caught
in a characteristically low-key mood in a fine collection of
acoustic performances taken from various shows in the UK and
Ireland in 1998. Penn and Oldham were touring as special guests of
Nick Lowe, whose good taste is well known, and audiences were
clearly enthralled. On the 14 tracks here, Penn's burnished vocals
are complimented by his own simple acoustic guitar accompaniment
while Oldham's Wurlitzer piano lends an earthy, gospel-drenched
feel. The disc, available only as a British import from mail-order
sites like Amazon.com, opens with a beautiful reading of
``Puppet,'' a 1966 hit for r&AMP;b duo James and Bobby Purify. The Box
Tops classic ``Cry Like a Baby'' and, naturally, Aretha's ``Do
Right Woman'' follows as Penn and Oldham work up to what's surely
the second-best version of ``Dark End of the Street'' ever put on
record. The first? James Carr, of course. Penn himself makes that

   A decade ago, Lynne was a Nashville misfit; a promising but
hard-to-label country-soul singer who released an ahead-of-its time
swing album that quickly flopped. So, she went home to Alabama to
write and plan her next move. Her knockout self-titled new effort
is a well-crafted and perfectly realized synthesis of country, pop
and soul ingredients that brings to mind the big pop production
style of Phil Spector in one breath and the passion of Dusty
Springfield in the next. Produced by onetime Sheryl Crow and
Michael Jackson collaborator Bill Bottrell, many of the 10 tracks
here have a '60s Memphis feel, immediately calling to mind the
sultry, strings-stoked atmosphere of Springfield's wonderful
``Dusty in Memphis.'' Best of all is the seamless ``Leavin','' the
only cut here penned entirely by Lynne, a completely convincing r&AMP;b
ballad that will have you reaching for your Al Green records. ``I
Am Shelby Lynne'' might be the first real discovery of 2000. 3 1/2

   ``The English Songbook,'' Ian Bostridge, tenor; Julius Drake,

</P>
<P>
   Bostridge cuts a wide swath with this sampler of exceptionally
well-spoken songs from the British Isles. It was Britain's literary
flowering, from Shakespeare through the late Romantic period, that
seeded its outburst of late-19th- and early 20th-century song.
Accordingly, these lovely tunes, sensitively performed by Drake,
partake of the nostalgic colorings of Keats, Shakespeare, Dante
Gabriel Rossetti and W.B. Yeats, among others, translated into
music by the likes of Charles Villiers Stanford (a haunting,
impressionistic take on Keats' ``La Belle Dame Sans Merci''),
Frederick Delius (``Twilight Fancies'') and Ralph Vaughan Williams.
Bostridge, who's being hailed as England's purest interpreter of
song cycles since Peter Pears, favors simplicity over rhetoric,
imparting a sparkling robustness to pastoral reveries like Vaughan
Williams' ``Linden Lea,'' a lyrical introspectiveness to ``Come
Away Death'' (from Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night'') and a wistful
tenderness to Stanford's arrangement of ``My love's an Arbutus,''
giving this old Irish air the shapely beauty of the finest
Renaissance sonnet. 3 1/2 stars

   If record-buyers are lapping up teen pop singers, the thinking
here seems to be, then maybe they'll snap up another teen
pop-country crooner. At 16, Elliott is actually pretty good,
though. A confident performer with a full-bodied delivery, she puts
across ballads such as ``I'm Waiting for You'' and ``Every Heart''
with the same gusto she addresses the bouncy title track, which is,
incidentally, climbing the country charts. Of course, it doesn't
hurt to have label prez and top country producer Tony Brown on
board in the studio, either, and his deft hitmaking sensibility is
all over this first effort. In an age where Barbie dolls like
Shania Twain and Faith Hill somehow represent country womanhood for
much of the public, maybe Elliott will develop into something more
substantial. 3 stars &QL;

   The son of late Afrobeat king Fela Kuti, Femi proves the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree on this compelling collection of
loose-limbed polyrhythmic jams highlighted by a superb remix of the
set's lascivious ``Beng Beng Beng,'' a song that was banned in
Kuti's native Nigeria. Like his father's brilliant Egypt 80 outfit,
the younger Kuti's Positive Force is a forceful and dynamic
ensemble, full of female chanting, pungent horns and lots of
delightfully complex guitar interplay. Kuti, who sings and plays
sax, echoes his father's concerns about black unity and African
culture in earthy, sharply constructed uptempo pieces like the
disc's opening salvo, ``Truth Don Die,'' and ``Blackman Know
Yourself.'' Ideally, the well-produced ``Shoki Shoki'' will make
some sturdy inroads in the United States for the appealing music of

called ``Send Me an Angel''? Well, Eiffel 65 do, too. In fact,
these guys _ veterans of Italy's thriving club-music factory _
liked the song so much they practically devoted an entire album to
variations on the theme. Not surprisingly, ``Europop'' is a smash
in Europe and Canada, where the disco-fueled ``Move Your Body'' and
dance-pop album-opener ``Blue (Da Ba Dee)'' have conquered the
charts. Using electronic elements, the trio actually mixes dance
and pop quite effectively, adding that ever-popular disco beat to
rope in the retro crowd. Listening to ``Europop,'' you can easily
imagine the tourists marching up and down the Champs Elysees to
this stuff. In the end, Eiffel 65 fills that long gap between
Depeche Mode albums. 2 1/2 stars

   These guys came together in 1978 in Leeds, England, the same
depressing place that spawned always far-superior Gang of Four.
After shedding the Marxist affectations, Scritti Politti _ Italian
for ``political writing'' _ changed direction and decided they
wanted hits, haircuts and hotel rooms with a view. That's when they
came upon the pop-soul hybrid so popular in the '80s, scoring a Top
20 hit with ``Perfect Way.'' These days, our hero (there's just one
original member of the trio left) still wants hits and nice hotel
rooms (the hair went a long time ago). After a long period spent
``chilling out,'' poptastic political writer Green Gartside (for it
is he) offers Scritti's fourth album, a mildly amusing mix of rock,
funk, hip-hop and, apparently, nonfat dry milk. Don't expect a
Scritti Politti comeback. 2 stars &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Robert A.F. Thurman wanted to clear up one
thing for the audience that recently packed the auditorium at the
Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Before he began his discussion of the work in the museum's new
exhibit, ``Worlds of Transformation: Tibetan Art of Wisdom and
Compassion,'' Thurman took a stab at what he calls a Western
misconception about Buddhism: that it is a religion that focuses on
emptiness in a suffering world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everyone was doomed to suffer ... why would (the Buddha)
have just rubbed it in our face?'' asked Thurman, a professor of
Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Studies at Columbia University in New York
City and co-curator of the exhibit, which continues through March
26.
</P>
<P>
   The Buddha's goal was to offer a path to enlightenment, an
antidote for the suffering mind, Thurman said. To reflect that, the
art being displayed at the Kimbell offers images of a different
world and ways to achieve that enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each painting is a world of transformation,'' Thurman said.
``... The painting itself represents a kind of spiritual
transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the exhibit is religious in meaning and purpose, here
are some basic principles of Tibetan Buddhism to help guide museum
visitors:
</P>
<P>
   Buddhists do not believe in one god or deity but see
spirituality in many forms, including many gods. However, those
gods are neither completely creative forces nor omniscient.
</P>
<P>
   The religion is based on the teachings of the historical Buddha,
Siddhartha Gautama, who lived from about 560 B.C. to about 480 B.C.
and is considered the Shakyamuni Buddha. Leaving behind the life of
a prince, the Buddha embarked on six years of spiritual seeking,
which resulted in a revelatory experience of enlightenment _ an
awakening to ``the final nature and structure of reality,'' Thurman
writes in ``Essential Tibetan Buddhism.''
</P>
<P>
   From that experience, the Buddha passed on four main principles,
or the four noble truths: Suffering, mental and physical, is
inevitable; suffering has a source that comes from desire;
suffering can cease, and that is nirvana or enlightenment; and
there is an eightfold path of ethical conduct that can lead to
enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   The eightfold path is a prescription for moral conduct, mental
discipline and intuitive wisdom. It can include practices _ such as
yoga and meditation _ that can ``lead to mental peace,'' said
Andrew Fort, a professor of Asian religions at Texas Christian
University in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Central to Buddhist thought is an understanding of existence as
impermanent and all beings as interconnected.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Buddha, there are figures in the religion,
Bodhisattvas, who have progressed far on the path to nirvana but
have remained among humans, partly to aid them.
</P>
<P>
   According to Thurman, there are four angelic Bodhisattvas, or
``Enlightenment Heroes,'' who are particularly important to Tibetan
Buddhism. They include Tara, a lady of miraculous activities;
Lokeshvara, lord of compassion; Manjushri, lord of wisdom; and
Vajrapani, lord of power. Tara and Lokeshvara are considered
divine, and all four have manifested themselves in different forms.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism was founded in India and stems from Hindu traditions.
But it has traveled throughout Asia and is practiced in various
forms. In Tibet, Buddhism was introduced in the early seventh
century, Fort said. Most Tibetans practice Tantric Buddhism, which
offers the possibility of reaching enlightenment within a single
life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1642, the Fifth Dalai Lama, or spiritual leader of the
Gelugpa order of monks, was crowned king of Tibet. The connection
between the religion and politics continues today with the 14th
Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture and the religion are intimately tied together, so
the Dalai Lama is both a political and religious leader,'' Fort
said.
</P>
<P>
   When China invaded Tibet in 1959, monasteries were destroyed and
leaders killed. Since then, religious leaders have escaped to India
and then farther west to the United States. So a religion and a
culture that once were tucked away in remote regions of the
Himalayas have become more accessible to American communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing is history in the making,'' Fort said.
``After the Chinese, it became in their political and religious
interest to spread the word.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Coke job cuts meant to shake up status quo
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Make no mistake about it.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola is slashing 6,000 jobs around the world, including
2,500 in Atlanta, for one simple reason: The status quo wasn't
working.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting 5 percent or 10 percent of the payroll can be seen as a
necessary adjustment during the tough times companies periodically
go through.
</P>
<P>
   But when the largest soft drink company in the world said
Wednesday that it's going to shed 21 percent of its 29,000 workers
worldwide _ and an astonishing 40 percent in Atlanta _ that's more
than an adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest downsizing in Coke's history is an admission that
the company has gone down the wrong road.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows that better than the man now charged with driving
the company down the right road _ Doug Daft, Coke's new president
and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Daft wouldn't even be in his position right now had the
company been humming along. He only got his current job seven weeks
ago after M. Douglas Ivester announced he would retire early as
chairman and chief executive officer in April. That's when Daft
will take over the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   Daft said the company's dramatic announcement Wednesday of vast
job cuts was a painful but necessary decision that was six months
in the making. While the soup-to-nuts review of all company
operations would have happened anyway, Daft said, the unprecedented
product recall in Belgium last summer was a ``wake-up call.'' That
call, and the analysis that followed, triggered the layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is painful for those within the company who will be
directly affected and for those responsible for making this
decision,'' Daft said. ``But this management team is committed to
doing what is necessary to ensure a strong future for the Coca-Cola
Co.''
</P>
<P>
   The future has plenty of challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daft's moves are all aimed at regaining long-term consistency
in profit growth, which has eluded the company over the past
several years,'' said Andrew Conway, an analyst with Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   ``As sad as the job cuts are, and they are very sad, Daft is
clearly moving to lower the cost structure and implore management
to be more nimble to local soft-drink trends,'' Conway said. ``I
think the work force reduction signifies the importance of a leaner
cost structure in an environment where achieving profitable growth
in case sales is becoming more challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   The company will save about $300 million a year from the job
cuts at a time when it reported a second straight annual decline in
profits. Those declines have pushed down the stock price by 29
percent since it hit a high in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the job cuts are about more than saving money, even though
that is critical when earnings are depressed. They're about
changing the way the company operates in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world in which we operate has changed dramatically, and we
must change to succeed,'' Daft said. ``This realignment will better
enable the company to serve the changing needs of its customers and
consumers at the local level.''
</P>
<P>
   This is important to Coke because it sells soft drinks in some
200 nations. Having too many people at the Atlanta headquarters,
far removed from some of their overseas responsibilities, means the
company hasn't been as reactive to local market conditions as it
needs to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have different beverage requirements in different
environments,'' Daft said. ``No matter where we operate around the
world, we're a local business.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Daft is moving some high-ranking executives from
Atlanta to different parts of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this signals a major change in thinking at the
company and sends a message that the status quo days are over,''
said Bill Pecoriello, a beverage analyst at Sanford Bernstein. ``We
expect this shift in mindset, which goes well beyond cost savings
from head-count reduction, to position Coke strongly for long-term
sustainable profit growth.''
</P>
<P>
   While some employees are getting transferred, others are getting
their severance packages and walking papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's walking around stunned,'' said computer programmer
Kevin Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts are being handled in three ways: through early
retirements, outsourcing and eliminating positions. This will
happen around the world, across nearly every job description.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 2,500 cuts in Atlanta, where 6,200 workers
are employed, there will be an additional 800 cuts in other parts
of the United States and 2,700 jobs lost abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The company has already informed many of the people who are
losing their jobs. But some may not know yet, for a variety of
reasons. For example, some departments may have been told to cut a
certain number of workers, but the decision on which staffers may
not have been made yet.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some employees have the option of deciding whether to
accept an early retirement offer. Still others may know that they
will be losing their jobs, but they may not know when. That is
because some jobs will be farmed out to other companies, but that
takes a while to do.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the positions being eliminated are in sales and
marketing offices, where Coke employees are no longer needed
because workers at the company's bottlers are doing the same jobs.
The duplication of effort has accelerated in recent years as big
bottlers have gobbled up the smaller ones. As that has occurred,
Coca-Cola has fewer bottlers to deal with, so it needs fewer
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Coca-Cola is a giant marketing machine. It supplies
the soft-drink concentrate, or syrup, to its bottlers. They then
add carbonation and put the drinks in bottles and cans. The
bottlers also distribute the products to retailers.
</P>
<P>
   If the cutbacks are done effectively, Daft hopes he has come up
with a formula for giving the right amount of support to the
bottlers, but not wasting precious resources by duplicating
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts and company observers question whether he is
cutting too many people in too many places. And there certainly
will be a considerable adjustment period for the remaining 23,000
staffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change in the corporate culture will be dramatic and
far-reaching,'' said Conway, the analyst. ``And it will take the
organization a period of time to adapt.''

   Humbled by a year of problems at home and abroad, Coca-Cola Co.
said Wednesday that it would cut 6,000 jobs, or a fifth of its work
force, in the biggest reductions ever by the company.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the job losses reverberated around the company's
headquarters in Atlanta, where Coke images dot the skyline, and
where the company has long been identified with success both
personal and collective. About 2,500 people, or nearly half the
employees, at Coke's gleaming downtown complex will be let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of crying today,'' said one employee as she
exited the iron gates of the company's compound. ``A lot of people
are packing up.'' The company, which has been known for generous
benefits, job security and unflagging optimism about its future,
said some employees were notified Wednesday, and others would be
informed by the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on the Atlanta economy is not expected to be severe.
``It's more the psychological rather than the economic impact,
which shouldn't be that large,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of
the Georgia Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   To cover severance packages and other costs related to the staff
cuts, the company will take an $800 million charge against its
earnings this year. In addition, Coke announced an $813 million
charge for the fourth quarter of last year to cover costs of its
poorly performing plants in Russia and Eastern Europe. Indicating
all its problems are not past, the company said bottlers in several
key markets would buy less concentrate this year to reduce bloated
inventories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world in which we operate has changed dramatically, and we
must change to succeed,'' Douglas N. Daft, Coke's newly designated
chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. Since being
named to the top job last month, he has moved quickly to
decentralize operations and make Coke more responsive to its
various markets around the world. He is replacing M. Douglas
Ivester, who lasted less than two years in the top job and was
criticized for responding slowly to contamination scares in Europe
and to government concerns about the company's proposed
acquisitions abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Through most of the 1990s, Coke was a paragon of success among
globe-trotting U.S. consumer-products companies, and it stuck
resolutely to its strategy even as its profits eroded over the last
two years. Many of its difficulties can be traced to regional
economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   But the reorganization announced Wednesday was interpreted by
some stock analysts and investors as Coca-Cola's tacit admission
that it had blundered badly, overinvesting in some markets and
failing to streamline its operations for too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a small, insignificant number _ it's $1.6
billion,'' said Marc Cohen, a beverage stocks analyst for Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co., of the two charges for job and inventory reductions.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Sweeping moves to clear away problems are typical when a new
executive takes over, as Daft will officially do at Coke in April.
The practice helps make future quarters look better in comparison,
and it often gives a company's stock price a lift. Coke said
Wednesday that it expected savings of $300 million a year from the
job cuts and related moves. Though the stock rose early on the
company's scheduled earnings report, it fell $2.8125 a share on the
day, to close at $63.0625 as Coke investors apparently fretted
about more problems ahead.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While job reductions had been predicted, the cuts were much
greater than expected. Indicating their seriousness, Daft and other
senior managers discussed the moves in a morning conference call
with Wall Street analysts and investors _ the first call of its
kind for Coca-Cola, analysts said. The executives said that after a
six-month review of the entire company, they had decided to
eliminate departments that were not central to the company's
objectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are going to be doing is centering our activity on
marketing and on meeting the needs of customers and consumers,''
Jack L. Stahl, who was named company president last week, said in
at interview later in the day. ``We said, gee, what kind of company
do we want to be? We started that way, as opposed to setting a
target on cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the changes are radical _ the company plans to transfer
many responsibilities formerly handled by executives in Atlanta to
local managers _ they left some investors wondering what else was
to come.
</P>
<P>
   One money manager said he sold his entire stake in Coca-Cola
after reading the company's statement before the opening bell on
Wall Street. ``For the last 10 years, everything seemed to go right
for Coca-Cola,'' said Fredric E. Russell, whose fund in Tulsa,
Okla., had 70,000 Coca-Cola shares until Wednesday morning. ``Now
there is a recognition that those years may have been unusual, and
we can't count on the same volume growth and the same returns on
equity.''

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the volume growth of past years is now suspect because
of the company's announcement that bottlers in Japan, Germany and
Eastern Europe would reduce their inventories, said Andrew J.
Conway, a beverage analyst for Morgan Stanley. While Canada and the
United States account for about 23 percent of profits, Japan
generates 20 percent of the company's profits, or about $1 billion,
on just 5 percent of its overall sales. Germany is Coke's
fourth-largest market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest surprise is that they are taking down their
inventory levels, which implies that they overstated their earnings
growth between 1997 and last year,'' Conway said. ``What's to stop
them from doing it again? This is a very negative development
because it pushes the improvement of Coke's returns further out
into the future.'' The reduced purchasing by bottlers is expected
to trim earnings by 11 cents to 13 cents a share in the first half
of this year, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   After the company's announcement, it was clear that this would
be the third consecutive year of disappointing results, instead of
the ``year of recovery'' that Daft promised when he was named to
Coke's top job last month.
</P>
<P>
   The charge against earnings in the last quarter includes
investments in Russia and the Baltics, but many expect additional
charges in India. Coke management is still assessing conditions
there, and in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What also troubled some listeners was that Daft indicated during
the conference call that Coke's growth targets for both its sales
and earnings would have to be revised, Cohen said. ``He indicated
that the long-term growth goals have been too ambitious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And for this year, Daft suggested the company would earn
slightly more than $1.50 a share, Cohen added. That is at the low
end of the $1.50 to $1.60 range the company had most recently
estimated. ``This is the 11th quarter in a row that I have cut
estimates for the Coca-Cola Co.,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Other industry experts said the reorganization was Daft's effort
to put Coca-Cola back on course, after a particularly troubling
year. The company had the biggest product recall in its history,
after children who drank Coke products fell ill in Belgium and the
contamination scare spread to France and other parts of Europe.
Coke was also fined $16 million by Italian regulators over its
anti-competitive marketing practices and stumbled in its efforts to
acquire the Orangina and Cadbury Schweppes brands in Europe. In
Atlanta, the company is facing a racial discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Moving more executives into the field, away from Atlanta, is
meant to improve the company's understanding of consumers in the
200 countries where it sells its drinks. The company will also
embrace local brands more than it has in the past, although it will
still emphasize Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature and scope of these changes reflect basically what
Daft wanted and what Daft believes to be good for the company,''
said John D. Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, a trade
publication. ``It certainly makes sense for some companies to be
centralized. But it really makes sense for Coke to be
decentralized.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 2,500 job cuts at Coke's headquarters in Atlanta
will come from departments that are being eliminated or replaced by
outside companies. Others will take early retirement, the company
said. Some functions, like payroll management and groundskeeping,
will be awarded to other companies there.
</P>
<P>
   About 800 people elsewhere in the United States will be
displaced, as will 2,700 people in company offices abroad.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because of the pending racial discrimination lawsuit, the
composition of the work force before and after the cuts will
certainly be closely examined by lawyers and others. Daft recently
wooed back the company's highest ranking executive, Carl Ware, who
had been nudged out under Ivester.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, Coke said its volume growth was slightly
better than expected. The company reported that case volume
increased 6 percent, although volume for the entire year grew by
less than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, per-share earnings fell 31 percent, with the $800
million charge included, to 98 cents, compared with $1.42 a year
earlier. The fourth quarter produced a rare loss of 2 cents a
share. Without the charge, the company would have earned 31 cents a
share. In the comparable period a year earlier, the company made 24
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   One money manager who sold off all of his Coca-Cola shares at
the end of last year said that management changes might bring some
investors back. ``It's clear that they are moving the company back
in line with economic reality,'' said David Garza, an analyst at
Roxbury Capital Management in Los Angeles. ``It's back to the
future. It's the new Coke, and I am starting to like it again.''

 &HT;    Coke layoffs dampen sense of elite employment
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While Wall Street absorbs the news of massive cuts at
Coca-Cola Co., President Douglas Daft faces one of his toughest
challenges yet: rebuilding the company's bruised image internally.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to appeasing shareholders, Daft will have to work
hard to salvage Coca-Cola's corporate culture, now reeling from the
shock of its biggest round of layoffs ever.
</P>
<P>
   It is a cloistered culture inside the gates of the company's
Atlanta complex. Becoming part of Coca-Cola's world involves
clearing a number of arduous hurdles, beginning with months of job
interviews. Once in, however, employees looked at it as privileged
employment for life, where, if you do a good job, life is good.
</P>
<P>
   To those on the outside, it's a world apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tight-knit group of people,'' says Bob McDonald,
founder and chief knowledge officer with Highlands Program, an
Atlanta-based company that works with businesses to train and
develop workers. ``The feeling is that if you're working there,
you're just head-and-shoulders above anyone anywhere else. The
whole idea (is that) you live for Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, life at Big Red has been turned on its ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very disruptive dynamic that goes on. Your whole world
is turned upside down, not unlike an ice storm,'' said Bill
Kahnweiler, an associate professor of human resource development at
Georgia State University and an expert on downsizing. ``This
undermines the elite culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers feel like they don't have a safe haven, that they are
now just like workers in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   In any downsizing, workers are wounded. Top management must work
quickly and be up-front with those who survived the cuts. There's
anger and lots of mistrust, soul-searching and wondering what's
next and who's next.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, who works with people and businesses going through
stressful or chaotic periods, said the layoffs have ``a huge impact
on morale. A lot of times, it's an impact that's not readily
apparent. People don't talk about it openly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Coca-Cola, ``it shatters a sense of being elite.
There's a subtle impact here. ... You were considered crazy if you
ever left Coke. That feeling gets undermined if they can lay people
off.''
</P>
<P>
   While a lot of attention is given to those who lose jobs, the
survivors go through just as much or more anguish.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience, the survivors aren't written about or
thought about as much. It can be hard or more difficult on the
survivor,'' Kahnweiler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel guilt and fear. At least for the people who were let
go, they know where they stand. There's always the little nagging
voice in one's head: `Why wasn't it me' and 'Will it be me the next
time? If Coke does this today, will I be next tomorrow?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a loss of social support if your good buddy next to
you was chosen (for lay off) and you weren't,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   There's also concern about the people, the work and who's going
to do it. Workers are asking: ``Will I be asked to do the work of
two people for the price of one?''
</P>
<P>
   Managers, who also may feel the job-cut heat, are left with
trying to motivate people who are disillusioned, distrustful and
worried about job security.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of those kinds of worries surface,'' Kahnweiler said.

GENE THERAPY DEATH CASE HIGHLIGHTS ISSUE OF INFORMED CONSENT IN
EXPERIMENTS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Perhaps no event in recent medical history has done
more to shine light on the inherent conflict of interest between
researchers and their subjects than the death of an 18-year-old
from Tucson in a gene therapy experiment at the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   It has been four months since Paul Gelsinger made the wrenching
decision to withdraw life support from his son, Jesse, after an
infusion of gene-altered viruses meant to correct an enzyme
deficiency caused an immune response that spiraled out of control.
The grieving father then vowed to stand by the Pennsylvania
scientists ``until my dying day.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, amid accusations by the Food and Drug Administration that
the researchers repeatedly ignored rules intended to protect
patients from harm, Gelsinger has hired a lawyer. He says he was
told too little when he encouraged his son to volunteer for the
study, which offered no benefit to the teen-ager, but was designed
to test the safety of a treatment for babies with a fatal form of
his disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The case may lead to increased regulation of clinical trials in
gene therapy research, a 10-year-old field that is already heavily
scrutinized. And it shows how expectations diverge in early-stage
clinical trials, when researchers want to learn if cutting-edge
treatments are safe, but patients are hoping for a cure.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration shut down all human
gene therapy experiments at the University of Pennsylvania after
finding ``numerous serious deficiencies'' in the way the clinical
trial involving the younger Gelsinger was run. The agency did not
attribute the youth's death to lapses by university doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Kathryn Zoon, who runs the drug agency's Center for
Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in an interview on Tuesday
that agency officials were considering policy changes as a result
of the Gelsinger case. She said the agency was thinking of imposing
a new rule that would allow it to make public more information
about gene therapy. And it is also considering beginning random
inspections of clinical trials of the sort it conducted at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Institutes of Health, officials are re-examining
the role of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, which oversees
gene therapy research but lost much of its authority in a
reorganization four years ago. Congress is also considering
stepping in. Next week, a Senate subcommittee will hold a hearing
on whether there is sufficient oversight for gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Wilson, who directs the Institute for Human Gene
Therapy at the University of Pennsylvania, declined an invitation
to testify, and declined to be interviewed for this article. Paul
Gelsinger, however, is on the witness list.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger says they had no idea there were risks _ of hepatitis,
liver damage, and even a remote chance of death. And Gelsinger now
says that neither he nor his son had any idea that despite 300
clinical trials, gene therapy had never cured anyone. He said they
were lulled into participating by the idea that that therapy would
work for his son's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have had somebody there who was not
affiliated with Penn that could have assisted in describing the
whole process of gene therapy,'' Gelsinger, who works as a
handyman, said in a telephone interview from his Tucson home. ``I
didn't research it. But I shouldn't have to research it. I believed
these guys, everything they were telling me.''
</P>
<P>
   As scientists map the human genome, they are uncovering
mutations for genetic disorders _ including Ornithine
Transcarbamylase (OTC) Deficiency, from which Jesse Gelsinger
suffered _ at a rapid pace. The idea of gene therapy is that these
illnesses can be cured, or prevented, through an infusion of
corrective genes. Typically, the genes are encased in a virus that
acts as a taxicab, of sorts, to deliver them to the proper cells in
the body.
</P>
<P>
   In examining the Gelsinger case, one issue of particular concern
to regulators is the process known as informed consent. Federal
rules require that the risks and benefits of an experiment be
explained to patients in language that is understandable to them,
and that patients be given sufficient time to make the decision.
And if some patients experience serious side effects, all
volunteers are supposed to be informed and then must consent again.
</P>
<P>
   These requirements were not met in the Pennsylvania study, the
FDA says. The informed consent form the Gelsingers reviewed omitted
information about monkeys that had died after being given a
similar, though stronger, treatment. And when patients experienced
elevations in liver enzymes that were significant enough to bring a
halt to the trial, the FDA was not notified, and the consent form
was not revised.
</P>
<P>
   Some worry that biotechnology money is altering the informed
consent equation. Many university-based gene therapy researchers
have company ties. At the University of Pennsylvania, for instance,
Wilson also founded a biotech firm, Genovo, in which he holds
stock. Although the company did not sponsor the study in which
Jesse Gelsinger participated, it does provide financial backing for
Wilson's institute. In previous interviews, Wilson has said the
university had rules to prevent a conflict of interest between his
academic position and his ties to the company.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Ruth Macklin, a bioethicist on the NIH advisory
committee, said, ``There is one feature of this field that is quite
different from general run-of-the-mill research, and that is that
large numbers of the researchers themselves have a financial
stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Lapses in informed consent are common, said Dr. Gary B. Ellis,
director of the federal Office for Protection From Research Risks,
which investigates reports of abuses. He said more than 90 percent
of the cases he looks at reveal problems with informed consent, a
figure that does not surprise ethics experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consent forms are often very deficient and they overpromise,''
said Dr. LeRoy Walters, a bioethics professor at Georgetown
University and former chairman of the Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee at the NIH. ``They make Phase One studies'' _ safety
tests _ ``sound like the cure for your cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the forms are clear, and accurate, Walters and others
say, the discussions doctors have with their patients may cloud the
issues. Patients anxious for a cure may engage in a kind of
selective hearing, taking in only to information about potential
benefits, while researchers eager to sign up study volunteers may
gloss over the risks.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Root Wolpe, a bioethicist at the University of
Pennsylvania. He said he once watched researchers advise patients
that an experimental therapy, an injection, contained such a small
dose it could not possibly hurt them, when they should have been
telling patients the dose was too small to do them any good. When
he talked to the researchers, he recalled, ``One of them said, very
frankly, `Well, of course we do that. No one would do this if we
didn't spin it that way.'''
</P>
<P>
   A conversation with Gelsinger reveals just how cloudy, and
fraught with emotion, the informed consent process can become. When
he learned late last year that the information about the monkeys
had been omitted from the consent form, he said, ''I was willing to
overlook it.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he reflects on his decisionmaking process, he said, he
keeps coming back to an conversation he had with Dr. Mark Batshaw,
one of the study's principal investigators. He said Batshaw told
him the treatment was already working in some patients and that
because of the particular nature of his disorder, Jesse Gelsinger
would allow the scientists to ''show exactly how well this works.''
</P>
<P>
   Batshaw, through a spokeswoman, said the Gelsingers were never
told the therapy could be considered a treatment. Still, Gelsinger
says he feels misled. ``They wanted to lock Jesse in,'' he said.
``They didn't want him backing out.''
</P>
<P>
   The experiment involving Jesse Gelsinger was unusual, as gene
therapy research goes, because the participants were not
particularly sick. Some were carriers of the gene for Ornithine
Transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, a disorder in which the liver
cannot process ammonia, a toxic breakdown product of food. Others,
like Gelsinger, suffered from a mild form of the disease; in
Gelsinger's case, it was controlled through diet and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The therapy involved an infusion of trillions of particles of
the OTC gene, encased in a weakened cold virus, adenovirus. When
the FDA investigated, it said Gelsinger should never have been
treated, because his liver was not functioning well enough before
doctors gave him the infusion.
</P>
<P>
   The findings have given a boost to those who have been calling
for greater openness in the field. The Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee, known by its nickname as ''the RAC,'' which operates in
public, is supposed to monitor patient safety, but in practice that
job has been left to the Food and Drug Administration, which is
required by law to conduct its work in secret.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gelsinger, for instance, said he did not even know the RAC
existed until after his son's death, when he learned that the panel
had reviewed the experiment, and that some members thought it was
too risky to conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, critical though he is of Wilson's group, he still says he
wants their work to go forward. He is troubled that other gene
therapy researchers appear to be backing away from Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll sacrifice Penn, they'll sacrifice Jim Wilson,''
Gelsinger said. ``These guys screwed up, yes. But they should not
be put out of business. They should be able to lick their wounds
and go back to work, because guess what? They'll be clean from now
on. I don't want to see anybody lose their job. I don't want to see
anybody suffer like we've suffered. I want them to make this thing
work, and do it right.''

BEIJING ABUZZ OVER SMUGGLING SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ For the past week, rumors have flown around Beijing
that the wife of the city's top Communist Party official had been
detained as part of an ongoing investigation of a huge smuggling
scheme in southeastern Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
   Communist Party officials had even told foreign reporters
privately that Beijing's party secretary, Jia Qinglin, had divorced
his wife of 30 years, Lin Youfang, last month in order to salvage
his political career, even providing the date of the marriage's
demise.
</P>
<P>
   The reports about Jia and Ms. Lin were published in both the
Hong Kong and Western press and even, briefly, in a smaller Chinese
paper or two. But until this week, there was no mention in the
mainstream Chinese media of the smuggling case.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in a bizarre twist to the scandal, the Chinese
government as well as Ms. Lin herself have publicly denied the
reports that she and her husband are divorced or in any way
involved in corrupt activities. And in the process the government
has obliquely acknowledged that there is indeed a major corruption
investigation under way in Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the press office of the State Council, China's
cabinet, quietly posted a notice on its web site (www.china.org.cn)
calling the charges against Ms. Lin ``fantastic rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lin Youfang has no links whatsoever to the Xiamen smuggling
case, and is not at all involved,'' the site said. ``Comrade Jia
Qinglin is striving with all his might to lead the people of
Beijing forward in reform and opening up and modernization and
Comrade Lin Youfang is his devoted wife.''
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday night, Ms. Lin, sitting in her living room and
wearing a simple pink dress, gave a short interview to a Hong Kong
television station in which she said that she had never even heard
of the Yuanhua Co., which is at the center of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   She said that, while it was true she used to work at an
international trade company in Fujian province, she had retired in
1997. She denied that she had been detained, saying that she spends
her days exercising, going for walks and looking after her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see I'm very free,'' she told a reporter from Phoenix
TV, a Hong Kong-based television station with close ties to the
Chinese government that can be seen by some viewers on the mainland
via satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The State Council's information office posited that the rumors
of guilt and divorce were the result of foul play, although it did
not say who might be behind them. Jia is a protege of President
Jiang Zemin. He was brought to Beijing in 1995 to replace the
former party secretary who is now serving a 16-year prison term on
corruption charges. His downfall would certainly embarrass the
Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advise the fabricators of these rumors to end your
chicanery,'' the web site entry said. ``That `evil can never
outweigh justice' remains as true now as ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing is certainly a fertile ground for rumors, particularly
on topics like this where official news has been tightly
restricted. But these particular rumors seemed far more specific
and detailed than the usual fare.
</P>
<P>
   And, over the last few days, it certainly has appeared that
Jiang and Jia have been engaged in rather heavy-handed damage
control, as the evening news on state-controlled television
featured pictures of the pair together, and the Beijing Daily
newspaper highlighted Jia's speeches about the evils of smuggling
and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in a country where the relatives of high officials are
often fantastically rich on the basis of shady businesses, many
people are inclined to believe the worst about Ms. Lin, even though
her husband has the reputation of being squeaky clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``With almost any leader, you'll find a family member who's done
something,'' said one Chinese professor, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``On the surface it may all appear legal, but when you
investigate there are bribes or smuggling _ there's something to
attack.''

GRANDMOTHERS FINALLY MEET ELIAN GONZALEZ ON NEUTRAL SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Two Cuban grandmothers and their 6-year-old grandson,
accidental players on the last front of the Cold War, met privately
Wednesday for the first time in the two months since he was rescued
from the sea off Ft. Lauderdale, where his mother drowned. The
grandmothers seek custody of the boy, Elian Gonzalez, for his
father in Cuba, while Cuban-American relatives want to raise him
here.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the meetings, the grandmothers departed by helicopter
without commenting. The relatives, however, were elated by the
discussions, although they were not a party to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great,'' said Marisleysis Gonzalez, 21-year-old
daughter of Lazaro and Angela Gonzalez, with whom Elian has been
living. ``I feel he's more to this side than to that side,'' she
said referring to the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   Right after the meeting, Jorge Mas Santos, a leader of the Cuban
exiles who was in the car leaving the meeting with Elian, spoke to
a reporter for WSCV-TV, a Spanish station in Miami. Mas handed the
phone to the boy. ``I will get my U.S. citizenship tomorrow,'' a
little voice said in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the family was in the meeting with Elian, the
grandmothers, Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, president of Barry
University here who opened her home for it and two other nuns who
participated. In a news conference afterward, Sister Jeanne
indicated that the principal breakthrough may have been a softening
of hostility, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very touch and go for a long time,'' she said. ``It was
very definitely a family affair that has somehow turned into
political agendas.'' Both sides arrived frightened and wary of
trapdoors, she said. But, ``there were no accusations or promises
or trying to define the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Friday, Mariela Quintana, mother of Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, and Raquel Rodriguez, mother of Elian's mother,
have bounded from New York to Washington to New York to Miami to
Washington and now back to Miami to plea for something that would
be simple enough almost anywhere else: the custody of a motherless
child for his only other parent and for themselves, grandmothers
who had helped raise him from infancy. But their cause has been
caught up in the fires that have scorched American-Cuban relations
since the Cuban Revolution 41 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Acrimony between the grandmothers and the Miami relatives who
want custody was such that the two sides did not have contact with
each other at the meeting place. The child was handed to Sister
Jeanne, who led him to the grandmothers, where toys and coloring
books had been provided. The relatives, who have taken care of the
boy since he was found clinging to an inner tube Nov. 25 in a
crossing from Cuba in which his mother and 10 other people drowned,
stayed in other rooms.
</P>
<P>
   To facilitate the meeting, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service had assured the Miami relatives that Elian would not be
spirited away.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little doubt outside about the reunion's symbolism
and the passions that it has stirred. With Miami police providing
security as intense as that for presidential visits, little Elian
came and went in his relatives' political consultant's Lexus, a
tiny figure in a blue and red plaid shirt and dark blue trousers
whom a cousin , Marisleysis Gonzalez, and a great uncle, Delfin
Gonzalez, led into the house.
</P>
<P>
   A half hour after Elian arrived, an hour after the scheduled 4
p.m. start of the meeting, his grandmothers arrived by helicopter
from a Miami area airport, leapfrogging anti-Castro protesters
outside the house. Armando Gutierrez, the consultant, said a cell
phone had been confiscated from one of the women as she entered to
visit with Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the meeting site, anti-Castro demonstrators circled the
area outside the home's iron gate. They chanted, ``Libertad!
Libertad!'' and in Spanish, ``Elian, Miami is with you.
</P>
<P>
   A demonstrator's sign said, ``Council of Churches, Castro's
Puppet,'' a reference to the National Council of Churches, which
helped bring the women to the United States. Another sign expressed
a view gaining currency in the exile community, that of a waif who
miraculously survived two days in the sea. It said, ``3 kings, 3
children _ Moses, Jesus and Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   As the visit began, all the combatants who are demanding
American custody of Elian assembled in their largest force yet. The
lawyers, publicists, officials of Cuban exile groups and officials
of the National Council of Churches, who have been chaperoning the
women, were not allowed indoors. Elian's psychologist was not
allowed in either.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban community views the custody battle as an opportunity
to embarrass Fidel Castro, and Castro has seized it to defend his
nation's sovereignty and a father's prerogatives. To compete for
media attention, the Cuban American National Association brought
several of Elian's relatives to the National Press Club in
Washington to press its case for legislation that would grant Elian
U.S. citizenship and in that way remove the immigration service
from his case.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives maintained that statements of the boy's father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, demanding custody are coerced by Castro.
``He's manipulated by the government, and he has to say everything
the government wants him to say,'' said a Cuban-American second
cousin, William Gonzalez. We all know doesn't speak for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place after the Immigration and Naturalization
Service intervened Tuesday and ordered the relatives to allow the
grandmothers to meet Elian or lose their temporary custody while
their appeals are heard in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's paternal great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, has sued in
federal court to block Elian's repatriation, which the INS has
ordered and then delayed, and to hear the appeal for his political
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Congress Wednesday, a bill to grant the boy
honorary citizenship _ a right offered only two other people then
living, Winston Churchill and Mother Teresa _ struck some
rhetorical shoals. ``Should the U.S. Senate be a custody court?''
asked Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska. ``Let this young boy go home to
his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Such questions appeared to at least slow the momentum of
citizenship legislation led by Sen. Connie Mack of Florida and
supported by the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, of
Mississippi.

`BUDDY HOLLY' STAR DOES MORE THAN WEAR THE GOOFY GLASSES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Friday, Jan. 28) 
 
 
 
 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the Southern-gothic novels of William Faulkner or the
magisterial westerns of John Ford, the propulsive roots rock of
Buddy Holly has often been best appreciated on the far side of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, says actor Van Zeiler, who plays the title role in
``Buddy ... The Buddy Holly Story,'' the Texas-born rock 'n' roll
pioneer's music is still packing them in across the pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was one of the first and only early rock guys to
tour over there,'' explains Zeiler, recently returned from London,
where ``Buddy'' has been running continuously for the past 10
years. In London, Zeiler and other cast members were actually on a
first-name basis with members of the local Buddy Holly Fan Club,
who regularly attended the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like the Who are bigger over here than over there,''
Zeiler says, drawing a parallel with the British rock band.
</P>
<P>
   Over here, over there, or most anywhere rock 'n' roll is played,
Holly's legacy still casts a long shadow, and his best tunes still
can make people sway.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this Wednesday, Feb. 2 _ exactly 41 years to the day
since Holly gave his last fateful concert performance many of those
seminal Holly hits, including ``Peggy Sue,'' ``Maybe Baby'' and
``That'll Be the Day'' will reverberate inside the Pantages Theatre
in Hollywood, where ``Buddy'' will play an 11-day engagement. The
musical play, which opened in London's West End in 1989 and later
had a successful Broadway run, is currently on a national tour that
has been winning strong notices.
</P>
<P>
   Zeiler, 27, will take the stage in geeky glasses and white
short-sleeve shirt to re-create the legend of a performer whose
meteoric career ended abruptly in an Iowa plane crash in the early
morning hours of Feb. 3, 1959.
</P>
<P>
   While making himself look like Holly is a relatively easy task,
Zeiler's real challenge is replicating the singer's magnetic stage
aura.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always willing to take things a step further and
incorporate crazy things that other people couldn't envision,''
says Zeiler, speaking by phone from a Fort Worth hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Crazy things such as?
</P>
<P>
   ``Standing on the basses and having bass players twirl things
around, and sliding around on his knees,'' Zeiler continues.
``Crazy stuff like that _ crazy considering that rock 'n' roll and
rockabilly stuff was just starting around that time. Elvis was just
starting to swivel his hips, and Chuck Berry was just starting to
duck walk. But I think Buddy's (theatricality) wasn't so much
calculated performance as a youthful exuberance.''
</P>
<P>
   Holly's craziness ... er, youthful exuberance, also extended to
his personal life: He proposed to his future wife on the night of
their first date.
</P>
<P>
   Holly also became one of the first white performers to play the
Apollo Theatre in New York, one of many unconventional experiences
that he packed into his brief 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was definitely moving ahead _ all the time _ at the time
that he died,'' Zeiler says. ``People who knew him said it was as
if he knew he had a limited time and he wanted to get it all in. He
had no time to fool around in the recording studio. He was
notorious for being able to get things down in a few takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Charles Hardin Holley (with an ``e'') on Sept. 7, 1936, in
Lubbock, Texas, Holly and his band, the Crickets, brought a number
of innovations to early rock, including the use of double-tracking
and the basic lineup of two guitars, bass and drums.
</P>
<P>
   Holly also penned original material at a time when other
proto-rockers were content doing souped-up covers of country and
blues tunes.
</P>
<P>
   He helped popularize such now-familiar techniques as the
percussive rhythmic strumming of guitar chords (on ``Peggy Sue,''
for example) and at the time of his death had begun incorporating
orchestral textures into his arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key to it all is that it was ground-breaking at
the time,'' Zeiler says.
</P>
<P>
   Zeiler's path to playing Buddy Holly also traversed unfamiliar
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in an Atlanta household of music enthusiasts, Zeiler
began playing classical violin at age 3. His parents, he says, fell
in that generation between Elvis and the Beatles, limiting his
youthful exposure to pop music.
</P>
<P>
   But as an adolescent, he developed a taste for progressive
Southern rock by the likes of Jimmy Buffett, Lynyrd Skynyrd and the
Allman Brothers. Later, he played in a college band, Southern
Exposure.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to New York City to pursue an acting career, he
managed to pay some bills by playing acoustic guitar at ``yuppie
bars'' during happy hour. While he ``never really intended on a
career in music,'' and still doesn't, Zeiler partly credits his
years on the cocktail circuit with building the stamina he needs to
play Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   One unexpected residual of ``Buddy'' was meeting his wife,
Victoria Stilwell, the British actress who portrays Holly's wife,
Maria Elena. While the couple are enjoying the chance to share the
same stage, Zeiler says, they avoid bringing their work home with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sort of done it long enough now, Vicki and I, that we
keep our other interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Zeiler is unsure how long he'll keep playing the role,
his interest in Buddy Holly seems in no immediate danger of fading
away. In some ways, he suggests, the entire world is still catching
up with the skinny kid from Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems, from reading the history of it, that his loss wasn't
really felt and his stuff really appreciated for its place in the
history of things until history had moved on and was able to look
back.'' &QL;

STUDY FINDS STRONG EVIDENCE THAT JEFFERSON FATHERED SLAVE SON 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The foundation that administers Monticello, Thomas
Jefferson's estate in Charlottesville, Va., said on Wednesday that
an extensive study it had commissioned concluded that Jefferson was
almost certainly the father of one, if not all six, of the children
of Sally Hemings, one of his slaves.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation comes
more than a year after a scientific study of DNA samples taken from
known descendants of Jefferson and Hemings concluded that Jefferson
was the father of her youngest son and was probably the father of
her five other children as well.
</P>
<P>
   The new study is likely to have an impact well beyond the
well-tended and hallowed grounds of Monticello, which is maintained
as a historical site and shrine to one of the nation's founders.
The report also supports the theory that Jefferson and Hemings had
a long intimate relationship.
</P>
<P>
   James Truscott of Slippery Rock, Pa., the president of the
Monticello Association, a group of Jefferson descendants that has
generally resisted the notion of black Jefferson descendants, said
in an interview on Wednesday night that his group would issue a
separate report on the matter later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel P. Jordan, the foundation's president, said at a news
conference, ``Although paternity cannot be established with
absolute certainty, our evaluation of the best evidence available
suggests the strong likelihood that Thomas Jefferson and Sally
Hemings had a relationship over time that led to the birth of one,
and perhaps all, of the known children of Sally Hemings.''
</P>
<P>
   The study combined an evaluation of the original DNA study in
November 1998 and an examination of the whereabouts of Jefferson
and Hemings at the times she is presumed to have conceived her
children.
</P>
<P>
   The historical examination, the foundation said, established
that the presence of DNA characteristic of Jefferson over the
decades in some of Hemings descendants could not be supported by an
alternative theory that his brother or nephews fathered the
children.

 &HT;    Two lesser lights step from shadow
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Titans' lesser-known defensive linemen have
stepped from Jevon Kearse's shadow during the Super Bowl run. On
Sunday, they could play big roles.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse has received much publicity during his rookie, 14
1/2-sack season. But starting tackle Jason Fisk, a seventh-round
choice of Minnesota in 1995, and tackle Josh Evans, who wasn't even
drafted, have been forced to make big plays because Kearse is
commanding such attention from offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start double- and triple-teaming the guys who have
the big names, somebody with a lesser name or status steps up,''
Kearse said. ``The past couple of weeks, when I was kind of
contained, you saw those other guys step up and make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearse was shut down by Jaguars right tackle Leon Searcy in last
week's AFC Championship Game. Kearse had only two tackles and a
fumble recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisk, who played behind Vikings Pro Bowl tackle John Randle
in 1998, had a fumble recovery and a half of a sack.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk and Evans, who had four tackles against the Jaguars,
combined on a game-turning safety in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With the Jaguars facing second-and-10 at their 1, Evans and Fisk
blew through the middle to tackle quarterback Mark Brunell in the
end zone, extending the Titans lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was going to be a pass play,'' Evans said. ``We
just got off the ball quickly. We're not a big defensive line, so
we've got to use our speed to our advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who played at Alabama-Birmingham, missed the first four
games this season. He was suspended for violating the league's
substance-abuse policy. When Evans returned to the team on Oct. 4,
he had lost 14 pounds and seemed quicker at 278.
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing in only 12 regular-season games, Evans matched
career highs with 54 tackles and 3 1/2 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Starting right defensive end Kenny Holmes also is resuscitating
his career. A first-rounder from Miami in 1997, Holmes had just 2
1/2 sacks in his second season.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans seemed ready to give up on him after they drafted
Kearse and courted high-priced free-agent Chad Bratzke, who signed
with the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   But the competition seemed to give Holmes a sense of urgency.
After recovering from an early-season ankle injury, he had four
sacks and 12 quarterback pressures in the final nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes says he owes a lot to Kearse.
</P>
<P>
   ``His presence alone just takes so much away from the other
guys, in terms of double-teams,'' Holmes said. ``They worry about
him, and he's still getting the job done with the double-teams and
chip blocks.''

CHINESE PREPARING TO IMPORT CALIFORNIA CITRUS
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A delegation of Chinese officials toured the
citrus groves of Ventura County north of Los Angeles on Wednesday
in preparation for launching a multimillion-dollar trade deal
between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
   The group is making its way across the agricultural sites of the
country, inspecting pest trapping and eradication programs to
ensure that exported citrus -- oranges, lemons, grapefruit and
tangerines -- will be protected, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last step to opening the market,'' said Claire
Peters, spokeswoman with Sunkist Growers, one of the hosts of the
day-long tour.
</P>
<P>
   China signed an agreement last April to open its market to U.S.
citrus. The landmark agreement, however, hinges on what the Chinese
inspectors find during their tours, Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   She was not sure when the Chinese would decide if they approve
of the traps and programs.
</P>
<P>
   In Ventura County, up the coast from Los Angeles, the No. 1 cash
crop is lemons, part of the county's nearly $1 billion agricultural
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents a major potential increase in exports to the
Pacific Rim,'' said Rex Laird, executive director of Ventura County
Farm Bureau. ``Anytime you can increase the number of customers,
that's a major benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Laird was confident the county's crops showed well during the
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we do an excellent job here of covering the issues
that they would be concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters said the Chinese's response during Wednesday's tour was
``very positive and very good.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour included a visit to a packing house in Fillmore and the
shipping area at the Port of Hueneme. Fruit from Ventura County
currently is exported to Japan from that port, Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors are scheduled to visit Kern and Tulare counties
later this week and proceed to the San Joaquin Valley, Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   The group has visited Florida, Texas and Arizona. California is
their last stop before returning home. At each site, they visited
with the agricultural commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura County Agricultural Commissioner Earl McPhail was not
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's tour included state and federal officials, including
Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Simi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Peters said the citrus industry of California and Arizona could
see sales of more than $500 milliion over the next five years if
China opens its doors.

OPTIMISM AT GLOBAL TRADE TALKS ON GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS

<P>
   MONTREAL _ Negotiators trying to forge the first global treaty
regulating trade in genetically modified products have tentatively
agreed to eliminate a proposal requiring exporters of genetically
modified crops like corn and soybeans to obtain permission in
advance from each importing country.
</P>
<P>
   Under the preliminarily agreement, information about such crops
would be posted to a central clearinghouse. It would be up to each
country to decide whether to ban the imports.
</P>
<P>
   How to handle crops is just one issue confronting delegates from
more than 130 nations here negotiating a so-called Biosafety
Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Still, negotiators said progress is being made and that the
atmosphere is far more cooperative than the mood a year ago in
Cartagena, Colombia, when talks collapsed after the United States
and some other big agricultural exporting nations rejected a draft
approved by the other countries. The mood is raising hopes that an
agreement can be reached by the self-imposed deadline of Friday.  &QL;

 &HT;    Right career moves for defensive boss
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In 1984, Titans defensive coordinator Gregg Williams
couldn't get a head coaching job at his own high school. On Sunday,
he will lead one of the NFL's best defenses into the Super Bowl in
the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 41, was an assistant coach at Excelsior Springs (Mo.)
High School when he applied for the head position at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 25 years old,'' Williams said Wednesday. ``They asked me
what I'd do if I didn't get the job, which kind of told me that I
wasn't getting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `You guys are probably going to do Gregg Williams
the biggest favor of his life.' I told them I had aspirations to
coach in college and the pros, and they just kind of snickered.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Williams became head coach at Belton (Mo.) High
School. After four seasons, he took a job as a graduate assistant
at the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   When Cougars coach Jack Pardee took over the former Oilers in
1989, Williams went to the NFL with him. He was the team's
quality-control coach for three years and coached special teams in
1993, Pardee's final season.
</P>
<P>
   Current Titans coach Jeff Fisher took over in 1994 and hired
Williams to coach linebackers. He has been defensive coordinator
the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gregg has taken the long road,'' Fisher said. ``There are
coaches around the country who would give anything to be in his
shoes. His situation and mine are completely different. I got my
start in the NFL. Gregg started as a high school coach and worked
his way up.''
</P>
<P>
   Along every stop, Williams has kept in touch with his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would have retired there. I probably wouldn't have
left the district,'' he said. ``I'll send them a letterhead from
every place I go, just to see how they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   PRO BOWL MEDIA PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Brad Hopkins thinks rookie Jevon Kearse has
handled the media crush adroitly. ``It's a situation where people
really want to know what he does best and to learn about him
personally,'' he said. ``He's done a good job of maintaining his
poise. I think he understood the magnitude of it all when he first
got here. Florida's no rinky-dink school. He's used to the national
spotlight, to playing big games in which all eyes are on them.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING FOR HELP
</P>
<P>
   Center Kevin Long said the long arm of the media has reached his
parents, who did their first interview Tuesday. ``They were nervous
about it,'' he said. They called me up yesterday for a few pointers
and I told them, `Heck, I'm not too good at it because I haven't
been interviewed that much.'''
</P>
<P>
   KICKING THE COLD Kicker Al Del Greco said the Titans
havediscussed having their kickers work out in the Georgia Dome
while the rest of the team practices at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're checking into that,'' he said. ``Obviously it would be
nice to get our work done in the Dome, but I don't think it'll be a
problem if we have to go outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be ready to kick either way. Whether we kick
outside in great weather or bad weather all week, come warmups on
Sunday you're in that Dome, and it's a little different.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Greco described the anxiety going into the Super Bowl as
``the most awesome uneasy feeling I've ever had in my life, with
the exception of getting married.''
</P>
<P>
   DORSETT GETTING COMFORTABLE
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Dorsett, who is replacing injured free safety Marcus
Robertson, said he doesn't expect the Rams to pick on him. ``How
can they pick on me?'' said Dorsett, who is the son of former
Cowboys running back Tony Dorsett. ``I'm a free safety, I'm not a
corner. To beat me, they have to beat someone else also. You can
throw the ball in the middle of the field; they may catch the ball
sometime, you know they get paid just like I do. I want a chance to
make some plays. I'm not nervous. I'm not scared.... If that's what
they want to do, then bring it to me. If I can make the plays, and
if they want to keep trying me, I might be MVP of the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett, who lived in Stone Mountain, Ga., with his mother from
ages 12-15, said the Titans still don't get any respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like the ragamuffins of the league,'' he said. ``We have
to fight, scratch and scrounge for everything we're going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse doesn't expect the Titans to rattle Rams quarterback Kurt
Warner as much as they did in their 24-21 victory at Nashville on
Oct. 31. ``We were playing at home with a lot of crowd noise,'' he
said, ``and it really messed up his rhythm.''... Titans guard Bruce
Matthews said he had just signed a new contract with the Houston
Oilers a few days before they revealed in 1997 they were moving to
Tennessee: ``I'm like, `You've got to be kidding me.'... In my
heart I wanted everything to fail and I wanted the team to stay in
Houston.''

IN ASSAULT ON ISLAMIC REBELS, A BID TO END ALGERIA'S CIVIL WAR 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A bid by Algeria's president to end an eight-year civil
war by opening an offensive against Islamic guerrillas who have
defied a government amnesty has erupted into some of the fiercest
fighting in years.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in Algerian newspapers have said that at least 125
soldiers and guerrillas have been killed since the government began
its offensive in a mountainous area of western Algeria nine days
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The government attack follows an ultimatum included in a peace
plan that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika put forward after he was
elected last April. His proposal for a ``civil concord'' with the
guerrillas, ratified in a national referendum in September, hinged
on an amnesty for any rebel surrendering before a Jan. 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   A pro-government newspaper in Algiers, El Khabar, said last week
that 4,200 rebels may have surrendered, more than double the figure
previously given by the government. But by most counts, at least
1,500 rebels, perhaps substantially more, remain active.
</P>
<P>
   When he proposed the amnesty, Bouteflika said that guerrillas
who prolonged the war would face ``a fight without mercy'' and
``eradication.'' He waited six days past the deadline before
sending paratroops, infantry units and helicopters against one of
the main guerrilla strongholds in the hinterland of Relizane
province, 95 miles southwest of Algiers. The region is one of
several that have served as base areas for guerrilla attacks on the
Mediterranean coastal plain, where 90 percent of Algerians live.
</P>
<P>
   The combat area _ which includes the Oursenis national park, a
vacation area before the war _ is thickly forested with pines and
cedars and rises to nearly 4,000 feet. Le Matin, an independent
Algiers newspaper, reported on Monday that 25 government soldiers
and about 100 guerrillas had been killed, with 70 of the dead
rebels being accounted for in fighting on Saturday. The paper said
about 230 guerrillas were still holding out against the main thrust
of the government attack.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Bouteflika was hand-picked for the
presidency last year by Algeria's generals, who have held decisive
political authority since shortly after Algeria's independence from
France in 1962. His pledge to Algeria's 30 million people was that
he would bring about ``national reconciliation'' by ending the war.
</P>
<P>
   By unofficial estimates, 100,000 people have been killed in the
conflict, most of them civilians who have been bombed in cafes,
markets and schools, stopped at guerrilla roadblocks and executed,
or slaughtered by the hundreds in village massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Algerians see the conflict as an extension of what they call
their national ``nightmare,'' reaching back to the eight-year war
of independence with a French colonial army that historians say
cost about 1 million lives.
</P>
<P>
   More than an end to the war rides on Bouteflika's shoulders,
since many Algerians believe there is little hope of the generals'
allowing the emergence of a genuine parliamentary democracy or of
Algeria's rising from the economic abyss into which it fell in the
1990s until the fighting ends.
</P>
<P>
   Although Algerians are gaining confidence that the back of the
Islamic insurgency has been broken, it is not clear yet that the
war's end is at hand. For one thing, the rebels' ``eradication''
would void the main claim that the generals have for retaining
their decisive political power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little early to say, but I'm not at all convinced that
this is the end game,'' said High Roberts, a specialist on Algeria
who teaches at the London School of Economics. ``I'm not convinced
that there is a consensus in Algiers to make a definitive end to
all the armed groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The amnesty plan has had some striking successes. On Jan. 11,
two days before the amnesty expired, the guerrilla group that
started the war, the Islamic Salvation Army, agreed to dissolve
itself after Bouteflika granted its estimated 8,000 fighters a
blanket amnesty. The move effectively ratified the status quo,
since the Islamic Salvation Front, the political group that
controlled the fighters, had observed a cease-fire since August
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significant has been Bouteflika's success in
opening amnesty negotiations with a splinter force led by a
guerrilla leader, Hassan Hattab, who broke with the main insurgent
group over its attacks on civilians. Algerian security force
spokesmen have said that Hattab has 1,500 fighters in his group,
the Salafist Group for Proselytization and Combat, which has been
active in the mountains of the Kabylia area about 70 miles east of
Algiers.
</P>
<P>
   What remains unclear is how many guerrillas will accept, or
defy, their leaders' decisions on the amnesty. The interior
minister, Yazid Zerhouni, said last week that ``about 80 percent''
of all the guerrillas had surrendered, but did not specify how many
men that involved.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Islamic Salvation Army's leader, Madani Mezrag,
signed a statement dissolving the force, the actual hand-over of
arms by his fighters appears to have been sporadic. Government
spokesmen have said that 1,100 of Mezrag's fighters have
surrendered in the Jijel area, 130 miles east of Algiers, but
others have yet to respond.

GORE CITES SUCCESS OF ADMINISTRATION'S WELFARE OVERHAUL
</HEADLINE>
   (See also GORE-N.Y., CLINTON-GORE) 
(sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ At a shoe factory converted to high-tech
manufacturing, Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday emphasized the
success of the Clinton administration's overhaul of the welfare
system and drew attention to former Sen. Bill Bradley's opposition
to that overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been linking himself with the successes of the Clinton
administration and, in keeping with that message, he was introduced
on Wednesday by Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, this state's governor, who
herself attributed the nation's economic prosperity to the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke at a company called Electropac, a former shoe factory
that now makes circuit boards and is emblematic of New Hampshire's
success in the new economy. The Gore campaign is also running new
commercials here boasting of the economy and Gore's experience in
keeping the economy on track.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare, like the economy, has improved over the past eight
years, Gore said, but could get even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay, it's been a success, what now?'' Gore said to a handful
of plant employees. ``We need to keep building on this success.''
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated his prescription for improvements in the welfare
system, which is to get fathers more directly involved with their
children and providing support and training to fathers who want to
be more involved with their children but are unable to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can move millions off of welfare and into the workforce,''
Gore said. ``I would like to challenge Senator Bradley to change
his position and recognize at long last that the welfare reform he
vigorously opposed is a success. He continues to believe that he's
correct in opposing welfare reform and supporting the status quo
even after the historic successes of this policy.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on Bradley to ``get with the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeated his assertions about Bradley's opposition to the
welfare overhaul in a local television interview. ``If he sees that
as a negative, maybe it's because he's afraid the people see his
earlier vote as a mistake and his current position as a mistake,''
Gore said.

COWBOYS OWNER HIRES YET ANOTHER PUPPET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry Jones introduced his new puppet Wednesday, which is not a
personal indictment of Mr. Dave Campo.
</P>
<P>
   But like it not, true or not, it's the perception Campo will now
have to live with, locally and nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Valley Ranch is the only place in the history of the NFL where a
highly successful defensive coordinator can be promoted to head
coach and immediately lose respect.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the pox Jerry has placed on his own head-coaching house.
</P>
<P>
   Was Campo, having been a valuable, trusted and productive
Cowboys assistant for 11 years, the right hire in these most
troubling of football times?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely not. But again, that is also not a personal
indictment of Campo. There could be no right hire, at least not in
the true definition of what the title of head coach should mean,
and has to mean if success is going to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry has stripped the job down to dune buggy status _ four
tires and a roll bar.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, whomever the choice, the new guy was going to be
slapped with an immediate image problem. It's that puppet thing
again. Which is that Jerry thing again. And now a nice man like
Dave Campo is branded, fair or not fair.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Campo, 52, Wednesday as his third head coach in
three years, Jones proudly observed that after his homework and
research, he interviewed no candidate from outside the
organization. His logic was that the research and homework pointed
straight to Campo.
</P>
<P>
   But if we can deal with the truth for one second, absolutely no
qualified candidate from the outside even came close to surfacing.
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry _ your reputation has spread like poison ivy.
Any real candidate with head coaching aspirations either realized
on his own, or was advised by others, that the Cowboys' job carries
the kiss of a cobra.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the very best thing to happen in all this was Jones
being forced to stay in-house.
</P>
<P>
   The job came down to only insiders _ Campo or special teams
coach Joe Avezzano.
</P>
<P>
   From personal observation only _ meaning I'm not privy to what
is said in the coaches' meetings _ Avezzano has the stronger and
more forceful personality of the two. In dealing with Jones, that
is needed.
</P>
<P>
   But Campo also fully understands the weird ground rules at
Valley Ranch. After 11 years, one would assume he has picked up a
few tricks that might be useful when Jones plunges off the roof on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry is the owner, the president, the general manager, the team
mouthpiece, the team power, and he darn sure wants to be first in
line when the glory is handed out. If there is ever going to be any
more glory for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   But by Jones making the decision to stay in-house, he eliminated
an unnecessary time factor. As Chan Gailey soon learned, no matter
what you might think you know about dealing with Jones, many
surprises are coming, none of them pleasant, and all of them time
consuming to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   In a job where there was no right hire, at least Campo was a
choice that went in the right direction. That direction was
in-house. Because the new head coach would not have the benefit of
making his own staff selections _ another Jerry law _ it was
another reason to go the only way Jones could go. Although how much
input will Campo have in hires on the offensive side, since his
specialty is defense?
</P>
<P>
   It would, of course, have been nice Wednesday to hear Campo
finish his acceptance speech during the Valley Ranch media
conference. But Jerry, who had rambled too long before introducing
Campo, jumped in, interrupted Dave, and then told us again, that by
gosh, Campo was the head coach in charge of all areas of the team,
including offense.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. I suppose that meant Jones wasn't hiring just a defensive
coordinator, a reference to head coach Gailey really being just an
offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   But does Jerry already have the offensive staff in place for
Campo? Would that be Jack Reilly as offensive coordinator? Reilly
is the former quarterbacks coach here under offensive coordinator
Ernie Zampese. Will Zampese move back to Valley Ranch and serve as
Reilly's part-time consultant? Will Jason Garrett be convinced to
retire as a player and become quarterbacks coach, something Troy
Aikman would certainly favor?
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to think these are decisions Campo will make.
He is, after all, the new head coach. But until proved otherwise,
the perception will be this is simply another Jerry puppet. nn

 &HT;    DISABLED TWIN TELLS ABOUT SWITCH TO REGULAR CLASSES
 &HT;    Eds: Advance for release Saturday, Jan. 26
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Anastasia Somoza, 16, and her twin sister Alba are
10th graders at School of the Future, a public high school in
Manhattan. Each is a quadriplegic wheelchair user with cerebral
palsy.
</P>
<P>
   Anastasia was one of the students who joined concerned parents
recently on Capitol Hill to urge stricter enforcement of laws
protecting the right of disabled children to a free, appropriate
public education in the ``least restrictive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   She told the others how a persistent parent, volunteers from a
big law firm and personal intervention by President Clinton helped
Alba follow Anastasia out of special classes and into classes also
attended by children without disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ ANDREW MOLLISON
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is a condensed version of what Anastasia said:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When I started kindergarten, I went to a special school in Long
Island that was only for disabled students, and my twin sister was
in a special education classroom in a public school about an hour's
bus ride from our house in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   They would not let Alba attend my school because she could not
speak.
</P>
<P>
   In her own class, nobody knew how to use her assistive
technology. My sister is very smart, and has an IQ of 130, but the
teachers simply were not trained to teach her properly. She then
simply tuned them out because she was so bored, and refused to
respond. They kept giving her ``baby stuff'' to work on year after
year.
</P>
<P>
   My school was OK academically. But it was so far from home that
I left home at 7 a.m. and returned at 6 p.m., at which time I still
had to have therapy, dinner, my bath and do homework. I had no
playmates because my friends lived too far away and we had no car.
I was always tired and hated the long bus ride.
</P>
<P>
   My mom went to a conference one day and learned all about
inclusion, and how well children did in their local classrooms.
When my school continued to refuse to accept my sister, she took me
out of there and returned me to our district, to the same school as
Alba.
</P>
<P>
   However this time, she had me placed in a 3rd grade class where
I was the only child with a disability. When my mom saw how well I
was doing, she decided to place Alba in a regular class.
</P>
<P>
   That is when our problems began. The principal and the district
refused to allow Alba into a general education classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody like my sister was allowed into regular education in New
York City and they put the chancellor's lawyers in charge of the
legal team opposing my mom. She had a legal aid lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   About this time, I was invited to a town meeting with President
Clinton at the White House. It was filmed on television, and I
asked the president to help my sister, and he sure did, and still
writes to us today.
</P>
<P>
   Even with his help, it took my mom one and a half years in court
to get my sister into regular education, and to get both of us the
support services we needed.
</P>
<P>
   A big law firm in New York helped my mom without charging;
otherwise we could not have done it.
</P>
<P>
   During the legal battle, it was really terrible for me and my
sister at school. They did everything to be nasty to my mom, and
refused to do even the simplest things to make things easier for my
sister and for me.
</P>
<P>
   But the kids in school were great and so were some teachers who
secretly helped my mom and told her what was going on in our
school.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, my sister was integrated into the fourth grade, but all
the time we spent at that school was difficult for us.
</P>
<P>
   When we moved on to the 7th grade in my present school, it was
like night and day. Everybody welcomed us, the principal, the
teachers and the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Both my sister and I started to get really good grades and
everyone was astonished with our progress.
</P>
<P>
   I was named the ``most outstanding student'' in the 9th grade
last year and am top of my class this year. I went to Yale
University summer school for political science. I was the only
student with a disability and I graduated in the top ten of 200
students with straight A's.
</P>
<P>
   My sister has made extraordinary progress. She is having a hard
time catching up from all the years she lost in special education,
but her teachers have said that she has had an exceptional
turnaround. She is talking up a storm on her communication
computer, and is one of the most popular kids in the school.
</P>

   I think that if people just have faith in students with special

not concentrate on what we cannot do, there will be many, many more

 &HT;    Bush team expresses cautious confidence about N.H. victory
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ The George W. Bush campaign machine remains
convinced he has time to pull a come-from-behind victory in
Tuesday's New Hampshire primary. But privately, Bush team members
are not showing the buoyant confidence that has come to typify the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush's top political strategist is publicly offering hedged
confidence that could become the company line if the polls are
correct and Arizona Sen. John McCain wins here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to win New Hampshire,'' Rove said as Bush geared
up for a week of campaigning. ``But the fact of the matter is the
front-runner ... has always hit a rough patch in the road.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all aimed at protecting Bush against the possibility of
suffering the first political defeat of his career since he lost a
1978 West Texas congressional race.
</P>
<P>
   After a Wednesday morning speech in Concord, a longtime GOP
operative said the New Hampshire challenge for his man grew
significantly with Steve Forbes' solid second-place showing in Iowa
on Monday. That finish, according to the Bush backer, solidified
Forbes' standing in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   It also amplified Bush's position in the GOP field, where he is
fending off Forbes from the right and McCain from what could be
considered the party's left. But Rove says he's not worried about
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in the broad mainstream of the party that's always
true,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush got a boost, albeit a small one, on Wednesday when Utah
Sen. Orrin Hatch, who took only 1 percent in the Iowa caucus this
week, withdrew and endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   Though not giving up on a New Hampshire win, the long-range
confidence of the Bush campaign is based elsewhere. The next races
will be in Delaware on Feb. 8 and South Carolina on Feb. 19, two
states where Bush is expected to score big wins.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Bush pronounced himself ``ready for the
contest.'' But he's also beginning to appear a little sick and a
lot tired. He sniffled through two speeches before Wednesday's
debate and has acknowledged feeling the rigors of life on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get beyond 20 or 30 pages (of reading) a night
because when I get into bed, I'm exhausted,'' he told reporters on
board the early morning Tuesday flight from Iowa to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   While campaigning for governor, Bush usually made day trips
around the state so he could be home with his family at night. On
the national campaign trail, he frequently tells crowds he misses
the comforts of home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the longest stretch of time I've been away from my
family,'' he told a Hillsboro audience Wednesday.

 &HT;    ELIAN MEETS WITH GRANDMOTHERS, REMAINS WITH MIAMI FAMILY

<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ After two months of being paraded,
photographed and fought over as a symbol of Cuba's political
divisions, 6-year-old shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez on
Wednesday finally was allowed to be simply a grandson.
</P>
<P>
   As about 100 Cuban-American demonstrators nearby chanted
``Libertad,'' or ``liberty,'' the boy was reunited with his
grandmothers in a private meeting at the home of Sister Jeanne
O'Laughlin, president of Miami's Barry University.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Elian saw his grandmothers they were elated,'' said
Sister Leonor Esnard, an associate of O'Laughlin who took the boy
into a room to meet his grandmothers. ``They picked him up and they
were just shaking. They were thrilled. They kept hugging and
kissing him.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who at first didn't talk much, played with stuffed
animals and a coloring book, and then sat with his grandmothers to
look at photo albums sent by Elian's Cuban family and schoolmates,
said Sister Peggy Albert, another nun who looked in on part of the
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   But the poignant scene apparently did not erase the deep
divisions between branches of the Gonzalez family, who can't agree
on where the boy should live.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides of the family never met or spoke during the
roughly two-hour meeting, a condition that was insisted upon by the
grandmothers and Cuban officials, Sister O'Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking into tears as she spoke to reporters afterwards,
O'Laughlin seemed troubled there wasn't more progress toward
resolving the family conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray for that family, I weep for that family,'' she said.
``There was pain on both sides. There was hurt on both sides. There
were no accusations or promises or trying to define the future.
There were only moments of tearful weeping for what might have been
and what was not to be.''
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, one of the nuns heard a cellular phone ring,
O'Laughlin said. The nun opened the door and took the phone away
from Mariela Quintana, Elian's paternal grandmother. A condition of
the meeting was that there were to be no cell phones, but perhaps
Quintana didn't understand that, Sister O'Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The call may have been from the boy's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, who sent the grandmothers a letter asking them to take a
phone to the meeting so that Elian's Cuban family could speak to
him.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, the grandmothers left without speaking to
reporters and were scheduled to fly back to Washington, where they
have been lobbying against bills that would make Elian a U.S.
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Elian returned to the Little Havana home of the Miami relatives
who have cared for him since he was rescued at sea on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping out of the car, the boy smiled at a crowd of Cuban
exiles, waved and flashed a ``V'' for victory sign, drawing a roar
from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went fine,'' said the boy's Miami cousin,
Marisleysis Gonzalez, who before the meeting said she feared the
grandmothers might try to take the boy back to Cuba. ``I have more
feeling than before that he's more to this side than that side.''
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic reunion had all the trappings of an international
summit, with the two grandmothers arriving by chartered jet and
then flying by helicopter to a hospital near O'Laughlin's home.
They rode in a motorcade of unmarked police cars with blacked-out
windows, past a small army of Miami Beach police and plain-clothes
immigration officers.
</P>
<P>
   Streets were barricaded for several blocks around O'Laughlin's
posh home, and more barricades separated a horde of reporters and a
small but determined band of Cuban exile protesters from the gated
entrance to the home.
</P>
<P>
   But any hopes that the meeting might end the painful tug-of-war
over the child seemed dim.
</P>
<P>
   Federal immigration officials have said the boy _ whose mother
drowned on the ill-fated crossing from Cuba _ should go back to his
Cuban father. But the Miami relatives insist they won't let Elian
go until a federal court rules on their lawsuit aimed at keeping
him here.
</P>
<P>
   An opening round of legal motions in that lawsuit is expected to
be filed this week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Elian's fate has become a hot topic in snow-bound
Washington. After the grandmothers' tearful appeals to lawmakers
Tuesday, members of the Miami family flew to the capitol to make
their case Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   William Gonzalez, who is part of Elian's Miami family, said he
visited the boy's father in Cuba in 1998 and doesn't believe he is
free to speak his true feelings about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that he is not the cousin that we have over
there,'' Gonzalez said. ``He is being manipulated by the government
and he has to say everything the government tells him to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Bills that would make Elian a U.S. citizen, which would take his
case out of the hands of immigration authorities, probably won't be
debated until next week, said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., who supports keeping the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Beach reunion came after several tense days of
negotiations and one aborted attempt at bringing the warring sides
of the Gonzalez family together.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's grandmothers, who flew to the United States last Friday,
came to Miami Monday, but never made it to a planned reunion at the
Little Havana home. Frightened by televised images of a large crowd
of Cuban exiles gathered there, the women asked to meet at some
neutral spot, but Elian's Miami relatives refused.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, federal immigration officials _ who retain legal
authority over the boy _ ordered the Miami family to bring Elian to
O'Laughlin's home for the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin said both sides of the family seemed fearful when
they arrived separately at the house, but she showed them around to
put them at ease, even playing the child's game of ``scissors,
rock, paper,'' with Elian and his great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
   While relieved that the meeting wasn't marred by angry
outbursts, O'Laughlin implored everyone to seek a path to
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was about the future of a child, and together we must
all weep for the days of anguish and suffering that that child has
had to endure,'' she said. ``Each one of us must find a way to be
the healer, to be the reconciler.''

 Internet Marketer DoubleClick in Hot Water  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The use of personal information by Internet marketers has shifted
up a notch, spurring privacy advocates to step up their protests.
<P>
   The Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.,
watchdog group, is preparing to file a complaint with the Federal
Trade Commission following a report yesterday that Internet
marketer DoubleClick is identifying Internet users by name and
address, tracking their activities online and using the information
to send them targeted banner advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Also yesterday, Berkeley-based Privacyplace, an online magazine
(www.privacyplace.com), warned Web users to avoid the Web sites
that are sharing information with DoubleClick _ if the names of
those sites become public.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick, a New York company that sends banner ads to 11,000
Web sites and tracks consumer response to the ads, has not said
which sites or how many sites in its network are involved.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy was sparked by an article in USA Today yesterday
detailing how DoubleClick links consumer profiles from a database
called Abacus with the names of people who have registered on Web
sites that are part of DoubleClick's network.
</P>
<P>
   The Abacus database _ which reportedly covers 90 percent of U.S.
households _ consists of information about catalog users, including
their names, where they live and purchases they have made through
the mail. These names have long been traded among catalogers mining
for sales prospects.
</P>
<P>
   By linking that information with names of registered Web users
and attaching an identifying ``cookie'' to each surfer, marketers
can, for example, send a banner ad for boxed chocolates to a person
who has recently ordered chocolates from a catalog, or an ad for
Weight Watchers to someone who visited a diet Web site.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick's strategy is not surprising; Web marketers have
long touted highly targeted advertising as the great promise of the
Internet. And DoubleClick's intentions were clear when it acquired
Abacus months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who hold privacy paramount, DoubleClick's recent
applications of consumer profiling on the Web are an ominous
development. Consumer advocates don't buy marketers' arguments that
surfers want to see ads targeted toward their interests.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy watchdogs also believe Web marketers are disingenuous
when they say consumers have the right to ``opt out'' of having
their names used for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know they have to opt out'' _ they don't even
know which sites are in the DoubleClick network, said Tom Maddox,
editor of Privacyplace.
</P>
<P>
   In the FTC complaint that EPIC intends to file next month, the
group will ask the FTC to force DoubleClick to reveal which sites
are participating in the targeting, said Andrew Shen, an EPIC
policy analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Shen allowed that catalogers use similar information to send
targeted paper ads (catalogs) to consumers' homes. But ``e-commerce
is taking targeted advertising to an entirely new level,'' he said.
Web marketers are privy to information beyond mere purchases,
including data like which news articles consumers have read, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell Singer, an e-commerce analyst with Robertson Stephens,
said most consumers don't mind sharing their purchasing behavior as
long as information like medical records and their checking account
balance are not made available to marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as advertisers don't cross the line, they're not going
to get a tremendous amount of consumer protest,'' Singer said. ``If
they respect the parameters, I think they will continue to grow
their targetting capabilities. And I think that's a good thing.''

 _ SF CHRON   Internet Publishers Gamble on Altering Their Successful Brands 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
If building a brand is so important, especially when it comes to
Internet media, why are some heavy-hitting publishers tinkering _
or even trashing _ the brands that have brought them great success?
<P>
   TheStreet.com, the New York purveyor of financial news and
analysis, is making its flagship site at www.thestreet.com free to
all Web surfers. It will maintain a subscription only site, at
www.realmoney.com, where people can pay to read columnists like
James Cramer, Herb Greenberg and Adam Lashinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, even though TheStreet built its brand by
promoting those columnists, people who go to the site once the
change takes place won't find Cramer or Greenberg's latest musings.
</P>
<P>
   Even more dramatically, PC Computing, the Ziff-Davis magazine
that last year won a National Magazine Award and saw circulation
top 1 million, is changing its name with its May issue, to ``Smart
Business.''
</P>
<P>
   Are these moves really dumb business?
</P>
<P>
   They are certainly risky business, but could be the right thing
to do, branding and media experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't stay still too long,'' said Michael Tchong, who
publishes an online marketing newsletter, Iconocast.
</P>
<P>
   Tchong hailed the changes at TheStreet.com because the company
finally recognizes that ``the name of the game is free sponsored
content.'' While the company can boast of a truly impressive
achievement _ starting a brand from scratch and in less than five
years amassing 100,000 paying subscribers _ chief executive Tom
Clarke said the subscription fees would hinder future growth.
</P>
<P>
   After all, plenty of other sites like San Francisco's
MarketWatch.com offer free financial news and opinion online. Now
Clarke foresees TheStreet's advertising income rising, from 55
percent of its revenues to 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Priscaro, who runs a San Jose brand consultancy called No
Heavy Lifting and is director of brand development for TransMeta,
the upstart chipmaker, likened TheStreet's move to Coca-Cola
tinkering with its recipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``That to me is a classic branding mistake,'' he said. ``They
took something that was attractive to consumers, and changed it.
What is the value there?''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, at TheStreet, argues that the move eliminates confusion
that kept many Web surfers from the site. Roughly 60 percent of the
site's content was already free; now that will be expanded, while
the columns move to a site that costs twice as much as now.
</P>
<P>
   PC Computing's move is even bolder, and yet Priscaro and Tchong
agreed that the magazine was doing the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Tchong noted that traditional sources of advertising for PC
magazines are shrinking, as computer software and hardware becomes
ruled by a smaller group of companies and as the Internet grows in
importance for the sale of such products. Meanwhile, small
businesses are exploding; Tchong cited International Data Corp.
research showing businesses with two to 20 employees growing from
41 million today to more than 51 million in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a more alive segment of the marketplace,'' he
said. Plus, he added, the magazine didn't have much choice as it
looked to its future: ``It's a move made out of an absolute need to
do something.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because, as Priscaro notes, ``It's not so much a matter
of PCs anymore, nor is it a matter of computing ... The name they
built their brand around is pointing their brand in the wrong
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Greg Mason said management ``hemmed and hawed'' but
ultimately took the gamble.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine had already embarked on a redesign that made it
more business-oriented, providing tech information to people in
business, not just the systems geeks who were once its
bread-and-butter. Having done that, Mason said it no longer made
sense to call the magazine ``PC Computing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``PC-anything was so limiting,'' Mason said. Readers _ and media
buyers _ thought it was another hardware magazine. ``We could
become People magazine inside the covers, and no one would notice
as long as it was called `PC Computing.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
STICKING WITH THE STANDARD &QL; 
Jim Fallows is returning to his old stomping grounds at the
Atlantic Monthly, where he was Washington editor from 1979 to 1996.
He'll be a national correspondent writing from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But his new gig doesn't mean he'll be giving up his column at
San Francisco's Industry Standard. Is he keeping that column
because of the initial public offering said to be in the works for
the Standard?
</P>
<P>
   ``NO,'' he e-mailed, emphatically, ``I am not in the Standard's
options plan. I like the people who run the magazine; I admire what
they're doing with it; I like being able to address this audience;
and ... I have a contract with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The public offering looks increasingly likely, given the news
this week: the Standard received $30 million in venture funding,
led by Flatiron Partners and Chase Capital Partners. Flatiron and
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Venture Partners each placed an
executive on the Standard's board of directors, and Pearson PLC,
EuropAtWeb, J.&AMP; W. Seligman and Chase H&AMP;Q also contributed to the
financing.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard will use the money to expand its Web site as well
as its magazine and conference businesses in the U.S. and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MINOR POINTS &QL; 
In an interview earlier this month, Cnet CEO Halsey Minor let a few
opinions fly on reports that his company's $100 million ad campaign
was a bust because it had to hire a new ad agency and change the
nature of its ads.
</P>
<P>
   Minor said the changes were essential, given all the television
ads from other dot-coms blanketing the airwaves over the December
holidays. ``There was no way we could keep going with the kind of
clutter we were seeing,'' Minor said. ``What we did was smart. We
reacted. We had to break through with a simple, straightforward
message. It was very effective. Dumb companies keep doing what
they're doing in the face of a changing landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Cnet spent $60 million last year, and plans to spend another $40
million this year. He said the ads helped Cnet build its brand, but
he wouldn't have minded if they didn't work. ``No one would be
happier than me to discover that it didn't make a difference,''
Minor said. ``We were a profitable and fast-growing company
beforehand. If it didn't work, hey, no hard feelings. I would
cancel my $40 million ad budget this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he'll pay the money, but with the aim of driving
traffic to Cnet's site. ``Wall Street wants us to generate $25
million in operating income,'' Minor said. ``We'll go back to being
profitable.''

NEW STUDY LINKS HORMONES AND BREAST CANCER
</HEADLINE>
  (ADDS where study was being published in 2nd graf) 
 (rk) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A study of 46,355 women has confirmed earlier findings that
long-term use of hormone replacement after menopause can increase
the risk of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said the new study, done at the National Cancer
Institute, and published Wednesday in the Journal of the American
Medical Association, provided relevant information but still did
not resolve the dilemma faced by millions of women who are trying
to weigh the pros and cons of hormone replacement. Breast cancer is
just one of a panoply of serious conditions affected by the
hormones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always issues of competing risks,'' said Dr. Larry
Norton, head of the division of solid tumor oncology at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who was not involved in the study.
``Every individual has to balance benefit and risk. Individualizing
care is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Hormone replacement eases menopausal symptoms like hot flashes,
insomnia and vaginal dryness. It is known to prevent osteoporosis,
a serious weakening of the bones, and it is thought to protect
women against cardiovascular disease. Preliminary studies suggest
that it may also help prevent Alzheimer's disease, colon cancer and
macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness.
</P>
<P>
   The drawbacks of the treatment include an increased risk of
breast cancer and of blood clots, which can be life threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should not
use hormone replacement, Norton said. Those with a low risk of
breast cancer and a high risk of fractures from osteoporosis would
clearly benefit from the hormones, he said. But the decision is
rarely so clear cut.
</P>
<P>
   Most women taking hormone replacement take two hormones:
estrogen and progestin. The estrogen replaces what the body lacks
because the ovaries shut down at menopause, and provides the
treatment's benefits. But given alone, estrogen also increases the
risk of uterine cancer. Progestin counters that risk, which is why
the hormones are given in combination. The only women advised to
take estrogen alone are those who have had hysterectomies and
therefore do not have to worry about uterine cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies had found a small increased risk of breast
cancer among women taking estrogen and progestin, but the risk was
attributed largely to the estrogen. The new study suggests that
some of the risk is due to the progestin.
</P>
<P>
   The study included post-menopausal women from 29 breast cancer
screening centers who took hormone replacement treatment for some
period from 1980 to 1995. The researchers relied on the women's own
reports from memory of what hormones they had taken.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, led by Dr. Catherine Schairer, an
epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute, found that women
who took the hormone combination for five years had a 40 percent
increase in the risk of breast cancer, compared with those who did
not take the treatment. Women who took estrogen alone had a 20
percent increase. The risk increased with the duration of
treatment, but existed only for women who were current users of the
hormones or who had taken them during the past four years. The
study did not provide any information about death rates among the
women.
</P>
<P>
   The risks applied only to women of normal weight, and not those
who were overweight. The researchers were not sure why.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Schairer said one way to illustrate the increased risk is to
consider a group of 100,000 normal-weight women, aged 60 to 64,
none of whom take hormone replacement. During a five year period,
350 cases of breast cancer would be expected. But if all the women
took combined hormone replacement for five years, about 560 cases
would be expected.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Pac Bell Fighting PUC Fine  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pacific Bell has launched an all-out assault on a $44 million fine
levied last month for sleazy marketing practices.
<P>
   The telephone company has asked its army of 56,000 workers to
write state politicians protesting the fine, placed full-page ads
in major California newspapers, lobbied state legislators and
reached out to reporters following the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to scare the (Public Utilities Commission),''
said Charles Carbone, a consumer advocate with the Utility
Consumers Action Network in San Diego, which wants the fine boosted
to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a PUC administrative law judge fined the company $20
million and ordered Pacific Bell to spend an additional $24 million
on a consumer-education campaign because it misled customers into
buying extra services they didn't need.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC plans to consider motions to modify the fine as early as
March 2, but Pacific Bell is barred from lobbying commissioners
directly in their fifth-floor offices in San Francisco. So Carbone
said Pacific Bell instead is ``waging a fifth-floor full court
press ... in the media.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Pacific Bell says the judgment was riddled with
errors and it needs to do everything it can to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we are being unjustifiably and unfairly attacked,''
said Pacific Bell spokesman John Britton. ``We have a right and a
responsibility to defend ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Some PUC officials are uncomfortable with the indirect lobbying,
even though they concede it is allowed within the rules. ``We would
have preferred everything stay on the record'' within the formal
appeal process, said Lester Wong, an adviser to PUC President
Richard Bilas. ``It's hard to miss a full-page newspaper ad, but we
are trying to ignore it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell's latest offensive marks a sharp contrast to 1986,
when the company quickly agreed to pay a $16.5 million fine for
overly aggressive marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Pacific Bell executives say they have taken steps to
ensure that customers don't get services they don't want. Plus,
Pacific Bell says it clears all its promotions with the PUC. For
instance, Britton said, commissioners agreed to let the company
label a package of extra calling features ``the basics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so different from 1986,'' Britton says. ``We think (we
are now) the model for how other companies have to act.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, Pacific Bell sent letters to the vast
majority of its workers, urging them to write protest letters to
the state Assembly's Utilities and Commerce Committee. The
committee already has received as many as 100 letters from Pac Bell
workers, nearly all opposing the fine.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell also:
</P>
<P>
   _Lobbied key state legislators in person, including members of
the state Utilities and Commerce Committee. Technically, the state
Assembly doesn't have jurisdiction on the issue. But Carbone says
the PUC could be sensitive to political pressure. However, Carolyn
Veal-Hunter, chief consultant to the committee, said she thinks Pac
Bell is simply making a defensive move in case consumer groups
pressure the Legislature to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   _Gave reporters a sneak-peak at its appeal, filed Friday, a day
early. The move ensured that the news didn't get buried in the
weekend newspapers. And Pac Bell President Bill Blase personally
briefed reporters. Blase also submitted an opinion piece to The
Chronicle op ed page, which published it last week.
</P>
<P>
   _Placed full-page ads in five major newspapers around the state
on Friday, including The Chronicle, Los Angeles Times and
Sacramento Bee. The ads read: ``36 million customer calls. 15
complaints. Government fines? It doesn't add up.'' The ads point
out that consumer groups submitted just 15 complaints in their
initial filings. But customer service representatives say they
often receive angry calls from customers that are never formally
logged as complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``People hate Pacific Bell,'' said Antonio Dominion, a Pacific
Bell customer service agent 
ijn3f3f3f3f3fC_UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUn Alhambra, who says he was
pressured to sell businesses services they didn't need, like voice
mail and internal wiring plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do people file a complaint? They call the phone company,
they get me or my manager and we try to pacify them, and the
complaint goes nowhere,'' said Dominion, who is on leave from the
company. ``The only complaints (that become public) are the people
irate enough to call the PUC, and calling the PUC is like dealing
with the federal government. Most people don't have the time and
energy to go through that.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Prudential Shakes Up Management at Volpe  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Prudential Securities, plagued by an exodus of key employees at the
former Volpe Brown Whelan investment bank, which it bought last
month, has shaken up management of the San Francisco unit.
<P>
   James Feuille, head of investment banking operations, has taken
over day-to-day management of the unit, which is now known as
Prudential Volpe Technology Group, said Charles Perkins, Prudential
spokesman. Founder Thomas Volpe and partner Robert Whelan,
originally designated as the group's managers, will now concentrate
instead on setting long-term strategy and winning new business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, research chief Peter Rogers is now in charge of
supervising all Prudential technology analysts, not just those at
Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe's reorganization follows the defection of five of the
unit's 14 stock analysts, including star Internet analyst Charles
Finnie who left for a venture capital firm, and several investment
bankers and other professional staff members. All told, nearly 20
of Volpe's nearly 200 staff members have quit since Prudential took
over six weeks ago, company insiders said.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential bought Volpe, a boutique investment bank that focused
on technology clients, to boost its business in the booming public
stock offering and merger markets.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price, not originally disclosed, was roughly $180
million, including cash and participation in a venture capital
fund, people close to the firm said. If the venture's investments
rise sharply, the value of the transaction could climb higher, they
added.
</P>
<P>
   The departures were prompted in part by Prudential's swift moves
to cut jobs it deemed unessential. More than two dozen Volpe
traders got the ax when Prudential decided to fold the firm's stock
trading operations into its own. ``Those heavy-handed moves early
on didn't generate a sense of trust,'' said one former Volpe
employee who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many of the employees Prudential most wanted to
keep _ the analysts and investment banking dealmakers who drove
Volpe's business _ headed for the door.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is ``confused and tragic,`` largely because
Prudential ``adopted a brutal integration strategy,`` said Don
Putnam, managing director of Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola &AMP;
Thornton, a San Francisco investment bank that specializes in
brokerage and money-management firms.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest beneficiary of the turmoil at Volpe has been WR
Hambrecht &AMP; Co., a San Francisco Internet-based investment bank.
About 22 members of the Volpe trading group moved to Hambrecht,
joined by two analysts and an investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential spokesman Perkins described employee losses at Volpe
as ``slightly greater than expected.``
</P>
<P>
   ``In any acquisition, you expect a certain number of people to
move on,`` he said. ``We're moving rapidly to replace those
people.``
</P>
<P>
   Volpe insiders said the elevation of Feuille and Rogers, both of
whom are highly regarded, may have stabilized the situation. By
giving the two managers authority, Prudential has reinforced the
distinct identify of the unit and created a platform for
rebuilding, the insiders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done the right thing,'' said former Volpe electronic
commerce analyst Rich Petersen, who recently moved to rival
investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The mood at Coca-Cola headquarters was somber
Wednesday, according to several employees leaving the company's
gated compound here, and the reverberations of the job cuts were
being discussed throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees would not speak on the record to a dozen
reporters waiting outside the gates Wednesday afternoon. ``I still
have a job, and I want to keep it,'' one man said as he rushed past
the group.
</P>
<P>
   Another took a more upbeat view. ``It's an exciting day,'' said
Tim Jacobi, a 32-year-old marketing manager. ``We're slimming
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobi, who said he had not yet heard whether his job would
survive, said: ``I'm young. If they lay me off, I'll move on.'' But
he added: ``For a lot of people who are being laid off, it's a
terrible day. You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman, who also insisted on anonymity, wiped a tear from her
face as she left the office. ``These are people's lives,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a shock,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of the
Georgia Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University in
Atlanta. But he added, ``It's more the psychological rather than
the economic impact, which shouldn't be that large.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about 2,500 jobs. The state made 155,000 new
jobs this year. Even though they're higher-paid jobs, it won't be
difficult for the state to absorb the loss,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficulty, he said, may come for the middle management
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a lot of management structures like Coke,'' he
said. ``There aren't a lot of obvious openings in other parts of
the Atlanta area for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke has recently faced a racial discrimination lawsuit by a
group of black employees, and, no doubt concerned about its image
on racial matters, recently managed to retain its top-ranking black
executive, Carl H. Ware, after offering him a newly created
position. As for the layoffs, ``We are going to monitor this
carefully,'' said Cyrus Mehri, a lawyer for eight employees
involved in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts, which Coke called a ``realignment,'' will slash jobs
through early retirement, outsourcing and layoffs. Jobs to be
outsourced include those in information system support, payroll,
and compensation and benefits delivery, said Ben Deutsch, a company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees were first told Wednesday morning in individual
meetings whether their jobs would be cut, and others will hear
later of their fates in meetings that are expected to continue
through mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people will know where they stand by the middle of
February,'' Deutsch said.
</P>
<P>
   The concern about lost jobs went beyond individuals to the
community of Atlanta, especially the city's arts and educational
institutions, which have benefited from the charity of the company
and its workers.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thought the layoffs could hurt those
institutions, Shelton Stanfill, president of the city's Woodruff
Arts Center, home to the Atlanta Symphony, the High Museum of Art,
the Alliance Theater Company and the Atlanta College of Art, said:
``At this time I don't expect that it will. But that certainly is
not beyond the realm of possibility. My guess is that it will
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which is also the main sponsor of the Super Bowl
festivities in Atlanta this week, is the city's second-largest
corporate donor, giving $481,903 in 1999, behind BellSouth, at
$742,431, Stanfill said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's leadership in donating through the years ``has
just been enormous,'' he said. Not only the arts community, but
Emory University and Agnes Scott College have benefited from the
company's largesse, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the company's charities would be affected, Deutsch
said, ``I don't think what has happened today will have anything to
do with how we view our commitment to our community here in Atlanta
and communities all over the world where we operate.''

 Consolidated Freightways Posts Loss, CEO Retires  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Consolidated Freightways Corp., the third-largest U.S. long-haul
trucking company, reported a quarterly loss yesterday of $11.3
million.
<P>
   At the same time, the Menlo Park firm said its chief executive,
W. Roger Curry, is stepping down after 31 years with the company. A
search has begun for a permanent replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated has been traveling a rough road in recent months.
The company's fourth-quarter loss follows a nearly 50 percent drop
in net income in the previous quarter and profit declines in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``1999 was not a happy year for the company,'' said Mike Brown,
a Consolidated spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   For the entire year, the company's net income was $2.7 million
(12 cents a share), compared with earnings of more than $26 million
($1.16) a year before.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest quarter, Consolidated posted a loss of 52 cents a
share, compared with profit of 12 cents a year earlier. Wall Street
analysts had been expecting the firm to lose no more than 45 cents
a share.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated's stock slid 19 cents to close yesterday at $7,
well off its 52-week high of $18.19.
</P>
<P>
   The company blamed its bumpy ride on costs related to
implementation of a service improvement program, as well as efforts
to switch to a new computer system and a ``disappointing'' software
development initiative.
</P>
<P>
   With Consolidated's average shipment weighing in at 1,000
pounds, this isn't a company that has prospered from the e-commerce
boom in the way that, say, UPS has positioned itself as a mainstay
for shipments from the likes of Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Brown insisted that Consolidated sees itself as a
suitably cyber-savvy entity. He expects the company to play an
increasing role in business-to-business Internet transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely becoming an e-commerce player,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To get there, though, he admitted that Consolidated will have to
invest more in service and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our 1999 results are indicative of the substantial investments
we are making in our future,'' the company's president, Patrick
Blake, said in a statement. ``We expect to see the payoffs this
year and beyond. The benefits of our investment in service
excellence are already being seen and we are confident our service
will continue to improve this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said it would be ``a stretch'' to connect Consolidated's
weak financial performance with Curry's decision to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in the hot seat as CEO for 25 years,'' he said. ``He
chose to retire this year.'' Curry is 61.
</P>
<P>
   G. Robert Evans, 68, a company director, was named interim CEO
and vice chairman until Curry's successor could be found.

 &HT;    Vermeil was serious about Falcons
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It wouldn't be accurate to say Rams coach Dick Vermeil
was nearly coach of the Falcons, but he gave it ``serious'' thought
after the 1986 season.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta had just fired Dan Henning after a 7-8-1 season wrapped
up his four year-run at 22-41-1, and team officials contacted
Vermeil, who had resigned from the Eagles after the '82 season.
</P>
<P>
   He was out of coaching for 14 years before taking over the Rams
in '97, but never far from getting back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without sounding arrogant or cocky, there was only one or two
years within those 14 years that somebody from some organization
didn't contact me,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got very serious for one week ... with the Atlanta Falcons
because I respected those people ... (late founder) Rankin Smith
and the sons, and many of my Eagles coaches were down there. I
didn't meet with them, though.''
</P>
<P>
   PRACTICE REPORT
</P>
<P>
   The Rams had as good an afternoon as some 70 grown men can have
while turning blue.
</P>
<P>
   Other than starting right defensive end Grant Wistrom, who
bruised a shoulder in the Rams' victory Jan. 16 over the Vikings,
and rookie wide receiver Torry Holt, who bruised a shoulder in
their 11-6 win over the Bucs last Sunday, everybody practiced.
</P>
<P>
   They'll both play Sunday, ``unless they're frozen,'' Vermeil
said, although Holt is not especially well off.
</P>
<P>
   Kicker Jeff Wilkins (patella tendinitis in his left knee), Holt
and Wistrom all are probable on the injury list.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil said Wilkins is his man, although soreness in his left
knee makes it hard to plant for kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the decision is made,'' Vermeil said. ``He is going
to have to make me make a different decision (which likely would
force the signing of retired kicker Nick Lowery).''
</P>
<P>
   COLD-WEATHER TACTICS
</P>
<P>
   Rams equipment manager Todd Hewitt, whose father, Don, retired
as the team's longtime equipment manager in '96, brought nearly
five tons of cold-weather gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``(His father) always told me, it's better to have it and not
need it than need it and not have it,'' Hewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides leg warmers, wool caps, thermal long johns, gloves and
various warmers, the Rams also rented six hot air blowers.
Linebacker Todd Collins held his helmet in front of a blower before
practice, heating up the pads inside.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Roland Williams and reserve guard Cameron Spikes wore
shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil wants to practice today in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   GREATNESS DELAYED
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons the Rams went from 4-12 to 15-3 is that
recent first-round draft choices, like defensive end Kevin Carter,
tackle Orlando Pace and Holt have worked out so well. But another,
Wistrom, didn't look last season as if he was on track.
</P>
<P>
   As the sixth overall pick of the draft, the Rams expected big
things from the undersized (6-foot-4, 267 pounds) Wistrom. But in
13 games, with no starts, he played mostly on passing downs and had
30 total tackles and three sacks.
</P>
<P>
   As a starter this year, he got better fast. Wistrom led Rams
defensive linemen with 60 tackles, and added 6.5 sacks, and 35
quarterback pressures.
</P>
<P>
   He also returned two interceptions for scores, outrunning
Falcons wide receiver Chris Calloway for a 91-yard score, and going
40 yards against the Bears. Wistrom added a 31-yard fumble return,
not for a score, against the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a nightmare,'' he said. ``Combine (all his
problems) with the losing, and when I did get on the field I didn't
do very well. I wasn't used to that.''
</P>
<P>
   LEGEND CONFIRMED
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis co-defensive coordinator and linebackers coach John
Bunting, who played under Vermeil for the Eagles, verified that it
was him driving around Veterans Stadium one cold day in 1978 _ in
little more than a jockstrap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he (Bunting) had a leather helmet on, too. A leather
helmet, a jockstrap and some tennis shoes,'' Bunting said. ``I
wanted to loosen up the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the team was so tight so I grabbed a golf cart, came
smoking down the ramp about 35 miles an hour ... circled Veterans
Stadium, waved to everybody, gave them a little bare look and went
back in the locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   VERMEIL TO VANISH?
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that Vermeil, 63, will retire if the Rams lose can't
be quashed. St. Louis cornerback Todd Lyght admits such thoughts
are in the back of players' minds, although Vermeil said he's not
addressing the question this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll be back next year,'' Lyght said. ``But if he
decides to retire, it would be a great way for him to end his
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Mike Martz had his contract reworked two
weeks ago to say he would succeed Vermeil.
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG TURNAROUND
</P>
<P>
   Bunting has seen the much-publicized change in his boss.
</P>
<P>
   But he said it's not as distinct as people think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick has never been relaxed. You have to use that term
loosely,'' Bunting said. ``But thankfully for (Vermeil's wife)
Carol, he has relaxed some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year (when the Rams were 4-12) was miserable. I didn't
see the light. But he said, `We're going to turn this around.' He
changed. Meetings were over and done with. Training camp got over
quicker. We added some pieces, made some addition by subtraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bunting didn't expect to end up in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``(If somebody said that before the season) I would have said,
`Give me some of that stuff he's smoking.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Vermeil is not exactly peaceful. She had voodoo dolls of
the Bucs, including defensive tackle Warren Sapp, in her suite
during last Sunday's NFC Championship Game against the Bucs. She
asked visitors to stick pins in them.

<TEXT>
<P>
   URUS-MARTAN, Russia _ Russian troops kept their distance as a
ragged band of Chechens strolled through the center of this
desolate Chechen town on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Chechens were decked out in dark blue coats. Some
had no uniforms. But all were with well-armed, including one
unshaven man who paraded the main square with a rocket-propelled
grenade launcher slung over each shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Urus-Martan is the only town in the Russian-controlled swath of
Chechnya that is policed by a Chechen militia, a motley group of
locals and former separatists ostensibly allied with Moscow. That
has made Urus-Martan a test case in Russia's efforts to pacify the
Chechen heartland.
</P>
<P>
   But these days the mood in the town is uneasy. Many residents
bitterly resent the Russians, who they say mercilessly bombarded
their settlement into submission for two days after the rebels had
left town. The Russians forces, for their part, do not fully trust
their Chechen partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably half of them fought against us in the last war,''
said a Russian policeman from Orenburg, a city in Russia's Ural
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled at the foot of the snow-capped Caucasian mountains,
Urus-Martan is one of Chechnya's most important towns. And after
the first Chechen war it has also been a haven for kidnappers,
Russian officials say. And for all Russia's promises to restore
Chechnya, however, life in Urus-Martan seems almost medieval.
</P>
<P>
   Gas and electricity are just a memory. Pensions have not been
paid. ``Bomb Shelter'' is scrawled on the wall of a local school,
which has yet to re-open. Hundreds of trees and even prized
orchards have been cut down for firewood.
</P>
<P>
   Urus-Martan was occupied by Islamic militants until December,
and the Russian capture of the town is still a sore point with many
townspeople. After fighting their way into the Chechen lowlands in
October, Russian troops advanced on the town.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the residents fled to avoid the fighting. The militants
left the town on Dec. 6. The Russian shelling, however, went on for
several more days, damaging homes and blasting a wing of the local
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shirvani N. Gadayev, 58, the deputy chief of the hospital,
provided several statistics that never turn up in the Russian
military's situation reports: the number of civilians killed and
wounded as a result of the Russian barrage.
</P>
<P>
   Gadayev said his hospital had received 362 wounded, virtually
all civilians, between mid-October and mid-December. Thirty-three
corpses were also taken to the medical center, wounded who died on
their way to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital itself is no longer operating, largely because
there is no fuel for its generators. ``We could find an oil truck
and bring in the fuel, but as soon as a gas truck reached the
Russian checkpoint the Russian soldiers would confiscate it,'' said
Vakha Elsnukayev, 47, director of hospital supplies. ``The
Russians' troops demand that we show them lots of documents and
then confiscate everything.''
</P>
<P>
   While life is hard, Urus-Martan is noted for its unique system
of keeping the peace. Russian soldiers occupy checkpoints on the
city's outskirts, and Russian police officers still patrol the
town. The Russian plan is to turn over increasing authority to the
Chechen militia so it can maintain order in its own house.
</P>
<P>
   That may turn out to be difficult since the militia says that
only parts of the town have been thoroughly checked for arms and
rebels, some of whom may be hiding in the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Some young men from the town who joined the militants are still
fighting in the mountains. A town official said that many of these
rebels did not trust the Russian promise of amnesty and were
reluctant to turn themselves in. Negotiations to establish a
corridor for them to come back are quietly underway.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen militia is not the most exemplary force in the
Caucasus. It reports to Bislan Gantamirov, the former Grozny mayor
who was imprisoned for embezzlement and then set free by the
Russians so he could fight on their side in the Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   Still, residents said that life might be even more difficult if
it was not for the Chechen militia, which functions as a buffer
between the Russians and the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people support them,'' said Lyoma Elsnukayev, a
50-year-old driver. ``If they were not here the Russian troops
would steal everything and be completely out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Local authorities say life in the town is relatively quiet. By
Chechen standards that means there is shooting virtually ever night
on the city outskirts and bodies occasionally turn up in the
streets, said Major Yuri Gurynov, a Russian criminologist.
</P>
<P>
   A dusk-to-dawn curfew has been imposed. The Russian soldiers who
enforce it seem to shoot first and ask questions later. The Russian
military commandant of the city was recently wounded when he
ventured out after dark with his bodyguards to inspect the
outposts.
</P>
<P>
   Georgy Muslimov, 37, commander of the local militia, works out
of a dank headquarters, which doubles as a prison. His militia has
already arrested six residents and has its eye on dozens more, he
said. His men, he said, investigate crimes and carry out passport
checks. With Russian troops and Chechen militiamen roaming, there
are few petty crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always the possibility that the militants might
return,'' he said. But ``we don't have car thefts or apartment
break-ins. The situation could not be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces, of course, see it differently. They suspect the
militia includes former militants, who may turn on their Russian
masters yet again. ``As soon as we pull out things will go back to
the way they were,'' a Russian militiaman said.

GORE WINNING BIG BENEFITS FROM PRESIDENT'S BACKING
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Iowa)   (See also GORE, GORE-NY) 
(nk) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore has not invited his boss, Bill Clinton, to
come out and stump with him, but back at the White House, Clinton
is taking every chance he can to plug the candidacy of his vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of Gore's staff and the irritation of both Bill
Bradley and the Republicans, Clinton has, day after day, announced
policies that dovetail with Gore's campaign effort _ and Clinton
usually says Gore is the brains behind them, maybe even the brains
behind the White House generally.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we took office together, the fact that I was challenged
scientifically and technologically was a standing joke,'' Clinton
said at Caltech last week as he announced more financing for
scientific research, an area Gore has scoped out as his own. ``And
he wants all of you to know that he's campaigning all over the
country with a Palm VII on his hip.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential announcements, politically helpful to Gore,
range from the prosaic to the sweeping.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week before the New Hampshire primary, Clinton
announced emergency subsidies for low-income families to pay
heating bills in about a dozen states _ including $5.4 million for
New Hampshire. The release of such financing is a presidential
ritual but the timing was opportune for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   With just days to go before the recent Iowa caucuses, Clinton
proposed a plan to enable parents to enroll in the same health
plans as their children. The president said he had borrowed the
idea from Gore, who had proposed it as part of his counter to
Bradley's more sweeping health care proposal.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Clinton will give Gore another big push when,
White House aides say, the president will single out Gore in his
final State of the Union address and, with the vice president a few
feet behind him, lay out an agenda that will coincide markedly with
that of the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first sections of the speech will address education _
proposals for significant expansions in after-school sessions and
Head Start, as well as higher pay for teachers. The initiatives
mirror those issued by the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the rival campaign of Bradley, there is grumbling about the
White House's blatant backing of Gore. Republicans, as well,
consider the real Gore campaign headquarters to be located not at
2410 Charlotte Avenue in Nashville, but at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has made abundantly clear that the political
power of the White House is behind the vice president,'' said Eric
Hauser, a spokesman for the Bradley campaign. With nothing to do
about it, Bradley aides try to use the alliance as one of the
entrenched powers their candidate is fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Gore backers in and out of the White House say of course there
is coordination between Clinton and Gore. The two men talk
frequently. Many of their aides have dual allegiances. But much of
the overlap in policy is just that. These are two men who have
worked closely together for seven years and, in most areas, agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``His people have always played a role in policy meetings,''
said one Clinton aide said of Gore. ``That's equally true this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton credits Gore in some of his announcements, like his
preview last week of his health care plan. ``I thank the vice
president for this proposal,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, the White House seems to run interference for
Gore, helping him avoid sticky situations. The administration, for
instance, has delayed implementing the provision of Nafta that
allows Mexican trucks into this country, a decision that delighted
the Teamsters union at a time when Gore is seeking its endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, aides to Bradley also complain that the
White House has delayed issuing a ruling to allow California to
sidestep a federal regulation requiring that its gasoline contain
ethanol. The ruling could have riled famers in Iowa, where the
corn-based fuel is popular, so Bradley backers contend the Gore
campaign made sure it comes after the caucuses there. The
Environmental Protection Agency, for its part, has said the
campaign is not a factor in its decision making.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, the apparatus of government is keeping one eye
on the campaign. Aides to Gore met with cabinet officials in the
fall to coordinate their work with that of the campaign. Housing
Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson are
among the Clinton aides who have campaigned for Gore in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   A lower-level member of the administration, Janice Lachance,
campaigned for Gore at an inopportune time. Ms. Lachance is
director of the Office of Personnel Management and responsible for
closing the federal government in inclement weather. She was in
Iowa when a blizzard hit Washington, prompting criticism from the
Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers are treading carefully as they seek to snuff out
Gore's image as an understudy to an impeached president while
simultaneously taking advantage of the benefits of the vice
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Policy breaks with the White House help send the message that he
is his own man, advisers say, while attaching himself to popular
White House proposals shows he would continue a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters this week that he had not even seen
Clinton's State of the Union speech yet, after having helped draft
it for the last seven years. But his aides were working behind the
scenes to maximize the vice president's advantage. Wednesday, as
the president staged a rehearsal of his speech in the White House
theater, Gore's chief of staff, Charles Burson, was watching from
the audience. He had a draft.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, continues backing his No. 2. The two men are
on good terms, aides say, having put behind them the impeachment
matter and a spat over whether Gore was distancing himself from
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Since no invitation to join Gore has been extended, the
president has been going it alone. He has been busy raising money
for the Democratic National Committee, funds that will be essential
to the eventual Democratic presidential nominee. And he talks up
his running mate every chance he gets.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent incident suggests that even lame duck presidents
who hope their running mates succeed them have egos.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter suggested at a briefing that Gore might be
running the White House, rather than Clinton, White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart made clear that no such succession had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, the president puts forward his ideas. It'll be his
budget, his State of the Union,'' Lockhart said, making clear who
was boss.

CHINA LISTS CONTROLS TO RESTRICT THE USE OF E-MAIL AND WEB 
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The Chinese government issued stern new regulations
Wednesday intended to control the release of information on the
Internet, underscoring the government's love-hate relationship with
cyberspace in a country where the number of Internet users is
growing dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations, which were published in Wednesday's edition
of the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily, specifically
govern the posting and dissemination on the Internet of ``state
secrets'' _ a vaguely defined term that has been applied by the
Chinese government to cover any information whose release it has
not sanctioned.
</P>
<P>
   The new pronouncement may have little practical impact, because
much of what is formally forbidden under the new rules was already
illegal. Enforcement will be difficult in a country now brimming
with Internet cafes and free e-mail services. And government
officials will be cautious about dampening an industry whose
exuberant growth has been a magnet for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, people here say the regulations serve mostly as
a very loud warning that could have some inhibiting effect on the
lively discussions that now criss-cross China via e-mail and
through postings in chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the regulations illustrate the Chinese government's
resolve to tame if not totally control the unwieldy beast that is
the Internet, which has rapidly become a means for Chinese to
bypass the state-controlled media to obtain and transmit
information.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations directly apply for the first time China's
state secrets law to the web, including chat rooms and personal
e-mails. For example, the use of e-mail to transmit what might be
regarded as secret information is expressly forbidden. Chat rooms
must screen their content. And Internet sites are required to
submit to ``examination and approval by the appropriate secrecy
work offices,'' although the rules do not specify what that
procedure involves.
</P>
<P>
   A basic principal of the new ``Computer Information Systems
Internet Secrecy Administrative Regulations'' is that ``Whoever
puts it on the Internet assumes responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any information provided to or issued on Internet web sites
must obtain the inspection and approval of secrecy censorship,''
the regulations state.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the Internet has emerged as an effective
propaganda tool of the Chinese government, but also as a potent
method for organizing and publicizing popular discontent.
</P>
<P>
   It has been used by overseas dissidents to communicate with
kindred spirits in China and by the banned Falun Gong spiritual
movement to organize protests. Last week, a group of disgruntled
farmers in a small village in Anhui province in central China even
turned to the Internet and e-mail to successfully expose a corrupt
local Communist Party chief.
</P>
<P>
   Computer technician Lin Hai, 30, was sentenced to two years
imprisonment in January last year for providing 30,000 Chinese
e-mail addresses to Chinese dissidents abroad.
</P>
<P>
   There are now nearly 9 million Internet users in China, up from
just 2 million a year ago, according to a survey by the
government's China Internet Information Center. But some feel the 9
million figure is too low; the same center also found that there
are 35.6 million e-mail accounts in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, government officials had repeatedly said that
they planned to issue new regulations to further control both the
content of and the financial arrangements behind the Chinese
Internet. Wednesday's regulations are the first, but probably not
the last, effort to spell out what that control might entail.
</P>
<P>
   Another law, adopted quietly last fall, requires all those who
use encryption software to register with the government by next
Monday. The software encodes e-mail messages so that they can not
be read by anyone but the intended recipient.
</P>
<P>
   Financial regulations will follow soon, officials say, which are
expected to restrict in some way foreign investment in the Chinese
Internet. The government plans to require all Internet companies
based in China to obtain government approval before going public in
foreign markets, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations were issued by the State Secrecy Bureau, a
little-known central government agency with both national and local
branches.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Internet users and Internet companies alike have been
aware all along that they risked arrest if they used to Internet to
spread sensitive information. Still, some have taken advantage of
the relative anonymity of the Internet to speak out against
government policy.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the government has occasionally arrested
people for posting illegal information on the web. This has
included members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement who
posted pictures of Falun Gong followers who had purportedly been
tortured by the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think it will have a big effect,'' said Guo Liang,
who studies the Internet at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
``People already know that you couldn't use the Internet to reveal
state secrets or do things that are illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, provisional regulations have been circulating since early
1998, according to the web site of the local Secrecy Bureau in
Lianyungang, a small city in coastal Jiangsu province.
</P>
<P>
   Although two years ago some Chinese web sites carried news items
culled from foreign news wire services, today Chinese commercial
web sites use only items from the official state media or avoid
political news altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``These regulations will not have much of an effect on us now
since we already conform to these kind of requirements,'' said Paul
Jin, deputy executive general manager at Sina.com, one of China's
most popular web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Sina.com, like most Chinese web sites, screens entries into its
chat rooms to make sure they are appropriate and not ``offensive to
the government.''

GRANDMOTHERS SEE BOY UNDER GUARD IN MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Six-year-old Elian Gonzalez was brought together with
his grandmothers for two hours Wednesday under the protection of
hundreds of police officers and armed agents representing the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, which ordered the
extraordinary meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Though the emotional encounter did not resolve the issue of
whether Elian will return to Cuba, it was the latest dramatic
episode in an international custody battle that has raged since
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The INS decided to step in after the grandmothers flew to Miami
Monday, only to return to Washington when Elian's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, insisted that the meeting take place at his home
in Little Havana. Elian has lived there since he was found clinging
to an inner tube off the Miami coastline, one of three survivors of
an ill-fated effort to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place at the large Miami Beach home of Sister
Jeanne O'Laughlin, a Dominican nun who is president of Barry
University and was chosen by the INS to serve as an intermediary.
Shortly after the meeting concluded at 7 p.m., the two
grandmothers, Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana de Gonzalez,
left the compound with their arms around O'Laughlin.
</P>
<P>
   The two woman were then driven to the airport without speaking
to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they saw him, it was like they saw God,'' said Sister
Leonor Esnard, a Cuban-American nun who participated in the
meeting. The grandmothers ``were elated, and they picked him up and
just hugged him, and they were shaking a little bit,'' she said.
``They were just hugging him and kissing him and saying that they
were so glad to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin said: ``There were no accusations or promises or
trying to define the future. There were only moments of tearful
weeping for what might have been and what was not to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the meeting, Elian was driven back to his
great-uncle's house, where he emulated his relatives by flashing
the V-for-victory sign to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez, the boy's 21-year-old cousin, suggested
that Elian had little reaction when he first saw his grandmothers.
``He just stood there and waited for them to come and hug him,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting is unlikely to resolve the ongoing battle for Elian,
which is now playing out in federal court. The grandmothers and the
Miami relatives apparently had little contact with each other, even
on the grounds of the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives, accused
one of the women of trying to sneak a cellular phone into the
meeting, in violation of the ground rules set by the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to fears expressed by the grandmothers for their
safety, the house was surrounded by Miami police officers and
plainclothes INS agents. Police boats patrolled behind the house in
a body of water known as Indian Creek, warning off any boats that
attempted to approached the residence.
</P>
<P>
   Local television stations carried the event live, from the
moment Elian left his great-uncle's home in the back of a dark
green Lexus. Dressed in blue slacks and a plaid shirt, he sat
between Marisleysis Gonzalez and his great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
   News helicopters followed the car as it made its way through
freeway traffic, crossed the causeway into Miami Beach, and turned
past the sliding iron gate that led to the large Spanish-style
home.
</P>
<P>
   As Elian was met outside the home by O'Laughlin, the two
grandmothers were preparing to board a helicopter at the Opa-Locka
Executive Airport. The helicopter transported them to a Miami Beach
hospital, where they were picked up and driven to the compound,
arriving nearly an hour after their grandson.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the house were perhaps 200 people, most of them
members of the Cuban exile community. Unlike the anticipated
meeting Monday, when hundreds of people stood with carnations and
signs welcoming the grandmothers, the crowd Wednesday was more
hostile, its anger directed at the INS, the Clinton administration,
and Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours before the meeting, as a small crowd chanted in
Spanish, ``Let him stay!, Let him stay!'' a rollerblader passed and
shouted, ``Send him back!'' Part of the crowd broke off and began
to chase the man, who was nearly overtaken before a police officer
intervened. The man skated off unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the crowd said they feared that the meeting was a
ploy to allow the INS and the grandmothers to take Elian back to
Cuba. One person carried a sign reading, ``We Hope This Isn't a
Judas Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Justice Department spokeswoman said the grandmothers had
been told that the meeting was only a chance for them to see their
grandson and not an opportunity to reclaim him. ``Obviously, they
weren't happy about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Delia Martinez, who described herself as a 75-year-old
grandmother of three, stood outside the barricades holding a spray
of flowers. ``If it were me, I would stay here and be with my
grandchild,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez argued that Elian's grandmothers had no right to demand
the boy's return. ``If the mother died trying to bring her child
here to the United States, they have to respect that,'' she said.
``I just think it's very bad that this mother does not respect her
daughter's wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Senate, which was preparing to begin debate
on a bill to grant citizenship to Elian, put off consideration of
the measure until at least next week. Senator Connie Mack, the
Florida Republican who introduced the bill, said Washington's
snowstorm, not a change of heart by the GOP leadership, was
responsible for the delay.
</P>
<P>
   But as members of both parties returned from the long recess,
some privately expressed reservations to their leaders about the
wisdom and political implications not only of taking an action that
is extremely unusual but also of forcing a vote on an issue pushed
by the Cuban-American lobby but not popular with the larger public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The members are coming back and burning the leaders' ears on
this: `What have you committed us to doing?' '' said a Senate aide
who tracks immigration issues.
</P>
<P>
   In the effort to sway public opinion, some of Elian's Miami
relatives said the family will appeal any court ruling that
supports the INS decision to return Elian to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Georgina Cid, a cousin of Elian's father, also said the boy
fears for his future and is receiving psychological counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The psychologist, whom she refused to name, asked Elian to draw
pictures of his homes in Cuba and Miami, Cid said. The Miami house
he drew was white, big, and had no bars at the windows. The Cuban
house he drew was smaller, gray, and had barred windows, Cid said.

PILOT OF JET THAT CRASHED HAD TROUBLE SEEING AIRPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ The captain of an American Airlines jetliner
that crashed here on the night of last June 1 was trying a visual
approach to an airport he could not see, according to a transcript
of the plane's cockpit voice recording.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the runway where the plane touched down was apparently
being buffeted by higher crosswinds than the airline's rules allow
for landing, according to other data made public here Wednesday by
the National Transportation Safety Board as it opened several days
of hearings into the cause of the crash, which killed the captain
and 10 other people among the 145 on board.
</P>
<P>
   The captain, Richard W. Buschmann, one of the airline's chief
pilots, brought the plane in 20 knots faster than usual, to cut the
risk from wind shear. But after touchdown the MD-82 jetliner
skidded, swung around nearly backward and shot back off the other
end of the 7,200-foot runway at nearly 100 mph. It hit an antenna
tower and broke open.
</P>
<P>
   The transcript of the cockpit recording shows that as the plane
approached, the captain said, ``I hate droning around visual at
night in weather without . . . some clue where I am.'' A few
minutes closer to touchdown, as the plane rolled and bounced
through the air with the approach of a thunderstorm, he said,
``This is a can of worms.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of the crew, wanting to land before the arrival of
the storm, hurriedly tried to line the plane up with the runway.
One late complication was their decision that because of rapidly
shifting winds, they would land with a heading to the northeast
instead of the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   The co-pilot, Michael Origel, testified on Wednesday that he had
told Buschmann that the plane should ``go around'' for another
attempt, because it appeared ``way off'' to the side of the runway,
which was less than 500 feet below. But the captain corrected
course and, the co-pilot testified, may never have heard him.
</P>
<P>
   Origel testified that in its haste the crew had never caught up
with all preparations for landing, and data released by the board
indicates that three separate systems for stopping the plane were
either forgotten or misused.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the crewmen apparently failed to arm an automatic
system that would have raised spoilers on the tops of the wings to
reduce lift on touchdown and put more weight on the wheels, giving
the brakes more grab. Second, they did not turn on the automatic
braking system before landing and waited 11 seconds after touchdown
to apply the brakes. And third, they applied the thrust reversers
harder than the system is designed for; that step may have slowed
the plane, but the backward-rushing air destroyed the effectiveness
of the rudder as a tool to keep the nose pointed down the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Origel also testified that at one point he began taking out his
rule book to check on the maximum allowable crosswind for wet
runways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did get the book out, but Rick signaled me to put it away,''
he said of Buschmann.

STRETCHING CLASSICAL TRAINING TO FIT THE NEW STYLES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Daniel Gesmer writes about dance from Boulder, Colo., and is
working on a book about Vaslav Nijinsky.  
 By DANIEL GESMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ At a time when few regional ballets can take the
financial and critical risk of visiting New York even once,
Colorado Ballet is back for the third time in less than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver-based company, which made one-night stands at
Brooklyn College's Whitman Hall in 1993 and 1998, returns Tuesday
night for a week at the Joyce Theater, marking its Manhattan debut
with three works: Sir Frederick Ashton's ``Facade'' and the New
York premieres of Peter Pucci's ``Picture of Sedalia'' and Stanton
Welch's ``Of Blessed Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to Denver in 1987, Martin Fredmann, who was the
artistic director of the Tampa Ballet in Florida and had been one
of the first Americans to study at the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad,
has forged a disparately trained conglomerate into a stylistically
cohesive ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Of their 1993 Brooklyn performance, The Times's dance critic
Anna Kisselgoff wrote that the company's ``strong suit lies in the
surprising maturity, presence and solid technique of its
performers.'' Today, Colorado Ballet has 30 dancers, ages 18 to 47,
from the United States, Asia, Australia and the former Soviet
Union. Twenty-three of them will make the trip to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a company on the cusp of being among the nation's finest,
approaching the level of the Miami and Pacific Northwest
companies,'' said Clive Barnes, the theater and dance critic for
The New York Post and chairman of the Dance magazine panel that
last year honored Fredmann for his achievement. ``Fredmann has gone
to great pains to build up an interesting repertory.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's repertory ranges from Petipa and Bournonville to
Fokine, Nijinsky, Ailey and Choo-San Goh, with eight Balanchine
works and a strong rotation of classic story ballets. Its 1998
staging of Martha Graham's ``Appalachian Spring'' coincided with
the establishment of the Graham Trust, a formal mechanism for
licensing the modern-dance pioneer's works to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   No American ballet troupe had ever performed a Graham work;
Colorado Ballet's classically trained dancers went through a
painful crash course in Graham technique to deliver remarkably
authentic and widely acclaimed performances of the landmark 1944
dance.
</P>
<P>
   With Eugene Loring's ``Billy the Kid'' and Agnes de Mille's
``Rodeo,'' produced in 1994 and 1999 respectively, Colorado Ballet
is now the only company performing all three ballets with scores by
Aaron Copland. Balanchine's ``Western Symphony,'' staged in 1997,
rounds out a set of works concerned with the American frontier, an
ideal match for a company with headquarters at the foot of the
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Joyce Theater program highlights this pattern of
progressive singularity. None of the three works are currently in
the repertory of any other troupe, and ``Facade'' has not been seen
in Manhattan for roughly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picture of Sedalia,'' the program's opening number, is Pucci's
second creation for the company. Set to violin renditions of music
written by Scott Joplin, who played ragtime for several years at
the Maple Leaf Club in Sedalia, Mo., it offers snapshots of
American life at the end of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The choreographer, a nine-year veteran of Pilobolus Dance
Theater and, like Fredmann, a native of Baltimore, had his first
commission from Colorado Ballet in 1996 when he created ``Size Nine
Spirit,'' a suite of swing-infused dances to Benny Goodman's music.
</P>
<P>
   Pucci's gritty work is juxtaposed with the evening's
neo-Classical centerpiece, Stanton Welch's first major ballet, ``Of
Blessed Memory,'' an abstract, intensely romantic exploration of
youth, motherhood and the transition families endure when children
grow up and leave home.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, who is 30, has already created more than a dozen works
for troupes around the world. He is the resident choreographer with
the Australian Ballet and the son of Marilyn Jones and Garth Welch,
who were prominent dancers with that company; Ms. Jones directed it
when Fredmann taught there in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Set to selections from ``Songs of Auvergne,'' the best-known of
Josef Canteloube's classical arrangements of French regional folk
songs, ``Of Blessed Memory'' is a tribute to Ms. Jones, who starred
in the work's 1991 Australian premiere and traveled to Denver to
stage it for Colorado Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welch's ballet is a beautiful showcase for my company's
classical range, with bravura work for the men and stunning
sensuality for the women,'' said Fredmann. ``Speed, technique and
musicality are not enough to make boys and girls look like men and
women. Our diversity gives us depth, dramatic nuance, and a
worldly, sophisticated, mature look.''
</P>
<P>
   Concluding the Joyce program, ``Facade,'' a lighthearted,
sophisticated homage to British popular culture that is one of
Ashton's earliest and most popular works, shows off the Colorado
Ballet dancers' comic skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go back to the original source as much as possible,'' said
Fredmann, who had ``Facade'' coached by Alexander Grant, the famed
Royal Ballet character dancer who created many starring roles for
Ashton starting in the mid-1940s. ``I want my dancers to learn not
just the steps but the history of the steps, what made them happen
at the moment of creation. Otherwise, the end result can be naive
and colorless.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ashton choreographed the charming romp in 1931, at 27, after
hearing William Walton's musical potpourri accompanying Edith
Sitwell, the composer's patron, as she recited her playful poem
cycle of the same name. The spare set shows the facade of a
Victorian house, but the title also alludes to the pretentious
identities affected in the waltz, tango, polka and other social
dances lovingly satirized in nine vignettes.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Ballet's ambition for national stature rises from
humble beginnings. When Fredmann took over the company, started in
1961 by Lillian Covillo and Freidann Parker, its annual budget was
just $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   Denver is now among the nation's fastest-growing cities, and
major sponsors including Oppenheimer Funds, Texaco and Health One
have expanded Colorado Ballet's budget to $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very heady time,'' said Fredmann, who once struggled to
fill seats. ``Something is very right here in Denver, and in the
whole state of Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   The midsize company has everything it needs for continued
growth: spacious studios in downtown Denver, two blocks from the
historic state capital; a school, the Academy of Colorado Ballet;
and a three-year-old junior company, Colorado Ballet II, readying
upper-level students and apprentices for potential stage careers.
</P>
<P>
   A contingent of Soviet-born and trained dancers helps Fredmann
instill a consistent classical style, while the year-old Dance Lab
serves as a forum for experimental choreography, a performance
outlet for retiring dancers and a rehabilitation camp for injured
company members.
</P>
<P>
   Fredmann's agreement with the Graham Trust promises two more
Graham works by 2003, and he longs to stage ballets by Jiri Kylian,
John Neumeier, Roland Petit, Glen Tetley and Antony Tudor. He is
eager to work with young talents like Welch and Christopher
Wheeldon, the New York City Ballet soloist and Boston Ballet's new
resident choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago Colorado Ballet presented Wheeldon's ``Midsummer
Night's Dream,'' his first evening-length work and his first
production with full professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christopher's aptitude was immediately evident,'' said
Fredmann, who suggested the Shakespeare theme. ``There's a real
shortage of talented new choreographers. I'm always looking for
gifted young people; it's a lucky company that can discover one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Performing at the Joyce is a chance for other choreographers
to see us and step up to work with us,'' he continued. ``And
exposure in Manhattan is the ultimate for any American company. It
gives my dancers new things to strive for and makes them push even
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the mother in Welch's ``Of Blessed Memory,'' Colorado
Ballet's director has earned the joy of watching the growth he has
nurtured. As his company ventures into new territory, he risks both
pride of accomplishment and heartache should it stumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived all over the world, and I loathe provincialism,''
said Fredmann, who will be 57 on Wednesday and was for years a
journeyman dancer, teacher, director and choreographer throughout
the United States, Europe and Asia. He still spends one month each
summer teaching in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long performing career with a great company would have been
nice, but my travels have given me a broad viewpoint,'' he said.
``I think I've translated that into a unique cosmopolitan polish
for my company. Now the New York audiences and critics will give us
their opinion.''

RUSSIA-CHECHNYA-VILLAGE -- On a break from looking after relatives,
several Chechen women stand in the blown-out doorway of the local

in October, Russian troops advanced on Urus-Martan. Most of the

campaigns at the subway exit on Lexington Avenue and 77th Street
during his 1988 run for the presidency. Then Mayor Ed Koch gestures
at left. The corner was a Koch's ``lucky'' stop during his
campaigns for mayor. As Gore prepares to return to New York for a
second primary, on March 7, this time as the vice president of the
United States and the favorite to be his party's presidential
nominee, he is, in many ways, a very different candidate from the
one whose campaign collapsed on the steps of Koch's City Hall in
1988. (Sara Krulwich/The New York Times)

<P>
   (NYT22) NEW YORK -- Jan. 26, 2000 -- STBIOGRAPHY-2 -- Claudia
Shear as Mae West in ``Dirty Blonde'' - a liberating catalyst in
the more ordinary lives she touches. This seems appropriate to an
age in which the idea of fame rules civilization as never before,
when celebrities are accorded the stature of Homeric gods and
heroes (the idea being they're just like us, only more so) and when
the line between fact and fabrication is deliberately blurred.

<P>
   (NYT21) CHICAGO -- Jan. 26, 2000 -- STAGE-BIOGRAPHY-1 -- Marc
Vann as Salvador Dali and Yasen Peyankov as Sigmund Freud in
``Hysteria.'' The play is an imperfect but winning example of a
breed of play that is especially in vogue now. It's theater as
meta-biography, in which real lives are transformed, abstracted and
mythologized in pursuit of more essential truths or loopy
intellectual gamesmanship. (Todd Buchanan/The New York Times)

Dr. Niranjan Rao's new house in Iselin was designed with Dr. Ahmed
Azmy, a Muslim. ``I am Muslim and they are Hindu, but we worked
well together. The cultures are closer than you think,'' Dr. Azmy
says. ``Both have strong family ties and a spiritual sense of
life.'' The house puts a Bangalore twist on the American dream: it
mimics a mock Windsor Castle in Mysore, India. (Fred R. Conrad/The

   (NYT19) ISELIN, N.J. -- Jan. 26, 2000 -- ETHNICITY-HOUSES-1 --
Hindu deities pack Dr. Niranjan Rao's pooja room, a home shrine. As
the cultural melting pot seeps outwards, away from the cities, it
brings with it a new kind of ethnic diversity to the previously
all-white enclaves. Nowhere is this more evident than in Iselin,
where the heart of the Indian community is centered along Oak Tree
Road, a blighted strip that even Robert Venturi would find hard to
embrace. (Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times) LITE

Supply pipes are the thin tubes under a sink or toilet, typically
three-eighths inch in diameter, that carry water from the shutoff
valves up to the fixtures. Supply pipe comes in standard lengths.
For most installations it must be cut and bent to align with the
fittings; use a tubing cutter, a clamplike tool with two cutting
wheels, one fixed and one adjustable. (Edward R. Lipinski/The New

to initiate contact,'' says Christie. ``We don't have to wait for
someone to ask us for help.'' If the technology used by
icontact.com becomes more widespread, online consumers may soon

   (NYT15) FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- Jan. 26, 2000 -- CIR-WEB-LIVE-HELP-1
-- Johanne Torres, an employee of icontact.com, assists online
shoppers. Instead of waiting for a befuddled online shopper to
press a help button on the computer screen, icontact.com's

When Tim McCoy and his lover broke up, they found ways to lead
independent lives while coexisting in their East Village
condominium. A cell phone helped. Faced with the most expensive
rents in the nation, skyrocketing co-op prices and a paltry vacancy
rate estimated at less than 1 percent by real estate agents, an

DELL, AFFECTED BY INDUSTRY SLOWDOWN, REDUCES ITS QUARTERLY PROFIT
ESTIMATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By SAUL HANSELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp., which has grown rapidly to become the
biggest personal computer maker in the United States, warned on
Wednesday that its sales and profits would fall well below
expectations for the quarter that ends on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it was being hurt by shortages in some
components and because sales to big corporations were not
rebounding this month after having slowed at year-end as
corporations became distracted with repairing the year 2000
problem.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, Thomas Meredith, the
company's chief financial officer, said he expected both problems
to clear up in coming months. Nonetheless, he cautioned investors
to lower their expectations for Dell's sales growth and profit
margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are bullish on the whole year, but we wanted to set more
realistic expectations for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In after-hours trading, Dell's shares hit $36.375, down from its
regular Nasdaq close of $40.375.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the troubles reflected an inevitable humbling
of a company that had thrived by focusing on direct sales of
personal computers, a model that had caused years of losses and
confusion among most of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were a little overconfident,'' said Kevin
McCarthy, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``They
thought that they could execute so well they could avoid a negative
industry event like Y2K, but that cut everyone with a broad
slash.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said that it would report revenue of about $6.7
billion for the quarter, down $800 million from its own
expectation. It also expects to earn $430 million, or 16 cents a
share, and 1 cent of that was attributed to sales of investment
securities. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to earn
21 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shortfall, Dell continues to outpace its major
competitors. Its sales for the quarter were up 30 percent from a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's sales will be up about 30 percent and profits will rise
about 1 percent, according to the revised predictions.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, sales at rival Compaq Computer in the fourth
quarter were down by 4 percent, and its profits down 56 percent.
IBM's fourth quarter sales also fell by 4 percent, and its profits
dropped by 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both IBM and Compaq attributed some of their sales slowdown to
reduced demand from corporations that wanted to make few changes in
their computer systems so they could keep close tabs on any
potential problems related to processing dates in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Though very few date-related problems have arisen, Dell said it
had been surprised that orders from big companies did not pick up
in January. Indeed, under normal circumstances, Dell said January
sales were 9 percent higher than those in December. But it appears
that January sales will in fact be lower than December this year.
February will also be slow, the company predicted, but it said it
expected sales to pick up in the rest of the year. Dell said that
over the next few years it expected demand to rise, largely because
big companies are expanding computer systems to do more business on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the current quarter, Dell said it was also being hurt by a
shortage of Intel's fastest Pentium III chips and a new generation
of memory chips. This slowed the company's sales to consumers in
the critical holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Compaq, which focuses on low-cost machines, Dell appeals
to the computer hot rodders who want the biggest, fastest and most
advanced computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell is a heat seeker,'' Michael S. Dell, the company's
chairman, said in the conference call. ``We are the first to
deliver new products in volume. When those products are in short
supply, that takes demand away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith, Dell's chief financial officer, told analysts that he
expected sales to increase this year ``in the low 30-percent
range'' with net profit margins closer to 7 percent than to the 8
percent that it enjoyed in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that now that Dell had sales of $25 billion a
year, its growth would inevitably slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell has been growing by three to five times the rest of the
industry,'' said McCarthy, of Donaldson, Lufkin. ``Now we should
reset our expectations to two or three times.''  &QL;

U.S. OFFICIALS SEE POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN BIN LADEN AND ALGERIAN
GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 This article was reported by DAVID JOHNSTON, JUDITH MILLER and
WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM and written by Johnston.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American investigators have uncovered what they believe are
links between a group of Algerians who have been charged with
plotting a terrorist attack in the United States and Osama bin
Laden, the exiled Saudi accused of bombing two U.S. embassies in
east Africa, law enforcement officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, authorities in Senegal arrested a man who the
American investigators believe directed an Algerian group in Canada
in its effort to enter the United States and carry off a bomb plot
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said the man being held in Senegal, Mohambedou
Ould Slahi, is a brother-in-law of one of bin Laden's key
lieutenants. Officials said that federal prosecutors in Manhattan
are preparing formal charges against Slahi, which could be used as
the basis for his extradition.
</P>
<P>
   In making the arrest, the Senegalese were acting on a request
from the United States. But he has not been charged with a crime in
either Senegal or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb plot was foiled on Dec. 14 when border agents in Port
Angeles, Wash., arrested a man who had been at the wheel of a car
loaded with explosives and four home-made detonators.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they have no specific evidence that bin Laden set
the operation in motion. But investigators say they have found
several ties to what they believe to be bin Laden's worldwide
network.
</P>
<P>
   Officials disclosed, for example, that one of the men charged
with assembling the bomb had a roommate who was associated with an
Islamic charity that, according to prosecutors, played a role in
the embassy bombings two years ago. Bin Laden has been charged with
directing those attacks, which left more than 200 dead.
</P>
<P>
   A host of questions remain about the bomb plot that appears to
have been centered in the Canadian cities of Montreal and
Vancouver. Federal prosecutors have to date charged four Algerians
with taking part but they remain uncertain what was targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, American officials said this week that the case has
turned into the biggest counter-terrorism inquiry since the embassy
bombings. That earlier case has resulted so far in criminal charges
against 17 people.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that federal agents were en route on Wednesday to
Senegal to question Slahi. They said the government in Senegal
appeared unwilling to hold him without specific charges, and was
preparing to expel him, possibly to his homeland, neighboring
Mauritania.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities believe that if Slahi is charged, they would
then be able to extradite him under existing international law.
Officials said it was less clear whether they could extradite a
Mauritanian citizen from that country.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the emergence of Slahi as a key suspect
reinforces American and Canadian suspicions about the origins of
the bomb plot.
</P>
<P>
   While several of those charged may have been members at one time
of a militant Algerian Islamic group known as the Armed Islamic
Group, the plot was most likely not inspired or ordered by that
group, which is not known to have attacked Americans or American
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Slahi's connections to Mr. bin Laden's group, al Qaeda, they
said, suggest the possibility that bin Laden may be at the heart of
the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are pressing to find out more about the role of
Slahi, who one law enforcement official described as ``potentially
the most significant person'' discovered thus far in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about his background, but investigators say that
he had what one termed as ``constant communications'' with a
construction company in Khartoum, Sudan, that was owned by bin
Laden. The company, officials said, was used as a front for al
Qaeda. Bin Laden lived in Khartoum from 1991 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials said that Slahi is related by marriage to one
of bin Laden's key operatives, known as ``the Mauritanian.'' They
declined to name this person, but one official said he had been
tied to the Africa bombings.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, officials said, Slahi was living in Germany. Last
fall, he arrived in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   While in Montreal, the officials said, Slahi worked closely with
Mokhtar Haouari, an Algerian man who has been charged with
arranging the logistics of the bomb plot.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest on Dec. 14 of Ahmed Ressam, the Algerian driving the
carload of explosives, prompted others linked to the plot to try to
conceal their involvement, prosecutors have said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that Slahi fled to a Montreal mosque, before
leaving the country.

   Dan Lambert, spokesman for the Canadian Security Intelligence
Service, confirmed that his agency had been following Slahi, and
took issue with the idea that Canada had lost him. ``We were aware
that Mr. Slahi was traveling in advance of his departure,'' he
said, ``because the reason for his travel was the heat being placed
on him by the Canadian investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials said there are several other emerging links
between the bomb plot and bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One involves Hamid Aich, an Algerian who lived for three years
in the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby until last May. A law
enforcement official said that after leaving Canada, Aich moved to
Ireland and was associated with Mercy International Relief Agency,
an Islamic charity that American prosecutors have linked to the
embassy bombings and bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The charity's director, prosecutors said in court papers,
received calls on his mobile phone from bin Laden's satellite
telephone. An FBI search of the charity's files in the days after
the embassy bombings uncovered a receipt dated July 24, 1998, two
weeks before the bombings, that referred to plans to obtain weapons
from Somalia. Attempts to reach the charity for comment were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   In his three years in Canada, Aich shared an apartment with
Abdel Majid Dahoumane, according to the building's superintendent,
who declined to be quoted by name.
</P>
<P>
   Aich was briefly detained last month in Ireland and police there
seized his computer and personal papers. He was released before
authorities understood that the material tied him to bomb plot,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   American investigators are also looking into whether Khalil Said
al-Deek, a Palestinian who became an American in 1991 and is now
being held in Jordan, may also have links to al Qaeda. Jordanian
officials have told their American counterparts they believe that
Deek was a key figure in a plot to blow up tourist sites in Jordan
at the new year. Deek's lawyer, Fred Sayre, of Newport Beach,
Calif., said on Wednesday night that his client was innocent and
had not been in Jordan for about a year before officials there
ordered his arrest.

RUSSIA-CHECHNYA-VILLAGE -- On a break from looking after relatives,
several Chechen women stand in the blown-out doorway of the local
hospital Monday. After fighting their way into the Chechen lowlands
in October, Russian troops advanced on Urus-Martan. Most of the
residents fled to avoid the fighting. The militants left December
6. The Russian shelling, however, went on for several more days,
damaging homes and blasting a wing of the hospital. (James Hill/The

the lawyer who represented John Sweeney, the Ma Maison chef who
strangled Dunne's 22-year-old daughter, Dominique. Her death and
her killer's trial left a permanent raw wound; much of Dunne's

Evicted from a hamlet that was cleared a few weeks before, they are

campaigns at the subway exit on Lexington Avenue and 77th Street
during his 1988 run for the presidency. Then Mayor Ed Koch gestures
at left. The corner was a Koch's ``lucky'' stop during his
campaigns for mayor. As Gore prepares to return to New York for a
second primary, on March 7, this time as the vice president of the
United States and the favorite to be his party's presidential
nominee, he is, in many ways, a very different candidate from the
one whose campaign collapsed on the steps of Koch's City Hall in
1988. (Sara Krulwich/The New York Times)

Claudia Shear as Mae West in ``Dirty Blonde'' - a liberating
catalyst in the more ordinary lives she touches. This seems
appropiate to an age in which the idea of fame rules civilization
as never before, when celebrities are accorded the stature of
Homeric gods and heroes (the idea being they're just like us, only
more so) and when the line between fact and fabrication is
deliberately blurred. (Sara Krulwich/The New York Times)

   (NYT21) CHICAGO -- Jan. 26, 2000 -- STAGE-BIOGRAPHY-1 -- Marc
Vann as Salvador Dali and Yasen Peyankov as Sigmund Freud in
``Hysteria.'' The play is an imperfect but winning example of a
breed of play that is especially in vogue now. It's theater as
meta-biography, in which real lives are transformed, abstracted and
mythologized in pursuit of more essential truths or loopy
intellectual gamesmanship. (Todd Buchanan/The New York Times)

Dr. Niranjan Rao's new house in Iselin was designed with Dr. Ahmed
Azmy, a Muslim. ``I am Muslim and they are Hindu, but we worked
well together. The cultures are closer than you think,'' Dr. Azmy
says. ``Both have strong family ties and a spiritual sense of
life.'' The house puts a Bangalore twist on the American dream: it
mimics a mock Windsor Castle in Mysore, India. (Fred R. Conrad/The

Hindu deities pack Dr. Niranjan Rao's pooja room, a home shrine. As
the cultural melting pot seeps outwards, away from the cities, it
brings with it a new kind of ethnic diversity to the previously
all-white enclaves. Nowhere is this more evident than in Iselin,
where the heart of the Indian community is centered along Oak Tree
Road, a blighted strip that even Robert Venturi would find hard to
embrace. (Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times) LITE

Supply pipes are the thin tubes under a sink or toilet, typically
three-eighths inch in diameter, that carry water from the shutoff

THE QUESTION OF ABORTION DOGS MCCAIN ONCE MORE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Struggling to answer a hypothetical question,
Sen. John McCain said Wednesday that if his teen-age daughter
became pregnant, she would have the ``final decision'' on whether
to have an abortion. He then quickly backtracked and said it would
be a ``family decision.''
</P>
<P>
   His words were used against him hours later in the Republican
debate, when Alan Keyes, a social conservative, said McCain showed
a ``profound lack of understanding'' of the issue. ``After all, if
your daughter came to you and said she contemplated killing her
grandmother for her inheritance,'' Keyes said, ``you wouldn't say
`let's have a family conference.' You'd just say no because that is
morally wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain shot back that he had a long anti-abortion record ``and I
will continue to maintain it. I will not draw my children into this
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was confronted with the polarizing social issue first
thing Wednesday morning when it arose for the second day in a row
on his Straight Talk Express campaign bus, which is drawing more
reporters as the New Hampshire primary nears.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator appeared caught off guard when a reporter
asked whether, if his 15-year-old daughter, Meghan, became
pregnant, he would tell her that she could not have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' McCain said. ``I would discuss this issue with Cindy and
Meghan, and this would be a private decision that we would share
within our family. Obviously I would encourage her to know that
that baby would be brought up in a warm loving family. The final
decision would be made by Meghan with our advice and counsel, and I
think that's such a private matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy, McCain's wife, has been campaigning with him and was at
his side.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has said repeatedly that he is morally opposed to
abortion, was then asked whether he had just articulated the
position of the abortion rights movement, which argues that the
procedure should not be outlawed but left up to individual women,
McCain became visibly irritated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's the choice position to say that my daughter
and my wife and I will discuss something that is a family matter
that we have to decide,'' he said. A short time later, McCain
telephoned reporters and said: ``I misspoke. What I believed I was
saying and intended to say is that this is a family decision. The
family decision will be made by the family, not by Meghan alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Both McCain and Gov. George W. Bush, the two Republican
front-runners in New Hampshire polls, are walking a fine line on
social issues like abortion because they are trying to build a
coalition of independents and conservatives alike. But it is a
difficult balancing act: stands that could help them in a state
like New Hampshire, where independents can vote in the Republican
primary, could hurt in a more conservative state like South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was asked a slightly different hypothetical question
earlier in the campaign: what he would do if one of his relatives
were weighing abortion because she had been raped. ``It would be up
to her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at Wednesday night's debate about abortion, Bush tried to
maintain a delicate balance. ``I believe it's important for our
party to maintain its pro-life position. I believe it's important
for the next president to recognize that good people can disagree
on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was not the first time McCain has had difficulties
with the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer he caused a conservative outcry when he told The
San Francisco Chronicle that he would not ``in the short term or
even the long term'' support the repeal of the landmark 1973 U.S.
Supreme Court decision on abortion rights because it would force
women in America to undergo ``illegal and dangerous operations.''
But then, too, he quickly backtracked.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's imbroglio over abortion showed the kind of risks
McCain has exposed himself to by giving reporters complete access
to him, particularly as the New Hampshire primary nears on Feb. 1.
In fact, late in the day, McCain was still facing questions on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Upset by the personal nature of the hypothetical questions about
her daughter, Mrs. McCain stood up and left her seat at the back of
the bus, where her husband holds court. McCain finally said,
``We're going to have to move on. This is the last six days of the
campaign. I can't really elaborate much more.''
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday night, McCain, a former prisoner of war in
Vietnam, told Keyes: ``I've seen enough killing in my life. I know
how precious human life is. And I don't need a lecture from you.''

<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-ROYALS (Undated) _ Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf, the
wastrel heir to a shipping fortune in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,''
is the purest example of an upper-class American golden boy to
appear in the movies in a long time. His female counterpart in
Anthony Minghella's portrait of rich young Americans abroad in the
late 1950s is Cate Blanchett's Meredith Logue, a textile heiress
bouncing around from one swell European hotel to another.
Hollywood's fondness for casting British actors as upper-class
Americans belongs to a long and duplicitous Hollywood tradition of
pretending to erase class differences while actually celebrating
them. By Stephen Holden. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COMIC-GENIUSES-FILMS (Undated) _ Humankind used to produce two
or three geniuses per century. Now, it gives us a couple of dozen
per month. Last November's Genius issue of Esquire showcased those
men and women ``transforming our civilization,'' including the NBA
point guard Allen Iverson and the brilliant Leonardo _ not Da
Vinci, but DiCaprio. Today, everyone and his dog is a genius.
Nowhere is this inflation more evident than in current comic
cinema. ``Comic genius'' Jim Carrey (Time magazine) appears as
``comic genius'' Andy Kaufman (The New Yorker) in ``Man on the
Moon.'' By Franz Lidz and Steve Rushin. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-FILMS (Paris) _ For all the ardent nationalists battling
American cultural and capitalist incursions, a new generation of
Europeans is living and working across the 15 borders of the
European Union, using the Internet, speaking ``American'' to their
children the way the Russian aristocracy used to speak French _
global citizens whose lives take place, at least some of the time,
in English. There is a struggle going on to create a cultural
identity for this united Europe, and one of its arenas is the
European film. If defining that identity now is more elusive
artistically, financially and geographically than ever before, one
thing is certain: the film will be in English. By Kristin
Hohenadel. (Moved). &QL;

</P>
<P>
   COLORADO-BALLET (Denver) _ At a time when few regional ballets
can take the financial and critical risk of visiting New York even
once, Colorado Ballet is back for the third time in less than a
decade. The Denver-based company, which made one-night stands at
Brooklyn College's Whitman Hall in 1993 and 1998, returns Tuesday
night for a week at the Joyce Theater, marking its Manhattan debut
with three works: Sir Frederick Ashton's ``Facade'' and the New
York premieres of Peter Pucci's ``Picture of Sedalia'' and Stanton
Welch's ``Of Blessed Memory.'' By Daniel Gesmer. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BLAIR-BROWN-THEATER (Undated) _ With the slow decline of the
Broadway play, and the dearth of musical roles for women over 50, a
middle-aged actress expecting to find steady, varying work on
Broadway might be a candidate for some sort of professional
intervention. So what is to be made of the unconventional
trajectory of Blair Brown, the erstwhile star of television sitcoms
(``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd'') and of movies (``Altered
States'') who has reinvented herself as, a Broadway actress? Last
year, she scored a critical triumph in ``Cabaret,'' replacing Mary
Louise Wilson as the dowdy landlady, Fraulein Schneider, and
surprising audiences with the suppleness of her voice. This month,
she moved back to Broadway in another singing role as Gretta
Conroy, the nostalgic wife in Richard Nelson and Shaun Davey's
musical adaptation of ``The Dead,'' the story by James Joyce. By
Peter Marks. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT-SHAW-MUSIC (Undated) _ It would somehow have been both
fitting and a bit grotesque if Robert Shaw, the great choral
conductor who died just over a year ago at 82, had left behind a
recording of a Requiem, to be released after his own death. And he
missed doing so only by weeks. His last recording, made in late
1998 and recently released by Telarc, was of Dvorak's Stabat Mater,
an expansive setting of a traditional text of the Roman Catholic
Church, reflecting on the sorrows of the Virgin Mary at the cross
of Jesus. By James R. Oestreich.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-FINALES (Berlin) _ For their New Year's Eve concert here
at the Philharmonie, the Berlin Philharmonic and its conductor,
Claudio Abbado, came up with an extraordinary program that worked
extraordinarily well: seven finales in a row, to mark the passing
of the year and, depending on how you count, the century. By Paul
Griffiths. (Moved).  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LONG-OPERAS (Undated) _ Many operas, including great ones, are
routinely criticized for being too long. Puccini's ``Tosca,'' a
miracle of dramatic streamlining, is conceded to be just right, but
``Madama Butterfly,'' which is not that much longer, is thought to
have dead spots. Wagner's ``Siegfried'' is way too long, detractors
say, and even many partisans concede as much, not to mention tenors
who take on the exhausting title role, the most demanding in opera.
Yet ``Gotterdammerung,'' an even longer work, is generally felt to
be gripping theater. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Dvorak: Symphony No. 7, `The Wild Dove'
by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Lauridsen: `Lus Aeterna,'
Other Works, by the Los Angeles Master Chorale. By David
Mermelstein. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MARSALIS-JAZZ (Undated) _ Sometime during the last year, those
of us who were on the mailing list of Columbia Records ran for
cover. It was raining CDs by Wynton Marsalis. By the end of 1999,
Marsalis had released some 20 hours of music on 15 CDs, a heroic
effort called ``Swinging Into the 21st'' that still has not emptied
Columbia's vaults of his material. There has never been anything
like that sort of effusion in the history of jazz, and to achieve
it Marsalis cut his earnings per album from $1 million to $100,000.
By Peter Watrous. (Moved).  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DENNY-DOHERTY-MUSIC (Undated) _ The moment the surviving members
of the Mamas and the Papas came onstage two years ago to sing an
old hit song and accept induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame, a certain group of mothers and fathers in the television
audience surely did a double take. For there on the screen, now
getting on in years, were the rock band's founder and chief
songwriter, John Phillips; the singer (and Papa John's ex-wife)
Michelle Phillips, and, belting out the lead vocals ... the Harbor
Master. Rock music fans with long memories may have known him as
Denny Doherty, once the buoyant tenor for one of the most popular,
tuneful and harmonically sophisticated bands of the '60s. By
William McDonald. (Moved).  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFRICAN-SLAVE-POTTER (Winterthur, Del.) _ The robust
eight-gallon jar was both impressive and puzzling: slightly larger
than a basketball and richly glazed in greens and browns, it bore
the neat signature of Dave, a slave who was a poet and master
potter in Edgefield, S.C., in the 19th century, the first
African-American to sign his ceramics. A traveling exhibition of
his work began at the McKissick Museum of the University of South
Carolina in 1998. The show's title quotes a line from a poem on a
pot by Dave in the Smithsonian: ```I made this jar...' The Life and
Works of the Enslaved African-American Potter, Dave.'' It will open
here next weekend at the Henry Francis duPont Winterthur Museum and
remain through June 25. By Rita Reif. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CORNELIA-PARKER-ART (Boston) _ Like a slightly daft forensic
detective, the British artist Cornelia Parker gathers evidence from
moldering cultural artifacts. Tarnish from Davy Crockett's knife, a
feather from Sigmund Freud's couch, dust from the grooves of a
phonograph record that belonged to Adolf Hitler, all become loaded
icons once she gets hold of them. Through precise presentations and
mind-spinning titles, Ms. Parker cleverly turns the trivial into
secular relics. Her first American museum survey exhibition opens
here on Wednesday at the Institute of Contemporary Art and runs
through April 9. By Ann Wilson Lloyd. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EISENMAN-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ For years, one of the burning
questions in American architecture has been: Will Peter Eisenman
find himself before the world finds Peter Eisenman? By himself, I
don't mean Eisenman's personality. I mean his attitude toward his
medium. Can he finally place architecture above the external
sources _ linguistics; semiotics; structuralist philosophy _ he has
relied on over the years? By the world, I don't mean popular
acclaim, of the kind that Frank Gehry has achieved in recent years.
I mean curiosity on the part of a public that has been slow to
recognize its stake in Eisenman's ideas. By Herbert Muschamp.

   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TV-STORM-IN-SUMMER (Undated) _ It's the summer of 1969 and
Herman D. Washington, a 9-year-old black boy from Harlem, has just
stepped off the bus in the upstate town of Fairview, N.Y., where he
is to spend a charity-sponsored vacation with a local family. He is
not thrilled at the prospect, and the greeting he receives does
nothing to increase his enthusiasm. ``A Storm in Summer,'' directed
by Robert Wise, is the 41st movie that Showtime has produced for
family audiences in the last five years. Its themes of racism,
anti-Semitism and hard-won friendship are typical for these movies,
which Showtime, in an effort to attract both younger viewers and
their parents, now promotes under the banner Original Pictures for
All Ages. By Suzanne MacNeille. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ New museum tours explore high and low;
High-tech school for golf on Maui; Code-share plan adds South

SEEKING HIGH-TECH INPUT TO STOP A SILICON VALLEY 2 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JIM YARDLEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Like so many of his fellow dot.com millionaires
in this Texas city often ranked as one of the country's best places
to live, Peter Zandan regards Silicon Valley in Northern California
as a nightmare of overpriced houses, horrific traffic and bad
planning.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as those same problems press upon Austin, a city known for
its live music, Zandan and other executives in the high-tech
industry are pondering a pointed question: How do we save Austin
from ourselves?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hate to see Austin become another Silicon Valley,''
Zandan said.
</P>
<P>
   So on Wednesday, Zandan, chairman of the Internet company
Zilliant and founder of IntelliQuest, and another local
entrepreneur, Steve Papermaster of Agillion, sponsored a gathering
of 300 local ``new economy'' executives not only to discuss the
future of the high-tech industry in Austin but to begin addressing
problems plaguing the city: traffic and sprawl, inflated housing
costs, environmental strains and a growing divide between the rich
and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   They had these facts: Austin saw the creation of 32,000 jobs
last year for a growth rate of 5.3 percent, the highest of any
metropolitan area in Texas. The cost of housing has risen 71
percent since 1990. Motorists now spend an estimated 53 hours a
year stuck in traffic. The infrastructure has become so taxed that
the largest employer, Dell Computer Corp., which has 27,500 workers
in central Texas, recently had to expand in Nashville rather than
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the gathering and a televised town meeting on Tuesday
night were part of a courting ritual between the technology
industry and a larger Austin. During a question-and-answer session
Wednesday, one executive told the mayor of Austin, Kirk Watson,
that, in essence, it was industry's job to create wealth and
government's job to deal with the incumbent problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say to me that it is in the government's court,''
Watson said, ``Folks, government can't take care of all the
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Zandan and Papermaster had organized the inaugural
conference, 360.Alpha Summit, after realizing that local high-tech
leaders were disconnected from one another as well as the
community.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose, Zandan said, was ``to stir things up,'' and it
apparently worked: When Larry R. Faulkner, president of University
of Texas, responded to criticism by commenting that the university
would be around a lot longer than the denizens of the technology
age, he was pelted by plastic golf balls, which had been handed out
to participants.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the golf balls were back (as well as free running
shoes and beanies with propellers), but the tone for the meeting,
360.00 Summit, seemed less confrontational, perhaps in response to
the growing public frustration with quality of life issues.
Executives watched a video hosted by Dan Rather, ``virtual guest''
and native Texan, in which a teacher described her difficulty in
finding an affordable place to live. They listened to motorists
complain about numbing traffic delays.
</P>
<P>
   At the town meeting, civic leaders made it clear that the
companies, as much as government, must do something to improve the
quality of life. One man asked if companies would agree to a
minimum $9 an hour wage, noting that many residents lived on $350 a
week. A minister asked what companies would do to narrow the
``digital divide'' and wire the Internet into classrooms for
minority students.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a silver bullet,'' said Tom Meredith, chief
financial officer of Dell, and one of the more active high-tech
executives in civic affairs, ``we'd have already found it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Zandan announced a new Austin Network, connecting
regional technology leaders with civic and governmental officials.
What he hopes, as do others, is that the same decision-making and
creativity that have fueled the technology boom can be applied to
solving the larger community problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the high-minded intentions of the conference will
seem like little more than good public relations if nothing
happens. Meredith, for one, talked about the need for improving
public schools and building light rail, the latter of which is
expected to come before voters later this year.
</P>
<P>
   And in the spirit of the technology age, he boiled down what
needs to be done to one word: Action.

   Coke to Cut 6,000 Jobs; Takes $800 Million Charge
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola said it would eliminate 6,000 jobs, or a fifth of its
work force, in the biggest reductions ever by the beverage company.
The cuts will be most keenly felt around company headquarters in
Atlanta, where Coke is long identified with success both personal
and collective. About 2,500 people, or nearly half the employees at
Coke's downtown complex, will be fired. To cover severance and
other costs related to the job reduction, the company will take an
$800 million charge against earnings this year.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton to Retire From Chrysler
</P>
<P>
   Robert Eaton announced his retirement as co-chairman of
DaimlerChrysler, the merged global automaker he helped to form,
effective March 31. He said he was leaving earlier than had been
expected because all his corporate goals had been reached. In doing
so, Eaton leaves DaimlerChrysler's top management to the company's
German executives. Juergen Schrempp, who is now Eaton's
co-chairman, will become Daimler's sole chairman after Eaton's
departure.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom to Acquire Global One
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom will pay $4.3 billion to gain control of Global
One, the struggling provider of telecommunication services that it
started three years ago with Sprint and Deutsche Telekom. The
purchase ends a three-way partnership that began with ambitious
visions but was later plagued by an unwieldy management structure
and feuding.
</P>
<P>
   Major Stock Gauges Finish Mixed
</P>
<P>
   Stocks ended mixed with the Dow Jones industrial average
finishing little changed, gaining 3.10 points, to 11,032.99. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index closed down 5.94 points, or 0.42
percent, at 1,404.09, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite
index fell 97.5 points, or 2.34 percent, to 4,069.91.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on short-term Treasury notes rose while the yields on the
10-year note and the 30-year bond fell, leaving some short-term
yields higher than long-term yields.

<P>
   Ford Reports Profit But Shares Fall
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor reported slightly better earnings for the fourth
quarter than financial analysts had expected, but the automaker's
shares fell on fears that further profit gains might prove elusive.
Ford earned $1.81 billion, or $1.47 a share, two cents higher than
analysts' expectations. Shares of Ford closed at $48, down $2.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock Offer Raises $1.7 Billion
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock Financial Services raised $1.7 billion in an
initial sale of stock. The sale of 102 million shares at $17 each
ended 137 years of ownership of John Hancock Mutual Insurance Co.
by its policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris Profit Rises 2.7 Percent
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris said fourth-quarter earnings rose 2.7 percent,
bolstered by higher cigarette prices. Profit from operations at the
maker of Marlboro cigarettes, Kraft cheese and Miller beer rose to
$1.81 billion, or 77 cents a share, up from $1.77 billion, or 72
cents. Sales rose 4.4 percent, to $19.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones &AMP; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, reported

</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems, moving to maintain its hold on the Internet,
said that Solaris 8, the latest version of its operating system,

domination of high-powered server computers for delivering Internet
services, on Feb. 17.

EUROPE FILMS LEARN TO SPEAK ENGLISH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ You'll really learn how to speak the language when you
fall in love,'' they said as I set off for life in Paris. But I
soon found out that not every Parisian love story takes place in
French.
</P>
<P>
   The man to go with the city of my dreams was the French-blooded,
American-schooled, tricontinental son of a civil engineer. He
preferred English, and his placeless accent was concocted from the
shards of his oddly assembled cultural memory: part Beatles, part
MovieFone, part Crocodile Dundee.
</P>
<P>
   I fell in love in English.
</P>
<P>
   If our tragic story were to screen at a theater near you, it
wouldn't need many subtitles. He broke into French only out of
playfulness, exasperation or embarrassment. I insulted him in his
mother tongue, hoping it would sting more deeply. But French wasn't
our language of communication: we said our first sweet words in
English, and it was in English that we said adieu.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a borrowed English, not my native tongue. For all the
ardent nationalists battling American cultural and capitalist
incursions, a new generation of Europeans is living and working
across the 15 borders of the European Union, using the Internet,
speaking ``American'' to their children the way the Russian
aristocracy used to speak French _ global citizens whose lives take
place, at least some of the time, in English.
</P>
<P>
   An American abroad can feel like a prisoner in a linguistic
funhouse, with familiar words disfigured by foreign accents and
convoluted grammar and half-felt cultural references. The Paris
version of Disneyland. A universe in which one is often unsure of
what is meant or what is being heard.
</P>
<P>
   There is a struggle going on to create a cultural identity for
this united Europe, and one of its arenas is the European film. If
defining that identity now is more elusive artistically,
financially and geographically than ever before, one thing is
certain: the film will be in English.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain once said that waiters were the only Frenchmen who
spoke a second language. But while France is still wary of foreign
languages, American movies dominate the cinemas of this fiercely
nationalistic, protectionist country.
</P>
<P>
   While Louis Malle, Luc Besson and Jean-Jacques Annaud have been
among the few French directors to make the cross-cultural leap to
English in the past, Michel Blanc recently released ``The Wrong
Blonde'' with Daniel Auteuil, and Arnaud Desplechin, Patrice
Chereau, Claire Denis and Alain Berliner all have English-language
projects in the works. Several more directors _ including Erick
Zonca and Olivier Assayas (whose ``Irma Vep'' was made partly in
English) _ have begun to flirt with the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Making films in English means potential sales in many more
countries; and it means a crack at the dominant American market.
It's what Besson has been doing for years, using French money to
try to muscle in on the lucrative American business with films like
``The Fifth Element'' or the recently released ``Messenger'' _ a
kind a macho gesture to prove that big, mass-market films can be
made outside of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Assayas points out that the producers of his newest film, an
expensive period drama called ``Les Destinees Sentimentales'' set
in France at the turn of the century, suggested making it in
English. ``I thought it was completely absurd for the same reason I
think it was absurd for Luc Besson to make a film about Joan of Arc
in English,'' he said. ``I couldn't imagine the characters from
that time speaking English _ not if you're making a film to
recreate a world, feelings, to anchor your story or characters in
some kind of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Besson's producer, the filmmaking giant Gaumont, has
English-language projects including ``The Messenger,'' the period
drama ``Vatel'' with Gerard Depardieu, Tim Roth and Uma Thurman,
and a remake of the French film ``Les Visiteurs'' (``The
Visitors''). The producer Fabien Liron of the recently formed
Fabulous Films said he was seeking out English-language material
that he could develop, using American talent and crew and adding a
European sensibility that he hoped would entice European audiences
and appeal to American audiences as exotic.
</P>
<P>
   Among his projects are a ``high-concept blind-dating film''
(high-concept, he says, because the phenomenon does not exist in
Europe), a woman's spiritual journey through Mexico and the story
of an American searching out her Scottish roots. Liron said his
tastes are borderless. But he hopes to make films that will capture
European and American imaginations by having a little of something
for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   At least one recent effort has shown the potential of a European
film in English to send a postcard from the Paris where people live
and dream and fall in love in English. The French-American
Jean-Marc Barr's ``Lovers'' opened recently in France, Italy and
Germany. Starring the French actress Elodie Bouchez (``The
Dreamlife of Angels'') and the Yugoslav actor Sergei Trifunovic, it
is an English-language film about the precarious love between a
young French woman and an illegal immigrant from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   If language and culture are prerequisites for citizenship in a
society, this small film shows how the English language has become
a passport to a community beyond geography, culture and national
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, a first-time director and actor who is best known for his
role in ``The Big Blue'' (1988), is a citizen of this community. He
has lived in both the United States and Europe and has been married
to a Yugoslav for 15 years. Born on a German military base in 1960
to an American father and a French mother, he has spent the last
seven years in France, where he has recently formed a production
company with the goal of making European films in English for a
world market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe Europe is going to exist because the English
language allows it to culturally,'' he said on a recent afternoon
in Paris. ``Never on this continent has there been a language that
all the classes can speak, from a Polish man to a Spaniard to an
Icelandic. My biggest and most rewarding events in my life have
been because I have been able to speak English with people from all
over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   BARR and his partner, Pascal Arnold, wrote the script in French,
and Barr translated it into American English. To most ears, Barr
sounds like an American. But he sometimes adds a Gallic ``hein?''
at the end of an English sentence, then cuts off his final g's like
a kid from San Diego, where he spent part of his youth. He talks
about America and Europe as ``us'' and ``them'' interchangeably, in
the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what culture I'm from _ I'm a real piece of
trash,'' he said. ``When I'm in America I'm not looked at as a
foreigner because I speak like an American. But I'm not totally
American, plus I'm living in Europe for the last 20 years. I don't
have any real identity, which makes it interesting for me.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It has given him an ear for the power negotiations that take
place between speakers of a common language. Witness the French and
Yugolslavian characters in ``Lovers,'' the words they won't give
up: the Yugoslav insists his French girlfriend pronounce his name
in perfect Serbo-Croatian, but he calls her ``Jane,'' unable to say
the French ``Jeanne''; she refers to her place of employment, a
bookstore, using the French word ``librairie,'' despite his
repeated corrections.
</P>
<P>
   When a director and actors attempt to tell a story in another
language, it can create a dissonant sound. In Besson's
``Messenger'' (called ``Jeanne d'Arc'' in France), the cast's
motley assortment of accents does not necessarily correspond with
their characters' nationalities. In ``Lovers,'' Ms. Bouchez's
accent can be hard on American ears.
</P>
<P>
   Barr said he saw it another way: ``The way she speaks American
in a strange kind of California way for me is cute. It's not easy
for the French; they're the ones who have the hardest time with the
English.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr said his work on the Danish director Lars von Trier's
``Breaking the Waves'' gave him faith in the possibility of the
English-language European film. ``Once in a while there's been a
Euro-pudding, when you put the big American stars with the big
European stars, but it's still Hollywood making the movie,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ```Breaking the Waves' was made in English with Danes, Swedes,
Germans, French, Icelandic, English, Scots, Irish. It didn't matter
where an actor came from, if his English was good enough.'' And the
ability of European filmmakers and actors to work in English means
that those films can take place anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Von Trier's upcoming ``Dancer in the Dark,'' starring Catherine
Deneuve (France) and Bjork (Iceland), is set in Oregon, but was
shot mostly in Sweden and Denmark; Barr's next film, ``Too Much
Flesh,'' is set in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of making English-language films with a European
sensibility is that they won't work at home or abroad. As the world
turns ever toward America, making films in English is as much an
attempt for Europeans to communicate with one another as it is for
them to find a way to have a dialogue with Americans. Look, they
seem to say, we're speaking your language, we are meeting you
halfway. But it seems, for the moment, a largely one-sided
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Assayas, who normally writes and directs his films, said he is
interested but cautious about making an English-language film. ``We
don't have the same relationship with a language that's not our
maternal language,'' he said. ``I speak English, but not that
deeply. I'm not that in touch with the everyday life and the
culture. If I had to write a scene with an American teen-ager, how
would I get into their mind? I worry about missing the nuances,
simplifying the characters and the emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lovers'' sold only 12,000 tickets at the French box office.
Because it was in English, it was distributed at only half the
country's provincial cinemas. But its English-language dialogue
also allowed its sale to film distributors in 20 countries, which
would have been difficult to achieve with a French-language film.
``Lovers'' has not yet been sold in America.
</P>
<P>
   Barr is aware that the commercial potential of the niche he is
trying to carve out is still unknown. ``Lovers,'' the first in a
trilogy, was shot using digital technology for less than $1
million. He says the cheap technology has allowed him to pursue his
vision without knowing exactly how he is going to make his money
back. If he cannot find cinematic distributors, he will seek other
ways _ cable television, for example _ of having his films reach
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Barr is confident that ``Lovers'' will find an American
distributor. ``We're not ever going to be real competition for the
United States in terms of worldwide market,'' he said. ``But
because we have this ability now to speak English and the younger
generations are going to speak more and more English, we also offer
a real cultural alternative. I think `Lovers' shows the real
potential of how culturally Europe can have an identity in the
world but also how it can maybe gather forces and also stand to be
a real challenger to what American film is about. Because we're
never going to beat them in terms of the baby-sitting market.''
</P>
<P>
   The director Eric Rohmer, who has made a long career of
exploring the nuances of regional France, said in an interview last
summer that he did not much believe in the idea of a European film.
``I would never make a film in English,'' he said. Never mind that
he doesn't speak the language. The reason his films work, he said,
for a devoted base of fans as far afield as America and Japan, is
that they are such faithful transcriptions of a country that they
lose nothing in translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment we are looking for the idea of a European film,
but I have the impression that it doesn't work,'' he said. ``When
French films try to imitate the American model, it doesn't work in
America. I think if you make a film that shows the reality of a
country, it has more of a chance to work.''
</P>
<P>
   But at 79, Rohmer perhaps does not have eyes for that country in
between, that landscape of ephemeral boundaries in which some of us
move in and out of cultures and time zones and inherited and
assumed languages _ that Paris I seldom know how to write home
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lovers'' is for all the people who will come to Paris and fall
in love in English. And it seems to know that while love may be the
universal language, when a French person says ``I love you,'' it is
spoken with a borrowed heart.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ NFL scouts will testify that year in and year out Florida
State produces the best pass-rushing prospects in the country. But
in Super Bowl XXXIV, the Seminoles are being overshadowed by the
Florida Gators.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tennessee defensive end Jevon Kearse, Florida class of 1999, set
an NFL rookie record with 14{ sacks. St. Louis defensive end Kevin
Carter, Florida class of 1995, led the league with 17 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse, whose nickname is ``The Freak,'' has been the catalyst
for a defense that registered a franchise-record 54 sacks this
season. In 1998, when the Titans finished 8-8, they recorded 30
sacks, with only 13{ by the defensive line. This season, linemen
registered 37{.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say about The Freak?'' Titans strong safety
Blaine Bishop said. ``When he runs down running backs that can run
a 4.3, that's impressive. He was the missing piece of the defensive
puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   The improved pass rush is one reason the Titans finished plus-18
in turnover margin this season, their best performance since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play our game _ fast, aggressive and with sure tackling
_ the turnovers will come,'' said Kearse, who will start for the
AFC in the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse plays the left side, or the opposite side of the majority
of the great pass rushers. Because offenses are loading up on him,
he often flip-flops.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse, who had five tackles, a sack and a forced fumble in this
year's regular-season meeting with the Rams, wouldn't be a member
of the Titans if the team had taken its second-favorite player in
the 1995 draft rather than quarterback Steve McNair. There was
sentiment in the organization for taking Carter. Coach Jeff Fisher
predicted Carter would become a big-time pass rusher, and he was
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``In April, we wanted Jevon,'' general manager Floyd Reese said.
``We tried to trade up to the sixth spot to get him, and we were
offering some good deals. When the Colts took Edgerrin James,
everybody kind of went, `Wow,' and decided to back up a bit. I was
scared to death that Pittsburgh was going to take him. Can you
imagine him as an outside linebacker rushing the quarterback with
the Steelers?''
</P>
<P>
   Any time a defense is dominating, the success begins up front,
and it's no different with the Titans. They have talent and depth.
Reese made a series of moves after the 1998 season that proved
instrumental in the first Super Bowl appearance in team history.
</P>
<P>
   Reese drafted Kearse in the first round and defensive tackle
John Thornton in the second round. Thornton contributed 4{ sacks
this season. Veteran defensive tackles Jason Fisk and Mike Jones
were signed as free agents and became part of the inside rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's defense has been outstanding in the playoffs,
limiting Buffalo, Indianapolis and Jacksonville to an average of
15.3 points a game. Those teams had a combined regular-season
record of 38-10.
</P>
<P>
   What sets Tennessee apart from other defenses is team speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can run with anybody,'' defensive coordinator Gregg
Williams said. ``We stress aggressive, attacking football. We don't
want the players to be worried about making mistakes. Sure, they're
going to make mistakes, but they have to blow them off, learn from
them and come back even harder on the next play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans have their most experience at linebacker, where Eddie
Robinson (eighth season) and Joe Bowden (eighth) flank Barron
Wortham (sixth).
</P>
<P>
   The Rams say the Titans have the league's best secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``That must be a smokescreen,'' Bishop said. ``We do like
challenges. Our motto is that if we go down, we're going to go down
fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   No team has more depth at cornerback than the Titans. Samari
Rolle, who may be the most underrated defensive player in the
league, and Denard Walker are starters. Steve Jackson, a nine-year
veteran, comes off the bench with Dainon Sidney and rookie Donald
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   The safeties are Bishop and Anthony Dorsett, the latter of whom
has replaced the injured Marcus Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run so many different schemes,'' Bishop said. ``You have to
have the right personnel to run our defense. You have to have great
cover corners and great pass rushers in this type of scheme. That's
definitely what we have, and that's why we're here today.''

<P>
   Humankind used to produce two or three geniuses per century.
Now, it gives us a couple of dozen per month. Last November's
Genius issue of Esquire showcased those men and women
``transforming our civilization,'' including the NBA point guard
Allen Iverson and the brilliant Leonardo _ not Da Vinci, but
DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   Today, everyone and his dog is a genius. (Literally: Barnes &AMP;
Noble shoppers can buy ``Caninestein: Awakening the Genius in Your
Dog.'') The coin of genius is now so frequently minted that it has
all the value of the Botswanan pula.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this inflation more evident than in current comic
cinema. ``Comic genius'' Jim Carrey (Time magazine) appears as
``comic genius'' Andy Kaufman (The New Yorker) in ``Man on the
Moon.'' Last year's ``Bowfinger,'' starring and written by ``comic
genius'' Steve Martin (The Washington Post) was powered by a
dual-character performance by ``comic genius'' Eddie Murphy (USA
Today).
</P>
<P>
   The malevolent ventriloquist played by ``comic genius'' Bill
Murray (The New York Observer) menaced multiplexes in ``Cradle Will
Rock'' while the malevolent scientist played by ``comic genius''
Mike Myers (Chicago Sun-Times) menaced his ventriloquist dummy of a
sidekick in ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   No CG has a longer CV than Robin Williams, the android star of
``Bicentennial Man.'' A computer database search of his name turns
up three times more published references to Williams as a comic
genius than to any other actor.
</P>
<P>
   When every comic actor becomes a genius, it seems, every genius
becomes a comic actor: ``comic genius'' Albert Brooks (The Alberta
Report) was born Albert Einstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genius is an overused superlative in show business,'' says
``comic genius'' Woody Allen (The New York Times) in a phone
interview. ``Lots of very talented comedians can make you laugh,
but if you think of Mozart and Picasso and Shakespeare, it's
difficult to find a comedian who rises to the level of genius. A
genius is like a sudden mutation. It's not that you get very good
and very, very good and suddenly you achieve genius. It's not
achievable in a gradual or practiced way. Somebody's just born and
hit with the magic.''
</P>
<P>
   In film, the number of genuine comic geniuses can be counted on
one hand, or, at most, on the hand-and-a-half of Harold Lloyd, who
lost several fingers to a prop explosive. Even Lloyd, whose final
clock-clinging minutes of ``Safety Last'' (1923) are the most
audaciously funny on film, does not make Allen's All-Star team:
Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, W.C. Fields, Groucho and Harpo Marx
and Peter Sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Allen had included Mae West, but called the next day and busted
her down to ``an enormously gifted performer like Bob Hope and Jack
Benny, but not a genius.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cleese can think of only one living genius of movie comedy:
Woody Allen. ``The main thing that makes people laugh now is
shock,'' says Cleese, the Minister of Silly Walks, from his car
phone on the Pacific Coast Highway. ``The film `There's Something
About Mary' had funny stuff, but lacked the classical structure,
evenness of tone and precision of comic genius. I kind of ache for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen does, too. ``I don't really want to put the knock on
people, but many current comedies that are considered great are
not,'' he says. ``I don't find them funny.''
</P>
<P>
   They're both right. There are enough ``comic geniuses''
panhandling for approval in theaters these days to fill the Academy
of the Overrated, the purgatory Allen created for the
not-great-enough in ``Manhattan'' (1979). A performer, after all,
can be clever and resourceful without being a genius.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin, who excels at playing exaggerated oafs, can't help
that an elephant caravan of blather now attends his every artistic
endeavor _ in movies, theater and belles lettres. ``His humor is
more Flaubert than Dreiser,'' the New Yorker editor David Remnick
has hyperventilated about the co-star and co-writer of (cough,
cough) ``Three Amigos!'' But Martin's humor is also more Jerk than
Tramp, more rimshot than Rimbaud. He often seems uncomfortable when
not doing shtick.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Brooks, who once told an interviewer that the
overwrought exhibitionists he plays are not ``insecure,'' they're
``vulnerable''; they're not ``whiny,'' they're ``pleading.''
``Follow your feelings'' is the Brooksian mantra _ in ``The Muse''
his noodge did, probing deep beneath a hardened pseudo-intellectual
exterior to expose a gooey pseudo-intellectual interior.
</P>
<P>
   There's no there behind Brooks' despair, as there is with, say,
Allen or Bill Murray, whose swaggering cynicism elevated
``Groundhog Day'' (1993) from a one-trick ``Twilight Zone'' episode
into a pleasing meditation on mortality and misery. Sadness clings
to Murray like a monkey on a racehorse, and still he wins us over
with the sincerity of his world-weary insincerity.
</P>
<P>
   The insincerity of Robin Williams' cloying sincerity _ in films
from ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' (1987) through ``Patch Adams''
(1998) _ has won him a worldwide audience of enablers. Even
President Clinton cannot speak Williams' name without first
conceding his CG, as if he were a Supreme Court appointee, entitled
to the honorific. But then Clinton, with his I-feel-your-pain
sanctimony, is practically Williams' alter-ego.
</P>
<P>
   The politician in Williams has won out over the manic Jonathan
Winters manque of ``Mork and Mindy.'' ``Williams wants to save the
world with laughter,'' wrote the film critic David Denby. ``He has
tried to free the spiritually imprisoned, loosen our tongues,
loosen our bowels _ he's become a purgative of second-rate
feelings, a twinkly, husky-voiced leprechaun, funneling
counterculture mush through New Age mush.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is free to make his own career choices, but his
attendance is not required at the genius ball.
</P>
<P>
   Saving the world with laughter is so powerful a pretension that
Williams, Jerry Lewis and Roberto Benigni have all accepted the
ultimate double-dare _ finding comic expression in Nazi oppression.
It worked better for Benigni (``Life Is Beautiful'' won him an
Oscar) than the others (for sheer chutzpah, the Polish
ghetto-blaster Williams played in ``Jakob the Liar'' was topped
only by _ there is no other phrase for it _ the concentraton camp
counselor Lewis portrayed in ``The Day the Clown Cried,'' a 1972
film so egregious and exploitative that it has never been
released).
</P>
<P>
   The critic Andrew Sarris has argued that when Lewis became
conscious of his own art _ about the time he became a genie comique
in France _ his aspirations exceeded his ability.
</P>
<P>
   This messianic impulse, Cleese says, is almost always ``doomed
to failure.'' (The director Frank Capra on how the silent screen
comedian Harry Langdon lost his innocence and his audience: ``The
trouble was that high-brow critics came around to explain his art
to him.'') Myers is eminently aware of his art _ he can recite Da
Vinci's ``Seven Tenets of Genius'' in Italian _ but has so far
resisted the impulse to become an artiste.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``When a comedian tries to do more significant things, very
often he strikes out,'' agrees Allen, who has himself sometimes
seemed lost in half-baked homages to foreign masters. ``The urge to
try to do more, is healthy. In comedy, the quickest way to death as
an artist is to repeat a successful formula over and over. The
other is a slower way to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen started reaching for significance about the time of
``Annie Hall'' (1977). ``I don't want to make funny movies any
more,'' says the melancholy filmmaker he plays in ``Stardust
Memories'' (1980). ``They can't force me to.'' He became so
immersed in the claustrophobic culture of New York that when he
attempted an amiable confection like ``Manhattan Murder Mystery''
(1993), he was like a pitching ace who had lost his rhythm. It was
a little painful watching him and Diane Keaton become middle-aged,
acting out his favorite old movies. One Ingmar Bergman per century
is enough.
</P>
<P>
   All art is the same, said Samuel Beckett: an attempt to fill an
empty space. Great art _ say, Beckett's tragicomedy ``Waiting For
Godot'' _ is inherently subversive, shaking us out of our cozy
assumptions, forcing upon us fresh perspectives.

<P>
   German funnyman Bertolt Brecht wrote: ``Don't be comfortable.''
But art requires more than discomfiting an audience. No comedian
disturbed a crowd more than Andy Kaufman, subject of the current
biopic ``Man on the Moon.'' He was less interested in amusing his
fans than in abusing them, by turning the conventions of television
comedy inside-out.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, subverting the traditions of television gag writing
is hardly worth the time or energy. One might say Kaufman staged a
devilish coup, elaborately plotted, to oust a third-grade class
president. In doing so, he aspired to show, as Carrey told
Newsweek, that comedy ``doesn't even have to be funny. It can be
weird or ironic.'' This is preposterous. ``If it's not funny,''
says Cleese, ``I don't think you can call it comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure whether Kaufman was deliriously subversive
or merely delirious. ``There's a connection between neuroses and
great comic talent,'' says Cleese. ``There's also a difference
between comic genius and mental illness.''
</P>
<P>
   The director Michael Curtiz once said: ``Nobody should try to
play comedy unless they have a circus going on inside.'' By that
definition, Carrey, alone among contemporary comedians, appears
possessed of the genius gene. The clinical insanity that seems to
afflict him onscreen is itself a form of subversion.
</P>
<P>
   A high school dropout with a truly wretched childhood, he is the
lone contemporary comedian with a pedigree to match the geniuses in
Allen's pantheon. All six came up from poverty, had little formal
schooling and sandpapered their technique in music halls. Carrey is
the only working actor save Murray who can keep a sinking comedy
afloat. Williams (``Mrs. Doubtfire'') and Martin (``The
Out-of-Towners'') just punch holes in the hull.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey exerts his own gravitational pull on the often ordinary
films he appears in, defying moviegoers to take their eyes off him.
Stanley Kubrick may as well have been speaking of Carrey when he
said, ``The quality that distinguishes him from other great comic
actors is his ability to transform the horrifying and grotesque
into unforgettable comic invention.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick was speaking of Peter Sellers, whom he directed in two
of the actor's masterworks, ``Dr. Strangelove'' and ``Lolita.'' His
work in the latter was the most richly subversive comic performance
in film history, undermining the work of two other geniuses.
</P>
<P>
   In the minor role of Clare Quilty, Sellers ignored the script of
Vladimir Nabokov, and so seduced Kubrick that he made the movie his
own. ``He wasn't like you and me,'' Lolita says of Quilty in the
penultimate scene. ``He wasn't a normal person. He was a genius.''
</P>
<P>
   In assuming three sharply different characters _ playboy
playwright, ingratiating cop, and the school psychologist Dr. Zempf
riffing on ``the irrationality of rationality'' _ Sellers seizes
the production by its ankles and shakes out all its change. No one
is more unsettled than James Mason, who plays Humbert Humbert:
faced with Quilty's genius, he is faced with Sellers' genius, which
makes both actor and character profoundly uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   The audience can fairly feel his flop sweat, for the classically
trained Mason spends much of the film looking terrified _ as if, at
any moment, he will be ground in the gears of Sellers' diabolical
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Playing Chauncey Gardiner in ``Being There,'' Sellers somehow
filled the screen with his emptiness. His absence of personality
made him a formidable presence. The dichotomy is difficult to
deconstruct, but then so is the theory of relativity. ``Sellers
goes to the deep core of what's funny,'' says Allen. ``His
funniness was the funniness of genius. What he had to offer was
clearly gold.''
</P>
<P>
   In comedy, of course, one man's gold is another's (Shecky)
Greene, which makes isolating the genius gene all the more
difficult. ``I saw `Broadway Danny Rose' and sat for 45 minutes
waiting for the film to begin,'' Cleese says. ``It seemed to me an
extremely boring movie. Yet it's Steve Martin's favorite Woody
Allen film.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen himself is unawed by Laurel and Hardy. ``I appreciate
Hardy because there's something amusing to me about his constant
intolerance of and disgust with and hostility toward his partner,''
he says. ``The other guy, scratching his head and crying, never
made me smile.''
</P>
<P>
   When Stan Laurel can be dismissed, by one who should know
better, as The Other Guy Scratching His Head, what hope have
Jacques Tati or Mel Brooks of ever sitting at comedy's grownup
table? Brooks' gift is in mining a genre _ the western, the horror
film _ for every mote of comic possibility, just as Myers' ``Austin
Powers'' movies are a comprehensive package tour of the '60s spy
caper. ``Mel Brooks is an intellectual gentle giant,'' offers
Myers. ``He uses his intellect to be wonderfully and deliciously
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly _ or should we say, ``soitainly'' _ there is such a
thing as lowbrow brilliance, or what's Curly Howard for? The best
dipstick for gauging a comic's depth is involuntary laughter. By
that standard, Myers' Austin Powers is a formidable comic creation,
as was the Nutty Professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Lewis has the capability to be very, very funny:
physically, charismatically,'' Allen concedes. ``You see how deeply
audiences have responded to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even allowing for a nyuck-nyuck knucklehead like Curly, our
candidates for geniushood are all white males, few of them still
drawing audiences, and almost none still drawing breath. What's
more, they are white American and European males, the only kind
that are approved in any great number for worldwide audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Surely there is some unknown Cantinflas of comedy out there, the
beacon of his or her talent hidden beneath a bumblebee suit on
Mexican television. But we have yet to see that CG, and quite
likely never will. This reflects, more than anything, the bigotry
of American movies and culture. It has nothing to do with ability,
and everything to do with access and opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   This unhappy fact was not lost on the actress and screenwriter
Mae West, whose saloon singer purrs in ``She Done Him Wrong''
(1933): ``Men's all alike, married or single. It's their game. I
just happen to be smart enough to play it their way.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's leering overlords let West strut her stuff for only
a few films before the Hays Office stepped in and made her an
honest (and far less humorous) woman. ``Women in general have been
kept in a different cage over the years,'' Allen says, ``and it is
only comparatively recently that they've been given the freedom and
social acceptance to be comedians. It's the same with blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pryor _ the profane Jackie Robinson of comic cinema _
was devoured and mainstreamed by Hollywood's makeover machinery.
That same machinery was implicated in the industrial accident
involving Eddie Murphy, Pryor's protege, whose sharp corners were
sheared off by a buzzsaw of buddy flicks.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor's most memorable work was in standup; his best films are
footage of his uncinematic stage act. Which raises another point.
There have, undoubtedly, been comic geniuses in other performance
fields. But Jonathan Winters, whom Allen anoints as the peerless
genius of standup, ``didn't have an ambition to be in movies,''
Allen says. ``He just never seemed to be interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Television's most inspired sketch artists (Sid Caesar, Ernie
Kovacs, Butthead) were often dazzling in the fierce run of five
minutes, but exhausting and impersonal for much longer. Cleese
claims the only ``true'' comic genius he ever met was Peter Cook of
the satiric revue ``Beyond the Fringe.'' ``In stage monologues,
Peter could saw it off by the yard,'' Cleese says.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, genius has something to do with doing it much more
easily than others. Peter's problem was that it came
(italics)too(end italics) easily.'' But Cook, who died in 1995,
could not transfer his genius to film, the most difficult parlor
trick and, for the comic actor, the ultimate test of comic genius.
</P>
<P>
   Cleese's Monty Python troupe was even more giddily sublime on
film than on television. The Flying Circus performed its
convention-defying loops and turns in three features, launching
aerial assaults on pomposity, gentility and the odd wet fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pythons were a periodic table of the elements of comedy,''
says Myers. ``If you distilled almost any of my comic ideas down to
its molecular level, you'd be left with something from Python.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleese seems to have distilled his comic ideas down to
sub-atomic quarks. He laments that the film ``Monty Python and the
Holy Grail'' was ``terrific for the first 40 minutes and the last
30, but soft in the middle.'' And he reckons structuring a movie
that lasts 90 minutes is 30 times harder than plotting a
five-minute sketch and 20 times harder than a half-hour sitcom.
``It's difficult to be consistently funny,'' he says. ``The great
geniuses each only produced two or three movies tops that were
classics.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin learned to make comedies when there was no one to learn
from. He was comedy's Columbus, discovering new worlds that
comedians will still be colonizing for as long as pratfalls are
projected on screens. Today, the Little Tramp's influence runs like
a shared memory through nearly every film comedic creation, from
Ace Ventura to Deuce Bigalow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe Chaplin was aware of creating a new vocabulary
for film comedy,'' says Allen. ``He just happened to be that
gifted, that superb. Very few have taken that extreme leap into a
realm that is undefinable and unexplainable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tramp made his transcendant leap in ``City Lights'' (1931).
``Chaplin tried to do something a little more dimensional than
slap-around Mack Sennett comedy,'' says Allen. ``City Lights was
funny and also tragic. Some think it's sentimental, but to me, it's
an honest film about love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``City Lights'' is an ostensibly simple tale: the Tramp courts a
blind flower girl and tries to impress her by pretending he's a
millionaire. At the end of the film, she finally sees the
mysterious benefactor who paid for the operation to restore her
sight.
</P>
<P>
   The flower girl watches in amusement as a newsboy pulls a rag
from the tattered trousers of the Tramp, who scolds the kid, blows
his nose on the rag, folds it neatly and tucks it into his vest
pocket. ``She recognizes who he must be by his shy, confident,
shining joy as he comes silently toward her,'' James Agee wrote in
1949. ``And he recognizes himself, for the first time, through the
terrible changes in her face. The camera just exchanges a few quiet
close-ups of the emotions which shift and intensify in each face.
It is enough to shrivel the heart to see, and it is the greatest
piece of acting and the highest moment in movies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``City Lights'' is, to be sure, a work of comic genius, but even
that phrase proves inadequate. With its final close-ups, it sheds
the modifier like a baby does its umbilical cord and becomes, alone
among film comedies, a work of just-plain genius.

MARKET PLACE: AN UNBALANCED SCALE IN BCE-NORTEL TRANSACTION
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ever heard of BCE Inc.? If so, you are probably
Canadian. Own BCE stock? If so, you were probably very happy on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ever heard of Nortel Networks Corp.? If so, you are probably
among the broad range of investors who have profited from the boom
in the communications equipment market. Own Nortel stock? You were
probably far less than happy on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Call it ``A Tale of Two Shareholder Bases,'' one that
underscores some of the financial imbalances that can emerge as
certain parts of the communications industry grow far faster than
others.
</P>
<P>
   BCE, a Canadian holding company that emerged from the Bell
Canada phone carrier, said Wednesday that it would distribute
almost all of its 39.2 percent interest in Nortel to BCE's nearly
500,000 investors.
</P>
<P>
   For those half-million people and institutions _ or at least
those in Canada _ the announcement was tantamount to a windfall.
BCE, which holds interests in communications and media companies
across Canada, contends that its current valuation does not reflect
the combined worth of its many units by at least $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distribution of the Nortel Networks shares will begin to
unlock significant and sustainable value for BCE shareholders,''
Jean C. Monty, BCE's chief executive, said in a statement. ``Nortel
Networks' stellar performance has overshadowed the underlying value
of BCE's other assets.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``This transaction will allow the market to more
accurately reflect the value of BCE's communications services
business.''
</P>
<P>
   He may well be right. BCE's shareholders are to receive 0.78
share of Nortel, North America's No. 2 maker of telecommunications
equipment after Lucent Technologies Inc., while keeping all of
their BCE shares. In the long run, shares of BCE may well lose some
of their value, of course, because they will no longer reflect the
Nortel stake.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts believe that in total, BCE's shareholders will
do quite well.
</P>
<P>
   BCE's shareholders south of the Canadian border, however, will
not do quite as well. About 6 percent of BCE's stock is owned by
investors in the United States and they, unlike their Canadian
counterparts, will incur a tax liability under the deal. For
Canadian shareholders the deal will be tax-free. For U.S.
investors, however, the distribution of Nortel shares will be
treated as a taxable dividend, Montreal-based BCE said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. shareholders are urged to consult their tax or financial
advisers in this regard,'' BCE's statement said, somewhat
ominously.
</P>
<P>
   But the chagrin of BCE's U.S. investors might well be exceeded
by that of Nortel's existing shareholders, no matter their
nationality. (About 60 percent of Nortel's publicly traded stock is
held by U.S. investors.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It has absolutely no day-to-day impact on the operation of the
company,'' said Eric C. Buck, an analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette. ``But obviously once this distribution is made, it will
create shareholders that weren't necessarily owning it for the
purpose of owning Nortel.''
</P>
<P>
   The point is that some of those 500,000 new Nortel shareholders
may well sell the stock. BCE is largely known as a stable,
value-oriented stock that is largely geared to communications
services (rather than equipment) and that pays a healthy dividend
of about 85 cents a share. Nortel is a more volatile,
growth-oriented stock based on the communications equipment
business that pays a relatively small dividend of about 21 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   As put by Timothy Luke, an analyst for Lehman Brothers, ``You
have all these conservative service-provider shareholders who now
have a 75 multiple tech stock.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, shares of Nortel, which is based in Brampton, Ontario,
have been trading at a multiple of its estimated earnings of closer
to 80.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, there may well be a lot of investors who bought BCE
as a way to participate in Nortel's growth. They would not seem
likely to sell. And some of the Canadian institutional investors
who hold BCE are probably quite comfortable holding Nortel stock.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Wednesday, John A. Roth, Nortel's chief
executive, said, ``A lot of the BCE shareholder base are in fact
big funds, and when you look at the distribution, many funds hold
both Nortel and BCE.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Stix, an analyst for SG Cowen Securities, said that
some Canadian index funds may in fact have to buy more Nortel stock
in order to reflect the company's larger public shareholder base
after the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Wednesday's deal will probably work to Nortel's
benefit by allowing investors to buy its stock without wondering
what impact BCE would choose to have on the company down the road.
After the distribution, it does not appear that any investors will
own more than 5 percent of Nortel.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not quite how investors were thinking about it on
Wednesday. After reports of the deal emerged at about 2:30 p.m. and
before trading in both stocks was halted, BCE's shares surged while
Nortel's fell. Shares of BCE ended the day at $99.50, up $4.50, on
the New York Stock Exchange while Nortel's fell $5.0625, to
$99.9375.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Budge, the red-haired athlete who helped redefine the terms
of his sport by becoming the first player to win the Grand Slam of
tennis in 1938, died Wednesday in Scranton, Pa. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Budge was injured Dec. 14 in northeastern Pennsylvania when the
car he was driving struck a tree in the Pocono Mountains and went
off the road. He had to be cut from the wreckage and was
hospitalized in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., until Jan. 8, when he was
transferred to a nursing home in Scranton.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Oakland, Calif., on June 13, 1915, John Donald Budge
came to tennis as a teen-ager already enamored of more
rough-and-tumble sports like football and soccer, which had been
dear to the heart of his Scottish father. When he decided to
concentrate on tennis, he brought a big man's bravado to the game
and by the age of 19 had been selected to represent his country in
international Davis Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
   One of the early practitioners of power tennis, which has come
to dominate today's game, the 6-foot-2-inch Budge was probably the
first player to use his backhand _ along with a crunching serve,
smash and forehand _ as an attacking stroke. In fact, his rolled
backhand changed tennis technique, and his overall excellence
earned him distinction as one of the best to ever play the game.
</P>
<P>
   His size, strength and bulldog tenacity allowed him not only to
outmuscle his opponents, but also to occasionally batter them into
submission, much as he did when he dismissed Henry W. Austin of
Britain in a mere 66 minutes in the 1938 Wimbledon final.
</P>
<P>
   Budge initially distinguished himself as the major threat to
Fred Perry of England, the reigning No. 1 amateur, when he reached
the 1936 Wimbledon semifinals at the age of 21 as well as the final
of that year's U.S. Nationals. But Budge's raw power was tamed by .
</P>
<P>
   Once Perry turned professional in 1937, the boyish, affable
Budge not only inherited his mantle as the world's top amateur, but
also began staking his claim to the coveted Grand Slam crowns,
which at that time were closed to professionals. The major
tournaments did not allow professionals to compete until 1968, when
the U.S. Nationals became the U. S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Budge captured both Wimbledon and the U.S. Nationals in 1937,
received the Sullivan Award as the nation's top amateur athlete,
and helped his country keep its Davis Cup championship in 1938.
Budge completed a stellar Davis Cup career with a record of 19-2 in
singles and 6-2 in doubles. He reached his career apex in terms of
drama, tension and match-playing flourish in the fifth and decisive
match of the 1937 Davis Cup Interzone final against Gottfried Von
Cramm of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bill Tilden, the tennis champion who was coaching
the German team at the time, Budge's heroic comeback stood as ``the
greatest match ever played.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the tennis superb, but the event had implications
far beyond sport. ``War talk was everywhere,'' Budge recalled in a
book by the tennis writer and historian Bud Collins. ``Hitler was
doing everything he could to stir up Germany. The atmosphere was
filled with tension although Von Cramm was a known anti-Nazi and
remained one of the finest gentlemen and most popular players on
the circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition was played at Wimbledon before a rapt audience
that included Queen Mary and Jack Benny, to name two. Just before
Budge and Von Cramm took to Center Court with the series tied at
2-2, Von Cramm received a supportive telephone call from Adolf
Hitler that proved unsettling to both players.
</P>
<P>
   Budge rallied from two sets down to even the match, but then
fell behind again, this time into a 4-1 fifth-set deficit.
Abandoning caution, the American charged the net behind fierce
returns of Von Cramm's serve and twice broke back to pull even at
4-4. As daylight began to fade, the score went to 5-5, and 6-6.
Then Budge again broke Von Cramm's serve and edged ahead for the
first time, 7-6. The German fought off five match points on Budge's
serve; on the sixth, Budge capped a prolonged rally with a lunging
forehand winner that sent the victor to the ground. Game, set and
match to the United States: 6-8, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team went on to win the Davis Cup for the first time
since 1926 by defeating Britain in the final. Von Cramm was sent to
a concentration camp in 1938, and Budge later appealed for his
release.
</P>
<P>
   Despite offers to turn professional in 1938, Budge elected to
preserve his amateur status to help keep the Davis Cup; he also, in
an understated campaign he referred to as ``something of an
afterthought,'' became the first player to capture all four Grand
Slam events within a calendar year. Budge won the Australian,
French, Wimbledon and U.S. Nationals with the loss of only one set
overall in the four finals.
</P>
<P>
   After fulfilling his dream of defending his Wimbledon title that
year, the 23-year-old Budge gave himself a typically low-key
accolade: ``I never played better,'' he said after trouncing
Austin,6-1, 6-0, 6-3, ``but it was just one of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one other man, Rod Laver, another redhead, has repeated
Budge's feat on the Grand Slam front. Laver, an Australian, won the
Grand Slam while an amateur in 1962, and then repeated his feat
seven years later after the tournaments had been opened to
professional players.
</P>
<P>
   After his 1938 victories, Budge vaulted to legendary status, and
comparisons invariably arose between him and the century's greatest
previous star, Tilden.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said there was little doubt in Tilden's mind as to who
was the better overall player. ``I consider him,'' Tilden said of
Budge, ``the finest player 365 days a year who ever lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Trabert, who in 1955 won Wimbledon, the French Open and the
U. S. Nationals, the only man besides Budge and Laver to accomplish
that feat in a single year, said of Budge: ``He stands tall in the
record books. He had a lot of self-confidence as well as one of the
game's all-time weapons in his backhand. His backhand was what we
called a concluder, the sort of shot people will still be talking
about a hundred years later.''
</P>
<P>
   Budge won a total of 14 Grand Slam tournament titles: six in
singles, four in doubles and four in mixed doubles.
</P>
<P>
   And his tennis life did not end after he turned pro in late
1938. In his pro debut at Madison Square Garden in 1939, he
defeated Ellsworth Vines. All told on the pro circuit, Budge posted
a winning record against Vines, Perry and Tilden, and he defeated
Bobby Riggs in straight sets for the 1942 U. S. Pro title.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, Budge enlisted in the Army Air Forces; an
injury to his right shoulder during military training hurt his
playing style. Budge reached his last U.S. Pro final in 1953 and
was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport,
R.I., in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Budge is survived by his second wife, Loriel, and two sons,
David of Los Angeles and Jeffrey of Boston.

 &HT;    Report says Jefferson likely fathered 6 children by slave
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The foundation that owns Monticello, the Virginia home
of Thomas Jefferson, acknowledged Wednesday that the nation's third
president was ``most likely'' the father of six children with his
slave Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation in
Charlottesville, Va., is the most sweeping evidence in the dispute
over whether Hemings' descendants deserve the same recognition as
Jefferson's white heirs.
</P>
<P>
   The report now goes to the all-white Monticello Association.
After a rancorous annual meeting last May attended for the first
time by black descendants, the association decided to study whether
to extend membership to Hemings' kin.
</P>
<P>
   Dues-paying association members have the right to be buried in
the Monticello Graveyard. The president who wrote the Declaration
of Independence, including the phrase ``all men are created
equal,'' is buried in the fenced cemetery on a hillside near his
slave-built plantation.
</P>
<P>
   The debate goes beyond burial rights, bringing into focus the
controversy of slavery and mixed race in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about the unwillingness of white Southerners to admit
that slaves, despite the fact that they were not citizens and they
were viewed as property, contributed in such an enormous way to the
founding of this country,'' said Lucian Truscott IV, 52, a
Jefferson descendant who invited Hemings' heirs to the
association's meeting last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hemings thing is a symbolic bubble,'' said Truscott, a Los
Angeles writer.
</P>
<P>
   One of Hemings' descendants, Marietta, Ga., businessman Lantz
Balthazar, said he hopes for an amicable resolution in the
Jefferson dispute that would signal progress in race relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is probably a lot more mixing of the races than people
thought,'' said Balthazar, 64, descendant of one of Hemings' sons,
Madison. ``If we are all of the same blood, it is hard to get mad
at yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Balthazar said the foundation's report ``vindicates the belief
that I grew up with, my family's history'' that they descended from
Jefferson and Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   History recorded her as the president's fair-skinned companion
after his wife, Martha, died in 1782 from childbirth complications.
Spurring the Jefferson-Hemings debate, a 1998 DNA study by
Charlottesville scientist Eugene Foster found that Jefferson ``was
the most likely person to have fathered Eston Hemings,'' Sally's
youngest child.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's report by the foundation considered that DNA study,
as well as historical documents and African-Americans' oral
history.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, the foundation said, indicate ``a high probability
that Thomas Jefferson fathered Eston Hemings, and he most likely
was the father of all six of Sally Hemings' children appearing in
Jefferson's records.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jefferson's records, Hemings gave birth to six
children, including two who died in infancy. The surviving children
were Beverly, Harriet, Madison and Eston.
</P>
<P>
   James Truscott, the Monticello Association's president and uncle
of Lucian Truscott, said he wasn't prepared to accept the
foundation's report as evidence that the association should open
its membership to Hemings' descendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Ross Perot would say, the devil is in the details,'' said
Truscott, 69. ``We haven't seen the details yet.''

FRANCE TELECOM TO BUY OUT ITS PARTNERS IN GLOBAL ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ France Telecom S.A. will pay $4.3 billion
to take control of Global One, the struggling provider of worldwide
telecommunication services that it started four years ago with
Sprint Corp. and Deutsche Telekom A.G.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ends a three-way partnership that began with ambitious
visions but was later plagued by an unwieldy management structure
and feuding, especially between the French and German phone
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also removes a potential snag in MCI/Worldcom's
agreement to acquire Sprint for $108 billion.
</P>
<P>
   One provision of the Global One deal calls for France Telecom
and Deutsche Telekom to sell their respective 10 percent stakes in
Sprint to MCI/Worldcom; they acquired those stakes when the three
companies formed Global One in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, in turn, agreed to sell its stake in Global One to
France Telecom for $1.13 billion and the repayment of $276 million
in debt. Deutsche Telekom will sell its stake to France Telecom for
$2.75 billion in cash and repayment of $188.5 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   The move is a gamble for France Telecom, because Global One is
still losing millions of dollars despite revenue of more than $1
billion. But the timing could prove fortunate because the explosion
of e-commerce and corporate networking are creating a booming
demand for high-performance fiber optic networks.
</P>
<P>
   All three partners have said that Global One should have only
one owner, and they had hoped to reach an agreement by the end of
January. The big question was who would buy out whom, and at what
price.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the parent companies have acknowledged that one of
Global One's biggest problems has been its unwieldy management
structure. Because the three owners could veto each other on many
decisions, the company was slow in developing a coherent strategy
for adapting to big changes.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's chief executive, William J. Esrey, began prodding his
partners to change the structure nearly two years ago. Executives
at Deutsche Telekom said they were equally frustrated and now use
Global One as an object lesson in the problems with taking minority
stakes in other companies.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom had shown more interest than Deutsche Telekom in
Global One. The French carrier has been eager to hasten its
international activities ever since it abandoned a partnership with
its German counterpart in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Bon, the chief executive of France Telecom, has never
forgiven Ron Sommer, the chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, for
making a surprising though unsuccessful bid last year to merge with
Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   But France Telecom stumbled badly last month. After having
reached an agreement to take control of the German mobile telephone
network E-Plus, the French plans were derailed when the BellSouth
Corp., a minority shareholder, was able to invoke its contractual
rights to increase its stake.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's decision to pull out of Global One stems from its
forthcoming acquisition by MCI/Worldcom, which is building its own
global networks and was already a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement to DPA, the German press agency, Sommer of
Deutsche Telekom praised the agreement as a reasonable solution to
an unworkable situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution we have found today is consistent with our goals
of maximizing shareholder value,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Brussels, Global One says it has about 30,000 customers
in 40 countries. But the company has consistently failed to earn a
profit, and its most recent chief executive _ Gary Forsee, a
longtime Sprint executive _ quit last year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides MCI/Worldcom, Global One's biggest competitor is now the
alliance between AT&AMP;T Corp. and Britain's dominant carrier, British
Telecommunications.

<P>
   During last year's Super Bowl, partygoers could rack up another
advantage over fans who attended the game. Not only did television
watchers save the price of admission, get all the munchies they
could eat and have a chance to critique the latest batch of
million-dollar commercials, but they could also see exactly where
the first-down stripe was.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of squinting at linesmen, chains and poles, home viewers
could see a computer-generated yellow stripe across the field,
marking the line that the offensive team had to cross to make a
first down.
</P>
<P>
   This simple addition to football broadcasts, introduced on Sept.
27, 1998, in a game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Cincinnati
Bengals, has been well received by viewers: a 1999 Harris poll
found that 92 percent of football fans wanted to see the virtual
first-down strip in future broadcasts. And so they have. Since that
first broadcast, by ESPN, all the sports networks have hustled to
adopt the technology.
</P>
<P>
   They have had a choice of two companies to do the job:
SporTVision, whose 1st &AMP; Ten system is the choice of ESPN and ABC,
which will broadcast Super Bowl XXXIV on Sunday from Atlanta; and
Princeton Video Image, whose orange-colored First Down Line is used
by CBS and several international broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Adding the line to a game broadcast is an impressive feat of
logistics and engineering. It takes surveying equipment, special
video cameras, a rack of computers and a staff of operators to
insert a simple line and change it every time a first down is made.
And it takes impressive computing power to generate and overlay the
line: SporTVision's system uses a dedicated PC and four Silicon
Graphics workstations, while Princeton Video Image's system uses a
proprietary multiprocessor video editing computer called L-VIS,
(pronounced Elvis) for live-video insertion system.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies' systems receive raw video feeds from the three
main cameras used in all broadcasts _ at the 20-, 50- and 20-yard
lines _ as well as the video feed from the network's production
unit that is about to go out over the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The raw video feeds are used to generate the image of the line,
but it is the network's feed _ which includes the score, the game
time and the network logo _ that is the final target for the
virtual line.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for that arrangement is time: the virtual first-down
line can take around half a second to generate, so it should be the
last thing that is done before the video feed goes to the network
studios for broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   For the first-down line to be acceptable to fans, it must look
as natural as a yard marker painted onto the grass or artificial
turf. To achieve that, the focus and perspective must be exactly
right _ which is why each of the three ``up'' main cameras at the
stadium are equipped with sensors that precisely measure the
cameras' pan and tilt angles, and levels of zoom and focus. By
comparing this information with a 3-D computer model of the
stadium, the video production systems can generate a realistic
video overlay 30 times a second that will appear natural, neither
sharper nor more blurred than the rest of the picture, and will
seem to stay in place as the camera moves.
</P>
<P>
   When the offensive team makes a first down, a crew member on the
field calls in the location of the marker, and a computer operator
in the video production outpost enters the measurement into the
system. The graphics workstations generate a precise position and
dimensions for the line, using information from the 3-D computer
model and the live camera's positioning sensors. It continues to
update that information as the camera pans to follow the action.
</P>
<P>
   Overlaying the line onto the broadcast image is the last stage
of production, and it is no simple feat. The process is similar to
chroma-keying _ the trick used in weather reports where the
broadcaster stands in front of a solid green or blue screen, and a
weather map is superimposed electronically onto the screen. But
that process is simple compared with the first-down-line overlay.
</P>
<P>
   Regular chroma-keying replaces a single key color with an
overlaid image, but the grass or turf on a football field contains
a range of colors, from shadowy dark greens to mud brown, and the
colors can change as daylight fades or as clouds pass in front of
the sun. A dedicated operator needs to tell the system to overlay a
range of field colors while excluding the colors of the teams'
uniforms (predominantly blue and gold for the St. Louis Rams and
light and dark blue for the Tennessee Titans in the Super Bowl on
Sunday) so the players will appear to step over the line. As the
game progresses, the operator monitors changes in light and enters
any color changes into the system.
</P>
<P>
   A processor- and labor-intensive process like that does not come
cheap. Although both companies and the networks they work for are
silent on the subject, most estimates place the cost per game of
adding the virtual first-down line at tens of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology is not just being used as a customer service
_ it also generates revenue. SporTVision's patents prominently
mention the system's benefits for adding advertising to on-screen
``dead space.'' CBS uses Princeton Video's technology to do that
every day, overlaying virtual advertisements on Manhattan
cityscapes during the ``Morning Show.'' CBS even used it to obscure
an NBC billboard in Times Square during the recent coverage of the
New Year's Eve celebration _ something the news anchor Dan Rather
later said he regretted.
</P>
<P>
   The technology has also been used in some baseball broadcasts to
put virtual advertisements on the backstop behind home plate. But
you are not likely to see a first-down line dotted with corporate
logos. The National Football League controls the Super Bowl, and
while it has approved the virtual first-down line, it is adamantly
opposed to showing a lot of logos on screen.

MEN SENTENCED IN ELABORATE CHEATING SCHEME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DONNA HUFFAKER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Describing their crime as an insult to everyone
who studies legitimately, a Los Angeles Superior Court Judge on
Wednesday sentenced two men to a year of home detention for their
intricate cheating scheme on the Law School Admissions Test.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Larry Paul Fidler disagreed with the prosecutor's
recommendation of state prison for one of the defendants and said
he believes both men are one-time offenders who are going to have
this felony on their records for the rest of their lives -- lives
that will never be lived as attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Danny Khatchaturian, 24, and Dikran Iskendarian, 23, who
live in the city of Glendale in Los Angeles County, must pay nearly
$97,000 in restitution along with a third defendant to the Law
School Admissions Council.
</P>
<P>
   Khatchaturian and Iskendarian pleaded no contest in November to
conspiracy, theft and robbery in the Feb. 8, 1997 incident.
</P>
<P>
   In an elaborate scheme that involved alphanumeric pagers and
exploiting time zone differences, Khatchaturian and Iskendarian
took the law school admissions exam in Hawaii three hours after a
third defendant, Ashot Melikyan, stole a test booklet from the
University of Southern California Testing Center, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   While Melikyan, 24, of Glendale, was in the testing room at USC,
he grabbed the booklet from a proctor who chased Melikyan until
Melikyan pulled a knife on him and escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Melikyan, who pleaded guilty in October to second-degree
robbery, registered for the test by using a fake ID. Khatchaturian,
who attended USC and Iskendarian, who attended Woodbury University
in Burbank, paid Melikyan $600 to steal the LSAT booklet so they
could have the correct answers transmitted via pager while they
took the exam in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Khatchaturian and Iskendarian flew together to the University of
Hawaii-Manoa Testing Center, where a test proctor noticed the men
paying more attention to their pagers than to the exam.
</P>
<P>
   Both Khatchaturian and Iskendarian scored in the 99th percentile
-- a rare feat scored typically by students who go on to attend
Harvard, Yale and Stanford, said Deputy District Attorney Loni
Petersen. When both men took the test again without cheating their
scores plummeted to the 40th percentile.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Khatchaturian lowered his head during testimony
and the prosecutor's arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of criminality should not be minimized,'' Petersen
said. ``This was not a stupid mistake or a moment of folly.''
</P>
<P>
   Petersen compared the defendants' criminal sophistication to
that of stealing corporate secrets or robbing a bank.
</P>
<P>
   A statistician who testified Wednesday likened the defendants'
acts to not just hacking in to someone's computer but inserting a
virus into a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Because the admissions council was unable to re-use the test, it
incurred a loss of $600,000 -- the value of an entire test, council
representative James Vaseleck testified. From that figure, Fidler
used $40,000 -- the value of one part of the exam -- and added
court fines to derive the $96,719 amount the three defendants must
pay collectively.
</P>
<P>
   Saying his client lost his judgment while under extreme pressure
to excel, Armand Arabian told the court Khatchaturian was a student
with a 3.7 grade point average who displayed the ``fragility of
humanity.'' Outside of court, Arabian said Fidler's sentence was
just.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client is getting his life back together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Khatchaturian was expelled from USC after the incident and is
working in property management.
</P>
<P>
   As for Iskendarian, defense attorney Christopher Armen agreed
with Fidler's ruling, which allows both defendants to spend a year
in a home monitoring program as long as they are eligible. If not,
they must spend the time in Los Angeles County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Khatchaturian and Iskendarian were also sentenced to five years
probation.

 &HT;    Leaders `declare interdependence' at 360.00 Summit
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After a day of loud music, slick videos, comic
props, giveaway sneakers and an abundance of talk, a few hundred
high-tech executives Wednesday committed to create a ``network''
that brings them in closer touch with community issues and
activists.
</P>
<P>
   The group, participants in the 360.00 Summit, agreed to support
the Austin Network, which will attempt to connect leaders in the
tech community with the community groups involved with issues that
concern them.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers Steve Papermaster and Peter Zandan said their network
is not another civic organization or community group. ``Austin has
enough organizations,'' Zandan said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the network is seen as a way to link high-tech
executives, who have talent and money, with issues and
organizations that need both.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new community here that clearly wants to be a part
of something,'' said venture capitalist Joe Aragona, one of the
attendees. ``We need for people to commit to do things. It takes a
commitment to build a community.''
</P>
<P>
   The invitation-only conference at the Four Seasons Hotel
unveiled a ``Declaration of Interdependence'' that supported more
involvement in four areas: quality of life, social equity,
diversity and entrepreneurship and assisting government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Details have yet to be worked out on exactly how the Austin
Network will operate, just who will be involved and how its success
will be measured.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who stood up and pledged their involvement in the
network were Jan Lindelow, chief executive of Tivoli Systems; Robin
Rather, a market research executive and environmental activist;
Bill Bock, chief executive of Dazel Corp.; Lisa Sharples,
co-founder of Garden.com; Bob Fabbio of TL Ventures; Joe Aragona of
Austin Ventures; and former Dell Computer Corp. president Lee
Walker. Participants at the conference said they attended because
they are worried that Austin's tremendous economic success is
eating away at its special strengths, including its quality of
life. Sixty-seven percent of the participants answered ``no'' when
asked during the conference if Austin's quality of life was
improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have become an honest-to-God boomtown,'' said Fortune
magazine managing editor John Huey, a guest speaker at the event.
``It's going to grow. You can't stop it and it isn't always going
to be pretty.'' The daylong event involved an interspersing of
serious discussion, irreverent high jinks and demonstrations of
real-world clout.
</P>
<P>
   Participants tackled subjects ranging from Austin's home-grown
technology strengths, the increasingly difficult search for
talented workers and the area's lack of enough bars and venues for
live music as prosperity complicates the economics of the
entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
   Zandan and Papermaster donned catchers' masks to become practice
targets for whiffle ball throwers, but most of the whiffle balls
were directed toward the empty chair that was supposed to be
occupied by no-show Joe Liemandt, the chief executive of Trilogy
Software Inc., who had been scheduled to be a panelist.
</P>
<P>
   The quickest response of the day came from Austin Independent
School District Superintendent Pat Forgione, who arrived at the
conference in the afternoon after previously saying he was too busy
to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Forgione's attendance was prompted by a David Letterman-style,
live conference call to his office asking why he wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   Conference organizers honored Neal Kocurek, a co-founder of
Radian Corp. and president of St. David's Health Care System, for
his longtime involvement in civic issues.
</P>
<P>
   They also welcomed into the fold University of Texas President
Larry Faulkner, who had been a whiffle ball target at last year's
conference. Faulkner received a Platinum Whiffle Ball Award for
UT's rapid progress in collaborating with high-tech business groups
in the past year. Faulkner pledged that theschool will continue to
work in partnership with the area's technology businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And at the end of nine hours of discussion and frivolity, 90
percent of participants voted to have the summit convene again next
year.

ABORTION ISSUE FOLLOWS McCAIN AFTER `FAMILY DECISION' STATEMENT 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ John McCain, campaigning for the Republican
presidential nomination as an abortion opponent, said Wednesday he
would not forbid his 15-year-old daughter from terminating a
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator who has promoted parental-consent laws
quickly said he had ``misspoken'' and insisted that he and his
wife, Cindy, would make any final decision on what to do if his
daughter Meghan were to become pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the remarks dogged him at an evening televised
debate among the GOP candidates, where opponent Alan Keyes accused
him of not understanding the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you tell her she could not have an abortion?'' a
reporter asked McCain on the campaign bus that the candidate has
dubbed the ``Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' McCain replied. ``I would discuss the issue with Cindy
and Meghan and this would be a private decision that we would share
with our family and not with anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added: ``Obviously, I would encourage her to know that
that baby would be brought up in a warm and loving family. But the
final decision would be made by Meghan with our advice and
counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after a portion of the exchange was broadcast on
CNN, which had a crew aboard the bus, McCain was on the phone with
a reporter to try to correct the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I misspoke,'' the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed I was saying and intended to say is that this is a
family decision. The family decision will be made by the family,
not by Meghan alone. And other than that, I believe that it is a
private family matter. I'm sorry if there was any confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobbed by reporters during a later campaign stop at a Manchester
restaurant, McCain added: ``Cindy and I will make that decision.
It's a family decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, obviously growing irritated at repeated questions, McCain
asked one reporter, ``What's the matter with you, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   At the debate, he appeared aggravated by the attack from Keyes,
a strong abortion opponent, and during one of his final
opportunities to speak, he snapped: ``I've seen enough killing in
my life. I know how precious human life is, and I don't need a
lecture from you.'' McCain, a veteran, spent several years as a
prisoner in North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes earlier said the ``family decision'' statement displayed a
profound lack of understanding of the basic issue of principle
involved in abortion.'' He suggested that McCain should ``just say
no'' to any contemplation of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it God's choice that protects the life of that child in
the womb?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   McCain replied that he was proud of his anti-abortion record and
added, ``I will not draw my children into this discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents were believed to be responsible for
better-than-anticipated showings by publisher Steve Forbes and
Keyes in the Iowa caucuses Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is expected to be less significant in New Hampshire,
where McCain is battling Iowa winner George W. Bush in the last
week of campaigning before the first-in-the-nation primary.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has repeatedly recounted his anti-abortion record in
Washington, his opposition to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that
legalized the procedure and his support for legislation to ban
partial-birth abortions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's views on abortion are similar to those of Bush. But
Tuesday the Arizona senator drew a distinction from the Texas
governor by saying he would support changing the Republican Party
platform to allow abortions in cases of rape or incest or when the
mother's life was endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, so far, said he supports the Republican Party platform,
whose anti-abortion plank has no exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   At an earlier campaign appearance in Hollis, N.H., McCain said
his proposed tax cut would remain the same, despite a large
increase in the projected federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has been in a pitched battle with Bush over the tax
issue, said he believed most Americans _ particularly those in the
key nominating state of New Hampshire _ would rather use a larger
surplus to make deeper reductions in the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, McCain warned, economic forecasts are uncertain, and
the latest projection also assumes that Congress will stick to the
balanced budget agreement, which it violated last year.

STATE PRESENTS SMOG-CUTTING PLAN IN NORTH TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NEIL STRASSMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ More than 200 people jammed the first of four
public hearings in Fort Worth-Dallas on the proposed state plan to
cut smog in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental advocates said the state plan is not tough enough
on industry, and speakers from the business community said it is
too tough on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy people signed up to speak at the hearing Wednesday night
at the Irving Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   The most impassioned plea came from 12-year-old asthmatic Josh
Schonborn of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make much sense to me that I should have to stay
inside when the air is bad,'' Josh said, who has been hospitalized
31 times because of his respiratory illness.
</P>
<P>
   The state plan calls for lowering highway speed limits by 5 mph,
tougher vehicle smog tests and emission standards, cleaner fuels,
less pollution from cement kilns and power plants, energy-efficient
building standards and banning the early morning use of heavy
diesel construction equipment and other measures.
</P>
<P>
   The objective of the broad smog-cutting plan developed by the
Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, the state's
environmental agency, is to reduce ozone smog in North Texas below
the federal health standard for ozone by 2007, a deadline set by
the federal Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a paper fix that doesn't get there,'' said state Rep. Lon
Burnam, D-Fort Worth. ``But we have a right to expect our public
officials to act in the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Other elected officials spoke in favor of the plan, but some
were critical of the construction equipment ban, saying it would
hurt growth in the Metroplex.
</P>
<P>
   ``To restrict work hours does nothing to end pollution. It will
increase safety hazards and costs,'' North Richland Hills City
Councilman Oscar Trevino said.
</P>
<P>
   DeSoto Councilman Jim Filyaw said there should be greater
emissions cuts required from the cement kilns in Ellis County.
``The largest polluter in the Metroplex is to the south of us in
Midlothian,'' Filyaw said.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative plan proposed by environmental groups such as the
Sierra Club, Public Citizen and Downwinders at Risk calls for
greater cuts from industry and questions the construction ban and
the enforcement and efficacy of lower speed limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is fatally flawed,'' James White, an Arlington
architect, said.
</P>
<P>
   White said he supports stricter emissions standards for power
plants and cement kilns but said that the construction ban could
put small contractors out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The state agency is expected to consider the comments from the
hearings and approve a final plan in April, which is to be
submitted to the EPA before May 1. If the state does not submit an
acceptable plan, the EPA could withhold hundreds of millions of
dollars in federal highway funds and impose tough environmental
restrictions on new or expanding businesses.
</P>
<P>
   As proposed, the plan shows North Texas barely squeezing under
the ozone standard by the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone is formed when nitrogen oxides, a combustion byproduct,
mix with volatile organic chemicals, such as gasoline vapors, in
warm sunlight during summer months. It is especially harmful to
children and the elderly, whose emphysema and asthma can be
worsened by smog.
</P>
<P>
   The Metroplex has consistently violated the ozone health
standard over the past 20 years posting no less than four
violations in any year. Metropolitan areas are not supposed to
violate the standard more than three times in any three-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicles produce roughly half the Metroplex's nitrogen oxides
emissions, and a major goal of the plan is to reduce miles traveled
in the Metroplex.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative proposed by clean-air advocates seeks an 80
percent reduction in pollution from the Ellis County cement kilns,
doubling the state's proposed 40 percent reduction, and an 88
percent reduction from power plants outside the four-county
Metroplex, instead of the proposed 50 percent cut. It also seeks a
stronger state-backed program to replace the dirtiest equipment and
polluting diesel engines.

 &HT;    Taxes, education points of critical exchange in GOP debates
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Arizona Sen. John McCain and Gov. George W.
Bush got into tense exchanges on education, tax policy and campaign
finance reform in a nationally televised debate Wednesday, just six
days before the critical New Hampshire GOP presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's debate, the eighth featuring all the major GOP
contenders, was the last before New Hampshire Republicans go to the
polls next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show McCain with a slight lead on Bush. But in an
attempt to keep it a three-man race, publisher Steve Forbes _ fresh
from a surprisingly strong second-place finish in Iowa _ also took
aim at Bush, charging that Texas has lost ground under the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   A McCain win in New Hampshire would put the first serious chink
in Bush's front-runner status. The Texas governor won the Iowa
caucuses Monday by taking 41 percent of the vote. McCain did not
compete in Iowa, but Forbes poured a lot of time and effort into
the campaign and finished second with 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The field was reduced to five on Wednesday when Utah Sen. Orrin
Hatch, who finished last in Iowa, withdrew and endorsed Bush.
Former Reagan aide Gary Bauer and conservative talk show host Alan
Keyes, a surprise third-place finisher in Iowa, also are still in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   On tax policy, Bush and McCain continued their philosophical
battle. Bush favors using more of the projected federal surplus for
tax cuts than does McCain, who wants to use more to shore up Social
Security, Medicare and attack the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``In good times, not bad times, we should give Americans a tax
break,'' said McCain. ``They need it. But at the same time, people
in New Hampshire are telling me, `Senator McCain, save Social
Security, put some money into Medicare and pay down that debt and
don't put that burden on future generations of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said good times call for his larger tax cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we ought to use this time of prosperity to get money
out of Washington and into the pockets of the taxpayers,'' said
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problem with your plan is that (money not used for tax
cuts) is going to be spent on bigger government,'' he told McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Bush's attitude is evidence of a belief that the
president is a ``hapless bystander'' in the budget process.
</P>
<P>
   ``An active president of the United States, me, will veto bills
and threaten to shut down government to get them to spend less
money,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush lobbed the ultimate Republican insult at McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore would have written your plan, Mr. Senator,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain responded in kind: ``If you're saying that I'm like Al
Gore, then you're spinning like Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush touched off another exchange by asking McCain why he does
not support a Bush plan to use test results to help measure where
federal education dollars should be spent. Bush wants federal aid
for education of low-income students to be cut off from
low-performing districts and used for alternatives such as
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with your (plan),'' McCain told Bush, ``is you
give too much power to the federal bureaucracy in Washington. I
want the states to make those decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to use funds from public education. I don't want to
take funds from public education. I want to take it from the
(government) subsidies you support,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Replied Bush, ``So you support continuing spending money on
(education for low-income students) without any measurement.''
</P>
<P>
   On campaign finance reform, McCain's pet issue, he charged the
Bush campaign with being just the kind of operation that needs to
be curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are setting up soft money to be used, at least according
to media reports, in the general (election) campaign,'' said
McCain. ``My friends, we have got to fix this system before it
lurches out of control and young Americans won't take part in the
political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush scolded McCain, saying, ``I don't appreciate the way you
characterized my position. I'm for reform.'' He said the problem
with McCain's plan is that it could hurt the GOP by not reining in
labor money that flows to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes assaulted Bush's record in office. He said state spending
and payroll has gone up while education suffered and tax cuts
missed the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you tell the people of New Hampshire that you won't
do in Washington what you've done in Texas,'' Forbes asked Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Texans have given him high grades by re-electing him
last year with about 70 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many half stories,'' he told Forbes about his allegations,
``so little time.''

threats would stop if we didn't publicize them. They're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about getting pub licity; it's about getting a day
off. Besides, we long ago passed the point where every schoolkid in

 ARIZONANS PLACE 1ST AS COUCH POTATOES  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Arizonans rank first for stay ing put _ staying put
on the couch, that is.
</P>
<P>
   A new U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey
finds that Arizona is last in the nation in physical activity,
prompting the state Department of Health Services on Wednesday to
declare an ``epidemic'' of inac tivity.
</P>
<P>
   The number of adult Arizonans who said they engaged in some &UR; kind
of leisure-time physical ac tivity dropped from 76.3 percent in
1994 to 48.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The report follows the CDC's finding last fall that Arizona has
the nation's lowest percentage of obese adults. Public health ex
perts say they are stumped about Arizonans' apparent ability to
stay skinny by doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps we're not getting off the sofa to go to the refrigera
tor,'' state epidemiologist Norm Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Utah had the high est percentage of adults who are
physically active: 82.9 percent. The national average is 70.9 per
cent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tim Flood, medical direc tor for Arizona's Bureau of Pub lic
Health Statistics, said reasons for being sedentary could range
from increasing dependence on automobiles, the Internet, televi
sion and video games and people's concerns about their safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lives are becoming so convenient,'' Flood said. ``We are
all turning into couch potatoes and office potatoes.'' &QL;

BRADLEY APPEARS RELUCTANT TO ATTACK, BUT HIS SPOKESMEN CRITICIZE
GORE
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Bill Bradley repeatedly declined an
invitation to criticize Vice President Al Gore, his rival for the
Democratic presidential nomination, on a radio broadcast here
Wednesday morning, telling his host that he believed such attacks
undercut democracy and weakened his appeal as a candidate for
national office.
</P>
<P>
   But less than three hours after Bradley's demurral, he
dispatched two high-profile Democrats to a news conference where
they assailed Gore with the kind of intensity typically reserved
for members of the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., suggested that Gore was guilty of
putting fund-raising over national security by soliciting money
from foreign sources. And Niki Tsongas, the widow of Paul Tsongas,
the Massachusetts senator who won the 1992 Democratic presidential
primary here, called Gore's attacks on Bradley unfair and said they
``undermined the trust that the American people have in the office
of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   The sequence of events suggested some confusion in Bradley's
campaign about how to proceed strategically. After his 2-to-1 loss
in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, Bradley has been under increasing
pressure from his supporters to take the case against Gore the way
Gore has taken the case against him, but he has seemed for the most
part reluctant to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's posture Wednesday morning seemed to dumbfound Dan
Pierce, who interviewed him on WGIR from the Merrimack Restaurant
on Elm Street.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce began by noting that Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., had argued in endorsing Bradley last year that Gore could
not win a general election in November. ``Is it appropriate to
hammer away at that theme?'' Pierce inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is,'' Bradley responded tentatively. ``I think
ultimately what the Democratic primary is trying to find is someone
who can beat the Republican in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce said he did not understand why Bradley was not pushing
Gore about suggestions of fund-raising abuses in the last election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more important to give people something to vote for, than
to vote against,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as Bradley was done, his advisers handed out a
sheath of papers citing articles and quotations by journalists
criticizing Gore for distorting Bradley's record in attacking him,
such as by charging that Bradley had favored the elimination of
Medicaid. ( Bradley supports replacing Medicaid with a larger
health insurance program that would cover more people.) And they
arranged a news conference where Kerrey and Mrs. Tsongas joined
together in 30 minutes of attacks on the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``What distresses me somewhat about Senator Gore, Vice President
Gore's campaign is the manner in which they are distorting his
record, particularly in the area of health care,'' Mrs. Tsongas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey said it was ``not an honest campaign.'' And he went on to
raise the very issue that Pierce had suggested should be used
against Gore. ``There were agents of foreign governments invited to
the White House for coffee, and at least the impression was given
that meeting the targets of fund-raising objectives was more
important than national security.''
</P>
<P>
   But the news conference did not go precisely to plan. Kerrey and
Mrs. Tsongas were instantly pressed to explain the apparent
discrepancy between what Bradley was saying, and what they were
doing. At first Kerrey fell back on what had been the explanation
offered by Bradley's aides: that he was uncomfortable with such
politics, and that it would be complicated at this point to embrace
the very kind of politics he had been denouncing for much of the
last six months.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Kerrey shrugged and offered another explanation. ``No
two snowflakes are alike, you might have noticed,'' Kerrey said
with a thin grin. ``I wouldn't conduct the campaign the same way
that Bill has chosen to conduct a campaign.''

SUN PLANS TO START SHIPPING OPERATING SYSTEM NEXT MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Moving to maintain its hold on the Internet, Sun
Microsystems Inc. said Wednesday that Solaris 8, the latest version
of its operating system, would ship on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's announcement comes as the Microsoft Corp. prepares to ship
Windows 2000, its strongest challenge yet to Sun's domination of
high-powered server computers for delivering Internet services, on
Feb. 17. Windows 2000, the latest version of Windows NT,
Microsoft's operating system for corporate networks, is meant to
answer criticism that NT is not robust, secure or reliable enough
for the demands of World Wide Web servers.
</P>
<P>
   Sun has flourished on the Web. It is the system of choice for 75
percent of Internet service providers, in large part because of the
reliability of Solaris.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sun reported record quarterly revenue, which it
attributed to strong sales in the Web market. Its stock closed
Wednesday at $78.625 a share, down $4, in NASDAQ trading.
</P>
<P>
   Chris LeToq, an analyst with the Gartner Group, said: ``Sun
understands very clearly what they're driving at, and it's owning
the high-reliability service space. What Sun is saying, and I
believe them, is the requirements for that kind of server are
moving up even as we speak.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Solaris was ``four to five years ahead of Windows
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun said the new version had been tested by 140,000 volunteer
users since November. Solaris 8 is a 64-bit operating system that
runs on either Sun's Sparc chips, or the coming 64-bit
microprocessor from the Intel Corp.; Windows 2000 is a 32-bit
operating system that runs on current Intel and compatible chips.
Processing data 64 bits at a time speeds many kinds of database and
graphics applications.
</P>
<P>
   LeToq said that he expected a 64-bit version of Windows 2000
some time next year, but that the first version would not be
designed for servers, only workstations. Microsoft has not
announced a release date for a 64-bit product.
</P>
<P>
   In a response to the Linux operating system that is available
free over the Internet and the growth of the ``open source''
movement among programmers who believe that source code should be
freely available to anyone to work with, Sun said it would make the
source code of Solaris 8 free to software developers.
</P>
<P>
   Source code is the underlying computational instructions that
make software work; it is normally not visible or available to
users. Solaris and Linux are both variations of the Unix operating
system first developed by the AT&AMP;T Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Sueltz, president of Sun's Sunsoft unit, said
individuals and corporations developing software for internal use
``can have access to the code for free.'' But she added: ``Once you
offer commercial access, then we want a licensing fee. That way we
can assure compatibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predicted that the move would have little impact on
Linux users and that developers would more likely be held back by
the cost of purchasing a Sun workstation than by the cost of a
software license for developing programs that run on Solaris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would describe that as a minuscule effort,'' LeToq said.
``Sun has always had a tight relationship with the educational
community, so if you were an educational institution, you were able
to look at the source. I don't see much difference between that
arrangement and what they have now.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Budge, the red-haired athlete who helped redefine the terms
of his sport by becoming the first player to win the Grand Slam of
tennis in 1938, died Wednesday in Scranton, Pa. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Budge was injured Dec. 14 in northeastern Pennsylvania when the
car he was driving struck a tree in the Pocono Mountains and went
off the road. He had to be cut from the wreckage and was
hospitalized in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., until Jan. 8, when he was
transferred to a nursing home in Scranton.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Oakland, Calif., on June 13, 1915, John Donald Budge
came to tennis as a teen-ager already enamored of more
rough-and-tumble sports like football and soccer, which had been
dear to the heart of his Scottish father. When he decided to
concentrate on tennis, he brought a big man's bravado to the game
and by the age of 19 had been selected to represent his country in
international Davis Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
   One of the early practitioners of power tennis, which has come
to dominate today's game, the 6-foot-2-inch Budge was probably the
first player to use his backhand _ along with a crunching serve,
smash and forehand _ as an attacking stroke. In fact, his rolled
backhand changed tennis technique, and his overall excellence
earned him distinction as one of the best to ever play the game.
</P>
<P>
   His size, strength and bulldog tenacity allowed him not only to
outmuscle his opponents, but also to occasionally batter them into
submission, much as he did when he dismissed Henry W. Austin of
Britain in a mere 66 minutes in the 1938 Wimbledon final.
</P>
<P>
   Budge initially distinguished himself as the major threat to
Fred Perry of England, the reigning No. 1 amateur, when he reached
the 1936 Wimbledon semifinals at the age of 21 as well as the final
of that year's U.S. Nationals. But Budge's raw power was tamed by
Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Once Perry turned professional in 1937, the boyish, affable
Budge not only inherited his mantle as the world's top amateur, but
also began staking his claim to the coveted Grand Slam crowns,
which at that time were closed to professionals. The major
tournaments did not allow professionals to compete until 1968, when
the U.S. Nationals became the U. S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Budge captured both Wimbledon and the U.S. Nationals in 1937,
received the Sullivan Award as the nation's top amateur athlete,
and helped his country keep its Davis Cup championship in 1938.
Budge completed a stellar Davis Cup career with a record of 19-2 in
singles and 6-2 in doubles. He reached his career apex in terms of
drama, tension and match-playing flourish in the fifth and decisive
match of the 1937 Davis Cup Interzone final against Gottfried Von
Cramm of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bill Tilden, the tennis champion who was coaching
the German team at the time, Budge's heroic comeback stood as ``the
greatest match ever played.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the tennis superb, but the event had implications
far beyond sport. ``War talk was everywhere,'' Budge recalled in a
book by the tennis writer and historian Bud Collins. ``Hitler was
doing everything he could to stir up Germany. The atmosphere was
filled with tension although Von Cramm was a known anti-Nazi and
remained one of the finest gentlemen and most popular players on
the circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition was played at Wimbledon before a rapt audience
that included Queen Mary and Jack Benny, to name two. Just before
Budge and Von Cramm took to Center Court with the series tied at
2-2, Von Cramm received a supportive telephone call from Adolf
Hitler that proved unsettling to both players.
</P>
<P>
   Budge rallied from two sets down to even the match, but then
fell behind again, this time into a 4-1 fifth-set deficit.
Abandoning caution, the American charged the net behind fierce
returns of Von Cramm's serve and twice broke back to pull even at
4-4. As daylight began to fade, the score went to 5-5, and 6-6.
Then Budge again broke Von Cramm's serve and edged ahead for the
first time, 7-6. The German fought off five match points on Budge's
serve; on the sixth, Budge capped a prolonged rally with a lunging
forehand winner that sent the victor to the ground. Game, set and
match to the United States: 6-8, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team went on to win the Davis Cup for the first time
since 1926 by defeating Britain in the final. Von Cramm was sent to
a concentration camp in 1938, and Budge later appealed for his
release.
</P>
<P>
   Despite offers to turn professional in 1938, Budge elected to
preserve his amateur status to help keep the Davis Cup; he also, in
an understated campaign he referred to as ``something of an
afterthought,'' became the first player to capture all four Grand
Slam events within a calendar year. Budge won the Australian,
French, Wimbledon and U.S. Nationals with the loss of only one set
overall in the four finals.
</P>
<P>
   After fulfilling his dream of defending his Wimbledon title that
year, the 23-year-old Budge gave himself a typically low-key
accolade: ``I never played better,'' he said after trouncing
Austin,6-1, 6-0, 6-3, ``but it was just one of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one other man, Rod Laver, another redhead, has repeated
Budge's feat on the Grand Slam front. Laver, an Australian, won the
Grand Slam while an amateur in 1962, and then repeated his feat
seven years later after the tournaments had been opened to
professional players.
</P>
<P>
   After his 1938 victories, Budge vaulted to legendary status, and
comparisons invariably arose between him and the century's greatest
previous star, Tilden.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said there was little doubt in Tilden's mind as to who
was the better overall player. ``I consider him,'' Tilden said of
Budge, ``the finest player 365 days a year who ever lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Trabert, who in 1955 won Wimbledon, the French Open and the
U. S. Nationals, the only man besides Budge and Laver to accomplish
that feat in a single year, said of Budge: ``He stands tall in the
record books. He had a lot of self-confidence as well as one of the
game's all-time weapons in his backhand. His backhand was what we
called a concluder, the sort of shot people will still be talking
about a hundred years later.''
</P>
<P>
   Budge won a total of 14 Grand Slam tournament titles: six in
singles, four in doubles and four in mixed doubles.
</P>
<P>
   And his tennis life did not end after he turned pro in late
1938. In his pro debut at Madison Square Garden in 1939, he
defeated Ellsworth Vines. All told on the pro circuit, Budge posted
a winning record against Vines, Perry and Tilden, and he defeated
Bobby Riggs in straight sets for the 1942 U. S. Pro title.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, Budge enlisted in the Army Air Forces; an
injury to his right shoulder during military training hurt his
playing style. Budge reached his last U.S. Pro final in 1953 and
was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport,
R.I., in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Budge is survived by his second wife, Loriel, and two sons,
David of Los Angeles and Jeffrey of Boston.

CAMPO `COMFORTABLE' CHOICE FOR COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Dallas Cowboys' hiring of Dave Campo was the hot
topic at Super Bowl XXXIV on Wednesday. Reaction was the same:
Campo might not be the biggest name the Cowboys could have hired,
but he was the best choice for Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Campo has been with the team 11 seasons, including the past five
as defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the circumstances, he was the best they could do,'' said
ESPN analyst Joe Theismann, a former quarterback for the Washington
Redskins. ``In a perfect world, were there other people Jerry would
have liked? Probably. But as I look at the people out there that I
say could coach the Dallas Cowboys and bring them back to where
Jerry wants them to be, I would have said Dave Campo would have
been No. 1 on my list.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he interviewed no other candidates before deciding on
Campo as the Cowboys' fifth head coach. In truth, there were not
many other choices.
</P>
<P>
   Texas coach Mack Brown and University of Miami coach Butch Davis
were among those who denied interest in the job, and Miami Dolphins
assistant head coach Dave Wannstedt, Washington Redskins head coach
Norv Turner and St. Louis Rams offensive coordinator Mike Martz
quickly became unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's the comfortable choice when you look at Dallas'
situation,'' said ESPN analyst Ron Jaworski, a former quarterback
for the Philadelphia Eagles. ``It would have been very difficult to
bring an outsider in with an entire staff already in place, and
tell a guy, `This is the staff you have to work with.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it the wise choice? Only time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo replaces Chan Gailey, who was fired two days after the
Cowboys ended their season with a 27-10 loss to the Minnesota
Vikings in an NFC wild-card playoff game. Jones mentioned Gailey's
``offensive philosophy'' as a reason for Gailey's termination. The
Cowboys (8-9) ranked 16th in the league in total offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hired him, huh? As head coach?'' New York Giants
cornerback Jason Sehorn said. ``Their choices of head coaches are
definitely interesting. Maybe they know something none of the rest
of us know.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's their defensive coordinator, right? They fired Gailey
because he wasn't offensive minded enough, so they hire a defensive
coordinator as the head coach? The thought process there is really
making sense to me now. So what do they do now, hire Gailey back as
offensive coordinator?''
</P>
<P>
   New England Patriots quarterbacks coach Jack Reilly could become
the Cowboys' offensive coordinator. Reilly runs a version of Don
Coryell's offense, which the Rams used to score the third-most
points in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to put an offense in there for Troy Aikman,'' said
ESPN analyst Jim Kelly, a former quarterback with the Buffalo
Bills. ``They need an offense that he'll strive in and something
that will give him some freedom to do what he does, because he's
too good of a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning around the Cowboys won't be easy. They haven't been a
Super Bowl contender since their fifth championship, which came
four years ago in Super Bowl XXX.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Michael Irvin is contemplating retirement after
injuring his spine in the third game this season. Cornerback Deion
Sanders, who will have his contract voided because it would count
$12.7 million against the salary cap next season, could end up with
another team next season if he plays football.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof in the pudding is three years from now or whatever
it may be, let's see what happens. Then you judge the move,'' said
Gil Brandt, the former director of player personnel for the
Cowboys. ``I think he has a hard time because I think they've got
some holes to fill, and they've got some big decisions to make. A
lot of that is out of Campo's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaching used to be my ability to outcoach you. Now, it's my
organization to out-organize your organization to out-sign and to
out-recruit you.''

FORBES CHALLENGES BUSH ON HIS RECORD IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Clearly emboldened by his strong second-place
finish in the Iowa caucuses, Steve Forbes sought to use the
Republican debate here Wednesday night to put the front-runner,
George W. Bush, on the defensive, arguing that Bush's record as
governor of Texas was not as glowing as Bush portrays it to be.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was not the only one to criticize Bush, but his
accusations that education in Texas had gotten worse and that
government spending had increased under Bush were the criticisms
that seemed to hit the hardest. Bush paused for several seconds
during his response.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many half stories, so little time,'' the governor said of
Forbes' recitation of what he saw as Bush's failures. He said
Forbes was getting his record entirely wrong and cited his
re-election in 1998 as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the people of Texas took a look at my record,'' Bush
said, ``and they said, `Mr. Governor, we accept your record,' and
they overwhelmingly voted me back in office. I got nearly 70
percent of the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last Republican debate before the New Hampshire primary
on Tuesday, there were equally tense exchanges between Bush and
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who are locked in a tight battle here.
</P>
<P>
   This was the two candidates' final shot at each other in a
public forum, and they did not squander it, squabbling in
particular over which one of them would be the truest enemy of
bigger, more bloated, less-honest government.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has made several proposals for altering the federal
government's role in education, asked McCain why he did not support
more accountability for schools that received additional federal
funds for teaching disadvantaged children. Bush noted that another
prominent critic of the plan was Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're saying that I'm like Al Gore,'' McCain shot back,
``then you're spinning like Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that what he wanted to do was take some of the money
that the federal government was using to subsidize such programs
and industries as ethanol in Iowa and sugar in Florida and put it
in education. He said that Bush supported those subsidies, clearly
attempting to portray him as a guardian of government pork.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush promoted his proposal for a $483 billion tax cut over
the next five years as an insurance policy against too much money
in Washington and too much unnecessary federal spending. McCain's
plan for a tax cut is more modest than Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   This debate, sponsored by CNN and WMUR-TV in Manchester, was the
seventh since early December to feature all of the contenders for
the Republican presidential nomination, although that field had
narrowed to five from six with the withdrawal Wednesday of Sen.
Orrin Hatch of Utah.

SPORTS COLUMN: NAMES TO BANK ON GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You would have to have been here to appreciate the
scene: Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky and John Elway. The impeccably
dressed Jordan, the conservative Gretzky and the workmanlike Elway
stand shoulder to shoulder. They selected the Super Bowl to promote
their new e-commerce venture: mvp.com.
</P>
<P>
   This was Day 3 of the Super Bowl hype, but only Day 1 of Elway's
new business venture. He proudly told the audience that the site
went online Wednesday at 12:30 p.m. He said that the company just
sold its first product _ a pair of cross-training shoes _ for $35.
``This is a $300 million athlete apparel business out there,''
Elway said when asked why he started this new venture. ``We want to
be a big piece of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl has so many twists and turns, so much to get
into, so much to avoid. Finally there's the game. Later Elway
agreed that the actual game increasingly becomes secondary to the
commerce surrounding the game. There are two Super Bowl realities.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's first Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos was following
the 1986 season. ``It was big back then, but the magnitude its gone
to now and the way that business just flocks at it, it's turned
into such an entertainment _ the game's almost secondary,'' he
said. ``There's so much stuff going on around it, so many
opportunities around it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of the Super Bowl, in the minds of players that
have not gotten there, the Super Bowl gets bigger and bigger each
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway said that after his first three Super Bowls he began to
venture out and explore all the business going around the game.
``The last two I played in were a lot easier because you didn't
feel like you were missing something by staying in your room.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway knew this Super Bowl was the place to start his new
venture. The Super Bowl is part zoo and part carnival, with writers
and broadcasters walking around with large nets trying to catch
stories in bunches. He was right. A healthy cast of the news media
was drawn, in large part, by Jordan and Elway. This time last year
he was part of the circus, leading Denver to its second straight
Super Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   As Elway sat next to Jordan and the Great, but retired Gretzky,
you could feel the synergy on display: The NBA, the NHL, and the
NFL seated at one table at pro football's great circus. Gretzky was
struck by the magnitude of it all. ``This is pretty spectacular,''
he said. ``This is kind of the goal of the NHL to get to a level in
America that football is at. We're way behind now.''
</P>
<P>
   The oddest element of all was that the NFL would allow these
interlopers from other sports on its premises. Except that this was
John Elway. At any rate, this was a good image to project at a time
when each league has had to deal with a blemish. Officials cringe
every morning for fear of news that one player or another has
gotten into trouble. By comparison, mvp.com is a welcome addition.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's new business is a 21st century version of the Sears
catalog, except it exists in space. ``The big difference is that
you don't have to lift a catalog,'' said John Costello, the mvp.com
chief executive officer and a former Sears executive. Elway had the
original idea to form a sports and recreation e-commerce site with
a Florida-based firm. The relationship fell apart. Three months ago
Elway got Benchmark Capital to put up the investment money. He
approached Gretzky and then Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Five days ago I sat in another crowded room at the MCI Center as
Jordan was introduced as part owner of the Washington Wizards.
Wednesday he sat in Atlanta with Elway, Gretzky and Costello.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jordan had to rush off to attend to what Elway called a
personal matter. Or a personnel matter with his Wizards. Maybe
fire-a-coach dot com. or trade-a-player-dot com.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, each year the Super Bowl gets engulfed by a larger
morass of advertisement and commercialism. The Super Bowl is part
circus and increasingly part carnival, replete with medicine men
selling new wares.
</P>
<P>
   On its big stage, three retired great ones _ Elway, Jordan and
Gretzky _ are trading on names and banking on reputation: in their
sports lives they were known for deftly using sticks, basketballs
and footballs, not for selling them. What's a name worth? We're
about to find out.

 &HT;    Candidates more aggressive with words during debates
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ In advance of Wednesday night's big double
debate of the Republican and Democratic candidates, Sen. Orrin
Hatch's departure from the GOP presidential race barely made a blip
on the news cycle. But it had a decided impact on the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Six Republicans on stage a couple of weeks ago was a civilized
if not always animated discussion. Five was, well ... a mosh pit.
</P>
<P>
   With only six days to go before the New Hampshire primaries and
a little narrower field, this Republican debate became a good deal
more acrimonious as soon as the candidates got the chance to go at
each other.
</P>
<P>
   The fuse was lit by Alan Keyes on a question inspired by Sen.
John McCain's remarks earlier in the day, about what he'd do if his
daughter were considering an abortion. He wouldn't have given the
same answer, Keyes told McCain, if she were thinking of killing her
grandmother for the family inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been on guard after press reports about his temper,
and though the question stung, it took him a good 40 minutes before
he really blew his stack.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Steve Forbes and Gov. George W. Bush had engaged in a
sharp exchange over Bush's record on education in Texas, Gary Bauer
had mixed it up with Forbes over China, and then _ in maybe the
biggest stretch of the evening _ related Keyes' leap into a mosh
pit the other day with the Columbine murders.
</P>
<P>
   All this time, McCain had been stewing over that question about
his daughter, and in a 30-second rebuttal to another question he
let Keyes have it:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen enough killing in my life,'' the former Navy pilot
and POW told him. ``I know how precious life is and I don't need a
lecture from you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, presumably because they were only two, got a half
hour less than the Republicans. But by this point in the GOP
debates, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley had to
be sitting backstage wishing the Republicans had even more time to
cut each other up.
</P>
<P>
   It got even better. In the final 10 minutes, moderator Bernie
Shaw got into an argument with Forbes for insinuating that the
debate rules had been ignored to give Bush and McCain more time.
</P>
<P>
   After this, it seemed a bit extraneous when in the Democratic
debate that followed, the first question to Gore was whether he was
waging a ``mean-spirited campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   This gave the Democrats the regrettable incentive to waste
considerable time arguing over who was more negative than the other
before they got into their real differences over universal health
insurance, education and _ hey, come to think of it, when you get
past the negative stuff, do these two candidates really have much
to argue about?
</P>
<P>
   Not too much, apparently, because by the conclusion of the
Democratic hour, the two candidates were back to arguing over how
they argue with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Political debates are about defining the differences between
candidates. But since there is a reasonable possibility the two
Democrats, and two of the Republicans, could wind up running
together this fall, maybe there ought to be a forum that explores
what they have in common.

GORE AND BRADLEY HOLD DEBATE MARKED BY ACRIMONY AND ACCUSATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Facing questions about the vigor of his
campaign, former Sen. Bill Bradley attacked an equally aggressive
Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday night over abortion, welfare
reform health care plans that ``nibble around the edges'' and for
working ``hand in glove with special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   In their seventh debate, and one of their sharpest exchanges
yet, held just six days before the New Hampshire primary, Gore
hammered Bradley on familiar subjects, accusing him of voting with
congressional supporters of President Ronald Reagan against
children and of offering a health plan that did not do what it
promised.
</P>
<P>
   The testy, one-hour debate was punctuated with contradictions
and quarrels. Each candidate accused the other of conducting a
negative campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we believe that you will tell the truth as
president if you won't tell the truth as a candidate?'' Bradley
asked. ``Any politician can pick a fight but only a leader can move
a country forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore defended his own record against the special interest charge
when he said ``I have fought for working people against every lobby
that exists in Washington.'' And he spoke up for President Clinton,
too, saying ``People are tired of the whole discussion about the
president's personal mistake. They think that by and large he has
been a great president, in turning this economy around.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates were asked questions about their campaign
styles.
</P>
<P>
   Gore took issue when Judy Woodruff of CNN asked whether he was
running a ``mean-spirited campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing I have said in this campaign that has been
mean-spirited,'' the vice president said. He said he would `never
run a negative personal attack against my opponent.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was questioned about whether he was a tough enough
campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   He responded, ``I think politics should be a case of belief and
not tactics.'' Running a successful campaign, he added, did not
mean ``demeaning your opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the two men were given the opportunity to question
each other, Gore suggested that Bradley was responsible for setting
a negative tone to the campaign. He noted that Bradley had
criticized Gore for raising the issue, when he sought the 1988
Democratic presidential nomination, of an inmate that was released
under a Massachusetts furlough program and committed rape during
the administration of Gov. Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the one who brought Willie Horton to the campaign, but
if you're going to talk about a higher standard, you have to live
by it,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley retorted by raising the image of President Richard M.
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, let me just say when Al accuses me of negative
campaigning, that reminds me of the story about Richard Nixon. They
said Richard Nixon's the kind of politician who'd chop down a tree
then stand on the stump and give a speech about conservation. It
just won't fly.''
</P>
<P>
   During the questioning between the candidates, the tension was
immediately apparent in the nature of the questions they raised.
</P>
<P>
   Gore turned to Bradley and asked why, as a senator from New
Jersey in 1981, he had voted in favor of budget cuts and tax
reductions proposed by Reagan. Bradley defended his vote by noting
that he voted both for budget cuts and tax cuts, in what he
described as a prudent step to guard against deficit spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for those, but it was an act of leadership, I think,
once again getting ahead of the curve,'' Bradley said
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded: ``I just don't see how you can vote for Ronald
Reagan's budget cuts and than try to campaign like Robert
Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was Bradley's turn, he invoked the contest for U.S.
Senate in New York, in an effort to undercut Gore's position on
abortion rights. He asked whether he agreed with a suggestion by
Hillary Rodham Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate, that
her Republican opponent, Rudolph Giuliani, was not as strong an
advocate of abortion rights because he had changed his position on
the question over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley noted that Gore, earlier in his career, had opposed
government financing of some abortions. ``When you were in the
Congress you had an 84 percent Right-to-Life voting record. And it
seems to me that this is an issue that requires somebody to know
where they stand and to know why they stand where they stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can evolve. But your campaign shouldn't go around
saying that you've always been for a woman's right to choose,
because the record shows you have not.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded by saying that he had always supported abortion
rights, but opposed, earlier in his career, government financing in
some cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always supported Roe vs. Wade,'' Gore said, referring to
the 1973 Supreme Court case which legalized abortion. ``And let me
say that if you entrust me with the presidency, I will guarantee
that women's right to chose is protected.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They also quarreled over Bradley's vote against the welfare bill
of 1996. ``What this vote really was was a gamble for kids for
re-election,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   The questioning then turned briefly to foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he did not favor spending more for the military,
Bradley said: ``We're heading to a new age. We no longer have to
fight the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore disputed a questioner who said the Clinton administration
had not been hard enough on Russia over Chechnya. The vice
president said that as long as Russia had tens of thousands of
nuclear warheads, the most important goal this country should be to
work with Russia to reduce that threat.
</P>
<P>
   Gore challenged his opponent to support more federal assistance
for college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley replied that he favored a ``major investment'' in
community colleges, which he said were ``where most kids begin the
process of higher education.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore replied, ``We're not talking about machinery and equipment
here. We're talking about people.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates then resumed their back-and-forth over who was
engaging in negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing the vice president of running a commercial that
distorted the Bradley record, Bradley said, ``Why should we believe
you will tell the truth as president if you don't tell the truth as
a candidate?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore declared, ``There has never been a time when I have said
something I know to be untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who earlier this year had offered a relatively tepid
support of Clinton, tied himself unambiguously to the president
when asked about Clinton fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of the whole discussion of the president's
mistake,'' Gore said. He said people now think of him as a
president who had turned the country around. Late in the debate,
Bradley asked Gore about his reliance on campaign contributions
from special interests, referring to a report in Wednesday
morning's Boston Globe. ``How can you be fighting for people when
you're hand-in-glove with the special interests or are fighting
essentially against the people?'' Bradley asked.
</P>
<P>
   Gore bristled at the question: ````I'm not working hand in
glove, as you suggested there,'' he said, turning to the camera.
``If that's not negative, I don't know what is.''

GOP BALLOT FIGHT IN N.Y.   INTENSIFIES AS THE DEMOCRATS STEP IN
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The fight over Sen. John McCain's efforts to
enter the Republican primary in New York escalated to the next
battleground Wednesday when state Republicans immediately turned to
the courts after Democrats blocked their attempts to keep McCain
off the ballot upstate.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began early Wednesday morning, when Democrats on the
state Board of Elections agreed to allow McCain to appear on the
Republican ballot in eight districts where state Republican Party
chieftains had tried to block his candidacy. It spilled into a
court hearing later in the day, and drew in officials across state
government.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Democrats threatened to thwart the state Republican
Party's drive to assure an easy victory in the March 7 state
primary for their preferred presidential candidate, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas. And the feud erupted as Republicans turned on
Republicans in other regions of the state, with zealous Long Island
Republicans knocking Steve Forbes off the ballot in three
congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   In retaliation, Forbes is going after Bush's petitions to get on
the ballot in six congressional districts in New York City, a
skirmish that state party leaders had hoped to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   After the decision by the Board of Elections on Wednesday
morning, the state Republican Party responded furiously, saying
Democrats had intruded in an internal party matter and exerted
improper influence over the board. The Republican Party immediately
dispatched its lawyers to state Supreme Court here, seeking to have
the board's ruling overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey T. Buley, a lawyer for the state Republican Party,
condemned the actions by Democrats, who have fought their own
similar petition battles in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democratic leaders are doing what they can to support Al
Gore,'' Buley said. ``I am sure that the Gore people would rather
face McCain than Bush in November, but if they can't get that, they
would at least like to get McCain to bloody Bush and make him spend
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision drew support from the McCain camp, which found
itself in the odd position of profiting from the Democratic
maneuvering. Howard Opinsky, McCain's campaign spokesman, called on
state Republicans and the Bush campaign to end the ballot fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the Republican apparatchiks don't get it is
unfortunate, and it denies voters a choice they will have in all 49
other states,'' Opinsky said. ``New York Republicans deserve better
from their leadership. And George Bush could end this tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats reacted with glee at the prospect of an intramural
fight in the Republican Party. ``I'm delighted with the ruling,''
said Martin Connor, the Democratic leader in the state Senate. ``It
isn't meddling in another party's affairs when Democratic leaders
respond to calls in numerous quarters to open the process. This is
about giving rank-and-file voters a real choice in who their
party's nominee will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary dispute between McCain and the Republican state
party has been brewing for months. McCain has already filed a
lawsuit in federal court seeking to overturn a series of complex
state election rules that the party has employed to keep him off
the primary ballot in electoral districts across the state.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Republican party has sought to knock McCain off the
ballot in 16 districts, and has done so in four.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and his Republican allies contend that the rules are
fair, maintaining that they are intended to dissuade people from
mounting frivolous campaigns by ensuring that anyone who appears on
the ballot has built solid grass-roots support.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders in New York once used the state's elections
rules to prevent insurgent candidates from mounting challenges
within their party. But they have made it a bit easier for
candidates to qualify for the ballot in recent years. Both Gore and
his challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley, have spots on the ballot
across the state.
</P>
<P>
   In coming to McCain's defense, the Democrats violated a
longstanding agreement between the two major parties not to
interfere in each other's internal affairs. The state elections
board has two Democrats and two Republicans, and it takes three
votes to keep a candidate off the ballot in a district in which his
or her candidacy is challenged. In the past, both sides have
usually honored the wishes of party leaders when it involves
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, with encouragement from the state's leading
Democrats, the two Democrats on the state elections board refused
to honor challenges that the Republican State Committee had filed
against McCain in eight districts upstate. Instead, the two
Democrats, Carol Berman and Evelyn J. Aquila, abstained from the
vote, leaving Republicans without enough votes to uphold their
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Berman and Ms. Aquila repeatedly denied that
partisanship had anything to do with their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that when we stop a major candidate from being on
the ballot, whether Republican or Democrat, we embarrass the people
of New York,'' Ms. Aquila said, ``and we turn people away from
voting.''
</P>
<P>
   The day's maneuvering underscored what critics say is the
Republican Party's byzantine primary system in New York. Candidates
must collect signatures on petitions in each of the state's 31
congressional districts. The law allows petitions and signatures to
be disqualified for technical reasons, like failing to get enough
signatures in a given district.

SPORTS COLUMN: PLAYERS CAN'T DENY FAIR WARNING
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NFL has suffered enough embarrassment this year,
what with a number of players involved in, shall we say, legal
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the entire world is watching, the league has gone into
control mode, trying to modify the behavior of the rollicking lads
who commit mayhem on Sunday afternoon but are expected to contain
themselves the rest of the time. ``All through the year, we hear
about avoiding the distractions,'' said Devin Bush, a safety with
the Rams, who saw distractions up close last year with the Falcons
when he was a backup to Eugene Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   One of the league's most respected players, Robinson was charged
with soliciting oral sex from a female undercover police officer in
a seamy section of Miami last year the night before the Super Bowl.
That qualified as a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Bush found himself in the spotlight after being named
as one of the combatants in an alleged brawl in the corridor after
Sunday's game in St. Louis. He apparently had a confrontation of
the physical kind with Frank Middleton of Tampa Bay after both
teams had dressed. ``I said, `Good game,' and he wanted to take it
to another level,'' Bush said Wednesday to waves of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   One player said the 210-pound Bush may have punched the
300-pound-plus Middleton _ Bush said he only shoved him _ but
either could be considered not only distracting but also foolhardy.
``I don't know anything about a police report, but it's all over
now,'' Bush said, a model of propriety, relating all the good
advice being offered to the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Vermeil has been telling us that we're targets,'' Bush
said. ``He just mentioned to us that if you drink, don't drive,
avoid ticket scalpers, and he even told us to avoid a certain strip
club, but I don't remember the name.''
</P>
<P>
   That Atlanta club is the same one connected to an investigation
of alleged misconduct by certain Knicks during a training sojourn
in Charleston, S.C., in 1997. It was just another example of
athletes getting in trouble when left to their own devices, like
the cocaine-and-prostitution charges against the Rangers' Kevin
Stevens in the wee small hours of last Sunday morning after a game
in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   These expensive nocturnal excursions seem to suggest that the
players have far too much money and far too much free time. While
teams cannot micromanage how players spend their considerable
fortunes, football coaches certainly try to control time.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's Super Bowl, Mike Shanahan of the Broncos had
meetings to discuss meetings. He also did not allow families to
accompany the players, whereas the Falcons permitted wives and
children to travel with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Robinson, a bit too candidly, later said the families
were a distraction. He picked a bad time to make this distinction.
Rather than going out for a solitary mind-clearing stroll in the
warm Miami night, Robinson had taken a drive on the wild side,
engaging in a conversation with the plainclothes officer who found
grounds to book him.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's arrest has become linked to the result of that game,
a 34-19 waxing by the Broncos. ``Eugene was a huge distraction to
the Falcons,'' Joe Theismann, the former quarterback, now a
broadcaster, said this week. ``What bothers me is that I didn't
hear one of his teammates ripping him for what he did. What are the
chances of the Falcons getting back to the Super Bowl? Pretty
slim.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush recalled how the news broke with barely a dozen hours to
game time.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I just wanted to be with Eugene, to make sure he was
all right,'' Bush said. ``I felt so bad. We know what a good man
Eugene Robinson is. He made a mistake but he didn't deserve that
after the career he had.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who said he was innocent of soliciting for sex,
admitted he was guilty of terrible judgment. He eventually took
what is called a ``diversification course'' of counseling, and the
charges were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, everybody remembers the incident, and how John Elway
soon passed Robinson and the Falcons into submission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was magnified,'' Bush said. ``If the Falcons had won, it
wouldn't have been a big deal, but we got beat so bad. Things like
this happen all the time in the game of life. Only Jesus Christ was
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it had been a distraction, Bush said, ``I can't say it
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   One factor may cut down on distractions this year: there is less
temptation to go out on the prowl with the temperature dipping down
toward the teens. It is unclear whether the league ordered the
chill to keep the lads indoors.

IN ASSAULT ON ISLAMIC REBELS, A BID TO END ALGERIA'S CIVIL WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: CHANGES head; SUBS 2nd graf to correct when offensive began
to about a week ago, sted nine days ago.) 
 (nk) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A bid by Algeria's president to end an eight-year civil
war by opening an offensive against Islamic guerrillas who have
defied a government amnesty has erupted into some of the fiercest
fighting in years.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in Algerian newspapers have said that at least 125
soldiers and guerrillas have been killed since the government began
its offensive in a mountainous area of western Algeria about a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The government attack follows an ultimatum included in a peace
plan that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika put forward after he was
elected last April. His proposal for a ``civil concord'' with the
guerrillas, ratified in a national referendum in September, hinged
on an amnesty for any rebel surrendering before a Jan. 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   A pro-government newspaper in Algiers, El Khabar, said last week
that 4,200 rebels may have surrendered, more than double the figure
previously given by the government. But by most counts, at least
1,500 rebels, perhaps substantially more, remain active.
</P>
<P>
   When he proposed the amnesty, Bouteflika said that guerrillas
who prolonged the war would face ``a fight without mercy'' and
``eradication.'' He waited six days past the deadline before
sending paratroops, infantry units and helicopters against one of
the main guerrilla strongholds in the hinterland of Relizane
province, 95 miles southwest of Algiers. The region is one of
several that have served as base areas for guerrilla attacks on the
Mediterranean coastal plain, where 90 percent of Algerians live.
</P>
<P>
   The combat area _ which includes the Oursenis national park, a
vacation area before the war _ is thickly forested with pines and
cedars and rises to nearly 4,000 feet. Le Matin, an independent
Algiers newspaper, reported on Monday that 25 government soldiers
and about 100 guerrillas had been killed, with 70 of the dead
rebels being accounted for in fighting on Saturday. The paper said
about 230 guerrillas were still holding out against the main thrust
of the government attack.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Bouteflika was hand-picked for the
presidency last year by Algeria's generals, who have held decisive
political authority since shortly after Algeria's independence from
France in 1962. His pledge to Algeria's 30 million people was that
he would bring about ``national reconciliation'' by ending the war.
</P>
<P>
   By unofficial estimates, 100,000 people have been killed in the
conflict, most of them civilians who have been bombed in cafes,
markets and schools, stopped at guerrilla roadblocks and executed,
or slaughtered by the hundreds in village massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Algerians see the conflict as an extension of what they call
their national ``nightmare,'' reaching back to the eight-year war
of independence with a French colonial army that historians say
cost about 1 million lives.
</P>
<P>
   More than an end to the war rides on Bouteflika's shoulders,
since many Algerians believe there is little hope of the generals'
allowing the emergence of a genuine parliamentary democracy or of
Algeria's rising from the economic abyss into which it fell in the
1990s until the fighting ends.
</P>
<P>
   Although Algerians are gaining confidence that the back of the
Islamic insurgency has been broken, it is not clear yet that the
war's end is at hand. For one thing, the rebels' ``eradication''
would void the main claim that the generals have for retaining
their decisive political power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little early to say, but I'm not at all convinced that
this is the end game,'' said High Roberts, a specialist on Algeria
who teaches at the London School of Economics. ``I'm not convinced
that there is a consensus in Algiers to make a definitive end to
all the armed groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The amnesty plan has had some striking successes. On Jan. 11,
two days before the amnesty expired, the guerrilla group that
started the war, the Islamic Salvation Army, agreed to dissolve
itself after Bouteflika granted its estimated 8,000 fighters a
blanket amnesty. The move effectively ratified the status quo,
since the Islamic Salvation Front, the political group that
controlled the fighters, had observed a cease-fire since August
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significant has been Bouteflika's success in
opening amnesty negotiations with a splinter force led by a
guerrilla leader, Hassan Hattab, who broke with the main insurgent
group over its attacks on civilians. Algerian security force
spokesmen have said that Hattab has 1,500 fighters in his group,
the Salafist Group for Proselytization and Combat, which has been
active in the mountains of the Kabylia area about 70 miles east of
Algiers.
</P>
<P>
   What remains unclear is how many guerrillas will accept, or
defy, their leaders' decisions on the amnesty. The interior
minister, Yazid Zerhouni, said last week that ``about 80 percent''
of all the guerrillas had surrendered, but did not specify how many
men that involved.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Islamic Salvation Army's leader, Madani Mezrag,
signed a statement dissolving the force, the actual hand-over of
arms by his fighters appears to have been sporadic. Government
spokesmen have said that 1,100 of Mezrag's fighters have
surrendered in the Jijel area, 130 miles east of Algiers, but
others have yet to respond.

BUSH, McCAIN SQUARE OFF IN FINAL DEBATE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ In their final televised confrontation in New
Hampshire, the two leading GOP presidential candidates squared off
over education, campaign-finance reform and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Texas Gov. George W. Bush tried to portray chief
rival, Sen. John McCain, as a Clinton clone, he was forced to
defend his state's education record.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is lagging behind McCain in state polls, zeroed in on
differences with McCain over several issues as he courted voters
who have not been moved by his central theme of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush likened the Arizona senator's criticism of him to
Democratic complaints and questioned why McCain did not endorse his
plan to take away federal funds from low performing schools and
give parents school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two people have openly criticized this plan, you and the vice
president,'' said Bush. ``Why don't you think that high
expectations will work?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well first of all George, '' responded McCain. ``If you're
saying that I'm like Al Gore, then you're spinning like Bill
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that Bush's plan to take away federal funds from
poor schools would usurp state's rights to make educational
decisions. He added that the Texas governor's proposal would take
away money from the public schools and put them into vouchers for
poor families.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he endorsed an experimental voucher program that
would be financed by closing corporate loopholes that Bush
supports, such as tax breaks for oil and gas, ethanol and sugar
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Three other GOP candidates who are fighting for conservative
votes, Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes, also jumped into
the fray, attacking each other and the leading contenders over
abortion, U.S. policy toward China and endorsement of lewd rock
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, among the most contentious so far, provided one of
the few remaining opportunities for the candidates to define
themselves and opponents before a television audience.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes were high with polls showing a close race between
Bush and McCain. The latest USA Today, CNN, Gallup New Hampshire
tracking poll through Jan. 29 had McCain at 43 percent, Bush at 36
percent, Forbes with 12 percent and Keyes at 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, after a last-place showing in the Iowa
caucuses, dropped out of the race. He threw his support behind
Bush, saying the Texas governor was the best candidate to ``unite
the party and bring back the White House to us.''
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, Bush, once again stressed that he wanted to
devote much of the estimated federal surplus for tax cuts while
McCain said he wanted to use much of that money to stabilize Social
Security and Medicare and pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also criticized Bush for not endorsing campaign-finance
reform, arguing that defense of the current system would hurt
Republicans in the general election, where Democrat Al Gore would
be vulnerable on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded that he supported some changes such as banning
unrestricted corporate and union ``soft money'' contributions. But
he noted that McCain's campaign-finance reform plan was opposed by
a majority of Republican senators.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said that he did not favor using federal funds to help
low-income students get connected to the Internet. McCain, however,
said he supported giving tax breaks to private companies who help
wire classrooms in low-income neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, the governor continued to characterize McCain
as too liberal for the party's primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of hit from the left,'' Bush said. He added that
``there was not much difference between the (Clinton)
administration's and the senator's tax cut plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain defended their anti-abortion stands, which have
been questioned by party conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what two-sentence amendment he would write into the
U.S. Constitution on abortion, Bush said, ``It would be that every
child, born and unborn, should be protected in law. And every child
should be welcomed in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush added, however, that while ``our party must not abandon our
pro-life position, but we must welcome people from different
persuasions into our party _ or different points of view into our
party.''
</P>
<P>
   While the focus was on the McCain-Bush rivalry, Forbes also
slammed the Texas governor's record, arguing that under his tenure
spending in Texas and the number of government employees had grown.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Forbes charged that Bush's education program had
failed, citing falling Scholastic Aptitude Tests, used for college
admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``On SATs, Texas is one of the few states where minority scores
have gone down, not up,'' said Forbes. ``Standards have been dumbed
down. Eighth-grade science tests in Texas show four pictures of
four insects and say pick out the fly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush defended his Texas record, saying that the state had
set high educational standards, abolished social promotions and was
``making the best progress in the nation for improvement among
minority students.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said that the SAT scores may have dropped because
``unlike many states, we make sure as many kids can take the SAT as
possible. We include all kinds of children.''
</P>
<P>
   SAT test scores in Texas dropped 2 percent from the spring of
1998 to the spring of 1999, with minority scores lagging behind
Anglo scores.

FORD POSTS HIGHER EARNINGS, BUT SHARES STILL TAKE A HIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ A broad improvement in auto and financial
operations allowed the Ford Motor Co. to post slightly better
earnings for the fourth quarter than financial analysts had
expected, but the automaker's shares fell on fears that further
profit gains might prove elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's profits surged in North America, despite a one-time, $103
million charge related to last autumn's labor contract with the
United Automobile Workers, while the company's losses narrowed in
Europe and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Credit, the company's division for car loans and leases,
posted a 32 percent gain in profits after several years of flat
earnings. Among Ford's biggest units, only its auto parts division,
Visteon, posted slightly worse results than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, Ford earned $1.81 billion, or $1.47 a share, up 73.2
percent from profits of $1.04 billion, or 84 cents a share, a year
earlier. The earnings per share were 2 cents better than the
consensus of analysts' forecasts issued by First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Even excluding various one-time charges in the last quarter and
a year earlier, Ford's earnings were up 14 percent. Sales rose to
$44.42 billion from $37.90 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But with gasoline prices climbing and with the likelihood that
the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates further,
investors began selling Ford stock Wednesday morning even as other
industrial stocks were rising. Ford shares fell $2.0625, to $48,
while shares of the General Motors Corp. were up 62.5 cents, at
$78.5625.
</P>
<P>
   A few financial analysts said they were nervous that Ford's new
chief financial officer, Henry D.G. Wallace, had seemed
uncomfortable with their forecasts for first-quarter earnings this
year during a conference call this morning. Wallace said in an
interview that he had simply pointed out that it would be harder
for Ford to meet analysts' forecasts for the first quarter than for
all of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point I was making to them was their expectations grow
week by week, and were getting pretty stretchy in the first
quarter,'' he said, adding that by ``stretchy'' he meant
challenging. It was unclear how much effect, if any, his comments
to the analysts had on the stock, which dropped more than $1 at the
opening of trading and slipped further through the day.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here Wednesday morning, Wallace said that
while Ford anticipates that auto sales will be a little slower than
last year's record-setting pace, the automaker also hopes to
increase its share of the North American market, using recently
introduced or redesigned cars like the Ford Taurus, Lincoln LS and
Jaguar S-Type.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker has based its planning on the assumption that the
Fed will raise short-term interest rates this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is carefully examining the balance sheet of Daewoo, the
virtually bankrupt Korean automaker, but has not yet made a
decision on whether to invest in it, Wallace said. The growing
Korean auto market remains virtually closed to imports while Korean
manufacturers step up their exports, to the growing irritation of
Western automakers. So companies like Ford, GM and Renault SA have
been trying to buy Korean automakers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford earned $7.24 billion for all of last year, or $5.86 a
share, on sales of $162.56 billion. In 1998, Ford reported earnings
of $22.07 billion, or $17.76 a share, but this included a noncash
gain of $15.96 billion from Ford's spinoff of a consumer lending
unit, Associates First Capital. Auto analysts have excluded that
gain in their calculations of the company's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   There had been considerable speculation that Ford might announce
Wednesday the closing of one or more factories in Europe and
large-scale layoffs there. While Ford did neither, Wallace
acknowledged that the automaker had excess capacity in Europe and
that cutbacks were a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   While Ford earned $1.58 billion in the last quarter in North
America, up from $1.05 billion, it lost $55 million in Europe,
which was still better than a $74 million loss a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Ford fared worst in South America, although its losses narrowed
in the fourth quarter to $95 million from $151 million a year
earlier. Ford's sales in the region dropped 24.6 percent, as its
market share dwindled while the overall market remained weak.
</P>
<P>
   Visteon earned $95 million in the fourth quarter, down from $129
million a year earlier. Wallace said that the new labor agreement
and lower prices hurt the parts division, but repeated that Ford
plans to make it an independent company.

AD COLUMN: SOME OF MADISON AVENUE IS FORGOING A PRE-SUPER BOWL
QUIET PERIOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Typically before the Super Bowl, account activity
along Madison Avenue slows as agencies turn their attention to
finishing commercials scheduled to run during the game. Given how
frenetic business has been lately, though, it's no surprise that
several large advertisers made decisions Wednesday involving
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Eveready Battery Co., a unit of the Ralston Purina Co., is
expanding its agency roster by naming the Chicago office of DDB
Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, to handle the global
introduction of a battery brand to be named Energizer E2. Estimates
are that spending for the new product, to be introduced in the
summer, could total more than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Harriet Blickenstaff, a spokeswoman for Eveready Battery in St.
Louis, confirmed reports of the assignment that appeared in the
trade publications Advertising Age and Adweek. Plans for Energizer
E2 are scheduled to be discussed Thursday, she said, at the Ralston
Purina annual shareholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The new brand, combining alkaline and titanium ingredients, is
meant to be a so-called superpremium battery, priced higher than
alkaline brands like Energizer and Duracell, made by the Gillette
Co., as well as traditional brands like Eveready.
</P>
<P>
   The Energizer E2 review began in September with four agencies,
two on the Eveready Battery roster and two not. The roster shops
were Bates U.K., part of the Bates Worldwide unit of the Cordiant
Communications Group, and the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of
TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom, which
creates the well-known ``bunny'' campaign for the Energizer brand
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Bates was trimmed from the Eveready Battery
roster last month, losing its pan-European creative assignment when
the company shifted to more localized efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The shops not on the Eveready Battery roster that were
considered for the Energizer E2 introduction were DDB Chicago and
the Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago, part of the Leo Group. Early last
month, the review was narrowed to DDB Chicago and Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   Concert, a global joint venture formed by the AT&AMP;T Corp. and
British Telecommunications, named Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising as
its agency of record. Billings were estimated at $40 million to $50
million.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R Hong Kong will be the lead office on the account,
responsible for forming a strategy for the Concert brand as well as
creative work, including a campaign to introduce Concert as a
communications company that promises to simplify information
delivery. The Hong Kong office of Media Edge, the media services
unit of Y&AMP;R, will handle Concert's global media planning and
buying.
</P>
<P>
   Concert, which has offices in cities like Atlanta, Hong Kong,
London, New York, San Francisco and Reston, Va., did not hold a
review for the account, according to Shelly London, senior vice
president for communications at Concert.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture chose Y&AMP;R, she added, because executives were
familiar with work the agency produces for AT&AMP;T in the United
States, which includes corporate, consumer, international and
multicultural advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Concert, which serves businesses, international carriers and
Internet service providers, plans to begin the campaign on Monday
in print and online media in more than two dozen countries.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Seagram Spirits and Wine Group expanded its
relationship with offices of TBWA Worldwide by naming the agency to
handle the global creative duties for its Martell cognac brand.
Billings were estimated at $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a two-month review that had been
narrowed to TBWA Worldwide, which handles creative chores for
Seagram brands like Absolut vodka and Chivas Regal Scotch whiskey,
and another Seagram roster agency, Grey Advertising in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Martell assignment had been at Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide in
New York, part of the WPP Group, since 1993, but that agency
decided against taking part in the review.
</P>
<P>
   The Martell campaign, which could begin running in midyear, will
be directed by TBWA GGT Simons Palmer in London, the TBWA British
agency, with additional creative contributions from TBWA/Chiat/Day
in New York. The American media duties continue at Mediacom in New
York, the Grey media services agency; they are still being
determined for the rest of the world.

GORE WINNING BIG BENEFITS FROM PRESIDENT'S BACKING
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Iowa)  (Eds: SUBS 8th graf, One of ..., to add that Clinton will mention
Head Start in State of Union. 
 (See also GORE, GORE-NY) 
(nk) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore has not invited his boss, Bill Clinton, to
come out and stump with him, but back at the White House, Clinton
is taking every chance he can to plug the candidacy of his vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of Gore's staff and the irritation of both Bill
Bradley and the Republicans, Clinton has, day after day, announced
policies that dovetail with Gore's campaign effort _ and Clinton
usually says Gore is the brains behind them, maybe even the brains
behind the White House generally.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we took office together, the fact that I was challenged
scientifically and technologically was a standing joke,'' Clinton
said at Caltech last week as he announced more financing for
scientific research, an area Gore has scoped out as his own. ``And
he wants all of you to know that he's campaigning all over the
country with a Palm VII on his hip.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential announcements, politically helpful to Gore,
range from the prosaic to the sweeping.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week before the New Hampshire primary, Clinton
announced emergency subsidies for low-income families to pay
heating bills in about a dozen states _ including $5.4 million for
New Hampshire. The release of such financing is a presidential
ritual but the timing was opportune for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   With just days to go before the recent Iowa caucuses, Clinton
proposed a plan to enable parents to enroll in the same health
plans as their children. The president said he had borrowed the
idea from Gore, who had proposed it as part of his counter to
Bradley's more sweeping health care proposal.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Clinton will give Gore another big push when,
White House aides say, the president will single out Gore in his
final State of the Union address and, with the vice president a few
feet behind him, lay out an agenda that will coincide markedly with
that of the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first sections of the speech will address education _
proposals for $1 billion in additional spending in after-school
sessions and another $1 billion to expand Head Start, as well as
higher pay for teachers. The initiatives mirror those issued by the
Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the rival campaign of Bradley, there is grumbling about the
White House's blatant backing of Gore. Republicans, as well,
consider the real Gore campaign headquarters to be located not at
2410 Charlotte Avenue in Nashville, but at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has made abundantly clear that the political
power of the White House is behind the vice president,'' said Eric
Hauser, a spokesman for the Bradley campaign. With nothing to do
about it, Bradley aides try to use the alliance as one of the
entrenched powers their candidate is fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Gore backers in and out of the White House say of course there
is coordination between Clinton and Gore. The two men talk
frequently. Many of their aides have dual allegiances. But much of
the overlap in policy is just that. These are two men who have
worked closely together for seven years and, in most areas, agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``His people have always played a role in policy meetings,''
said one Clinton aide said of Gore. ``That's equally true this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton credits Gore in some of his announcements, like his
preview last week of his health care plan. ``I thank the vice
president for this proposal,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, the White House seems to run interference for
Gore, helping him avoid sticky situations. The administration, for
instance, has delayed implementing the provision of Nafta that
allows Mexican trucks into this country, a decision that delighted
the Teamsters union at a time when Gore is seeking its endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, aides to Bradley also complain that the
White House has delayed issuing a ruling to allow California to
sidestep a federal regulation requiring that its gasoline contain
ethanol. The ruling could have riled famers in Iowa, where the
corn-based fuel is popular, so Bradley backers contend the Gore
campaign made sure it comes after the caucuses there. The
Environmental Protection Agency, for its part, has said the
campaign is not a factor in its decision making.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, the apparatus of government is keeping one eye
on the campaign. Aides to Gore met with cabinet officials in the
fall to coordinate their work with that of the campaign. Housing
Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson are
among the Clinton aides who have campaigned for Gore in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   A lower-level member of the administration, Janice Lachance,
campaigned for Gore at an inopportune time. Ms. Lachance is
director of the Office of Personnel Management and responsible for
closing the federal government in inclement weather. She was in
Iowa when a blizzard hit Washington, prompting criticism from the
Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers are treading carefully as they seek to snuff out
Gore's image as an understudy to an impeached president while
simultaneously taking advantage of the benefits of the vice
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Policy breaks with the White House help send the message that he
is his own man, advisers say, while attaching himself to popular
White House proposals shows he would continue a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters this week that he had not even seen
Clinton's State of the Union speech yet, after having helped draft
it for the last seven years. But his aides were working behind the
scenes to maximize the vice president's advantage. Wednesday, as
the president staged a rehearsal of his speech in the White House
theater, Gore's chief of staff, Charles Burson, was watching from
the audience. He had a draft.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, continues backing his No. 2. The two men are
on good terms, aides say, having put behind them the impeachment
matter and a spat over whether Gore was distancing himself from
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Since no invitation to join Gore has been extended, the
president has been going it alone. He has been busy raising money
for the Democratic National Committee, funds that will be essential
to the party's eventual nominee. And he talks up his running mate
every chance he gets.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent incident suggests that even lame duck presidents
who hope their running mates succeed them have egos.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter suggested at a briefing that Gore might be
running the White House, rather than Clinton, White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart made clear that no such succession had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, the president puts forward his ideas. It'll be his
budget, his State of the Union,'' Lockhart said, making clear who
was boss.

EATON TO RETIRE FROM DAIMLERCHRYSLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Saying he was leaving because his corporate goals had
been reached, Robert J. Eaton, the former chairman of Chrysler,
announced on Wednesday that he would retire, effective March 31, as
co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler, the merged global automaker he
helped to form.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two companies are one; my goal has been accomplished,'' he
said in a statement. ``This is the right time for me to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Eaton, who is 59, leaves DaimlerChrysler's top
management exclusively peopled by the company's German executives
from the former Daimler-Benz. Jurgen E. Schrempp, Eaton's
co-chairman, will become the sole chairman.
</P>
<P>
   When Daimler-Benz of Germany bought Chrysler in 1998, the deal
was announced as a merger of equals. But soon, more shots seemed to
be called from Stuttgart, and American executives began to depart,
some voluntarily, some not. Indeed, after Thomas T. Stallkamp, a
vice chairman, was ousted last fall, Eaton was the only American
left in the DaimlerChrysler senior leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton had said when the deal was announced that he would retire
within three years. Still, trying to preserve influence in the
company, he had to deny almost monthly rumors that he was about to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said that Eaton's retirement would be
unlikely to affect DaimlerChrysler's stock price. The announcement
came shortly after the close of the market, with DaimlerChrysler at
$67.1875, down 81.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``His retirement has been widely anticipated,'' said John A.
Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Jurgen Hubbert, the DaimlerChrysler management board member who
oversees Mercedes-Benz, said recently that after Eaton retired, the
office of the chairman of DaimlerChrysler would be in Stuttgart
alone, though the former Chrysler's offices in Auburn Hills, Mich.,
will remain a second headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton said that he had decided last week to retire at the end of
the first quarter. ``The company is in terrific shape and I think
now's the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not go on to run another company; instead, he
plans to spend time fishing, hunting and skiing and perhaps serving
on other companies' boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working 70 hours a week as long as I can remember,''
he said. ``I will not take a full-time job; on the other hand, I'm
sure as heck not going to sit in a rocking chair.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton also said that he had not received any extra compensation
because of the sale of Chrysler. When the Daimler deal closed, the
company cashed out Eaton's $70 million in options and issued him
new options in DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   His retirement contract stipulates that he may not work for a
DaimlerChrysler rival, and on Wednesday he sharply ruled out the
idea of succeeding John F. Smith Jr., whom some expect to step down
this year as chairman and chief executive of the General Motors
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Detroit area remain bitter about the sale of
Chrysler to Daimler. ``It's a German company, and I'm enough of an
American that it bothers me,'' said David Lewis, a professor of
automotive history at the University of Michigan. ``When hard times
come, and they will, there will be cutbacks, and Chrysler will be
on the short end of the stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the credit for turning Chrysler into an automotive
powerhouse over the last two decades belonged to the former
Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca, who helped rescue the company from
the brink of bankruptcy in the late 1970s, and to Chrysler's vice
chairman under Eaton, Robert Lutz, who championed the eye-catching
vehicle designs that made Chrysler one of the world's most
profitable automakers in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of Chrysler, I think of what Bob Lutz did,''
Lewis said. Lutz, who left Chrysler just before the merger, is now
chairman of Exide, the battery maker.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Chrysler has had a remarkable turnaround since the late
1970s, when the company was bailed out by federal loan guarantees.
Under the charismatic Iacocca, Chrysler became a raffish underdog
whose survival struggle somehow became entwined with patriotism.
Iacocca even toyed with the idea of running for president.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Eaton defended the deal, noting those tough times
Chrysler once faced and saying he had ensured the company's
survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognized that there was going to be consolidation in this
industry,'' Eaton said. When Daimler offered to buy Chrysler, he
added, ``we felt this was a tremendous opportunity for Chrysler,
its employees and its shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one of those disappointed about the sale of the company
was Iacocca. ``I worked 20 years to make it a Big Three,'' he said
last year, referring to GM, Ford Motor and Chrysler, the
traditional trio of American automakers. ``If I thought it was
going to be a Big Two, I wouldn't have worked so hard.''

 ARIZONANS PLACE 1ST AS COUCH POTATOES  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Arizonans rank first for stay ing put _ staying put
on the couch, that is.
</P>
<P>
   A new U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey
finds that Arizona is last in the nation in physical activity,
prompting the state Department of Health Services on Wednesday to
declare an ``epidemic'' of inac tivity.
</P>
<P>
   The number of adult Arizonans who said they engaged in some &UR; kind
of leisure-time physical ac tivity dropped from 76.3 percent in
1994 to 48.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The report follows the CDC's finding last fall that Arizona has
the nation's lowest percentage of obese adults. Public health ex
perts say they are stumped about Arizonans' apparent ability to
stay skinny by doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps we're not getting off the sofa to go to the refrigera
tor,'' state epidemiologist Norm Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Utah had the high est percentage of adults who are
physically active: 82.9 percent. The national average is 70.9 per
cent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tim Flood, medical direc tor for Arizona's Bureau of Pub lic
Health Statistics, said reasons for being sedentary could range
from increasing dependence on automobiles, the Internet, televi
sion and video games and people's concerns about their safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lives are becoming so convenient,'' Flood said. ``We are
all turning into couch potatoes and office potatoes.'' &QL;

FAILING MATH BUT ACING TERRORISM 101 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - While the bureaucrats whine about our chil dren's
poor perform ance on the highfalutin AIMS test, the kids are
proving they don't need no stinking math be cause they rule this
town al ready.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, 80 percent of the student body at Central High
School stayed home be cause someone left a threaten ing note on
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew it was a fake, just as everyone knew parents
couldn't afford to take the chance it wasn't a fake.
</P>
<P>
   St. Mary's High School closed Wednesday because of a threat.
Sixty-seven percent of Goldwa ter High School students stayed home
Tuesday because of hand-scribbled note reading, ``I'm gonna kill
everyone on Jan. 25.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Tempe police arrested a 14-year-old Corona del Sol
student for sending an e-mail threat, but not before 43 percent of
the 2,720 students were kept home from school.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police caught a 12-year-old girl who'd left a threat
ening note on the playground of Cartwright Elementary School, but
not in time to prevent a third of the pupils from getting a day
off.
</P>
<P>
   Maryvale High School in west Phoenix had a threat. And Mesa's
Stapley Junior High. And Desert Arroyo Middle School in northeast
Phoenix. And Phoenix's Washington Ele mentary. And Deer Valley High
School. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Arizona's boys and girls may not be skilled in alge bra
or trigonometry, but they're earning straight A's in Terror ism
101.
</P>
<P>
   I called the office of the state superintendent of public in
struction, Lisa Graham Keegan, to ask if she had a plan to deal
with this problem.
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is: No.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan and the other bureau crats have been too busy whin ing
about the AIMS test to think about scholastic hijackers. But her
public relations flack, Patri cia Likens, told me the superin
tendent planned to discuss school threats with influential members
of the Arizona Legis lature, bringing in the only peo ple in the
state capable of taking a complex and trouble some situation and
making it even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Likens said possible solutions include ``making examples'' of
children caught leaving threats, and keeping schools open be yond
the regular school year to make up for any lost days. Un
fortunately, it's tough catching the culprits, and keeping the
schools open would cost a for tune.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the media. Some people believe anonymous school
threats would stop if we didn't publicize them. They're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about getting pub licity; it's about getting a day
off. Besides, we long ago passed the point where every schoolkid in
Arizona learned about the scam.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a school problem, anyway. It's not a political prob
lem. It's not a kid problem. It's a parental problem. We could post
the National Guard at schools and nervous parents still would keep
their children home. Who's willing to risk a youngster to prove a
point?
</P>
<P>
   Kids know this. Think back to when you were in school. Can you
imagine anything better than your parents forcing you to play
hooky?
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the massacre at Columbine High School in
Colorado, even children with poor math skills have learned the
power of simple addition:
</P>
<P>
   Threats + Paranoia Vaca tion.
</P>
<P>
   A local teacher told me he overheard two students discuss ing
the time off they expected to get because of a threat scrib bled on
a wall. One boy de clared the coming respite ``Dylan Klebold
Day.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ By any measure, April 18, 1988, was a frustrating day
for Albert Gore Jr. It began at 7:30 a.m. at a subway station on
Manhattan's Upper East Side, with Gore, who had just turned 40 and
was running for president for the first time, standing in visible
shock as Mayor Ed Koch bellowed a morning greeting to commuters:
``Hi, everybody, it's us! Al Gore and me!''
</P>
<P>
   The day ended, or it might as well have, a few hours later with
Koch, who had endorsed Gore and then effectively seized command of
his New York campaign, fiercely accusing the Rev. Jesse Jackson of
``contempt and arrogance'' for skipping the ``Salute to Israel''
parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I said that about a white candidate, would anyone say that
was unfair?'' Koch inquired. Gore turned ashen.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had never really expected to win the New York primary in
1988, or for that matter, the Democratic nomination for president.
But when the votes were counted the day after he campaigned one
last time at Koch's elbow, Gore, the senator from Tennessee, had
stumbled into third place, with less than 10 percent of the vote,
behind Michael Dukakis and Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Gore emerged from New York viewed even by his supporters not as
a noble loser laying the groundwork for the future but as a naif
who had been manipulated by sophisticated forces advancing their
own interests. He had, it seemed, engaged in the clumsiest kind of
negative campaigning, and countenanced a harsh and racially charged
strategy to advance his own improbable candidacy. From that
perspective, the fact that Gore's campaign shut down less than 48
hours after the polls closed in New York was the least of his
problems. At 40, the defining goal of his life _ being elected
president _ was suddenly in peril.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore prepares to return to New York for a second primary, on
March 7, this time as the vice president of the United States and
the favorite to be his party's presidential nominee, he is, in many
ways, a very different candidate from the one whose campaign
collapsed on the steps of Koch's City Hall in 1988. And there is
probably no better place to chart that evolution than in this same
state that provided Gore with a brutal lesson in presidential
politics that he and his friends remember bitterly to this day.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate who was scolded for negative campaigning by Gov.
Mario Cuomo in 1988 has learned the subtle form of the acceptable
if devastating political attack (``He's negative on the
substance,'' Cuomo said approvingly the other day). The candidate
who was dizzied by the cross-currents of New York ethnic politics
has this time finessed them, deftly standing in the background as
they consume another newcomer to New York politics, Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Gore ran with barely any organized political support
and then proceeded to give up complete control of his campaign to
Koch and to David Garth, the political consultant. This time, Gore
has systematically recruited Democratic leaders across New York to
his campaign, and has made clear that he intends to cede control of
the New York effort to no one.
</P>
<P>
   The last time he ran for president, Gore neglected to tend to
the most basic political chore of appealing to the various blocs of
voters that make up the Democratic primary electorate. Last week in
Manhattan, by contrast, Gore spent the afternoon meeting first with
blacks, then with Jews and then with gays and lesbians. That
evening, it was off to the latest in a series of private sit-down
suppers with figures from New York's media and political worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers, those who worked for him in 1988 and those who
work for him today, are quick to point to all these factors as
evidence of the vice president's evolution. Indeed, they announced
the details of Gore's meetings last week, drawing an implicit
comparison with Gore's mistakes of 1988. For them, Gore as a
candidate in New York in 2000 is a story of growth and maturity.
</P>
<P>
   But for the candidate himself, those two weeks in 1988 remain a
dark memory. He recoiled when asked to discuss the experience the
other day, groping around for an answer when asked what lessons he
might have drawn from it, or for some details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' the vice president finally said in an interview, ``I
was hoping I had read the last story about that primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign had sparked to life on March 8, when he won
seven of the 20 states that had primaries on that day, most of them
in the South. His strategy had been to ignore the Iowa caucuses and
the New Hampshire primary, and focus his limited resources in his
home region, calculating that a strong showing that day would
thrust him into the front circle of presidential contenders.
</P>
<P>
   It did not work out as he had hoped. Gore suggested the fault
lay with the media. ``We didn't capture the spotlight of the
television news coverage even after winning seven states,'' Gore
complained at the time to The Washington Post &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But other Democrats thought the problem lay with Gore himself.
The novice candidate had not planned beyond what is known as Super
Tuesday, when 20 states, most of them in the South, have primaries,
and was not prepared to take advantage of his moment. Deep in debt,
he bounced around from message to message, and from state to state,
losing in Illinois, Michigan, Connecticut and Wisconsin, finally
ending up in New York.
</P>
<P>
   By the start of April, there really was not much of a chance
that Gore would capture the Democratic presidential nomination, and
the candidate and his advisers knew it. Dukakis, the governor of
Massachusetts, had a commanding lead in delegates, and his biggest
fear was not Gore but Jackson, then at the peak of his influence in
Democratic presidential politics. Accordingly, Gore's advisers came
to view New York as a place where the little-known southern senator
could make a respectable showing and a graceful exit from the race,
leaving an impression that, they hoped, would be remembered when it
came time to pick a presidential candidate in four or eight years.
</P>
<P>
   And that might have happened, were it not for Koch.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his staff were elated at first when the popular New
York mayor, after summoning both Dukakis and Gore to City Hall for
interviews, said he was endorsing Gore. When reporters at the
bustling news conference where Koch disclosed his selection
suggested that this could produce the exact result that Koch said
he most feared _ draining enough votes from Dukakis to produce a
Jackson victory in New York _ the mayor shouted back: ``It's
irrelevant, irrelevant!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dukakis came over with a veneer as thin as a dime, and on
issues very glib, and Al Gore came over as someone who has the
potential to be a great president,'' Koch said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor certainly knew how to grab a headline, and from the
moment he signed up with Gore, he did precisely that, even if the
result was that the endorser soon loomed large over the endorsee.
``Every time we were together, I would raise the issue of Jesse,''
Koch says, hastening to add that he and Jackson are friends now.
But at the time, Jackson's derogatory reference to New York as
``Hymietown'' was raw.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore recalls the contest, it was Koch who carried the weight
of the attacks on Jackson. ``That was him on his own,'' Gore
asserted.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gore _ who is trying to win Jackson's support for the
current race _ had been attacking Jackson's credentials on foreign
policy for weeks. Gore told one audience of Jewish leaders, for
example, that he had been ``dismayed'' by Jackson's ``embrace of
Arafat and Castro'' and critically observed that Jackson had ``not
had a single day's experience in the national government or a
single day's experience in foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed on why he was attacking the civil rights leader,
Gore responded, ``If the country is going to mature to the point
where we are color-blind and see candidates in terms of their
ability and leadership, then we must be prepared to engage in the
rough and tumble of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats saw another reason for Gore's attacking Jackson
so hard and so soon: to play to Koch, who even before the primary
was one of Jackson's harshest national critics.
</P>
<P>
   As primary day approached, Gore and Koch came under criticism
for exacerbating tensions between black and Jewish voters, tensions
which were particularly raw in New York in 1988, the year before
the city elected its first black mayor, David N. Dinkins. Jackson
compared the attacks on him to shouting ``Fire!'' in a theater.
Cuomo, the governor and a senior figure in the national party,
scolded Gore for the tone of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him some advice: It was to be positive, and not to be
negative, because he was not yet well-established enough in New
York to earn the right to be negative,'' Cuomo said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   That advice was not taken, as Gore stepped up and expanded his
attacks, even at the risk of coming across as brash. As Bill
Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic presidential nomination
this year, noted while campaigning recently, it was Gore who first
raised the issue of Willie Horton, the black inmate who committed
rape while on release from a Massachusetts furlough program,
mentioning it while debating Dukakis in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not mention Horton by name or refer to the fact that he
was black, and the issue attracted little attention at the time.
But after the primary season, supporters of Vice President George
Bush used the Horton case to devastating effect against Dukakis. At
one point in the campaign, Bush supporters circulated a flier with
a picture of Horton, prompting sharp complaints from Democrats that
Bush was injecting a racial element into the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If attacking Jackson was part of some grand strategy _ Gore,
Koch and Garth all say today that it was not _ it was a failure.
Jackson's supporters rallied around him, as some of Dukakis'
supporters turned Gore's attacks on Jackson to their advantage by
asserting that a vote for Gore would ensure that Jackson would
defeat Dukakis in New York.
</P>
<P>
   With each passing day, Gore seemed more out of place in the
state, which was turning into the site of his last political stand.
At one debate, Gore talked about his distress at growing up in the
South and coming across a ``whites only'' sign. He intended his
remarks as a way of demonstrating his concern with discrimination;
some of Jackson's supporters in the audience burst out laughing at
what struck them as patronizing. ``I don't know what's so funny,''
a perplexed Gore said as the audience continued hooting.
</P>
<P>
   Garth, the political consultant who handled Gore's television
advertisement, says he did not believe that Koch's attacks were the
cause of Gore's defeat. ``But it cost him a strong second-place
finish,'' Garth said. Cuomo said he called Gore after the vote,
saying that he should not lose heart, ``I think you'll make a
terrific candidate some day,'' Cuomo recalled telling Gore. ``You
made a mistake in the way you handled this particular thing in New
York. You miscalculated, but I don't think it's going to affect you
long-term.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the end the New York contest overshadowed the end of
Gore's candidacy, producing what to many of Gore's advisers was the
worst possible outcome. ``There was something dyspeptic about the
way the New York campaign ended the campaign,'' said one of Gore's
closest friends. ``You never want to end on a sour note.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore laughed darkly when asked if he thought he had been hurt by
his experience in New York in 1988. ``Do you?'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking that I had a lot to learn,'' Gore said.
``And I went about learning.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not wait long. The night of the primary, Gore joined Koch
for dinner where, Koch said, the senator expressed his appreciation
for his help. ``But I never heard from him again,'' said Koch, who
is supporting Bradley this time.
</P>
<P>
   From dinner with Koch, Gore than headed quietly to the hotel
where Jackson had settled in for the night, knocking on the door of
Jackson's suite and sitting down for a drink and a moment of
contrition with the candidate he had attacked so relentlessly. Gore
was a day away from abandoning his 10-month-old effort to become
president in 1988. But his next campaign for the White House had
already begun.

JOHN HANCOCK SELLS STOCK IN A $1.7 BILLION CONVERSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Hancock Financial Services, the 15th-largest life insurer
in the United States, raised $1.734 billion in an initial sale of
stock that was priced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of 102 million shares at $17 each ended 137 years of
ownership of the John Hancock Mutual Insurance Co. by its
policyholders. Several other mutual companies, including
Metropolitan Life, are expected to convert to shareholder-owned
companies and sell stock in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The John Hancock stock offering was by far the biggest initial
public offering so far this year, but fell well short of the record
$5.47 billion raised by United Parcel Service in its first sale of
stock in November, according to Randall Roth of Renaissance Capital
in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock also distributed 229.7 million shares of stock to
policyholders in exchange for their ownership of the company.
</P>
<P>
   A dispute concerning as much as 4 percent of the policyholders'
shares threatened to interfere with the offering. But John Hancock
and New York state regulators finally agreed that the shares would
be held in trust until resolution of a suit brought by the Mutual
of America Life Insurance Co., a New York annuities and
pension-plan company that owns Hancock policies.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock indicated in securities documents that it initially
hoped to sell its stock for as much as $25 a share, but earlier
this month set a price range of $16 to $18.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the price of the Hancock stock was kept down by a
generally depressed market for insurance and bank stocks, partly
because of rising interest rates, which tend to reduce the profits
of financial services companies. While the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index has risen nearly 15 percent since the start of
1999, insurance stocks have lost 28 percent of their market value.
</P>
<P>
   Some potential investors saw the low price as an incentive to
buy, but others said they were more likely to see greater growth in
other areas of the market. Still others said they feared that at
least for the next year or so, the prices of insurance stocks might
be driven down further as the other mutual companies flood the
market with new shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that there is going to be a period of
indigestion,'' said Lannie Thorndike, a manager of the Century
Shares Trust, a mutual fund in Boston that invests in life
insurance and banking shares.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock has been trimming its operations for greater
efficiency and Larry Altman, an insurance specialist at Booz, Allen
&AMP; Hamilton, the consulting firm, said the company ``is better
equipped'' than other converting mutual insurers for the
intensifying competition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Larry Mayewski, a senior analyst at A.M. Best, John
Hancock may face a tough sell. ``As an investor looking at
insurance stocks in general,'' he said, ``you have to ask yourself,
`Is there something about this company that makes it a better bet?'
This is a tough market to enter.''

WHEN WEATHER BYPASSES THE COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID STOUT   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six months ago, the National Weather Service
celebrated the completion of a decade-long modernization program
that gives forecasters access to computer and satellite data that
their professional predecessors could scarcely have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Around daybreak Monday, the computers were predicting that the
bad weather building up along the East Coast would drift out to sea
and dump most of its snow into the Atlantic. Forecasters sent out
word that Tuesday might bring light flurries in some areas. But
millions of people awoke Tuesday to deep snow and howling winds.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, as reality sank in and people from South Carolina
to New England shoveled, or swept, or blew away snow, Todd Miner, a
meteorologist, reflected on the storm that may have cured
forecasters' overconfidence for a long time to come. ``It's easier
to see in hindsight,'' said Miner, who works for Weather
Communications Group, a private forecasting service at Pennsylvania
State University. ``Obviously, these computer models were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there was one moment when things went wrong, it might
have been at dawn Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were certain things I saw,'' he said. Over south-central
Georgia, there was an area of low atmospheric pressure, often a
harbinger of foul weather. The pressure was lower than the computer
predictions were saying it should be, and the area was farther west
than the computers thought it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Oops, no. Computers don't really ``think.'' They just spit out
predictions based on the data fed into them. The data can be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Miner saw something else that made him nervous early Monday:
cloud imagery from satellites suggested a big jet-stream
disturbance, another storm omen. The computers did not make much of
that either.
</P>
<P>
   The snowstorm that blanketed the Northeast the next day reminded
Mine that computers are no substitute for human judgment, that
sometimes they should just be overruled. And yet, he said, they are
``right'' more often than not.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to satellites, forecasters rely on data from weather
balloons and from ground instruments that can infer temperature and
moisture conditions many miles up.
</P>
<P>
   But there are not enough balloons in the world, nor enough
satellites in orbit above it, to tell what is going on in the
atmosphere at a given moment, Miner said. ``Let's say you have two
weather balloons 200 miles apart,'' he said. ``We don't know what's
going on in between. What we end up doing is  &UR; inferring &LR;  what's
going on between the two points. Sometimes, there's something very
important that we're missing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wednesday, some children whose schools were still closed
continued to reap the benefits of Tuesday's storm, which swept up
the East Coast from South Carolina, dropping heavy snow inland.
Parts of the Northeast got up to 2 feet of snow, snarling roads and
closing schools and government offices. Most places were almost
back to normal Wednesday, but Raleigh, N.C., and Richmond, Va.,
which got 11 inches, were still largely paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, four months after Hurricane Floyd, residents
were struggling with the aftermath of a record 2-foot snowfall in a
part of the country that does not have much experience with
blizzards. More than 140,000 homes and businesses remained without
electricity Wednesday in North and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Travel was especially treacherous along Interstate 85 just south
of the Virginia-North Carolina line. The road was virtually shut
down for several  &QL; 
hours Tuesday night and Wednesday morning by jackknifed and
abandoned tractor-trailers. Road crews and National Guard troops
freed hundreds of stranded motorists Wednesday.

GORE, BRADLEY CLASH DURING DEMOCRATIC DEBATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Democratic presidential contenders Al Gore
and Bill Bradley clashed heatedly and repeatedly Wednesday in a
debate that grew most contentious on questions of personal
political style and campaign tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey, also forced Vice
President Gore, who claims a career-long dedication to backing the
Supreme Court decision legalizing abortions, to defend votes during
his congressional career to limit government-funded access to the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in New Hampshire before the debate, Bradley had
passed up a chance to criticize Gore, but three prominent Bradley
supporters denounced the vice president as an attack-style
politician who will lie to win.
</P>
<P>
   The sniping over ``attack'' campaigning began in the early
moments of the debate and flared repeatedly, making the hourlong
encounter the most spirited and personally revealing of the
campaign so far.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley labeled Gore ``the elephant of negative advertising,''
but Gore said Bradley was being hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to talk about a higher standard, you need to
live by it,'' Gore said. But one of the vice president's weakest
moments in the debate came as he tried to sell his current proposal
for campaign-finance reform in answer to a question about the
Clinton-Gore campaign fund-raising abuses four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, disavowing ``politics as usual,'' said Gore's campaign
boiled down to ``a thousand promises, a thousand attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate was the Democrats' seventh of the campaign and the
final one before next Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, the first of
the 2000 election. All recent polls of likely Democratic voters in
the Granite State give Gore a narrow lead, with nightly tracking
polls pointing to an increase in the vice president's appeal _ a
definite turn-around from late last fall when Bradley had an edge
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, fabled for his cool, rangy, professorial style, clearly
felt it was time to turn up the heat on Gore _ especially on issues
of declining trust and political reform, two topics popular with
New Hampshire independent voters to whom Bradley has appealed.
Bradley was helped in his effort by pointed questions to the vice
president about the more aggressive style of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   CNN news anchor Jury Woodruff asked Gore in her first question
to defend what she said some commentators consider the vice
president's mean, distorted campaign against Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that I have said in this campaign that is in
any way mean-spirited,'' Gore contended.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said some people might ``confuse free-spirited debate'' on
substance _ he cited his pointed critique of Bradley's health-care
proposal _ that was ``not anything but an exercise in democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the candidates dueled extensively over the details of
their health-care plans, the exchanges were essentially about
whether either was being truthful with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Citing media criticism of some of Gore's television
advertisements, Bradley asked the vice president how he could be
counted on to tell the truth as president if he did not do so in
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a negative attack?'' Gore asked archly. ``Let's be
serious about this,'' the vice president went on, repeating for the
second time in the encounter that his campaign had not used
Bradley's name or picture in an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore pointed out that it was Bradley who had brought up the
racially charged issue of Willie Horton, the Massachusetts convict
who figured in ads of the 1988 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley admitted a campaign transgression in an unrelated
pamphlet that he said was withdrawn quickly and argued that
comparing his record on attacks to Gore's was like comparing ``a
gnat to an elephant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the elephant of negative advertising,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley defended his use of surrogates to launch his campaign's
bluntest attacks on Gore, saying that he himself needed to uphold
his view that ``politics should be a case of beliefs, not
tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' Bradley said, that has not been reciprocated
by Gore in this campaign. At that, Gore called on Bradley to live
by the higher standard the former senator seemed to advocating.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a Boston Globe story Wednesday about Gore's strong
support from Washington lobbyists, Bradley demanded how Gore could
fight for average people as president when he was ``working hand in
glove'' with vested corporate interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's not negative, I don't know what it is,'' Gore
replied to Bradley's characterization, not denying the thrust of
the story. He recalled his fight against drug companies, which he
indicated were able to depend on Bradley to do their bidding when
he was in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff challenged Bradley on whether he had the stomach to
face down the Republican nominee in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he would rest on his Senate record, in which there
were ``a lot of fights'' on major issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had the stomach to challenge Gore on what he said was
the vice president's ``84 percent pro-life record'' in Congress.
Gore explained that while he had always supported the court's 1973
abortion decision he had at one time wrestled with whether Medicaid
funding should be used for the procedure and had eventually come to
the ``strong view'' that it should be.

 ARIZONANS PLACE 1ST AS COUCH POTATOES  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Arizonans rank first for stay ing put _ staying put
on the couch, that is.
</P>
<P>
   A new U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey
finds that Arizona is last in the nation in physical activity,
prompting the state Department of Health Services on Wednesday to
declare an ``epidemic'' of inac tivity.
</P>
<P>
   The number of adult Arizonans who said they engaged in some &UR; kind
of leisure-time physical ac tivity dropped from 76.3 percent in
1994 to 48.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The report follows the CDC's finding last fall that Arizona has
the nation's lowest percentage of obese adults. Public health ex
perts say they are stumped about Arizonans' apparent ability to
stay skinny by doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps we're not getting off the sofa to go to the refrigera
tor,'' state epidemiologist Norm Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Utah had the high est percentage of adults who are
physically active: 82.9 percent. The national average is 70.9 per
cent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tim Flood, medical direc tor for Arizona's Bureau of Pub lic
Health Statistics, said reasons for being sedentary could range
from increasing dependence on automobiles, the Internet, televi
sion and video games and people's concerns about their safety.
</P>

PATAKI SEEKS TO ADD TO PANEL TO ENFORCE LAWS AGAINST ILLEGAL
LOBBYING
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By WINNIE HU    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A month after the state Legislature toughened the
law regulating lobbying, Gov. George Pataki said Wednesday that he
would request $400,000 to create 11 new positions at the state
lobbying commission to enforce the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have a lot more work,'' Pataki said at a news
conference to announce changes to the budget proposal he unveiled
two weeks ago. ``They have a tougher lobbying law, and I think
that's a good thing.'' He said he would formally submit a list of
budget amendments to lawmakers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying commission monitors the activities and expenditures
of lobbyists and their clients. The six-member board, which is
appointed by the governor, and its nine staff members have the
authority to levy fines for lobbying violations. Last year, Philip
Morris paid $75,000, the highest such fine ever imposed, for
underreporting the money it spent to lobby New York lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Pataki would not specify how the commission would
be expanded, but state officials have previously requested
additional staff and money to keep up with the groundswell of
lobbying in the state capital. Expenditures by lobbyists climbed to
a record $55 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law passed in December, lobbyists will be required to
file financial statements of their expenditures every two months,
instead of four times a year under the previous law, and their
clients are to make reports twice a year to the commission, instead
of once. In addition, state officials will put in effect an
auditing system to check the statements and will extend the
lobbying law next year to counties and municipalities with more
than 50,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's proposed increase would bring the commission's budget
to $1,075,000, a 63.9 percent increase from last year. David M.
Grandeau, executive director of the commission, did not return
phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Horner, legislative director for the New York Public
Interest Research Group, said the increase might not be enough to
cover the costs of enforcing the lobbying law. ``No one really
knows how much it will cost to implement the new law,'' Horner
said. ``My guess is that this is a bare bones increase, and we will
urge legislators to spend even more.''
</P>
<P>
   John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Joseph
Bruno, said the governor's budget amendments, including the
increase for the lobbying commission, would be carefully reviewed.
``Senator Bruno is a strong advocate for lobbying reform, as well
as strengthening the disclosure requirements with the lobby
commission, and recognizes that this will take additional
resources,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for the Assembly speaker, Sheldon
Silver, would not comment on the governor's proposal until
lawmakers had had a chance to review it.
</P>
<P>
   In another change to his budget, Pataki said he would ask for $1
million to begin redeveloping Governors Island. Earlier this month,
Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani outlined a $30 million plan to
put a hotel and conference center, stores, apartments and public
parks on the 173-acre island south of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who is not proposing any cuts, said the overall budget
would remain the same, because his earlier figures had contained
inflated cost estimates in other areas. He said there would be no
major changes in his education proposals, which have quickly become
the most divisive issues between Republicans and Democrats.

ARIZONANS PLACE 1ST AS COUCH POTATOES

<P>
   (Phoenix) - Arizonans rank first for stay ing put _ staying put
on the couch, that is.
</P>
<P>
   A new U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey
finds that Arizona is last in the nation in physical activity,
prompting the state Department of Health Services on Wednesday to
declare an ``epidemic'' of inac tivity.
</P>
<P>
   The number of adult Arizonans who said they engaged in some &UR; kind
of leisure-time physical ac tivity dropped from 76.3 percent in
1994 to 48.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The report follows the CDC's finding last fall that Arizona has
the nation's lowest percentage of obese adults. Public health ex
perts say they are stumped about Arizonans' apparent ability to
stay skinny by doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps we're not getting off the sofa to go to the refrigera
tor,'' state epidemiologist Norm Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Utah had the high est percentage of adults who are
physically active: 82.9 percent. The national average is 70.9 per
cent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tim Flood, medical direc tor for Arizona's Bureau of Pub lic
Health Statistics, said reasons for being sedentary could range
from increasing dependence on automobiles, the Internet, televi
sion and video games and people's concerns about their safety.

 &HT;    Bradley, Gore heat up exchanges during debate
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett and Scott Shepard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Locked in a tight race, Vice President Al
Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley used Wednesday night's
Democratic debate to trade testy accusations over each other's
campaign tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure to be more assertive, Bradley delivered a
stinging attack on Gore's campaign tactics, calling him at one
point ``the elephant of negative campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we believe that you would tell the truth as
president if you don't tell the truth as a candidate?'' Bradley
asked the vice president after saying that Gore's advertising had
deliberately misrepresented Bradley's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Gore rejected Bradley's characterization, and, in turn, accused
Bradley of negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aggressive style reflected his need to perform well
after Gore's decisive victory Monday in the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's task was to strike a delicate balance _ continuing the
``fighter'' style that helped him in Iowa while avoiding being
overconfident.
</P>
<P>
   CNN anchor Judy Woodruff, one of the two moderators, put Gore on
the defensive with the first question, citing critics who say ``you
will do almost anything to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore denied that accusation and counter-punched, saying at one
point that Bradley's rebuttals were themselves ``negative personal
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Bradley was the only candidate who had been forced to
``apologize'' for a negative attack _ a reference to a flier his
campaign distributed in New Hampshire that suggested Gore was a
liar.
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeatedly objected to Bradley's criticism, at one point
saying: ``If you're going to talk about higher standards, you're
going to need to live by them.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said Bradley had resurrected the issue of Willie Horton,
a racially charged subject with which Republicans attacked Michael
Dukakis in the 1988 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore defended his ads as accurate and noted that none of them
used Bradley's name or his image but rather contrasted their
positions on issues. He suggested the former senator was frustrated
and was trying to ``shoot the messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of the previous debates, there was no studio
audience and no questions from voters. But the candidates were
given almost free reign to question each other and they used the
time to score points. At one point, Bradley delivered a diatribe on
what he called Gore's distortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a question there, senator?'' Woodruff asked. ``No,''
was Bradley's firm reply.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats also tussled over some of the top issues of
Democratic voters _ the economy, health care and even abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeatedly reminded the New Hampshire audience in the
nationally televised debate how the state's economy had rebounded
from a severe recession in 1992, the year Bill Clinton was elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the Clinton-Gore administration has ended the
deepest recession since the 1930s, when New Hampshire was losing
10,000 jobs a year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And when questions arose about Clinton's impeachment, Gore
defended the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of the whole discussion about the president's
personal mistake,'' he said. ``They think that by and large he has
been a great president in turning this economy around.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley challenged Gore's commitment to pro-abortion policies by
reminding him that Gore had voted against Medicaid funding of
abortions as a member of Congress from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also used the example to again suggest that Gore wasn't
truthful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your campaign shouldn't go around saying you have always
supported a women's right to choose when you have not,'' Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always supported a women's right to choose,'' Gore
said. But the vice president acknowledged that he had ``wrestled''
with how abortion should be covered by Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also sought to put Bradley on the defensive, criticizing
him for voting for President Reagan's budget cuts in 1981 and
voting against welfare reform in 1996, his final year in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how you can vote for the Reagan budget cuts and
campaign like Bobby Kennedy,'' Gore said. He claimed that the
resulting cuts forced 1 million children into Medicaid and 1.5
million into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an act of leadership,'' Bradley said. The deficits
``stole from the poor ... much more than the budget cuts.''

AT&AMP;T TO INVEST $250 MILLION IN APPLICATION SERVICES SECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to tap into a new sector, the AT&AMP;T Corp. plans to
announce on Thursday that it will invest $250 million in the next
three years to expand its presence in the developing business of
managing software applications for corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   At the Comnet show in Washington, AT&AMP;T is expected to discuss
plans to join with companies called application services providers
to allow corporations to run software from within AT&AMP;T's network
rather than on their own.
</P>
<P>
   With the expansion of high-speed communications networks around
the country, the ``applications hosting'' business appears poised
to grow quickly as corporations try to bring their far-flung
employees, customers and suppliers together with seamless digital
links.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is becoming a critical link in the computing and
communications chain to be able to either bring the applications
closer to the end-user or to bring the end-user closer to the
applications,'' Kathleen Earley, president of AT&AMP;T's data unit,
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, big communications carriers like AT&AMP;T are
looking to expand into more profitable lines as their old business
of providing mere communications pipes becomes largely
commoditized.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than compete against application services providers, AT&AMP;T
hopes to bring them within what the company calls an ``ecosystem
for ASP's.'' Among the companies AT&AMP;T has already enlisted as
partners in that effort are Sun Microsystem, EMC, Cisco Systems,
Hewlett-Packard and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Among potential partners that AT&AMP;T could be expected to approach
are Oracle and SAP AG, the German company that is the world's
largest maker of business management software.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its ecosystem effort, AT&AMP;T intends to offer marketing
partnerships with other companies as well as new sorts of
cooperation in linking to and exploiting AT&AMP;T's extensive global
network.

PEACE WON'T SOLVE PROBLEMS OF SYRIAN BUSINESSMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (CHANGES ``California'' to ``United States'' in graf
beginning:``Not so long ago...) 
 (rk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ They have luxury cars, marble-floored offices,
satellite dishes, tailored suits and high-end computers. But young
Syrian entrepreneurs, anxious to catch up with their contemporaries
in other Arab countries, are feeling distinctly bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   On the horizon, they can see the outlines of a new world, one in
which Syria's inefficient and inward looking producers will have to
compete in a newly energized Middle East free of trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   And while an end to the 52-year-old state of war between Syria
and Israel is also in sight, with its promise of access to Western
markets and investment, many businessmen here fear they will not be
able to reap any of the economic dividends of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``With or without peace, we will be left behind,'' said Hashem
Akkad, an outspoken member of the traditionally quiescent Syrian
Parliament and a director of his family's bottling and advertising
concern. ``I told the government, `If you don't make changes, in
five years all our plants will be shut down.'''
</P>
<P>
   For restless business executives like Akkad, who said he had
given up trying to open new factories in Syria, the question of
whether they will do business with Israelis after a peace treaty is
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   They say their more pressing concern is how much longer Syrians
will be able to do business at all, given their country's lack of a
private banking system, the morass of regulations choking
investment and the peculiar pricing policy that makes Syrian goods
more expensive than better quality items produced in neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations during the last week, a number of Syrian
businessmen displayed a striking sense of anxiety about their
country's near-term future, even as they gingerly welcomed the
prospect of peace for its own sake.
</P>
<P>
   These men, all in their 30s and 40s and owners of small- and
medium- sized factories and service companies, are among the few
who took the risk of trying their hand at private enterprise after
President Hafez Assad relaxed some investment rules at the end of
the Persian Gulf War nearly nine years ago and opened the borders
to some imports.
</P>
<P>
   But those reforms turned out to be the last step instead of the
first toward liberalizing an economy built on socialism and
cronyism.
</P>
<P>
   Jamil Samin, 45, a businessman in Homs, an industrial city about
100 miles northeast of Damascus, at first jumped at the chance to
start his own company. But he has since found that there are
built-in limits to how much he can expand.
</P>
<P>
   Purchasing power is low in a country where the average per
capita income is estimated by international economists at about
$900 a year. Like other importers of goods besides sugar, oil and
other commodities, Samin has no access to credit and can acquire
hard currency to pay his Italian supplier only by buying dollars
from a Syrian exporter who has earned them.
</P>
<P>
   In practice that means he asks around to find, say, a farmer who
has sold vegetables for dollars to a neighboring country. The
farmer, who may have earned $20,000, is required to sell one-fourth
of the dollars to the government. The rest he can sell for Syrian
pounds to an importer who tracks him down, but only through the
government-owned commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It restricts my ability to grow,'' said Samin, who knows
something of conventional business practices because he worked for
an insurance company in the United States for a few years after
finishing college. ``Syria just does not have yet the structures
necessary to provide financing for import and export.''
</P>
<P>
   But its natural trading partners in the region do have them.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Turkey and the Persian
Gulf states have largely unleashed their entrepreneurs, created
capital markets and opened their economies to investment. Unlike
most Syrians, products of an insular political regime, many of the
new Arab entrepreneurs in those countries have traveled and lived
outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not so long ago, it was the Gulf countries that hired Syrians
to come and give technical and business advice,'' said Thaer Laham,
the owner of a can factory who was exposed to another way of doing
business during his college years in the United States. ``Now look
at them. They are ahead of us and export their own products to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases the imports coming from other Arab countries are
cheaper than the same Syrian-made goods, which cost more to produce
despite the country's low wages. One reason is the government's
pricing policy for Syria's own resources. Domestic clothing and
textile manufacturers, for example, pay 150 percent more than
European importers for the same Syrian-grown cotton.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is likely to become tougher in the coming years,
regardless of whether Israel is part of the regional trading mix,
because of a 1997 agreement among Arab states, including Syria, to
gradually eliminate all trade barriers. The effect will be a flood
of tax-free imported goods that may well be less expensive and of
better quality than Syrian-made products.
</P>
<P>
   ``A restructuring effort at all levels is needed,'' said Nabil
Sukkar, a former World Bank economist who runs the Syrian
Consulting Bureau in Damascus. ``The name of the game is
competition, within the domestic economy and with the outside
world. Other countries in the region are facing the same economic
challenges, but they started restructuring long before.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what rules might apply to trade with Israel. Syria
has insisted that the border between the countries must be decided
before, or at least at the same time as, the shape of future
relations. But many Syrian businessmen regard Israel as a market
much like Europe and the United States _ that is, an impenetrable
juggernaut that could roll right over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is Syria going to face European states that are free and
open while Syria is the least developed in terms of its industry?''
Rateb Shallah, the president of the Federation of Syrian Chambers
of Commerce and Industry, said at a symposium on trade between
Syria and the European Union last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not feasible to postpone decision-making, because we
will lose the chance for reform,'' he added, in a direct and public
admonition that not long ago would have been unthinkable from such
an establishment figure.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Syria's political debate is conjecture and
interpretation of small hints from above, and like everyone else,
businessmen take their cue from the government-controlled
television and newspapers about what is permissible to discuss
openly. Lately, at least in the view of some people, the signals
from the top have encouraged their hopes for change.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last March, Assad spoke generally about the need for
creating new economic institutions but did not give a timetable.
Lately, some businessmen said, the press has featured stories about
scandal and corruption in branches of the state banks, perhaps in
preparation for introducing a new policy.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these Syrian entrepreneurs also say they believe they
have a silent ally in Assad's son, Bashar, who is widely seen as
his father's chosen successor.
</P>
<P>
   He has not said anything publicly about economic policy, or much
of anything else. Still, based on little more than what one Syrian
businessman called ``Damascus chitchat'' and the fact that he was
educated in England, the younger Assad is widely presumed to be
open to free market ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Once one of the most industrialized countries in the region,
Syria has depended for 30 years on two mainstays: its limited oil
reserves and foreign aid. But now the Persian Gulf states, like
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, no longer subsidize the Syrian budget, as
they did from the 1970s until the late 1980s. Growth has now fallen
to 2 percent or less a year, said Sukkar, the economist.
</P>
<P>
   The dismal situation has left many of the most energetic of
Syria's entrepreneurs sitting in their well-appointed offices
wondering what the future holds.
</P>
<P>
   Mamoun Hallek, for instance, runs a school that employs 70
people who teach courses in business management, computers,
English, marketing, sales and more. His Mamoun International Center
in Damascus is a gleaming three-story complex built around a
pristine courtyard garden.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the 2,000 young men and women who graduate each year
from his institute cannot find managerial work in Syria's
stagnating economy and end up leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hallek's obvious financial success _ his gleaming black
Mercedes, cashmere jacket and mahogany office suite _ he said he
has reached the limit of what he can do without an infusion of
capital from outside investors. ``If I had to start again now,'' he
said, ``I wouldn't choose this kind of work.''
</P>
<P>
   He is thinking of shifting his attention to tourism, which
remains quasi-governmental, hoping to open a hotel management
school and a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``After peace, tourists will feel more at ease,'' Hallek said.
``That's what I hope _ that our image will improve. Right now, when
I go to America, people hear I am Syrian and they think I'm
carrying bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   But many others say the answers lie closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a mentality here that is unique in the world,'' Akkad
said. ``I established a pasta plant five years ago. Now it is
practically closed. Why? Because the government wants me to buy
local wheat. OK, I would encourage that, but they want to send me
low-quality wheat at $500 a ton. I can import wheat from Europe at
half that price. Is that the way the government wants to encourage
investment?''
</P>
<P>
   Akkad's litany of outrages seemed limitless. A billboard rented
for 15 days to an advertiser brings his company $1,000, he said,
while in Lebanon a company like his can charge $24,000. Customs
duties on many goods imported from Lebanon, meanwhile, will soon be
eliminated, even as Syrian producers pay high import duties on raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Even with peace, Syria will be a loser economically because it
will not be able to compete even with its Arab neighbors, according
to Akkad, who voiced what many other businessmen said were their
own fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``After peace, there will be no paradise like some people
think,'' he said. ``Since the right atmosphere is not available
nobody will come here. They will go to Lebanon and have a door open
to Syria without the problem of paying taxes to export their
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only logic I can see in this system is that someone wants
the industry in this country to be killed.''

   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Clearly emboldened by his strong second-place
finish in the Iowa caucuses, Steve Forbes sought to use the
Republican debate here Wednesday night to put the front-runner,
George W. Bush, on the defensive, arguing that Bush's record as
governor of Texas was not as glowing as Bush portrays it to be.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was not the only one to criticize Bush, but his
accusations that education in Texas had gotten worse and that
government spending had increased under Bush seemed to hit the
hardest. Bush paused for several seconds during his response.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many half stories, so little time,'' the governor said of
Forbes' recitation of what he saw as Bush's failures. He said
Forbes was getting his record entirely wrong and cited his
re-election in 1998 as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the people of Texas took a look at my record,'' Bush
said, ``and they said, `Mr. Governor, we accept your record,' and
they overwhelmingly voted me back into office. I nearly got 70
percent of the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last Republican debate before the New Hampshire primary
on Tuesday, there were equally tense exchanges between Bush and
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who are locked in a tight battle here.
</P>
<P>
   This was the two candidates' final shot at each other in a
public forum, and they did not squander it, squabbling in
particular over which one of them would be the truest enemy of
bigger, more bloated, less-honest government.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has made several proposals for altering the federal
government's role in education, asked McCain why he did not support
more accountability for schools that received additional federal
funds for teaching disadvantaged children. Bush noted that another
prominent critic of the plan was Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're saying that I'm like Al Gore,'' McCain shot back,
``then you're spinning like Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that what he wanted to do was take some of the money
that the federal government was using to subsidize such programs
and industries as ethanol in Iowa and sugar in Florida and put it
in education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush promoted his proposal for a $483 billion tax cut over the
next five years as an insurance policy against too much money in
Washington and too much unnecessary federal spending. McCain's plan
for a tax cut is more modest than Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   This debate, sponsored by CNN and WMUR-TV in Manchester, was the
seventh since early December to feature all of the contenders for
the Republican presidential nomination, although that field had
narrowed to five from six with the withdrawal Wednesday of Sen.
Orrin Hatch of Utah. In announcing his exit from the race, Hatch,
who finished last in Iowa on Monday with 1 percent of the
Republican vote, endorsed Bush, saying he is the ``one who can
unite the party and bring the White House back to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The dynamic between the candidates had clearly been altered by
the results of the Iowa caucuses, in which Bush finished first, but
the second-place finish of Forbes and third-place finish of Alan
Keyes were both surprisingly strong.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes found himself under fire Wednesday night from Keyes and
Gary L. Bauer, who have both sought to claim the votes of the
party's religious and social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Those three men have tried to put Bush and McCain on the
defensive about abortion, and that effort continued Wednesday
night. Keyes used a statement that McCain had made earlier in the
day to question his anti-abortion convictions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had said, in answer to a question about what he would
advise his 15-year-old daughter if she had an unwanted pregnancy,
that the ``final decision'' on whether to have an abortion would be
up to her. He then backpedaled, saying he had misspoken.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, McCain said that his record over more than a
decade in the Senate proved his anti-abortion mettle. ``I will not
draw my children into this discussion,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, too, danced around the topic of abortion, answering a
question about how, if given the opportunity, he would write a
concise abortion amendment to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, he said, ``It would be that every child, born
and unborn, be protected in the law.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, ``Our party must not abandon our
pro-life position, but we must welcome people from different
persuasions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most heated exchanges occurred when Bauer and Keyes
accused Forbes of being unwilling to give direct answers to direct
questions about whether to impose trade sanctions on China and to
withdraw from the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve, you've had about four different positions on this,''
Bauer said. ``I still don't know where you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes insisted in both cases that a tough engagement was
needed, setting rules that the Clinton administration had never
made clear, and that punitive action could wait.
</P>
<P>
   A question that clearly divided the candidates was whether, as
the presidential commission on debates recently decreed, candidates
polling less than 15 percent in national polls should be excluded
from debates this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, Keyes and Forbes all strenuously opposed the decision.
Forbes called it ``grossly unfair to put that kind of power in the
hands of pollsters and elites.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Bush clearly supported the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The result of New Hampshire's primary is less important to Bush
than to McCain, who essentially bypassed Iowa so he could spend
more time in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would clearly like to stop the senator, but if he does not,
he can still count on much better poll numbers and more extensive
organizations in subsequent primary states.
</P>
<P>
   He also has more money, which has already allowed him to run
television commercials in more than a half dozen states with
contests after New Hampshire's.

GORE, BRADLEY CLASH IN FINAL PRIMARY DEBATE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Democratic presidential contenders Al Gore
and Bill Bradley clashed heatedly and repeatedly Wednesday in a
debate that grew most contentious on questions of personal
political style and campaign tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey, also forced Vice
President Gore, who claims a career-long dedication to backing the
Supreme Court decision legalizing abortions, to defend votes during
his congressional career to limit government-funded access to the
controversial procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in New Hampshire before the debate, Bradley had
passed up a chance to criticize Gore, but three prominent Bradley
supporters denounced the vice president as an attack-style
politician who will lie to win.
</P>
<P>
   The sniping over ``attack'' campaigning began in the early
moments of the debate and flared repeatedly, making the hourlong
encounter the most spirited and personally revealing of the
campaign so far.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley labeled Gore ``the elephant of negative advertising,''
but Gore said Bradley was being hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to talk about a higher standard, you need to
live by it,'' Gore said. But one of the vice president's weakest
moments in the debate came as he tried to sell his current proposal
for campaign-finance reform in answer to a question about the
Clinton-Gore campaign fund-raising abuses four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, disavowing ``politics as usual,'' said Gore's campaign
boiled down to ``a thousand promises, a thousand attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps his unkindest cut, Bradley said that Gore's disavowal
of negative campaigning reminded him of a story about Richard
Nixon, the Republican president whom Democrats invoke when they
really want to make an audience's skin crawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say Richard Nixon's the kind of politician who'd chop
down a tree and then stand on the stump and give a speech about
conservation,'' Bradley said. ``It just won't fly.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate was the Democrats' seventh of the campaign and the
final one before next Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, the first of
the 2000 election. All recent polls of likely Democratic voters in
the Granite State give Gore a narrow lead, with nightly tracking
polls pointing to an increase in the vice president's appeal _ a
definite turn-around from late last fall when Bradley had a clear
edge in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, fabled for his cool, rangy, professorial style, clearly
felt it was time to turn up the heat on Gore _ especially on issues
of declining trust and political reform, two topics popular with
New Hampshire independent voters to whom Bradley has appealed.
Bradley was helped in his effort by pointed questions to the vice
president about the more aggressive style of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   CNN news anchor Jury Woodruff asked Gore in her first question
to defend what she said some commentators consider the vice
president's mean, distorted campaign against Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that I have said in this campaign that is in
any way mean-spirited,'' Gore contended.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said some people might ``confuse free-spirited debate'' on
substance _ he cited his pointed critique of Bradley's health-care
proposal _ that was ``not anything but an exercise in democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the two candidates dueled extensively over the details
of their health-care plans, the exchanges were essentially about
whether either was being truthful with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Citing media criticism of some of Gore's television
advertisements, Bradley asked the vice president how he could be
counted on to tell the truth as president if he did not do so in
the campaign. ``Any politician can pick a fight, but only a leader
can move a country forward,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a negative attack?'' Gore asked archly. ``Let's be
serious about this,'' the vice president went on, repeating for the
second time in the encounter that his campaign had not used
Bradley's name or picture in an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore pointed out that it was Bradley who had brought up the
racially charged issue of Willie Horton, the Massachusetts convict
who figured in ads of the 1988 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley defended his use of surrogates to launch his campaign's
bluntest attacks on Gore, saying that he himself needed to uphold
his view that ``politics should be a case of beliefs, not
tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' Bradley said, that has not been reciprocated
by Gore in this campaign. At that, Gore called on Bradley to live
by the higher standard the former senator seemed to advocating.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a Boston Globe story Wednesday about Gore's strong
support from Washington lobbyists, Bradley demanded how Gore could
fight for average people as president when he was ``working hand in
glove'' with vested corporate interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's not negative, I don't know what it is,'' Gore
replied to Bradley's characterization, not denying the thrust of
the story. He recalled his fight against drug companies, which he
indicated were able to depend on Bradley to do their bidding when
he was in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff challenged Bradley on whether he had the stomach to
face down the Republican nominee in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he would rest on his Senate record, in which there
were ``a lot of fights'' on major issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had the stomach to challenge Gore on what he said was
the vice president's ``84 percent pro-life record'' in Congress.
Gore explained that while he had always supported the court's 1973
abortion decision he had at one time wrestled with whether Medicaid
funding should be used for the procedure and had eventually come to
the ``strong view'' that it should be.

HOW SYSTEM LET DOCTOR WORK AFTER CARVING INCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   and EDWARD WONG     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Dr. Allan Zarkin came looking for work, Merle
Hoffman could not have been happier. She and the doctor had worked
together off and on for many years in her clinic, Choices Women's
Medical Center in Queens. Moreover, her medical director had just
left, so she happily handed the title over to Zarkin on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   What she said she did not know was that the doctor had been
dismissed just weeks before from Beth Israel Medical Center for
what may be the most bizarre incident in the history of the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Zarkin is accused of carving his initials into the stomach of a
patient on whom he had just performed a Caesarean section, a charge
he does not deny. The patient, Dr. Liana Gedz, is suing the
hospital, the doctor and his former medical practice for $5.5
million, charging that the incident has left her physically and
emotionally scarred. Zarkin has since had his medical license
temporarily suspended pending a final investigation, and he is also
the subject of an inquiry by the Manhattan district attorney's
office.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Zarkin was able to practice medicine _ and by some
accounts with further bad results _ after the incident at Beth
Israel underscores that even within a system like New York's, which
is known nationally for its oversight of doctors, the smallest
bureaucratic missteps, combined with peculiarities in the law, can
keep even egregiously bad doctors in practice.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Beth Israel did much by the book. The hospital
dismissed Zarkin almost immediately after the incident and reported
the dismissal to the state in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   But the hospital did not detail in its note to the state what
exactly Zarkin had done, which, state officials say, accounts for a
four-month lapse between the incident and his license suspension.
Further, the hospital sent a letter to Ms. Hoffman, his new
supervisor at Choices, informing her that he was no longer
admitting patients there, and that she should contact them with any
questions about Zarkin. It did not mention the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoffman, who trusted Zarkin, did not check with Beth Israel
or Zarkin's former partners about why he had parted ways with them,
she said. But not checking his credentials is a violation of state
law, and her clinic, which provides abortions and other women's
health services, is now being investigated by the State Department
of Health.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the state moved quickly to get Zarkin out of
medicine when it finally learned the details of what happened at
Beth Israel in September. But the Department of Health had already
received at least two complaints from patients about the doctor,
one well over a year old. Further, under state law, officials at
the agency would not have been permitted to tell Ms. Hoffman
anything about Zarkin's history or the fact he was being
investigated until his license was officially suspended, which was
not the case when he returned to work at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The events surrounding Zarkin are the sort that draw fire from
health care policy experts who cite recent data showing that
medical error is among the leading causes of accidental deaths in
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is this type of breakdown in oversight combined with a kind
of lackluster commitment on behalf of facilities that leads to
unnecessary injuries and deaths,'' said Blair Horner, the
legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research
Group. Horner's group is among many pushing for a law that would
make extensive information about doctors available to New York
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many doctors whose licenses are ultimately suspended,
Zarkin had a clinical history that suggested anything but imminent
disaster. Although obstetrics and gynecology is a speciality that
draws a disproportionate number of malpractice suits among even its
finest doctors, his record was nearly spotless. Further, the
practice where he was a partner, New York Gyn/Ob Associates in the
Murray Hill section of Manhattan, was well respected at the
hospital and by its peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an excellent physician,'' said one senior doctor, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``He got along very well with
his patients and was a good citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Zarkin did stand out. Among the blue shirt and white jacket set,
he wore high-fashion suits and loud ties, and was known for his
garrulous, joking nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was around, you would know it,'' one doctor said.
Another added: ``He was larger than life. Personality-wise, he was
a little nutty, but in terms of medical judgment, no one questioned
him.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, it was apparent that not all patients
were happy. The Department of Health has said it is looking into
two other patient complaints against Zarkin. Although a spokeswoman
would not elaborate on the complaints, a woman who contacted The
New York Times said she visited Zarkin in the mid-1990s for routine
gynecological exams. The patient, who insisted that her name not be
used, said that Zarkin made increasingly lewd remarks to her over
three years, leading her to file a complaint with the state.
</P>
<P>
   Besides making crass sex jokes, she said, Zarkin commented that
she was ``beautiful'' and his ``favorite patient.'' She filed a
complaint with the Department of Health, she said, when the doctor
told her he was taking Viagra three times per day and masturbating
in the shower.
</P>
<P>
   A Health Department spokeswoman, Kristine Smith, said that the
department had taken a sexual harassment complaint against Zarkin
seriously and investigated it. She added that in those types of
cases, the department tended to prefer to build a case against a
doctor showing a pattern of abuses, and was moving toward that goal
before Sept. 7, when Ms. Gedz had her C-section at Beth Israel.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Ms. Gedz, a dentist, and Zarkin had developed a
fond friendship while he was caring for her during her pregnancy.
He had even been a guest at a summer home she and her husband
owned.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts of what happened during the delivery are sketchy _
the hospital will not provide full details, citing the lawsuit, and
Ms. Gedz refused repeated requests for an interview. But after he
completed the surgery, Zarkin apparently sliced his initials in Ms.
Gedz's stomach, something she discovered in the recovery room. (The
hospital says that staff members who were in the operating room
immediately told their supervisors.)
</P>
<P>
   Zarkin's lawyers say that the incident was a manifestation of
Pick's disease, an Alzheimer-like degeneration of the frontal lobe
of the brain. ``Our legal response to the lawsuit was that what was
done was not a willful or intentional act,'' said Zarkin's lawyer,
Kenneth J. Platzer, who added that he could not comment on other
complaints against his client.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Israel executives said they were horrified. After a brief
investigation, they suspended his right to work at the hospital,
and he resigned on Sept. 17 rather than face dismissal and the
hearing process. The hospital wrote to the state saying that he
would no longer practice medicine there, citing ``gross
misconduct.'' He was also dismissed by the partners at his Murray
Hill practice.
</P>
<P>
   But the state did not move as quickly. Investigations take a
certain amount of time, Ms. Smith said. The agency has the right to
keep a doctor from practicing while he or she awaits due process,
which it would have done if it had been given the details of why
Zarkin left Beth Israel, she said. ``It is fair to say that had we
known the specific circumstances that produced the allegations from
Beth Israel, we would have moved much more quickly to stop his
practice of medicine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Ms. Smith said, the hospital did not file an
additional report with the agency's bureau of hospitals, which is
mandatory when there is an incident that adversely affects a
patient, and is something she said the hospital might be penalized
for.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mandler, a Beth Israel spokesman, said: ``We felt that the
language `gross misconduct' would automatically precipitate a
thorough investigation with which we had every intention of
cooperating with fully.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 7, once the department did learn the circumstances, it
temporarily suspended Zarkin's license, four months after the
doctor carved his initials into his patient's stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Zarkin did not share any of these details with Ms. Hoffman at
the Queens clinic when he came looking for a job, she said. Zarkin
had worked for her part time between 1983 and 1991, and she was
very pleased with his work. ``He always presented himself as a
physician who cared deeply about patients,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Things started to look strange when she got a letter in late
December from an insurance company that said it would not be
renewing Zarkin's malpractice insurance. Soon after, an oblique
letter from Beth Israel arrived in the mail, suggesting that if she
had any questions about the doctor, she should call the department
chairman, which she did not do.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, Zarkin's care at Choices was not all it should
have been. A complaint filed with the State Health Department by
Dr. Enayat Hakim Elahi, the medical director who preceded Zarkin at
the clinic, relates a November incident in which Zarkin botched a
complicated gynecological surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Elahi, who has filed many complaints to the state about
conditions at Choices, says that he did not see the incident; he
heard of it through his former colleagues there. The incident was
confirmed through interviews with other clinic employees who agreed
with Elahi's assessment. Ms. Hoffman denied the assertions that
poor care was given at her clinic, and said that Elahi had a grudge
against her.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 28, Ms. Hoffman, who reads all the mail that comes to
the clinic as a safety precaution, said she opened a letter to
Zarkin from Ms. Gedz's lawyers informing him of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw he was being sued for $5.5 million for carving A Z on
someone's stomach,'' she said in an interview. ``I felt shock and
amazement when I read it. I called him into my office and I asked
him, `Did you do these things?' and he said, `Yes,' and I asked him
why and how this could have happened and he said he thought he did
such a beautiful job, he thought he should sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   She dismissed him that day. ``I felt profoundly betrayed,'' Ms.
Hoffman said. ``Obviously if he had told me he would never have
been hired.''

PEOPLE NEED HELP FROM EMPLOYERS, CO-WORKERS WHEN MENTAL ILLNESS
STRIKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Donna asked me to share her story.
</P>
<P>
   She was deeply depressed, and she slit her wrist at work. She
lived _ but life as she knew it ended.
</P>
<P>
   She lost a 20-year career, her income, and 401(k) and insurance
plans. She spent a year in bed, overwhelmed by depression. She
gained 100 pounds. She declared bankruptcy and lost her home.
</P>
<P>
   She has a closet full of clothes but, except for some sweat
pants, none that fit, and she can't afford to buy anything new. She
rarely ventures out.
</P>
<P>
   Legal deadlines passed for pursuing claims against her former
employer for what she thought were violations of the Family and
Medical Leave Act or Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, she is peeling back the heavy blanket of
depression. But she says her emotional and financial hole is so
deep that her only hope is to warn others so a similar fate doesn't
befall them.
</P>
<P>
   I told Donna I'd try.
</P>
<P>
   No one plans for mental illness. It can creep up or hit with
vengeance. When it does, sufferers often fall through the social
safety net.
</P>
<P>
   ``God forbid, it would have been better to get cancer,'' Donna
said.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't possible here to dissect whether or why the human
resources department at Donna's company failed her, or whether she
slipped through the cracks of equal rights laws, or why her mental
illness was so much more financially devastating than a physical
illness would have been.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, though, to give Donna a voice.
</P>
<P>
   Her message is this: Mental illness, especially depression,
profoundly impairs a person's ability to think, feel and relate to
others or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill says two-thirds of
those who suffer major depression are treated successfully through
therapy and medication. Yet many remain unemployed. Up to nine out
of 10 persons with schizophrenia, major depression or bipolar
(manic-depressive) disorder are unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, the alliance says, 150,000 mentally ill people
are homeless. If she weren't able to live with her mother, Donna
might be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Donna is thinking more clearly now and moving a bit more
energetically. But she can't reclaim the years she lost. She can't
make up a line to fill a blank spot in her resume. She's not sure
she can ever re-establish friendships with _ or get references from
_ her former co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Her situation suggests all of us need to be aware. In any year,
more than 5 million Americans experience an acute episode of mental
illness. A severe mental illness affects one in five families at
some time.
</P>
<P>
   The workplace _ and those of us in it _ can't afford to be too
shy, too embarrassed or too afraid to offer support to co-workers
who are stricken.
</P>
<P>
   For many months, Donna could not think or act for herself. Her
family didn't know how to help her investigate or protect her
workplace rights. But where were her former co-workers, both peers
and managers?
</P>
<P>
   Donna: Please call me again. I want to know you're making
progress. I want to know that you know your story may help others.

 NEW YORK: questioned him.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years, however, it was apparent that not all patients
were happy. The Department of Health has said it is looking into
two other patient complaints against Zarkin. Although a spokeswoman
would not elaborate on the complaints, a woman who contacted The
New York Times said she visited Zarkin in the mid-1990s for routine
gynecological exams. The patient, who insisted that her name not be
used, said that Zarkin made increasingly lewd remarks to her over
three years, leading her to file a complaint with the state.
</P>
<P>
   Besides making crass sex jokes, she said, Zarkin commented that
she was ``beautiful'' and his ``favorite patient.'' She filed a
complaint with the Department of Health, she said, when the doctor
told her he was taking Viagra three times per day and masturbating
in the shower.
</P>
<P>
   A Health Department spokeswoman, Kristine Smith, said that the
department had taken a sexual harassment complaint against Zarkin
seriously and investigated it. She added that in those types of
cases, the department tended to prefer to build a case against a
doctor showing a pattern of abuses, and was moving toward that goal
before Sept. 7, when Ms. Gedz had her C-section at Beth Israel.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Ms. Gedz, a dentist, and Zarkin had developed a
fond friendship while he was caring for her during her pregnancy.
He had even been a guest at a summer home she and her husband
owned.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts of what happened during the delivery are sketchy _
the hospital will not provide full details, citing the lawsuit, and
Ms. Gedz refused repeated requests for an interview. But after he
completed the surgery, Zarkin apparently sliced his initials in Ms.
Gedz's stomach, something she discovered in the recovery room. (The
hospital says that staff members who were in the operating room
immediately told their supervisors.)
</P>
<P>
   Zarkin's lawyers say that the incident was a manifestation of
Pick's disease, an Alzheimer-like degeneration of the frontal lobe
of the brain. ``Our legal response to the lawsuit was that what was
done was not a willful or intentional act,'' said Zarkin's lawyer,
Kenneth J. Platzer, who added that he could not comment on other
complaints against his client.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Israel executives said they were horrified. After a brief
investigation, they suspended his right to work at the hospital,
and he resigned on Sept. 17 rather than face dismissal and the
hearing process. The hospital wrote to the state saying that he
would no longer practice medicine there, citing ``gross
misconduct.'' He was also dismissed by the partners at his Murray
Hill practice.
</P>
<P>
   But the state did not move as quickly. Investigations take a
certain amount of time, Ms. Smith said. The agency has the right to
keep a doctor from practicing while he or she awaits due process,
which it would have done if it had been given the details of why
Zarkin left Beth Israel, she said. ``It is fair to say that had we
known the specific circumstances that produced the allegations from
Beth Israel, we would have moved much more quickly to stop his
practice of medicine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Ms. Smith said, the hospital did not file an
additional report with the agency's bureau of hospitals, which is
mandatory when there is an incident that adversely affects a
patient, and is something she said the hospital might be penalized
for.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mandler, a Beth Israel spokesman, said: ``We felt that the
language `gross misconduct' would automatically precipitate a
thorough investigation with which we had every intention of
cooperating with fully.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 7, once the department did learn the circumstances, it
temporarily suspended Zarkin's license, four months after the
doctor carved his initials into his patient's stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Zarkin did not share any of these details with Ms. Hoffman at
the Queens clinic when he came looking for a job, she said. Zarkin
had worked for her part time between 1983 and 1991, and she was
very pleased with his work. ``He always presented himself as a
physician who cared deeply about patients,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Things started to look strange when she got a letter in late
December from an insurance company that said it would not be
renewing Zarkin's malpractice insurance. Soon after, an oblique
letter from Beth Israel arrived in the mail, suggesting that if she
had any questions about the doctor, she should call the department
chairman, which she did not do.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, Zarkin's care at Choices was not all it should
have been. A complaint filed with the State Health Department by
Dr. Enayat Hakim Elahi, the medical director who preceded Zarkin at
the clinic, relates a November incident in which Zarkin botched a
complicated gynecological surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Elahi, who has filed many complaints to the state about
conditions at Choices, says that he did not see the incident; he
heard of it through his former colleagues there. The incident was
confirmed through interviews with other clinic employees who agreed
with Elahi's assessment. Ms. Hoffman denied the assertions that
poor care was given at her clinic, and said that Elahi had a grudge
against her.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 28, Ms. Hoffman, who reads all the mail that comes to
the clinic as a safety precaution, said she opened a letter to
Zarkin from Ms. Gedz's lawyers informing him of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw he was being sued for $5.5 million for carving A Z on
someone's stomach,'' she said in an interview. ``I felt shock and
amazement when I read it. I called him into my office and I asked
him, `Did you do these things?' and he said, `Yes,' and I asked him
why and how this could have happened and he said he thought he did
such a beautiful job, he thought he should sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   She dismissed him that day. ``I felt profoundly betrayed,'' Ms.
Hoffman said. ``Obviously if he had told me he would never have
been hired.''

SPRINT AGREES TO SELL STAKE IN GLOBAL ONE FOR $1.4 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTWOOD, Kan. _ Five years after launching its much-heralded
international venture with European phone giants Deutsche Telekom
and France Telecom, Sprint Corp. has agreed to sell its stake in
Global One to its European partners for $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, when consummated, will eliminate a persistent
drag on the Westwood company's earnings and leave it free to pursue
international business in concert with MCI WorldCom, its proposed
merger partner.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint will receive $1.13 billion in cash and repayment of $276
million in debt for its stake in Global One, which constitutes
one-third of the venture's European operations and 50 percent of
operations outside Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, France Telecom is buying Deutsche Telekom's share of
the business for $2.76 billion in cash and $189 million in debt.
France Telecom will operate the business, which serves 35,000
business customers.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom each own 10 percent of
Sprint. As part of the agreement, they will vote their shares in
favor of Sprint's proposed merger with MCI WorldCom and relinquish
their two seats on Sprint's board once the vote occurs, most likely
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, international alliances were touted as the best
way for carriers to offer customers end-to-end communications
services around the globe, without the expense of building their
own networks. AT&AMP;T embarked on a partnership with British Telecom
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, however, point to Global One as a case study in the
difficulty of making such partnerships work. The venture was
plagued by larger-than-expected losses and management turnover
since its inception, problems compounded by the partners' inability
to agree on a strategic vision.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship among the European partners further soured last
year when Deutsche Telekom bid for Telecom Italia without informing
France Telecom, a violation of the companies' partnership
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Even the breakup of the venture took longer than expected, as
the companies haggled over an acceptable price.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Sprint officials say they invested $718 million in the
venture. The company's share of Global One losses have totaled
about $650 million since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this wasn't a good investment for them,'' said Mel
Marten, an analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis. ``With their
merger with WorldCom, they'll get a completely different view of
how these things work.''
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom has its own international networks, which experts
now see as a preferable strategy to joint ventures, one that may
spark a new outbreak of international mergers among phone
companies. MCI competes directly against Global One in selling
voice and data services to multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint customers who use Global One's network are guaranteed
service for the duration of their contracts, or at least two years.
Sprint is barred from offering competing services to those
customers for one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We retain the choice of selling Global One, or we can sell
Sprint-branded international services that are being purchased from
MCI WorldCom,'' said James Fisher, a Sprint spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint said financial results from Global One would be reported
as a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter. When the
transaction is completed, Sprint will record a gain on the sale in
that quarter.

MCCAIN TRIPPING UP ON ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain tripped over abortion politics Wednesday, saying he
would leave the decision about having an abortion up to his
15-year-old daughter if she faced an unwanted pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain then amended his statement to stress that the decision
would be made by the family, but it was too late to prevent
McCain's opponents from painting it as evidence that the Arizona
senator's record of voting against abortions rights has given way
to a more liberal position.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was asked the question as television cameras rolled
aboard his campaign bus in New Hampshire. He appeared to grow
irritated with the reporters but responded to the question, ``Would
he tell his teen-age daughter she could not get an abortion?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain at first said, ``No, it would be a private decision . . .
Obviously, I would encourage her to know that the baby would be
brought up in a warm and loving family. The final decision would be
made by Megan with our advice and counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   He was then asked whether that was consistent with the answer an
abor tion-rights advocate would give.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is the pro-choice position to say that my
daughter and my wife and I will discuss something that is a family
matter that we have to decide,'' McCain said. ``I'm not gonna talk
about what I'm gonna do with my daughter in the most personal and
painful kind of situa tion that I can imagine outside of a terminal
illness.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, he said, ``I misspoke. What I believed I
was saying and intended to say is that this is a family decision,''
McCain said, not his daughter's decision alone.
</P>
<P>
   McCain grew testy when reporters continued to press him during
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter with you, sir?'' he asked one. ``I've
answered your question, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   At a stop at the Merrimack Restau rant, McCain repeated, ``It's
a family decision, not her decision'' and said that was a
``pro-life'' position. He refused to answer further questions,
turning to greet diners.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Texas Gov. George W. Bush said the remarks
highlight McCain's inconsistency on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sen. McCain has given a number of positions in
response to these questions, and it will be up to him to explain
the number of positions he has taken,'' said Ari Fleisher, a Bush
aide.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's abortion stance also came under attack from Alan Keyes
dur ing Wednesday's GOP presidential debate. Keyes, an abortion
oppo nent, challenged the notion that McCain would leave the matter
in his daughter's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that displayed a profound lack of understanding of the
basic issue and principle involved in abor tion,'' Keyes said.
``After all, if your daughter came to you and contem plated killing
her grandmother for her inheritance . . . you would look at her and
just say `no.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McCain responded firmly but dispas sionately at first, noting
his anti-abortion voting record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only one here who has gone to the floor of the Senate
and voted for the preservation of the life of the unborn,'' McCain
said. ``I have worked very hard for the ban of partial-birth
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   He also tried to draw a line against discussing the matter out
of concern for his daughter's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not draw my children into this discussion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the debate, McCain re turned some fire of his own,
berating Keyes for questioning his anti-abor tion credentials and
referring to experiences in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell you something,'' McCain said. ``I've seen
enough killing in my life. I know how precious life is. And I don't
need a lecture from you.''
</P>
<P>
   As a U.S. senator, McCain has posted a consistent record against
abortion rights - pushing, for in stance, for a ban on
partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But lately he has gotten into political difficulties after
talking about the issue. Last fall, McCain was panned by abortion
foes for remarks he made to the editorial board of the San
Francisco Chronicle suggesting that it might be necessary to put
off overturning Roe v. Wade because the political climate in the
country was not ripe. McCain also worried then that repeal of the
Supreme Court decision would drive women to find back-alley
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   A representative for one national anti-abortion group said
McCain's statements in New Hampshire are one more sign of his
softening on the issue, a transformation they say began when McCain
jumped into the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``His current position is pretty cloudy. We are not comfortable
with him as a pro-life candidate, and we are very concerned,'' said
Davis O'Steen, executive director of the National Right to Life
Committee. ``He's got an overall pro-life voting record, but he
seems to have moved away from that as he ran for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been asked how he would counsel a loved one if she ever
became pregnant after a rape. His answer was that such a decision
would ``be up to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the Texas governor were quick to point out that
McCain's response was to the question of what he would tell his
daughter should she have an unwanted pregnancy, not a rape.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also tacitly criticized McCain for answering
the question at all, saying Bush would not respond to such a
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush will not let his children get dragged into this
campaign,'' Fleisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, who along with Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes, has
pushed abortion to the front burner of the campaign, responded to
McCain's comments by saying he would have counselled his daughter
to have the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our family we are a loving family,'' Forbes said. ``We
would gather together and offer love and support and we would urge
her to bring it to term. And we would assure her that we would
support her in helping to raise that child in a loving family
atmosphere.''

MATTHEWS FINALLY MAKES SUPER BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There are a lot of unique things about Bruce Matthews,
foremost of which is his 6-foot-5, 305-pound anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are always coming up to me and saying, `Did you play
football?''' relates the Tennessee Titans guard who has played in
264 regular-season games, an NFL record for offensive linemen. ``I
say, `Yeah, did a little playing in high school.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But more than size sets Matthews apart from mere mortals.
</P>
<P>
   As far as he knows, he's the only player in the history of the
NFL who was a college teammate of his head coach, Jeff Fisher, and
a pro teammate with his line coach, Mike Munchak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get kidded about that all the time,'' says Matthews. ``Young
guys on the team come up to me and say, `You actually played with
coach at USC?' `Yeah,' I tell them. They just can't believe it.
What's the big deal? I was a freshman and he was a senior.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there's that other slight oddity about Bruce
Matthews that he just happens to be a 38-year-old man who's never
missed an NFL game because of an injury in a physically damaging
sport usually unwelcome to those who have cele brated so many
birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Warner might be the rags-to-riches story of Sunday's Super
Bowl between the St. Louis Rams and Titans. And the 40-year-old
punter, Mike Horan, might be the most unlikely participant because
as recently as early November he was nothing more than a loan
officer at a mortgage company in Colorado before being rescued from
such a plight by the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   But the one player who might be defying the lengthiest odds, if
not defying medical science, to be performing in Super Bowl XXXIV
is Bruce Matthews, the 1979 Arcadia High School graduate and former
Trojan All-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here, Bruce is like Father Time, but he's still a kid
at heart,'' says Titans star running back, Eddie George,
beneficiary of Matthews' stout blocking. ``He still has that
youthful spirit. Some guys are serious, and they have that love for
the game. Bruce can be serious or funny.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, Matthews has been mixing it up with some of the
strongest, toughest and meanest men in America NFL defensive
linemen and linebackers for 17 seasons without displaying even the
faintest hint of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bruce will walk away from the game when he wants to
walk away,'' says Jeff Fisher the Titans coach. ``As long as he's
healthy and able to play on the grass and able to win and enjoys
playing, he can play as long as he wants. I do know people ask me
if I think I'll see anyone like him again. The answer to that is
no.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Matthews is set to participate in still another Pro
Bowl his 12th straight after concluding business against the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``God just blessed me with a great body, as He did with Clay,''
said Matthews, referring to his older brother who was a linebacker
19 seasons with the Cleveland Browns and Atlanta Falcons. ``I've
just been very fortunate. I've tweaked the knee a few times, but
it's never kept me out of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Married with four sons and a daughter, Matthews still lives in
Texas where the Titans once performed as the Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The low point of my career came in 1995 about a week after I
had re-signed with the team in August,'' says Matthews. ``We went
to Knoxville to play an exhibition game against the Washington
Redskins, and our team announced that they were moving to
Tennessee. That was pretty hard to take. I loved Houston and didn't
want to leave. But I guess things have worked out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews has endured all the ups, downs and in between across
the years with the Titans franchise, but this season has been
special for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through so much as a team, and I can see God's work
with us this season,'' said Matthews, a deeply religious man. ``How
else can you explain what happened to us in the Buffalo game?''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills still can't figure out that Frank Wycheck-to-Kevin
Dyson lateral or forward pass? that resulted in a dramatic,
game-winning kickoff return by Dyson in the final seconds of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody up there was looking out for us,'' insists Matthews.
``I've seen a lot of things during my 17 years in this league, but
nothing like that. Nothing even close to it. That was a divine
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews doesn't understand the reason so many people make such
an issue about his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first 10 or 12 years I was in the league, no one said
a thing about how old I was,'' says Matthews. ``Then all of a
sudden guys started retiring, and people started coming up to me
and saying things like, `Wow, you've been in the league for 13
years now.' And I'd say, `Yeah, so what?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And suddenly now everyone who interviews me wants to talk
about my age. Honestly, I don't feel any different now than when I
came into the league. Oh, I don't recover as quickly from games as
I once did. My recuperative powers have definitely declined. But,
as far as my ability to do my job, I don't think I have declined at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Matthews' comes from a football lineage. His father, Clay
Matthews Sr., was a defensive linemen with the San Francisco 49ers
during the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always a very competitive atmosphere around our
household,'' Bruce Matthews says.
</P>
<P>
   He expects the Super Bowl to be competitive, and for the Titans
to emerge victorious at the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably play an ugly game, but we'll do whatever it
takes to win,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Matthews plans to return next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to play two, or three more seasons if I can,'' he
says. ``Why not? I'm having fun. I'm healthy. And I'm still doing
the job. Why quit something you're good at and that you enjoy
doing?''

SHARPTON TO FILE LIBEL SUIT AGAINST NEW YORK POST
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Al Sharpton said Wednesday that he would
file a $20 million libel lawsuit against The New York Post
Thursday, saying that a recent column and an editorial irreparably
damaged his reputation and ability to raise money for his civil
rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said in court papers to be filed in state Supreme Court
in Manhattan Thursday that he had warned the newspaper in writing
last August, after it had made similar statements, that if they
were repeated he would ``take legal action.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit states that a column on Jan. 18 by Andrea Peyser
called him ``a carpetbagger from New Jersey'' and that an editorial
on Jan. 19 suggested that Sharpton incited a fatal 1995 arson
attack on a Harlem clothing store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it is important that people that always try and
hold public figures accountable are also held accountable
themselves,'' Sharpton said. ``Even after a warning, they
deliberately printed misinformation as facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Rubenstein, a spokesman for The Post, said Wednesday that
it had not yet received a copy of the lawsuit and that he had no
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit focuses in particular on the editorial that accused
Sharpton of ``exhorting his followers to oust a `white interloper'
from Freddy's Fashion Mart in Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was taken at his word; there was an arson attack that left
seven people dead,'' it continued.
</P>
<P>
   In the December 1995 attack, a street vendor, Roland J. Smith
Jr., walked into Freddy's on 125th Street with a gun, a container
of flammable liquid and matches. ``It's on now,'' the police said
he shouted. ``All blacks out.'' He then poured the liquid on jeans
and shirts, unloaded his pistol and set the store on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Eight people, including the gunman, were killed, most of them
young women, most of them Hispanic and black. Four people were
wounded. Smith's anger, according to the police, stemmed from a
belief that the owner of an adjacent record store, who was black,
was being forced from it by the Jewish landlord who owned Freddy's.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the police said, attended at least one of a series of
protests held in front of Freddy's before the attack, in which
demonstrators passed out anti-Semitic leaflets and shouted racial
slurs. Sharpton attended the rallies but said Wednesday that he
never encouraged violence. He also noted that he was not indicted
by a Manhattan grand jury that investigated the attack.

TOWN HOPES HELP THAT FOOTBALL PLAYER GAVE ILL CHILD WILL RETURN TO
HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Mention the name Derrick Thomas and Kansas
Citians think of quarterback sacks, forced fumbles, dramatic
victories.
</P>
<P>
   But mention his name in Lone Wolf, Okla., and people recall how
much an NFL star meant to a dying boy, and how to them the name of
Derrick Thomas will always be linked to that of Philip Tepe
(pronounced Tee-Pee).
</P>
<P>
   And now as Thomas faces his biggest battle following Sunday's
traffic accident, the people of the small town hope the lessons
from Philip Tepe can mean as much to Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1992, Philip was 14 years old and a freshman on his
high school basketball team when he announced that he had AIDS. A
hemophiliac, he'd become HIV positive at age 4 because of a tainted
blood serum. Now in high school and ill, his only dreams in life
revolved around spending his few remaining years as a normal boy.
Basketball was a big part of that.
</P>
<P>
   But rumors of his illness forced his announcement a few games
into his first high school season, even though doctors had told him
that the disease would not be spread on the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks, players from opposing teams began refusing to
play against him. At a few games, the opposing teams and fans
turned their backs on the Lone Wolf team. Teams from throughout
southwest Oklahoma were forfeiting basketball games _ both boys and
girls games _ because of fear.
</P>
<P>
   That spring, Philip played baseball, but area schools even
canceled those games. Philip's classmates were ostracized, picked
on and occasionally spat upon when they visited nearby small towns.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas heard about Philip in the spring of 1993. Through Kansas
City lawyer and good friend Kevin Regan, Thomas contacted the
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derrick doesn't want to invade the family's privacy,'' Regan
assured Philip's mother, Dorecia Tepe, when he called on Thomas'
behalf. ``But he would like to do something for him. He'd like to
meet him.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Thomas flew down and introduced himself. Dorecia
Tepe said her son was thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you really need it, God sends special people into your
life,'' she said this week, reflecting on the relationship.
``Derrick Thomas was that special person for Philip.''
</P>
<P>
   And the feeling was mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derrick came to love, admire, respect Philip,'' Regan said.
</P>
<P>
   During that first meeting and during the half-dozen or so times
they got together in the next year, Thomas and Philip spent hours
talking, Dorecia Tepe said. On one visit, the two went golfing and
disappeared for an entire afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philip would come back from spending time with Derrick, and
I'd ask what they did and he'd say, `Just talked,' '' she said.
``They'd go on for hours, laughing, serious. It was wonderful. I
never asked what they talked about. I figured that was private,
just between them.''
</P>
<P>
   That June, Thomas and Regan arranged for the Lone Wolf
basketball team to come to Kansas City. Thomas took the boys to a
celebrity golf tournament, a private performance by Hank Williams
Jr. and arranged a game for them against a team of local
professional athletes and celebrities. Before the game, the team
members discovered that Thomas had arranged for the boys to get new
uniforms, bags and shoes. The game ended as former Chiefs great
Bobby Bell hoisted the 5-foot, 79-pound Philip to the rim to score
the winning basket.
</P>
<P>
   It was an act that changed Philip's entire small town and turned
everyone there into Thomas fans.
</P>
<P>
   During the coming months, Philip and his family came to Kansas
City a couple of more times to see Thomas and watch the Chiefs
play. Once, at Thomas' invitation, they followed the team to
Houston for a playoff game, where before the game they laughed
together over breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so obvious that Derrick cared,'' Dorecia Tepe said.
``It wasn't a show. He didn't have to do it, but he did. He cared
about Philip.''
</P>
<P>
   In spring 1994, after doctors told Philip that he was in the
final stages and that there was nothing left to be done for him,
the 15-year-old set out to comfort his loved ones. He went into the
hills for an afternoon with his father and spent a day reassuring
his older brother. He hugged his mother and told her he loved her.
Then he made a last request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could I see Derrick once more?''
</P>
<P>
   Dorecia Tepe said she called, explained that death was near. She
remembers, however, that she didn't get too far into her
explanation before Thomas was making arrangements to get to Lone
Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put everything on hold and came right down,'' she said.
``They spent the afternoon together, visiting, gabbing. It meant so
much to Philip.''
</P>
<P>
   As they talked, the linebacker and the dying boy spent their day
in Philip's room, sitting on the bed and playing computer games.
</P>
<P>
   She paused to cry, apologizing for her tears, but unable to stop
them. She said that since hearing about Thomas' troubles on the
news Sunday, she hasn't been able to stop thinking about him,
praying for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derrick gave so much to Philip,'' she said. ``All night I've
been praying that maybe Philip taught Derrick something that will
help him come through this, something about living with tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Derrick will come through this,'' she added. ``I know
he won't be alone. His family is so strong. He's got such good
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I know that Philip will be with him, encouraging him and
holding Derrick up when he starts taking those first steps.''

EXCERPTS FROM FIVE REPUBLICANS' DEBATE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a forum involving Gary L. Bauer,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes and Sen.
John McCain of Arizona, candidates for the Republican presidential
nomination, Wednesday night at the WMUR television studio in
Manchester, N.H., as recorded by The New York Times. The candidates
answered questions from Bernard Shaw of CNN, Karen Brown of WMUR
and one another.
</P>
<P>
   SHAW: Governor Bush, if you could write a two-sentence amendment
to the United States Constitution on abortion, what would it be.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: It would be that every child born and unborn should be
protected in law and every child should be welcomed in life. I
believe it's important for our party to maintain our pro-life
position. I believe it's important for the next president to
recognize good people can disagree on this issue and so the next
president must elevate the issue of life to convince people of the
preciousness of life, not only for the young, but for the elderly
as well. The next president must lead our country toward policies
that will reduce abortions. I will sign a partial-birth abortion
ban. I will promote adoption. I will promote abstinence programs in
our school systems. The life issue is a important issue for our
party, and our party must not abandon our pro-life position, but we
must welcome people from different persuasions into our party, or
different points of view into our party.
</P>
<P>
   FORBES: When you ran for governor in 1994, you criticized Ann
Richards for the fact that Texas had 13,000 more state employees
than did New York state. Since then the gap is now 36,000. Texas
has 36,000 more employees than the state of New York does, state
level. Under your leadership spending has gone up 36 percent,
almost twice the rate of the Clinton-Gore administration. On your
so-called tax cut your own budget director said that six out of 10
Texans did not get a tax cut in this last round. ... What can you
tell the people of New Hampshire and of America that you won't do
in Washington what you've done in Texas?
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: So many half stories, so little time. Let's start with
education. People who've looked at the state of Texas have
consistently said that because we have set high standards,
abolished social promotion, got a vibrant charter school movement,
have got a public school choice movement, that we're making the
best progress in the nation for improvement amongst minority
students. That our minority students, because of our strong
accountability system, are making tremendous improvement. That our
schools are, some ranked as some of the best in the country, Steve.
Our public school system is meeting the challenge. In terms of the
budget, I've slowed the rate of growth down. And when you take out
population growth and inflation, it's by far the slowest rate of
growth ever in my state's history. In terms of tax cuts, I not only
led our state to a billion-dollar tax cut in '97, I led our state
to a $2 billion tax cut in 1999, real meaningful tax cuts. But I
guess the way to answer your question is, you know the people of
Texas took a look at my record. The second biggest state in the
union, a mighty important electoral state for any Republican
running for president and they said Mr. Governor, we accept your
record and they overwhelmingly voted me back into office. I nearly
got 70 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   BAUER: Steve ... Will you repeal Most Favored Nation status for
China? I will in my first week in office.
</P>
<P>
   FORBES: I believe that we must let the Chinese know what the
rules of engagement are. If they want a prosperous relationship,
they can have it. But you have to lay down the rules because then,
if they break those rules, then you can take a course of action and
unite this country and unite our allies. The rules of engagement
would include the understanding: We'd make it clear that they
cannot run us out of Asia as they're trying to do now. And they
cannot use force against Taiwan. Where they've made an agreement
not to use force against Taiwan, we're going to hold them to it.
And that means we must rebuild our military instead of run it down
and we must move ahead with the missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   On human rights abuses: We will criticize them in every
international forum possible. Dissidents in China have told me and
others how important that is to put the spotlight on.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of trade, of course we want trade with China but it has
to be two-way. They have to genuinely reduce barriers, not the fake
promises they've made to the gullible Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   And if China wishes to pass technology on to rogue states like
North Korea or to Pakistan, we should put sanctions on specific
Chinese companies, particularly those controlled by the People's
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   So you let them know what the rules are. If they don't adhere to
those rules, then you take the appropriate steps including taking
trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   BAUER: Steve, you know, you _ you've done it again. You've had
over a minute and 15 seconds and you can't answer a simple
question. ... All of the things that you just said hypothetically
has already been done by China. You refuse to answer a simple
question. Will you repeal most favored nation status for China or
not?
</P>
<P>
   FORBES: I'm trying to make it clear, Gary, in very simple terms.
If China violates those rules of engagement, when they _ now _ now
that they know what they are, then trade is going to be on the
table including most favored nation. And most favored nation will
be withdrawn if they want that confrontation.

MAN ACCUSED OF MURDER SEEKS TO SUPPRESS STATEMENTS HE ALLEGEDLY
MADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ As Keith Nelson lay handcuffed on the banks
of the Kansas River, he purportedly made a chilling statement to
the police officer who had arrested him in the abduction of
10-year-old Pamela Butler, new court records state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know where she is, but I'm not saying right now,'' Nelson
told the officer on Oct. 14, the records say.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson did not elaborate, however. Searchers did not find
Pamela's body in Grain Valley, Mo., until the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's statement on the riverbank and others attributed to him
in the next several hours are reported in court papers made
available Wednesday. A defense motion asks a federal judge to
suppress the statements.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest, Nelson was taken to a hospital for treatment
of a broken leg. The 25-year-old Kansas City, Kan., man has been
charged in U.S. District Court with kidnapping and sexual abuse
that resulted in her death.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 12, Pamela disappeared from the street in front of her
Kansas City, Kan., house, touching off a search by more than 100
local and federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The defense request to suppress evidence is the latest legal
twist in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's lawyers contend that he had not been properly read his
Miranda rights at the time of his arrest on the riverbank. He also
was in such pain from a broken leg that any such statements he made
to police should be ruled involuntary, lawyer Susan Hunt argued in
her motion.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Whitley, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office, said
prosecutors would evaluate the motion and respond in court.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt also has asked a federal judge to suppress three statements
that authorities say Nelson made while he was treated at the
University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan. All the
purported statements deal with Nelson's movements while officers
were searching for him.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI report cited in the defense motion contends that Nelson
knew investigators had staked out his boss's home in Independence,
Mo., on the evening of the kidnapping because Nelson ``allegedly
stated...he climbed the tree behind his boss' property and observed
the activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson stated that he narrowly avoided arrest on Oct. 13 when
investigators searched for him at his girlfriend's house, according
to the FBI records quoted in the defense motion.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson ``was at his girlfriend's house when the task force came
looking for him on Oct. 13, 1999,'' court records state. ``He then
ran on foot to the 18th Street Expressway Bridge and was attempting
to cross the bridge on the underneath structure when he fell and
was unable to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   A Kansas City, Kan., police employee saw Nelson lying near the
bridge about 1:30 p.m. the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI reports cited in the defense motion also allege that
Nelson said he had overheard two persons discussing Pamela's
abduction while on a bus from Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt argued that all statements made by Nelson at the medical
center should be thrown out because he was under morphine sedation
and already had told investigators he did not want to speak without
an attorney present.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hunt contends, agents who were guarding him ``continually
asked him where the girl was and continually asked him `to do the
right thing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson ``asserts these statements were not voluntary and were
the result of continual questioning by law enforcement and the
product of a drug-induced stupor,'' Hunt wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is scheduled for trial Oct. 23. Last week his lawyers
asked for the trial to be moved out of Missouri or Kansas because
of pretrial publicity. Federal prosecutors have asked Attorney
General Janet Reno for permission to seek a death sentence against
Nelson.

EXCERPTS FROM GORE-BRADLEY DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a candidates' forum involving Vice
President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, candidates for the
Democratic presidential nomination, Wednesday night at the WMUR
television studio in Manchester, N.H., as recorded by The New York
Times. The candidates answered questions Judy Woodruff of CNN, Tom
Griffith of WMUR and each other.
</P>
<P>
   MS. WOODRUFF: You have surrogates in this campaign who are being
very tough on Mr. Gore. Sen. Bob Kerry of Nebraska, the widow of
the late Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas, both of them on the air
now attacking Mr. Gore for suggesting that he's distorted your
record. Are you hiding behind them and letting them do your dirty
work?
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: No, I'm not, Judy. I just think politics should be
belief and not tactics. That it should be a case of saying what
you're for, not what you're against. It should be a matter of
bringing issues to the fore, not demeaning your opponent. And,
unfortunately, that has not been reciprocated on the other side in
this campaign. . . .
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: Al, Hillary Clinton said the other day that consistency
on fundamental issues of principle is important. She went on to
express how she and Rudy Giuliani have the same position on choice
now but that he had changed his position to arrive there and she
had always been there. My question to you is: Do you think she's
wrong?
</P>
<P>
   GORE: I've always supported Roe vs. Wade. I have always
supported a woman's right to choose. And let me say that if you
entrust me with the presidency, I will guarantee that a woman's
right to choose is protected.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's true that early in my career I wrestled with the
question of what kinds of exceptions should be allowed to the
general rule that Medicaid should also pay for this procedure. I
have come to the strong view that all women regardless of their
income must have the right to choose and that's my position. Now
the next president is likely to appoint as many as three maybe four
justices of the Supreme Court. All of the Republican candidates who
are in this studio have taken a pledge to overturn Roe vs. Wade and
support a constitutional amendment to take away the right to
choose.
</P>
<P>
   We basically agree, we have exactly the same position. So if you
want to manufacture a distinction, OK. But if you want to know my
position, I favor a woman's right to choose regardless of the
woman's income.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: Well, you still didn't answer the question whether
consistency on fundamental issues of principle is relevant. I think
they are. And I can understand why you wouldn't answer the
question. Because when you were in the Congress you had an 84
percent right-to-life voting record. And it seems to me that this
is an issue that requires somebody to know where they stand and to
know why they stand where they stand. . . .
</P>
<P>
   GRIFFITH: Can you talk to us a little bit right now about what
you _ type of people you hope to surround yourself with in your
administration? And would Clinton holdovers assume that they had a
job?
</P>
<P>
   GORE: Well, this'll be a fresh new administration. But I think
what you're picking up out there, Tom, is what I'm picking up. That
people are tired of the whole discussion about the president's
personal mistake. They think that by and large he has been a great
president in turning this economy around. You know, the
Clinton-Gore administration has ended the deepest recession since
the 1930's when New Hampshire was losing 10,000 jobs a year and
brought on the strongest economy in the history of the United
States, one in which New Hampshire is gaining 16,000 jobs a year. I
want to continue that prosperity . . .
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: Al, you've made a proposal that we take 30-second ads
off the air and you know that translation is you're well known, I'm
not. We take them off, you win.
</P>
<P>
   And I look at that and I say I understand why you did it. But
the real problem is negative ads, not 30-second ads. And the AP ad
watch called one of your ads unfair and misleading. And my question
to you is why should we believe you that you will tell the truth as
president if you don't tell the truth as a candidate?
</P>
<P>
   GORE: That's not a negative attack? Let me say in response,
Bill, first of all I have proposed that we debate twice a week and
take all of the 30-second, 60-second TV and radio ads off the air.
And I've said I'll do that if you pick any state where you will be
willing to do that. Now, as for criticism of negative campaigning,
one newspaper recently called your attacks muddying your image. You
were forced to apologize for a negative personal attack. You
introduced Willy Horton into this campaign. So let's be serious
about this. I've never mentioned your name in an ad. I have never
used your picture in an ad. . . .
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: Al, if you talk about a flyer that was immediately
repudiated that went to a couple of hundred people versus an
advertisement on television that's like comparing a gnat to an
elephant. You're the elephant of negative advertising here. And the
fact of the matter is, don't take my word, take the Lawrence Eagle
Tribune, which said that he was the master of spin and smear. .
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   . .
</P>
<P>
   GORE: You know there are plenty of reviews of the campaigning
that goes on but the truth is look, the people of New Hampshire
know a negative ad when they see one ask them if they've seen a
negative ad that my campaign has run. They did see that flyer that
you apologized for and I accepted your apology but it's not the
only example. The Boston Herald called your attacks a low blow and
one of the network anchors on the Sunday Morning Show said that
you'd made an unfortunate decision to kind of get a little nasty in
the campaign. I have not complained and I will not complain but if
you make those kind of accusations and attacks against me and hold
a standard up that you yourself are not complying with, I mean
that's just, that's not the way to go about it. Let's talk about
the issues. Let's have debates twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: Look, in politics sometimes people make misleading
statements because they don't know any better. You know better. You
know better. . . .
</P>
<P>
   GORE: There has never been a time in this campaign when I have
said something that I know to be untrue. There's never been a time
when I've said something untrue. Now, let's be honest here, Bill.
What you're uncomfortable about is that when you put out your
health care plan and you realize that nobody in New Hampshire or
Iowa can take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: That's not correct.
</P>
<P>
   GORE: And when you realize that more than half of all the
seniors get not a penny from your prescription drug benefit. You
realized you made a mistake. But instead of correcting the plan,
you decided to shoot at the messenger that pointed out what's wrong
with the plan.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: Both of those things are incorrect. That is not
correct. The fact of the matter is, as I said earlier, if you had
$10,000 in pharmaceutical costs, for prescription drugs, your plan
would cap that at $1,000 _
</P>
<P>
   GORE: How much money _ wait _ how many expenses do you have to
have before you get any money under your plan?
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: Wait, wait. Your plan would stop at $1,000. Sorry, this
is a tactic _ see, this is a tactic. Your plan would cap it at
$1,000. And mine would pay $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   GORE: That's not right, either.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: This is the difference between going for big ideas and
nibbling around the edges.

<P>
   When you talk to venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, there is
one issue where there is no agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any market, entrepreneurs would love to see more venture
capital, and venture capitalists would love to see more
high-quality businesses to invest in,'' said Reisler, at Kansas
City Equity Partners.
</P>

   Reisler thinks the number of successful entrepreneurial startups
in this area _ at least per capita _ is way above the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than those top three or four areas (where there is an
extraordinary amount of start-up capital available), ours is
growing faster than any community you could name,'' Reisler said.
``I don't think we're too conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessinger said financing was becoming more readily available,
and the Bi-State group should trigger even more business
development. Still, he said, financing dollars are still coming too
slow: ``You're trying to turn a freighter, so it doesn't happen
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessinger thinks the lack of investment money has hurt the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been losing companies in this community because they
couldn't get financed,'' Kessinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fraser, CEO of NetSales, an Overland Park, Kan.,
e-commerce company that has more than 150 employees, said his
company almost went down that road.
</P>
<P>
   ``As viable as my business is today, there were half a dozen
times when I was almost out of business because I couldn't find the
money,'' Fraser said.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser said there's a ``ton of need'' for financing for tech
firms, and that need will only grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Hoechst Marion Roussel's headquarters leaving (Kansas
City), and Sprint in question, you're going to see a lot of
business plans coming out of those companies,'' Fraser said.
``These are going to be sharp businesspeople needing some
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the merger also may lead to even more investment
capital available locally. Some business executives equate the
affect of the pending Sprint-MCI WorldCom merger to the West
Coast's ``Microsoft millionaires'' who have been responsible for
much of the Silicon Valley's growth.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg A. Herman, an associate at venture capital firm C3
Holdings in Kansas City, said the announcement by OctoberCapital
might be only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three or four individuals or groups (including
Bi-State Investment) trying to raise significant capital,
significant with a capital S, for technology opportunities,''
Herman said.

EDUCATION CHIEF REJECTS SUBSTITUTES TO STATE EXAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dismissing a high-profile campaign by 40 alternative high
schools and the former New York City schools chancellor, State
Education Commissioner Richard P. Mills on Wednesday rejected
end-of-year projects as substitutes for the new English Regents
exam required for graduation.
</P>
<P>
   The decision dealt a significant blow both to the alternative
schools movement and to an effort led by former Chancellor Rudy
Crew and Judith Rizzo, the current deputy chancellor, who contended
that elaborate portfolios including things like reports on
literature, journals and internships were more rigorous and
creative than high-stakes tests.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is likely to force the alternative schools _ most of
which are in New York City _ to revamp their unconventional
curriculums so that their students can pass the challenging
statewide exam starting next year. Their curriculum is the heart of
what makes them alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers will have to teach to the test,'' said Jane R.
Hirschmann, chairwoman of a consortium of parents with students at
the alternative schools. ``It does not really evaluate literacy.
It's very formulaic. It's a test that all children will have to get
prepared for.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills' ruling took another step in the direction of a single
standard for public high school graduation in New York State, a
trend that is reflected nationally but is also causing political
concern because of the likelihood of large numbers of failures. The
uniform standard means that a high school diploma will become
significantly harder to acquire in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   In a six-page decision rejecting a request from alternative
schools for exemption from the Regents exams, Mills said that the
schools could not be excused because advocates had failed to
present evidence that portfolios were a valid substitute for the
test.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, about 15,000 of the city's estimated 300,000
high school students attend some 30 alternative schools. Ten others
exist around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Many compare themselves to private schools, which for years have
turned out top students who do not take the Regents exams. A few of
the schools regularly send students to four-year colleges like
Bard, Vassar and Boston College.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Methods of assessing student achievement at the alternative
schools range from straightforward oral examinations to the
creation of elaborate ``portfolios'' made up of a variety of
student projects. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The one consolation for the schools was that Mills left open the
fate of their methods of assessments for other subjects. He said he
would conduct his own yearlong evaluation of the system to
determine which schools should be exempt from Regents exams in
social studies, science and college-level mathematics, which are to
be introduced in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, advocates for alternative schools were seeking to
extend a five-year waiver they had received in 1995 that exempted
them from taking the Regents. Mills rejected that request on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Regents began giving new English tests, putting
into effect new statewide standards requiring tests in several
subjects for graduation. The standards are to be fully phased in by
2003. All high school students who entered the ninth grade in the
fall of 1996 are required to pass the English Regents exam _ not
just a competency exam in that subject _ before they can graduate.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Mills was honoring the waiver, exempting this
year's seniors from the English Regents exam. But they will have to
take and pass the competency test in reading and writing, which is
simpler than the Regents.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 40 alternative schools, Mills said 22 were not properly
covered by the waiver although they had claimed to be. Those 22
will be required to take the Regents exam this year unless they
provide him with evidence that they meet the same standards as the
exempted 18. In addition, two of those 18 have become charter
schools and are now required to take the Regents exam.
</P>
<P>
   The Regents standards were challenged not just by the
alternative schools, but by some suburban schools and by many of
the state's private schools, whose curriculums are not overseen by
the Board of Regents. Mills only addressed the 40 alternative
schools in Wednesday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Cook, co-director of Urban Academy and a leader of the
coalition challenging the Regents exams, said that she was pleased
Mills would spend the next year evaluating schools to determine
which would be exempt from future Regents exams and that she
believed the schools would persuade him to exempt them.

WEALTH OF `ANGELS' PREPARE TO INVEST IN BUDDING HIGH-TECH
COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sprint Corp. President Ronald T. LeMay is
bankrolling a venture capital fund that will provide financing for
Internet and technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate venture, a group of local businesspeople are
forming an ``angel network'' to provide start-up financing for
high-growth companies.
</P>
<P>
   And out-of-town investment companies such as Citigroup, Chase
and takeover specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. are investing
heavily in Kansas City area technology firms.
</P>
<P>
   For Kansas City area entrepreneurs, things are looking up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good signal to the community and the country that
we're serious about our positioning as the Silicon Prairie,'' said
Becky Blades, chairwoman of the Greater Kansas City Chamber of
Commerce's Metropolitan Entrepreneurs Council.
</P>
<P>
   The latest announcement was expected today by a private
partnership of LeMay, and his son, Lance LeMay, 26. The son, a
Kansas City entrepreneur, is president of the fund. The father is a
partner but will continue as Sprint's president and chief operating
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, named OctoberCapital, is private, and the LeMay family
isn't providing any details about its size.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lance LeMay said the fund would make a series of
investments of $1 million or more in technology and Internet
companies, with a focus on companies that provide
business-to-business services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is the first venture capital fund in Kansas
City solely devoted to funding Internet and technology companies,''
LeMay said.
</P>
<P>
   LeMay said he and his father decided to begin the fund now
because the Internet had matured to the point where a second
generation of businesses, in the center of the country, were
starting to develop new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to attract the most professional, talented
entrepreneurs leading business-to-business Internet and technology
companies,'' LeMay said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial experts said OctoberCapital could become an important
source of financing for local technology companies. With the
acquisition of Sprint by MCI WorldCom on the horizon, stock options
granted to Ronald T. LeMay in Sprint Corp. in the last two years
alone are worth more than $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   OctoberCapital received a strong endorsement from area business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything we can do to bring more capital into this market to
support the entrepreneurial community will be a plus,'' said Susan
Catts, president of the Silicon Prairie Technology Association.
``If there's a fund that will have a willingness to gamble more
than some have in the past, that would be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Catts, like some on the entrepreneurial side, contends there
hasn't been enough investment money available for the area's
budding technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough in this town for a lot of these guys to get
going,'' Catts said. ``There is not really enough money in this
town. That good Midwestern conservatism guides the money
practitioners here.''
</P>
<P>
   William Reisler, a managing director in Kansas City Equity
Partners, said investment patterns were changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People invest from all over the country here, and that's a
good thing,'' Reisler said. ``As a city, we're attracting more
venture capital dollars this year than any other year.''
</P>
<P>
   Reisler points to a series of recent deals involving Kansas City
Equity Partners and venture capital firms from other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for instance, Digital Archaeology Corp. in Lenexa
received $13.2 million from Citigroup; Davis, Tuttle Venture
Partners, based in Texas and Oklahoma; and Kansas City Equity
Partners.
</P>
<P>
   A seat at this table will cost you $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few months, Joseph Kessinger of the Enterprise
Center of Johnson County, Kan., has been quietly meeting with local
business people. He's been promoting an organization not unlike
those often credited for the success of the Research Triangle area
of North Carolina and the Silicon Valley in northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Kessinger plans to formally unveil the group next month _ 40
businesspeople, maybe more, who each have put up $50,000 to help
new technology or Internet companies get started in the Kansas City
area.
</P>
<P>
   In an entrepreneur's world, they're known as ``angels'' _
investors, often established businesspeople, willing to invest
their own money to get a new company off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Bi-State Investment Group will jointly review some financing
proposals in March and could make its first investments as early as
April, Kessinger said. The group will invest between $250,000 to $1
million in start-up companies with potential to grow fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, venture capitalists were investing half a
million, or $2 million at the most,'' Kessinger said. ``Now we're
hearing about $20 million first-round financing deals. Everyone's
moved up the food chain, and it has left a big hole for anyone
trying to raise $250,000 to $1 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bi-State Investment Group, nicknamed BIG, came out of
research conducted by the Kauffman Center for Entrepreneurial
Leadership and the Enterprise Center. It was modeled after a
similar organization in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they started this initiative eight years ago, there were
two venture capital firms in the Research Triangle area,''
Kessinger said. ``Now there are more than 20. You can't say the
group was solely responsible. But it creates an efficient system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurs can be matched with angels, and venture
capitalists look at the group as a feeder for them.'' MORE

CHINA LISTS CONTROLS TO RESTRICT THE USE OF E-MAIL AND WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  (ADDS little known about State Secrecy Bureau in 16th graf; ADDS 2
grafs at end with practical effects of monitoring) 
 (rk) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The Chinese government issued stern new regulations
Wednesday intended to control the release of information on the
Internet, underscoring the government's love-hate relationship with
cyberspace in a country where the number of Internet users is
growing dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations, which were published in Wednesday's edition
of the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily, specifically
govern the posting and dissemination on the Internet of ``state
secrets'' _ a vaguely defined term that has been applied by the
Chinese government to cover any information whose release it has
not sanctioned.
</P>
<P>
   The new pronouncement may have little practical impact, because
much of what is formally forbidden under the new rules was already
illegal. Enforcement will be difficult in a country now brimming
with Internet cafes and free e-mail services. And government
officials will be cautious about dampening an industry whose
exuberant growth has been a magnet for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, people here say the regulations serve mostly as
a very loud warning that could have some inhibiting effect on the
lively discussions that now criss-cross China via e-mail and
through postings in chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the regulations illustrate the Chinese government's
resolve to tame if not totally control the unwieldy beast that is
the Internet, which has rapidly become a means for Chinese to
bypass the state-controlled media to obtain and transmit
information.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations directly apply for the first time China's
state secrets law to the web, including chat rooms and personal
e-mails. For example, the use of e-mail to transmit what might be
regarded as secret information is expressly forbidden. Chat rooms
must screen their content. And Internet sites are required to
submit to ``examination and approval by the appropriate secrecy
work offices,'' although the rules do not specify what that
procedure involves.
</P>
<P>
   A basic principal of the new ``Computer Information Systems
Internet Secrecy Administrative Regulations'' is that ``Whoever
puts it on the Internet assumes responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any information provided to or issued on Internet web sites
must obtain the inspection and approval of secrecy censorship,''
the regulations state.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the Internet has emerged as an effective
propaganda tool of the Chinese government, but also as a potent
method for organizing and publicizing popular discontent.
</P>
<P>
   It has been used by overseas dissidents to communicate with
kindred spirits in China and by the banned Falun Gong spiritual
movement to organize protests. Last week, a group of disgruntled
farmers in a small village in Anhui province in central China even
turned to the Internet and e-mail to successfully expose a corrupt
local Communist Party chief.
</P>
<P>
   Computer technician Lin Hai, 30, was sentenced to two years
imprisonment in January last year for providing 30,000 Chinese
e-mail addresses to Chinese dissidents abroad.
</P>
<P>
   There are now nearly 9 million Internet users in China, up from
just 2 million a year ago, according to a survey by the
government's China Internet Information Center. But some feel the 9
million figure is too low; the same center also found that there
are 35.6 million e-mail accounts in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, government officials had repeatedly said that
they planned to issue new regulations to further control both the
content of and the financial arrangements behind the Chinese
Internet. Wednesday's regulations are the first, but probably not
the last, effort to spell out what that control might entail.
</P>
<P>
   Another law, adopted quietly last fall, requires all those who
use encryption software to register with the government by next
Monday. The software encodes e-mail messages so that they can not
be read by anyone but the intended recipient.
</P>
<P>
   Financial regulations will follow soon, officials say, which are
expected to restrict in some way foreign investment in the Chinese
Internet. The government plans to require all Internet companies
based in China to obtain government approval before going public in
foreign markets, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations were issued by the State Secrecy Bureau, a
little-known agency whose exact function the main government news
office was unable to describe, despite repeated requests.
</P>
<P>
   Internet users and Internet companies alike have been aware all
along that they risked arrest if they used to Internet to spread
sensitive information. Still, some have taken advantage of the
relative anonymity of the Internet to speak out against government
policy.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the government has occasionally arrested
people for posting illegal information on the web. This has
included members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement who
posted pictures of Falun Gong followers who had purportedly been
tortured by the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think it will have a big effect,'' said Guo Liang,
who studies the Internet at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
``People already know that you couldn't use the Internet to reveal
state secrets or do things that are illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, provisional regulations have been circulating since early
1998, according to the web site of the local Secrecy Bureau in
Lianyungang, a small city in coastal Jiangsu province.
</P>
<P>
   Although two years ago some Chinese web sites carried news items
culled from foreign news wire services, today Chinese commercial
web sites use only items from the official state media or avoid
political news altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``These regulations will not have much of an effect on us now
since we already conform to these kind of requirements,'' said Paul
Jin, deputy executive general manager at Sina.com, one of China's
most popular web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Sina.com, like most Chinese web sites, screens entries into its
chat rooms to make sure they are appropriate and not ``offensive to
the government.''
</P>
<P>
   But Web experts said enforcement was probably impractical in a
country where the volume of Internet communications has exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Although the authorities certainly have the technical ability to
read e-mail, and do monitor the mail of known dissidents, they
cannot  &QC; keep up with all messages or necessarily trace them from
particular individuals.

 BUSH, McCAIN TRADE BARBS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ In the final debate before next Tuesday's
primary, George W. Bush and Senator John McCain Wednesday night
tried to break their deadlock at the top of the New Hampshire polls
with a series of sharp and sometimes angry exchanges over taxes,
education, and corporate loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who for weeks has seen his tax cut plan attacked by
Bush, tried to turn the tables on the Texas governor, challenging
him to name a single corporate loophole that he would close as
president. But Bush's wouldn't bite, saying instead that as
president he would invite McCain to the White House to ``outline
all corporate loopholes and we'll pick and choose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You seem to depict the role of president as some kind of
hapless bystander,'' retorted McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-McCain broadsides so dominated the evening that Steve
Forbes complained the format of the 90-minute debate, sponsored by
WMUR-TV and CNN, was unfair. But Forbes, along with Gary Bauer and
Alan Keyes, also took to the offensive in their remarks, each
hoping for a strong enough showing to survive beyond the
first-in-the-nation primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who in earlier debates tended to use humor to make his
mark, Wednesday night frequently felt the heat of being one of the
front-runners. At one point, apparently trying to recover from an
earlier, stilted response about his views against abortion, he
rebuked Keyes for questioning his commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to his Vietnam service, McCain said, ``I've seen enough
killing in my life. . .I don't need a lecture from you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't lecture you,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time, use decaf,'' McCain responded testily.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was also asked to address an abortion question. If he could
write a two-sentence amendment to the constitution to cover the
abortion issue, what would it say?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be that every child, born and unborn, should be
protected in law. And every child should be welcomed in life,''
Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Bush and McCain point-counterpoint that seemed
most telling.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on couple of occasions, sought to link McCain to Clinton
administration positions. Referring to McCain's plan to cut taxes,
he said, ``Al Gore would have written your plan, Mr. Senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Bush again, in passing, compared a McCain position on
education to the Clinton administration's, McCain shot back,
``George, if you're saying that I'm like Al Gore, then you're
spinning like Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Bush's plan would give control over certain local
education spending to ``some nameless, faceless bureaucrat in
Washington, D.C. They're the ones that tell the states they're not
meeting the standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the folks in my state to set the standards and tell
them when they're meeting the standards. That's the critical
part,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's what my plan does, John,'' Bush responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you have the federal bureaucracy make it,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I beg your pardon, I wrote the plan,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, trying to overcome his image as a rather stilted,
scripted figure, did something he doesn't usually do: he talked
about himself and his broad political vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather was a penniless immigrant, as tens of millions
of other Americans were,'' said Forbes, not mentioning that his
grandfather and father built a publishing empire which left him a
multi-millionaire. ``What brings us together is not a single
ancestry or religion or a common race. What unites us is a shared
set of ideas and ideals: the belief in freedom and liberty,
democracy, individual equality before the law, opportunity. That's
what makes us unique, and that's what we need to get back to.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes also pointedly renewed his critique of Bush's record as
Texas Governor, saying he had exaggerated his claim to have cut
taxes, improved public education and streamlined government in his
home-state.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many half-stories, so little time,'' Bush snapped, then
offered a detailed self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   The debate also had its share of odd moments.
</P>
<P>
   In the most unlikely exchange of the evening, Bauer suggested
that Keyes had demeaned the dignity of presidential candidates by
being bounced by supporters in an impromptu ``mosh pit'' following
an appearance in Des Moines last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer also objected to what he considered Keyes's tolerance of
the music of an alternative rock group, which he identified as
``The Machine Rages On,'' whose recording was played during the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rage Against the Machine'' is the name of the group, and Keyes
said he knew nothing about the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accusing me of having complicity in the music is like asking
me to apologize for the color of my skin,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking part in the mosh pit routine, a standard at rock concerts
where people are pitched into the air by a human trampoline, was a
metaphor for his trust in humanity, Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will in fact hold you up,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also spent some time sparring over a pressing
regional issue, how to stem the rise of heating oil prices. Bush, a
former oilman, was asked whether he would be willing to draw upon
the nation's strategic oil reserves to increase the supply. Bush
said he would not do so. He said the president should ``jawbone''
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel to drive
down prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important not only to explain what high energy prices do
to our economy, but to the world economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All five candidates agreed that President Clinton committed a
felony in the Monica Lewinsky case and should have been removed
from office. Bauer faulted Clinton for discussing the crisis in
Bosnia on the telephone with a member of Congress ``while in the
middle of a disgusting act.'' Keyes complained that Congress
``lacked the guts'' to impeach the president. Both Keyes and Bauer
accused Forbes of avoiding their questions on the World Trade
Organization and China's most-favored nation trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who support is mired in the low single digits in recent
New Hampshire polls and who finished a disappointing fourth place
in Iowa, responded indignantly when asked by Shaw when and whether
he would drop out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think that a worker here in New Hampshire that's not
making enough money to get health insurance, or a mother here who
sends her child off to school worried about whether there's going
to be a school shooting, or a law-abiding citizen of this state
that sees these liberal judges trying to change the law so that men
can marry men and women can marry women, do you think they're
worried about whether Gary Bauer is going to drop out, stay in or
whatever?'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer also went on the attack against Forbes, saying the
millionaire publisher has taken a strong stand on revoking the
trade status for China, which Bauer said he would rescind
immediately upon becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we must let the Chinese know what the rules of
engagement are,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want a prosperous relationship, they can have it. But
you have to lay down the rules, because then if they break those
rules, then you can take a course of action and unite this country
and unite our allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, who in Iowa dwelled on his anti-abortion stand, Wednesday
night was asked about his little-publicized proposal to replace the
current tax code with a 23 percent sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   He said his plan would enable those ``who feel that they cannot
bear the burden of the income tax, would be able by following that
frugality track'' to avoid paying the sales tax.

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ Little Hawk went to his first Super Bowl when he was 5.
Daddy was a Dallas Cowboys rookie, and it was, best he can
remember, a pretty cool experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Anthony Dorsett admits, ``I really didn't understand
what it was all about, of course. And I had no idea how special it
was what my father was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   He does now.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett the elder, who answered to Tony _ and, yes, Hawk _ was
the Cowboys' rookie phenom running back in Super Bowl XII. Dorsett
the younger will be at free safety for the Titans on Sunday in
Super Bowl XXXIV because Marcus Robertson broke his ankle against
Jacksonville last weekend. The injury thus permits the Dorsetts to
make history. No father-son pair has previously started in the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The son was born the day the father, a college freshman, was off
helping Pitt beat Georgia in Athens, just down the road from
Atlanta. The son, however, was not preordained to greatness like
the father, an undersized, overblessed high school All-American who
won the Heisman Trophy and became a Pro Football Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   The son would carry the weight of the father's name uneasily for
many years, in fact, although he now concedes it was the spur that
drove him, against long odds, to become what he is today,
inarguably a pivotal figure in the season's biggest game.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think the Rams, with their prodigious passing attack,
won't be poking and prodding Anthony at every turn, checking for
signs of vulnerability in the erstwhile nickel back. But he has
been poked and prodded before. He's used to life under the
microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your name is Anthony Dorsett and you wear No. 33,'' he
said, ``people are always looking at you. That's a lot to live up
to. You have to do a lot to measure up.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, he couldn't. At Richland High School in Dallas, he
mostly rode the bench before transferring to J.J. Pearce, where he
at least played regularly as a senior. Still, he received a
football scholarship to Pitt, largely as a courtesy to his famous
father extended by head coach Paul Hackett, a Cowboys offensive
coach in Tony's latter years.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Brandt, Dallas' longtime personnel man, was fond of Anthony
because the youngster was a regular summer visitor to the Cowboys'
Thousand Oaks training camps, making harmless mischief with Ron
Springs' son, Shawn. Nonetheless, after seeing him play in high
school, he believed the boy had no chance to advance to the
professional level.
</P>
<P>
   But Brandt got Anthony invited to the East-West Shrine Game,
admittedly in large part because of who his father was. Once there,
Anthony made an impression on the old talent scout, for both his
above-average quickness and his attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did anything anybody needed,'' Brandt said, ``and he seemed
to be first in line for every drill. Then, in the game, he played
extremely well, intercepting two passes. Tony had always had a
terrific work ethic, and you could see how it had rubbed off on
Anthony. They were close. Tony really doted on that kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Before their final Houston season, the Oilers drafted young
Dorsett in the sixth of seven rounds as a
cornerback/special-teamer. He had long since given up any
aspirations he might have once held to follow in Dad's footsteps as
a tailback, saying: ``I didn't like getting hit on every play. I
wanted to deliver the pain, not be the recipient.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first preseason game, he returned a kickoff 99 yards for
a touchdown, the same distance Tony once ran from scrimmage to
score, setting an NFL record. Anthony would later make his
regular-season Oilers debut here in Atlanta, where he had also
played his first organized football at the age of 12 after his
mother, Karen Castelow, moved following her breakup with Tony.
</P>
<P>
   Each subsequent season he has further ensconced himself with the
Titans, finally winning a start in the final week of the regular
season while the snake-bit Robertson recovered from a motorcycle
accident that left him with 150 stitches in his face. Today Anthony
is a solid, exceedingly mobile 200-pounder with massive arms, a
much more imposing specimen physically than Tony ever was.
</P>
<P>
   ``What my father accomplished for his size (5-10, 180) is almost
hard to believe now,'' Anthony said. ``Look at these big backs like
Eddie (George).''
</P>
<P>
   Tony will, of course, be in the Georgia Dome stands Sunday, a
proud papa sitting where Anthony once sat. He has already told
Anthony to ``stay focused on the game, nothing else, this week.''
You suspect the message will be repeated several more times before
kickoff, when the Rams start challenging Anthony as he has never
been challenged before.
</P>
<P>
   It's advice well heeded, the son realizes. The father, having
been here and done this himself, knows best.
</P>

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Hakeem Olajuwon doesn't know what to make of it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He had just checked into Tuesday's game against the Minnesota
Timberwolves but after three minutes was gasping. During each
timeout, Olajuwon would double over, grabbing his shorts as he
tried to gulp down oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   But Olajuwon felt like he never was able to catch his breath,
and he's starting to wonder why.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like having a brand-new car,'' Olajuwon said of his
condition, ``but with no gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon is back, recently returning to the Rockets after Dec. 1
surgery to repair an inguinal hernia, but his conditioning is far
from back.
</P>
<P>
   And Olajuwon, 37, said he is beginning to get a bit concerned
about the possible reasons behind his lack of stamina on the court.
</P>
<P>
   All the other components _ instinct, ability and timing _ are
intact, which is perhaps the most frustrating thing for the center.
So Olajuwon, who in the past has battled anemia, underwent blood
tests Wednesday evening as a precaution, the results of which will
be available today.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon will play tonight when the Rockets meet the Golden
State Warriors at Compaq Center. He just hopes he has a little more
zip in his game than he did Tuesday against the Timberwolves, a
game that was especially troubling to Olajuwon because his body was
not responding to the demands he was making on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Tuesday) was a little discouraging for me,'' Olajuwon said.
``When I was in the game, I was winded throughout and I didn't get
a chance to recover. The game before that (Sunday vs. Miami), I was
encouraged because my wind was coming back. I had been working hard
to get my conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``But (Tuesday) I am concerned about what happened. Why did that
happen? I was so winded. I didn't have any energy. Well, the energy
was there, but I didn't have any condition to execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why he wanted to get screened for anemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is,'' Olajuwon said. ``I'll have to get
my blood work done to see if maybe I'm losing the blood count
again. It has to be something, because I'm working so hard to get
into condition and there's no way I should be that winded out there
like I was (Tuesday).''
</P>
<P>
   Since returning to action against the Dallas Mavericks on Jan.
17, when he played just 14 minutes, Olajuwon has not played more
than the 24 minutes he logged Sunday against Miami, when he
finished with nine points, four rebounds and four blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   He has yet to post double figures in points or rebounds, hitting
just 11 of his 33 field-goal attempts in five games and averaging
5.8 points and 4.4 rebounds over that span.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon played 21 minutes against Minnesota but was exhausted
after the first few minutes. He finished with eight points, five
rebounds and a blocked shot but left the floor with 3:50 remaining
as Anthony ``Pig'' Miller finished the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to be more involved, and you want to get involved,
but you couldn't because you can't execute,'' he said. ``I feel
great. I jump and jump, and I feel strong. But once you're tired,
you're limited as to what you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Rockets preparing for a back-to-back situation, playing
the Warriors tonight before traveling to Denver to meet the Nuggets
at the Pepsi Center, Olajuwon's stamina level becomes more
critical.
</P>
<P>
   And when you factor in the thin air of Denver, where Olajuwon
historically has struggled, it becomes a concern.
</P>
<P>
   During his rehabilitation process following the hernia surgery,
Olajuwon worked out on the track at the University of Houston. But
being in running shape is far different than being in shape to play
full-court basketball in the NBA, so Olajuwon hopes the condition
gradually will disappear the more he plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the more games you play, the better it's going to
be,'' Olajuwon said. ``That's the way you get back to basketball
shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can run in here (the Rockets' practice facility) on the
floor, and you can run on the track, but in basketball you have to
play. So all those games make it much easier.'' &QL;

BRADLEY FIRES BACK AT GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Bill Bradley on Wednesday night abruptly
abandoned his passive campaign for the White House, thrusting Vice
President Al Gore on the defensive with a prolonged attack on
Gore's campaign tactics, honesty and political integrity.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of sidestepping a fight with Gore, Bradley seized
the last debate before Tuesday's crucial New Hampshire primary as a
battleground to challenge the vice president for purportedly
distorting Bradley's record and engaging in the brand of unseemly
politics practiced by Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   The attack came as the latest polls showed Gore protecting a
slight lead over Bradley in a state where Bradley had enjoyed an
edge since December and badly needs to post a strong showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we believe that you will tell the truth as
president if you don't tell the truth as a candidate?'' Bradley
asked Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore asked back: ``That's not a negative attack?''
</P>
<P>
   As Bradley repeatedly forced Gore to defend himself, the vice
president denied lying or engaging in dirty politics. And Gore
accused Bradley of cheapening his effort to present himself as a
proponent of cleaner elections with his revised strategy to attack
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to talk about a higher standard,'' Gore said,
``you need to live by it.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate was the seventh between Bradley and Gore, and was the
last chance for New Hampshire voters to hear the unfiltered views
of the candidates before they cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley took the offensive after some of his advisers and
supporters had clamored for weeks for him to demonstrate to voters
that he is a fighter. Though Gore's aides anticipated the
counterattack, they expressed a measure of surprise at the ferocity
of Bradley's effort.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it remains to be seen whether voters will embrace Bradley's
newfound vigor or Gore will succeed in portraying him as just
another candidate engaged in the give-and-take of conventional
politics.
</P>
<P>
   They sparred at times over policy, but the debate was dominated
by the showdown over campaign ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's attack on Gore was supported in part by a debate
moderator, CNN's Judy Woodruff, who began the forum by saying that
Gore had repeatedly distorted Bradley's record and health-care
proposal. And Bradley soon exploited the opportunity by likening
Gore to Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Al accuses me of negative campaigning, he reminds of
Richard Nixon,'' Bradley said. ``He would chop down a tree, stand
on a stump, and give a speech about conservation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said, ``There has never been a time in this campaign that I
said something that I knew to be untrue. There is nothing I've said
in this campaign that is untrue.'' He accused Bradley of ``wanting
to shoot the messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's statement could come back to hurt Gore if Bradley is able
to prove that Gore has made false statements.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley wasn't done. He accusd Gore of playing ``politics as
usual,'' offering ``a thousand promises and a thousand attacks ...
attack, attack, attack every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore shot back: ``I didn't wait until I ran for president to
speak up for campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley later chastised Gore for making statements for which he
should know better. ``I wonder if you're running a campaign that
says untrue things,'' Bradley said. ``I wonder if you can be a
president that gets people's trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore called that ``a negative personal attack.'' Gore said
Bradley should stick to the subsance of their disagreements without
negative personal attacks. ``People out there are tired of that,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the joust, Gore criticized Bradley for voting for budget
cuts in the 1980s that were seen as hurting the poor and
campaigning in 2000 on a promise to help the disadvantaged. ``The
way you've been talking,'' Gore said, ``I don't see how you can
vote for Ronald Reagan's budget cuts and campaign like Robert
Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's hard feelings toward Gore stem primarily from the vice
president's relentless dissection of Bradley's health care proposal
over weeks and weeks. Gore has said that by eliminating Medicaid,
Bradley would throw out federal nursing home standards. Bradley
says that is not true.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also said that by eliminating Medicaid, the federal
health insurance program for the poor and disabled, Bradley would
harm African-Americans, Latinos and women, who disproportionately
receive those benefits. Bradley has said he is outraged by the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore has criticized Bradley's plan for replacing Medicaid,
saying it is grossly inadequate and describing it as $150-a-month
voucher for insurance. In New Hampshire and Iowa, Gore has said
repeatedly, there is no federal health plan for that price. Bradley
has fumed that Gore is distorting what is a weighted average that
could amount to more than $150 in some states and less than $150 in
others _ not a flat amount.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, in a reflection of Bradley's new and aggressive
tone, his campaign workers passed out reams of paper, attempting to
correct Gore's statements, as well as to pin the vice president
down on his own past record.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of last year, Bradley held himself out as a
different type of candidate running a different sort of campaign.
The Gore campaign, however, poked Bradley unceasingly in an effort
to get him to react, demonstrating that he is a politician like all
others.
</P>
<P>
   Following the debate, Bradley defended his decision to go after
Gore. He said he hoped there is a reservoir of good will toward him
from the voters, and that they will use his information to make
their decision. He also said Gore would have to go a long way to
prove that he has not lied in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried to be as positive as I can throughout this whole
period,'' Bradley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   One area Bradley has tiptoed around for months has been Gore's
record on abortion. Aides have suggested that people look at votes
Gore took early in his congressional career, but Bradley was always
loathe to raise the subject himself.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Bradley questioned Gore's commitment to
protecting a woman's right to an abortion, saying Gore supported
the ``right to life position'' 84 percent of the time while in the
House of Representatives. He also said Gore had opposed federal
funding for abortion, voting 19 times against federal or local
funding for abortion in the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, however, repeatedly told Bradley that he supports a
woman's right to have an abortion. And the Gore campaign issued a
previous statement from Kate Michelman, president of the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, saying that both
candidates are strong supporters of a woman's right to choose. ``No
one should question their commitment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did cast a number of votes against federal funding for
abortions. According to a summary of Gore's abortion voting record
in a recent biography by Bob Zelnick, Gore, in 1977 _ his first
year in Congress _ voted for an amendment offered by Representative
Henry Hyde, the Illinois Republican, that banned spending federal
funds on abortions unless necessary to save the life of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   That same year he voted against other amendments that would have
extended federal funding for abortions in cases of rape and incest.
As recently as 1987, by Zelnick's account, Gore supported another
Hyde amendment that declared that ``abortion takes the life of an
unborn child who is a living human being'' and that ``a right to
abortion is not secured by the Constitution of the United States.''

N.J. TAX OPPONENTS GO AFTER BRADLEY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
</HEADLINE>
   (With BRADLEY) 
(nk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ In the first overtly hostile television
commercial targeting a Democratic presidential candidate this year,
a New Jersey anti-tax group that has long been a foe of former Sen.
Bill Bradley is attacking him for what it calls his hypocritical
advocacy of campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The group, Hands Across New Jersey, is widely considered to have
been instrumental in stirring the anti-tax sentiment that nearly
toppled Bradley in his 1990 re-election campaign against Christie
Whitman, then a political unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second spot, which began running on Tuesday on WMUR-TV
here, features a group of New Jersey citizens sitting at a kitchen
table. One speaker says that Bradley has called for the elimination
of the use of soft money in campaigns ``yet he raised millions from
special interests.'' The advertisement says that Bradley was
compelled to return a campaign contribution from an insurance
company and attempted to intervene with the Commerce Department on
behalf of a donor.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign Wednesday denied the accusations, saying
Bradley had received no contributions from any company, in part
because that was not allowable under Federal Election Commission
guidelines. Kristen Ludecke, a campaign spokeswoman, added that
Bradley had voluntarily returned a contribution made by employees
of the Prudential Insurance Co. because it was raised ``using
corporate facilities, like a phone,'' which is not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department incident, the campaign said, involved
the owners of another New Jersey company who had each donated $500
to the campaign. Fifteen months later, the campaign said, Bradley
had written to the department asking it ``to give fair treatment to
the company,'' but that a company official has said it was nothing
but a routine letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advertisement attacks, falsely, the record of Mr. Bradley
on campaign finance reform issues,'' the campaign said in a letter
Wednesday to WMUR. It asked that the station refrain from
broadcasting ``soft-money financed, attack advertisements.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Bradley spot is the latest in a series of critical
advertisements that have revolved around money issues, chiefly
taxation and the financing of presidential campaigns. Steve Forbes
has been running an advertisement criticizing his Republican rival,
Gov. George W. Bush, for his record on taxes in Texas, while a
Washington-based advocacy group, Americans for Tax Reform, created
a commercial critical of Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   John Sheridan, who is a board member of and spokesman for Hands
Across New Jersey, said the commercial, in which he appears, was
created because he and other group members were angered by what
they saw as the hypocrisy of Bradley's joint appearance with McCain
last month in Claremont, N.H. During that meeting, the candidates
pledged to disavow the use of soft money, though Bradley added the
caveat that he would only forgo the money if his eventual opponent
did, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign, meanwhile, referred reporters to a former
official of Hands Across New Jersey, John Budzash, who they said
had renounced the group. In 1990, Budzash founded the grass-roots
organization to protest a $2.8 billion package of taxes enacted
under Gov. Jim Florio. Reached Wednesday, Budzash said he left it a
year later because he felt it was being usurped by members who
wanted to align the group with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He called the New Hampshire spit ``a complete violation of the
founding principles of Hands Across New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most blatant reasons for the need for
campaign finance reform,'' Budzash said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan, however, denied any partisan connections, saying the
group had long ago become disenchanted with Whitman and disavowed
its support of her.

DAVENPORT ENDS CAPRIATI'S BID FOR AUSTRALIAN OPEN FINAL
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ ``If she was playing anyone else, I would
want her to win,'' Lindsay Davenport said before taking the court
against Jennifer Capriati.
</P>
<P>
   Against most other players, the recharged Capriati would have
won with her flat power from the baseline and improved movement and
combativeness. But Thursday at the Australian Open, Davenport
reminded her and the tennis world that she still has work to do if
she wants to build on the foundation that she has managed to
reconstruct after it crumbled in her teens.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's 6-2, 7-6 (4) victory in the semifinals _ played with
the roof closed over the newly renamed Rod Laver Arena _ required 1
hour 22 minutes and a great deal of composure in the tiebreaker,
and it earned her a spot in her first Australian Open final.
</P>
<P>
   Her opponent will be the winner of Thursday's second semifinal
between the top-seeded Martina Hingis and 13th-seeded Conchita
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my third Grand Slam final,'' said a relieved Davenport.
``I'm 2-0, and maybe I'll make it 3-0. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati and Davenport were born slightly more than two months
apart in 1976 _ Capriati in New York and Davenport in Newport
Beach, California. But though both have won Olympic gold medals,
their careers have followed disparate paths. Capriati turned
professional at 13, signing lucrative endorsement deals well before
she reached the semifinals of her first Grand Slam event: the 1990
French Open. Davenport turned professional at 16 while she was
attending high school and did not reach her first Grand Slam
semifinal until 1997, a year when Capriati was already on the
comeback trail after a self-imposed absence from the sport.

   What could have been a signature rivalry between 23-year-old
attacking baseliners has yet to materialize. They had played only
three times before Thursday, with Davenport winning the last two
matches in straight sets. But Thursday's encounter was less
lopsided as the two powerful players traded flat forehands and
backhands under the retractable roof that has been closed with
unusual frequency in the midst of a rainy January.

   Davenport played superbly in the opening set, generating
remarkable depth off the ground. It was over in 22 minutes, but her
level would drop substantially in the second set, as errors began
creeping into her game with more frequency. There would be a total
of six service breaks in the second set. The last came when
Davenport served for the match at 5-4.

   After both women held serve to 6-6, the level lifted again in
the tiebreaker. But at 4-4 after one of the longest baseline
rallies of the match, Capriati attempted to change pace and dumped
a sliced backhand in the net. Two points later, Davenport was
letting loose a shriek of celebration and jogging forward to shake
Capriati's hand.

   ``Very rarely do I feel I'm on my back foot and not in control
of points,'' said Davenport, who already has won the U.S. Open and
Wimbledon. ``But today I felt like that a lot. I know she's been
though a lot and it's great she's come back, and I know she'll be
around for a lot more years.''
