<HEADLINE> Blues' Turgeon Might Miss a Month  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The injuries keep mounting for the St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
	   Pierre Turgeon, the Blues' leading scorer, injured his right wrist in the
first period of Saturday's 4-0 victory over the Colorado Avalanche and might be
out of action for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a long-term loss and it does not look good right now," St. Louis
coach Joel Quenneville said. "We'll find out Tuesday when the specialist looks
at him but I think he'll be out at least a month."
</P>
<P>
	   The injury occurred when the center fell awkwardly on the ice after being
checked.
</P>
<P>
	   Turgeon, third in the NHL with 58 points, has 23 goals and 35 assists. He
was selected to the North American All-Star squad earlier this month for the
All-Star game Feb. 6 at Toronto.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we're without (Turgeon) for any extended period of time, that will
really hurt us," Blues forward Craig Conroy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Turgeon will join Blues defenseman Al MacInnis on the injured list.
MacInnis, also chosen for the North American All-Star team, is expected to miss
up to four weeks with a collapsed lung.

<P>
	   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Demetrius Porter hit a 12-foot turnaround jumper with
5.6 seconds remaining as Fresno State rallied from a 14-point deficit in the
second half to beat No. 13 Tulsa 75-73 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Greg Harrington's long jumper as time expired hit the rim and bounced away,
and Tulsa's 13-game winning streak came to an end.
</P>
<P>
	   Courtney Alexander scored 28 points to lead Fresno State (14-7, 4-1 WAC),
which won its eighth straight at home. Melvin Ely added 16 points and Larry
Abney had 11 points to go with 24 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Brandon Kurtz had 17 points and David Shelton 15 for Tulsa (20-2, 5-1),
which lost for the first time since a 69-60 defeat at Oral Roberts on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing by nine at the break and down 58-44 after Dante Swanson's layup
with 13:37 left, the Bulldogs put together an 18-3 run, going in front 62-61
when Terrance Roberson grabbed an offensive rebound and put back a short jumper
in the lane.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberson began the flurry by converting a three-point play and Alexander and
Porter each hit 3-pointers to help keep it going.
</P>
<P>
	   The Golden Hurricane regained the lead when Kurtz made a baseline jumper
before the Bulldogs took it back on successive baskets by Ely.
</P>
<P>
	   With 1:54 remaining, Roberson connected on a 3-pointer to put the Bulldogs
in front 73-67.
</P>
<P>
	   Two free throws by David Shelton and a driving layup by Harrington
sandwiched around Alexander's miss on the front end of a 1-and-1 tied it 73-all
with 30.6 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Porter then drove into the open, spun and hit the go-ahead shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrington missed a long jumper as time expired.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurtz had 12 points in the first half, when Tulsa took a 42-33 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bulldogs missed all five of their 3-point tries in the period while
Kurtz, just 1-of-9 from beyond the arc entering the game, made his first two
3-point tries.
</P>
<P>
	   Fresno State kept it close early, pulling to 28-25 on a reverse layup by
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurtz shook free inside for a dunk and added a 3-pointer and layup as part
of a 9-2 burst that carried the Hurricane to a 37-27 lead.

<P>
	   CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- Brandon Granville scored 21 points and Southern
California made 20-of-29 3-pointers as the 23rd-ranked Trojans defeated Oregon
State 82-69 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Trojans (13-6, 6-1 Pac-10) opened the second half by hitting their first
11 shots from the field -- including nine 3-pointers -- to expand a seven-point
halftime advantage into 70-44 lead with 11:48 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Fans of the Beavers (10-8, 2-5) started chanting "Miss! Miss! Miss!" but USC
didn't until 10:26 remained to be played.
</P>
<P>
	   USC broke the conference record of 18 3-pointers set by Washington State
against Seattle in 1990. USC's previous best was 15, set in 1992 and matched in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Trepagnier and David Bluthenthal scored 17 points for the Trojans, who
have won 10 of 12 games. Nate Hair added 14 points and Brian Scalabrine 13
points.
</P>
<P>
	   USC, which earlier lost its top scorer and top reserve for the season to
injuries, played its five starters almost the entire game. Each hit at least
three 3-pointers, with Granville hitting 5-of-7.
</P>
<P>
	   The Beavers, who have lost five straight at home, were led by Deaundra
Tanner with 17 points. Jason Heide had 12 points and Josh Steinthal 11.
</P>
<P>
	   The Beavers were 10-of-24 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
	   The Beavers took a 14-8 lead, making 4-of-5 3-pointers in the first five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   But 3-pointers by Bluthenthal and Hair and three 3-pointers by Granville
over the next 10 minutes helped the Trojans to a 31-24 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   They stretched that to 39-28 on a basket by Trepagnier and 3-pointers by
Trepagnier and Bluthenthal, but the Ducks scored the last two baskets of the
half to trail 39-32.

</P>
<P>
	   The Bucks handcuffed Vin Baker in their second meeting in nine days. In
Seattle's 104-96 victory on Jan. 20, Baker scored 31 points. Baker managed 10
points against his former team on 2-for-nine shooting with four turnovers and
five rebounds in 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas scored 16 points for the Bucks, and Scott Williams had a solid
performance with 11 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams got off to sluggish starts in the fourth period, combining for
eight points in the first 5:09 of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Patterson's putback basket tied it at 84 after three periods. The Sonics
outscored the Bucks 9-2 to erase an 82-75 deficit.
</P>
<P>

The Sonics charged back behind Payton and Patterson with Payton's reverse layup
cutting the deficit to 75-73 with 4:58 left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Barry returned to the lineup after missing the previous game with a mild
concussion. He was 4-for-7 from 3-point range in 38 minutes. He had 12 points in
the first half and hit two of three from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucks took a 58-57 lead at halftime as Cassell scored 11 points in the
period, including the last five of the half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucks led 29-26 after one period. Allen scored 13 for the Bucks in the
opening period. The Sonics missed their first nine shots and did not get a
basket until Patterson's dunk with 6:17 left in the quarter.

Intelligence Agency Confirms Computer Outage
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The super-secret National Security Agency confirmed
Saturday night that it had a "serious computer problem" last week that affected
its ability to process intelligence information. The agency issued a brief
statement a few hours after the outage was reported by ABC News, which said its
sources characterized the problem as the biggest computer failure in the history
of the NSA. "This problem, which was contained to the NSA headquarters complex
at Fort Meade, Md., did not affect intelligence collection, but did affect the
processing of intelligence information," the agency statement said. "There was
no evidence of malice or no evidence of a Y2K problem," said an agency official
who asked not to be identified by name.

accused in the 1995 nerve-gas attack on Tokyo subways offered Saturday to pay a
total of $1.14 million a year as compensation to the victims. Tatsuko Muraoka,
who replaced Shoko Asahara as guru of the Aum Shinri Kyo cult this month, said
several tens of thousands of dollars will be paid to the victims immediately. "I
don't intend to deny that I bear a heavy responsibility," said Fumihiro Joyu,
one of the cult's leaders, appearing before reporters for the first time since
his release from prison last month.

Gore Changes Abortion Position

<P>
	   MILFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore retracted his 13-year-old
statement equating abortion to "the taking of a human life" as he scrambled
Saturday to keep the issue, a traditional stumbling block for Republicans, from
tripping him up against Democrat Bill Bradley. "Yes, my position has changed,"
Gore said. Meanwhile, the conservative New Hampshire Sunday News said it was
giving "an almost endorsement" to Bradley because Gore's "dishonesty in this
campaign makes him an unacceptable choice for Democratic-leaning voters." The
Sunday paper and its daily companion, The Union Leader, rarely endorse Democrats
in presidential primaries. The papers have already endorsed Steve Forbes in the
Republican primary.

Rep. Burton Says Elian Wants To Stay
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Rep. Dan Burton, whose congressional maneuvering to keep
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez in the United States has infuriated the boy's father
in Cuba, said Saturday that the boy told him he doesn't want to go back. "The
first question I asked him is how did he like living here and he said he liked
it very much as he was blowing bubbles. And then I said 'Would you like to go
back to Cuba?' And he was very firm in saying 'No' and this without any
coaching." The Indiana Republican met with the Elian for 30 minutes at the home
where the boy is staying with relatives. Elian was found clinging to an inner
tube Nov. 25 off the Florida coast. His mother and 10 others traveling with him
drowned during an effort to leave Cuba.

President Vladimir Putin on Saturday as "businesslike and decisive." Although
Annan said he still wants to see negotiations and an end to the war in Chechnya.
International leaders have accused Russia of using indiscriminate force in
Chechnya, citing high civilian casualties and the 250,000 refugees. Russia
insists it is targeting only rebel positions, and says the offensive is aimed at
rooting out Chechen militants blamed for terrorist acts in Russia.

and ice-covered overpasses and interchanges were shut down across the state.
Another storm earlier in the week had knocked out electrical service to
thousands of customers across the Southeast. In North Carolina, about 500
customers were still without power Saturday as state emergency management

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Better and better as time goes on, Andre Agassi
claimed his second Australian Open and sixth Grand Slam title Sunday in an
artistic and bruising victory over Yevgeny Kafelnikov. Five of Agassi's most
exquisite, feathery drop shots and dozens of powerful groundstrokes sapped the
strength and spirit from Kafelnikov in a 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 triumph. At 29,
Agassi left no doubt that he rules men's tennis. In less than a year, he has won
the French, U.S. and Australian Opens and finished runnerup at Wimbledon. This
time he put the exclamation point on his win with three aces at up to 123 mph in
the last game.

<HEADLINE> No. 19 Utah 64, Air Force 63  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN MOSSMAN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. (AP) -- Any more games like this and Alex Jensen
may finally realize how good he is.
</P>
<P>
	   The unselfish, self-effacing Jensen made a 3-point basket and a three-point
play in the final 38 seconds, rallying No. 19 Utah to a 64-63 victory over
stubborn Air Force on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one ever has to tell me how good Alex can be and is," Utah coach Rick
Majerus said. "Basically, I've spent my whole life telling the kid he's good,
and he looks at me as though I don't know what I'm talking about. Al has (Utah
Jazz guard John) Stockton's disease. He's unselfish to a fault.
</P>
<P>
	   "He did a wonderful job tonight."
</P>
<P>
	   At the finish, instead of dishing to his teammates, Jensen took charge.
</P>
<P>
	   "Al knew he had to look for a shot," Majerus said. "He knows Hanno (Mottola)
is out of the game."
</P>
<P>
	   Mottola, Utah's top player, fouled out with 49 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew I had to shoot it (the 3-pointer) without hesitating because we were
down and there was not a lot of time left," Jensen said. "Maybe even a year ago
I wouldn't have tried to be as aggressive at the end. This was a game we were
fortunate to get away with a win."
</P>
<P>
	   Falcons coach Reggie Minton said his players "played their hearts out. We
just slipped up at the end. We didn't want to give up a 3 or a three-point play,
that's what we were preaching. Jensen is a wily veteran and a tremendous
player."
</P>
<P>
	   Majerus said his team "never gave up, we never quit, and neither did Air
Force. What a shame that only 2,100 people saw this game, because it was a hell
of a game."
</P>
<P>
	   The Utes (16-3, 5-0 Mountain West) built an 11-point lead midway through the
second half and then saw Air Force erase it with a 15-4 run.
</P>
<P>
	   Jarvis Croff's 3-pointer from the corner and Tom Bellairs' free throw gave
the Falcons (6-11, 2-3) a 62-58 lead with 49 seconds left, but Jensen promptly
made a long 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
	   After Tyron Wright sank 1-of-2 free throws for a 63-61 lead, Jensen made a
driving layup and was fouled with 16.9 seconds left, making the free throw as
well.
</P>
<P>
	   Air Force nearly lost the ball twice on its last possession. The Falcons set
up an inbounds play with 2.1 seconds left, but freshman Vernard Jenkins missed a
16-footer as time expired.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he had control of the ball on his final shot, Jenkins said, "Not
really, because when I caught it they came around me and hit the ball from the
back. I still had a good enough look to make it, though. It just didn't go in."
</P>
<P>
	   Jensen finished with 20 points and nine rebounds. Tony Harvey added 12
points and Mottola, who played only 24 minutes because of foul trouble and a
hyperextended left elbow, had 10 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Wright scored 20 points for the Falcons and Croff had 19.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah shot 73 percent (16-of-22) in the second half and 63 percent for the
game, compared to Air Force's 45 percent. The Falcons were 21-of-25 from the
line to the Utes' 5-of-11.
</P>
<P>
	   Mottola, scoreless in the first half, fueled a 9-0 run early in the second
half with six points as Utah took control. Mottola fell on his elbow on a drive
to the basket and missed the next three minutes, but he returned with an elastic
sleeve on his elbow and made two jumpers.
</P>
<P>
	   Wright had 10 of the Falcons' 15 points during their furious comeback, and
Croff hit two 3-pointers down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   With Mottola playing only nine minutes of the first half because of foul
trouble, Air Force fashioned an 8-0 run to take a 23-18 lead with 3:18 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Jensen, however, scored the next seven points of the game on a layup, a
3-pointer and another layup for a 25-23 lead with 21 seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Bellairs sank two free throws to produce a 25-25 halftime tie.

5-4 against Atlantic Division opponents and 5-28 against the rest of the NBA.
Eric Murdock had 16 points, seven rebounds and a career-high 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerry Kittles scored 24 points for the Nets, who have lost four in a row and
six straight on the road. Stephon Marbury, who wasted a career-high 42 points in
Thursday night's loss in Vancouver, finished with 23 points after being held to
just four during the first 30 minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   But it wasn't enough for the heartbreak Nets, who lost each of their
previous two games in the final two seconds on shots by Seattle's Chuck Person
and Vancouver's Michael Dickerson and are 5-13 in games decided by fewer than
six points.
</P>
<P>
	   Marbury hit 20-foot jumpers on both ends of a 10-2 spurt at the start of the
fourth quarter, helping the Nets turn a three-point deficit into a 76-71 edge --
their biggest of the game -- with 9:08 remaining. The lead changed hands eight
times before Taylor's short jumper put the Clippers ahead for good at 90-89 with
1:55 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   After a 23-footer by Taylor put the Clippers up by three, Marbury swung an
errant pass toward Kittles, which he wrestled out of Anderson's hands before
hitting a 19-footer that trimmed the deficit to 94-93 with 22 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
	   But Anderson, coming off a career-high 35-point effort on Thursday night at
Dallas, sank both free throws after an intentional foul by Johnny Newman with 16
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey had one more chance for a game-tying 3-pointer, but Odom forced a
turnover by Marbury from behind the arc, and Tyrone Nesby clinched it with a
slam dunk off Odom's alley-oop pass in the final two seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nets capped an 11-0 run with consecutive 3-pointers by Kittles and Scott
Burrell and two free throws by Marbury, turning an eight-point deficit into a
64-61 lead with 1:20 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Murdock, who came to the Clippers in a trade for Johnny Newman on Sept. 23,
made his ninth start of the season and played the entire first half as he paced
Los Angeles to a 43-42 lead with 11 points, six rebounds and six assists. His
layup with 8:48 left in the second quarter gave the Clippers a 30-25 lead, the
largest margin by either team in the first half.

<HEADLINE> AmericaOne Loses America's Cup Race  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Skipper Paul Cayard was emphatic: A bad call
ruined a good race for AmericaOne but don't count him out yet.
</P>
<P>
	The American boat lost Race 4 of the America's Cup challenger finals Sunday
when it was penalized, as it held a small lead about a minute from the end, for
blocking Prada of Italy.
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne crossed the finish line a half boat length ahead of Prada but had to
make a 270-degree penalty turn. That gave Prada a 2-minute, 32-second victory
and a 3-1 lead in the best-of-9 series.
</P>
<P>
	Prada raised a protest flag and umpires in a nearby boat agreed that
AmericaOne, the windward boat, prevented Prada, the leeward boat, from sailing
the proper course to the mark as AmericaOne was required by the rules to do. But
Cayard said Prada already was off its proper course.
</P>
<P>
	``They've done an awesome job,'' Cayard said of the umpires. ``Today we
disagreed with the call. It was a quick call for a big-money race and it
shuffled the deck big time. That's all right. We don't mind 3-1.''
</P>
<P>
	There is no appeal process for calls made on the water.
</P>
<P>
	``He was trying to sail below and squeeze us to the mark and we just stayed on
course,'' Prada tactician Torben Grael said.
</P>
<P>
	Cayard must win four of a possible five races to advance to the best-of-9
America's Cup final starting Feb. 19 against defending champion New Zealand.
Race 5 is scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	``Each of us is going to win some races that we didn't expect to win and each
of us is going to lose some races that we didn't expect to lose,'' he said.
``That probably happened a little bit on both boats today.''
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne had come back from serious boat damage that forced it to withdraw
from Saturday's third race. It led all the way Sunday until the penalty turn.
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne led by 41 seconds going into the final 3 1/4-mile leg of the
six-leg, 18 1/2-mile race in varying conditions -- strong winds approaching 25
knots, sunny skies, and a brief downpour that limited visibility.
</P>
<P>
	Then Prada skipper Francesco de Angelis started closing in as he positioned his
boat behind Cayard's to block the wind, coming from behind, from Cayard's sails.
</P>
<P>
	With the finish line about 60 seconds away, Prada, sailing on the left, headed
toward AmericaOne, which was coming at an angle from the right. Their
spinnakers, sails at the front of the boat used on downwind legs, seemed to
touch, and the Italians immediately raised a protest flag.
</P>
<P>
	Cayard made a poor gybe and the boats separated as both sailed straight ahead
toward the finish line. AmericaOne's bow crossed first, but the umpires in a
nearby boat upheld Prada's protest.
</P>
<P>
	The American boat, plagued by equipment problems Saturday, was done in by human
error Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	``We did a much better job today and were looking good for a while,'' Cayard
said.
</P>
<P>
	For most of the race, it appeared Cayard's sailing skill would overcome the
latest mishap -- its eighth lost spinnaker in 44 races throughout the trials and
second in two days.
</P>
<P>
	A cool Cayard sailed an aggressive and masterful second leg after the
lime-green sail broke loose from its pole.
</P>
<P>
	Cayard won Race 2 despite having a spinnaker rip across the bottom. The
spinnaker damage in Race 3 on Saturday was more costly as the sail snapped in
two horizontally on the fourth leg.
</P>
<P>
	The boat's rigging also suffered substantial damage in the strong winds and
high waves and Cayard, fearing his mast would break, withdrew on the fifth leg.
For Sunday's race, he had substituted the mast from his backup boat.
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday (Saturday) we just had a lot of things go against us,'' Cayard
said. ``We hadn't raced in 30 knots before. The Italians had'' because they had
been in New Zealand longer than AmericaOne.
</P>
<P>
	The winds were strong again, although not reaching the 30 knots of Saturday.
Cayard led by four seconds at the start and eight seconds after the first leg,
going into the wind.
</P>
<P>
	Then the Hauraki Gulf turned into the scene of furious combat as both boats had
sail problems and raised protest flags that were disallowed by the umpires.
</P>
<P>
	About halfway up the three-mile downwind run, AmericaOne's spinnaker came loose
and remained attached only at the top.
</P>
<P>
	A luffing duel ensued in which the leading boat maneuvers in attempt to keep
its opponent's sail from filling properly. It worked for Cayard as he tacked
several times and stretched his lead even though he had no spinnaker.
</P>
<P>
	``They were very lucky that their spinnaker broke again,'' Grael said,
``because then it was easier for them to luff.''
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne gained 31 seconds on the leg and as the crisis passed, Cayard took a
deep breath and a drink from a water bottle. The heavy rain returned on the
third leg, and AmericaOne increased its lead to 54 seconds at the midpoint.
Prada started chipping away, trailing by 47 seconds and 41 seconds after the
next two legs.

    SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Mathieu Biron scored a power-play goal with 2:17
left in overtime Saturday night to lift the New York Islanders to a 3-2 victory
over the San Jose Sharks.
</P>
<P>
	   Biron's shot, from 20 feet out, followed a rebounded shot by Mariusz
Czerkawski.
</P>

</P>
<P>
	   Claude Lapointe scored his eighth goal of the season 40 seconds into the
game, tapping in a rebound. Jonsson passed behind the net to Gino Odjick, who
took a shot at the goal. Nabokov blocked it with his skates and went to the ice,
allowing Lapointe to slip the puck past him.
</P>
<P>
	   Dmitri Nabokov scored his second goal in as many games 1:17 later, putting
the puck through the legs of relief goalie Steve Shields after taking a pass
from Jonsson in the corner.

Computer Outage Confirmed at Security Agency
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The super-secret National Security Agency confirmed
Saturday night that it had a "serious computer problem" last week that affected
its ability to process intelligence information. The agency issued a brief
statement a few hours after the outage was reported by ABC News, which said its
sources characterized the problem as the biggest computer failure in the history
of the NSA. "This problem, which was contained to the NSA headquarters complex
at Fort Meade, Md., did not affect intelligence collection, but did affect the
processing of intelligence information," the agency statement said. "There was
no evidence of malice or no evidence of a Y2K problem," said an agency official
who asked not to be identified by name.

Bradley Presses Gore on Abortion

	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley
charged Al Gore was trying to "dance around" earlier qualms about abortion as he
bid to cut into the vice president's core Democratic support. Gore, who has
moved past Bradley in recent polls, sought to blunt his rival's attack on his
position on abortion and his credibility. Asked whether he would say abortion
"is arguably the taking of a human life," as he wrote to a constituent 1987, the
vice president said, "I would not use that phrasing today."

Law Makes Egyptian Divorce Easier
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A new law making it easier for Egyptian women to leave
their husbands was passed approved by President Hosni Mubarak on Saturday. The
new legislation makes it easier for women to obtain a divorce, though the
process remains more difficult for women than it is for men. Islamic law gives
men the right to divorce their wives anytime and without the approval of a court
or any other authority. Under the old law, women had to prove that physical or
psychological harm was caused by husbands to obtain a divorce. Under the new
law, women who divorce their husbands must return their dowries and relinquish
all financial claims, including alimony.

Rep. Burton Says Elian Wants To Stay

	   MIAMI (AP) -- Rep. Dan Burton, whose congressional maneuvering to keep
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez in the United States has infuriated the boy's father
in Cuba, said Saturday that the boy told him he doesn't want to go back. "The
first question I asked him is how did he like living here and he said he liked
it very much as he was blowing bubbles. And then I said 'Would you like to go
back to Cuba?' And he was very firm in saying 'No' and this without any
coaching." The Indiana Republican met with the Elian for 30 minutes at the home
where the boy is staying with relatives. Elian was found clinging to an inner
tube Nov. 25 off the Florida coast. His mother and 10 others traveling with him
drowned during an effort to leave Cuba.

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Better and better as time goes on, Andre Agassi
claimed his second Australian Open and sixth Grand Slam title Sunday in an
artistic and bruising victory over Yevgeny Kafelnikov. Five of Agassi's most

	   MILFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore retracted his 13-year-old
statement equating abortion to "the taking of a human life" as he scrambled
Saturday to keep the issue, a traditional stumbling block for Republicans, from
tripping him up against Democrat Bill Bradley. "Yes, my position has changed,"
Gore said. "I strongly support a woman's right to choose and if (Bradley)
disputes that, then he is making a mistake." Bradley began airing a new
television ad in the state Saturday in which the former New Jersey senator calls
himself the only presidential candidate who "has been pro-choice for everyone

statement a few hours after the outage was reported by ABC News, which said its
sources characterized the problem as the biggest computer failure in the history
of the NSA. "This problem, which was contained to the NSA headquarters complex
at Fort Meade, Md., did not affect intelligence collection, but did affect the
processing of intelligence information," the agency statement said. "There was
no evidence of malice or no evidence of a Y2K problem," said an agency official

<HEADLINE> Doc Holds Weight Maintenance Class  </HEADLINE>
    By TIM WHITMIRE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- To students in Tracy Tighe's weight maintenance
class, dieting is about more than merely looking good in a bathing suit or
dropping an inch off their waists.
</P>
<P>
	   For most, struggling with obesity and trying to dodge cardiovascular
disease, diabetes or cancer, it's a matter of life and death.
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the 16 men and women who attended Tighe's class on a recent Monday
evening had already completed an intense weight-loss program run by doctors at
the University of Kentucky Medical Center and Health Management Resources, a
private, Boston-based company.
</P>
<P>
	   For weeks, months even, they fasted under a doctor's supervision, subsisting
on a diet of five weight-loss milkshakes or three shakes plus two low-calorie
packaged meals per day -- 800 to 900 calories total. Patients lose an average of
65 pounds over five months in the program.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, having come through an ordeal of self-denial that most people cannot
even imagine, they face an even tougher challenge: keeping the weight off.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's one of the hardest things I do in this program, is the day-in and
day-out maintenance," said Lynne Cassidy, who lost 85 pounds in the HMR-UK
program in 1988 and now serves as the program's coordinator.
</P>
<P>
	   However, a new study by Dr. James Anderson, the program's director and a
professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Kentucky, suggests that
patients who particpate in very low-calorie diets and in follow-up classes like
Tighe's fare significantly better than other dieters in the battle to maintain
weight loss.
</P>
<P>
	   In an article published in December in the Journal of the American College
of Nutrition, Anderson reported on a follow-up study of 112 people who entered
the UK-HMR program in 1989 and 1990 and stayed with it through at least 12 weeks
of rapid weight loss. After more than five years of follow-up, he wrote,
patients maintained an average of nearly 23 percent of their initial weight
loss.
</P>
<P>
	   That may not sound like much, but consider that national health authorities
at the federal Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of
Health, judge a weight-loss treatment to be successful if participants maintain
a loss of 5 percent of their initial body weight. By this standard, 40 percent
of the individuals studied by Anderson achieved success after five years.
</P>
<P>
	   At seven years, 25 percent of the people studied had successfully maintained
a weight loss of at least 10 percent of their initial body weight.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think our data points out that many people are keeping the weight off
long-term," Anderson said. "Not everyone's being successful, but people are
being successful."
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson said his results at least point toward a solution to what he terms
an epidemic of American obesity that is fueling increased rates of diabetes,
hypertension and coronary heart disease. According to Anderson, more than half
of American adults are overweight and obesity is responsible for more than
300,000 early deaths in the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
	   HMR currently contracts with the University of Kentucky and more than 400
other medical institutions around the country to provide medically-supervised
weight management programs. The programs can cost up to $400 a month for shakes
and low-calorie meals, blood tests and medical supervision. They frequently are
not covered by health insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
	   However, programs like Anderson's are often the only choice for severely
overweight patients.
</P>
<P>
	   "If someone needs to lose 80 pounds, and they lose a pound a week, they'll
have to diet for 80 weeks. That's more than a year and a half," Anderson said.
"That's very hard to do. So we think it's better to bite the bullet and go on,
if you will, starvation rations under medical supervision."
</P>
<P>
	   That's what 43-year-old Janet Whitaker, a producer at the Kentucky public
television network KET, did in October 1998, breaking an unhealthy cycle of
stress-fueled junk food consumption by enrolling in the UK-HMR program.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never really got the concept of healthy eating," Whitaker recalled.
</P>
<P>
	   She lost 35 pounds in the program and now is in maintenance. Last fall, she
ran a 5-kilometer road race, something she never would have dreamed of 15 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Weekly attendance at follow-up classes like the one taught by Tracy Tighe is
crucial to keep the weight off, Whitaker said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I like it," she said, "I like the people I went through it with."
</P>
<P>
	   The classes are more than a support group, however. The petite, energetic
Tighe is more coach than cheerleader, holding her students accountable in their
efforts to comply with the program's "triple imperative" for maintaining weight
loss: at least 2,000 calories of physical activity a week, at least five
servings of fruits and vegetables a day and consumption of at least 14
meal-replacement shakes a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Careful planning is essential to preventing weight gain, Tighe tells the
class. They must plan days when they will undereat, make sure they empty their
homes of unhealthy foods and keep enough meal-replacement shakes and fruits and
vegetables at hand.
</P>
<P>
	   For these dieters, eliminating choices about what to eat is key. After the
class, Tighe discusses what she and her students call "the gap" -- the chasm
between the lifestyle that UK-HMR are patients are trying to lead and the daily
temptations offered by America's drive-thru, super-sized, deep-fried culture.
</P>
<P>
	   Cassidy mentions that the big offer at Burger King this week is two Whoppers
for $2. "You don't see them offering two bunches of broccoli for $2," she jokes.

<HEADLINE> Hormone May Cause Knee Injuries  </HEADLINE>
    By IRA DREYFUSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Female athletes face a far higher risk than do men of
ripping their knee tendons, and a study indicates female hormones may be a
reason why.
</P>
<P>
	   The test-tube experiment found that tissue from the knee's anterior cruciate
ligament grew less well when estrogen was added. The study was intended to help
explain why women have four to six times the risk that men face. But the report
is creating arguments among scientists.
</P>
<P>
	   "That study doesn't mean anything," said Dr. Elizabeth A. Arendt of the
University of Minnesota, who said the lab work was too limited. She also
rejected the idea that estrogen can weaken the knee.
</P>
<P>
	   "Certainly, the hormone we believe is influential," said Dr. Stephen Liu of
UCLA Medical Center, who was one of the researchers.
</P>
<P>
	   Other factors also doubtless play a role, but this study and others argue
that estrogen does weaken the ligament that helps to bind the upper and lower
leg bones together, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings are in the journal Clinical Orthopedics and Related Research;
the abstract appeared on the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   In the study, 17 beta-estradiol, a form of estrogen, was added to
fibroblasts, the cells that produce collagen, which makes up the tough tissue of
the ligament. Researchers found fibroblasts grew at a lower rate in the first
three days of the experiment and that growth was even slower in the presence of
more estrogen. The effect eased as the 14-day experiment continued.
</P>
<P>
	   The cells have estrogen receptors, and estrogen apparently binded to the
receptors, Liu said. "When you find receptors on a tissue, they have to have
some effect or they would not be present," he said. "Our study shows it
decreased collagen buildup."
</P>
<P>
	   The trouble comes in taking this test-tube finding to the next step --
increased ACL damage in women at the time in their menstrual cycle when they
have more estrogen.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a fair amount of interesting information, but nothing that really
explains in a convincing way why women are more at risk than men," said Dr.
Gerald A. Finerman, chairman of UCLA's orthopedic surgery department and senior
author of the paper.
</P>
<P>
	   This may be because it would take a lot of work to get enough blood samples
over enough time from enough women, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
	   Arendt doubts the data ever will come. Estrogen might well affect the
ligament, but the hormone might well the ligament, she said. "Estrogen is
necessary for the good function of every other tissue," she said. "Why would the
ligament be the poor sucker it is not good for?"
</P>
<P>
	   The joint-loosening effect of estrogen has a purpose, although not in the
knee, Liu said. Especially in the pelvis, the looser joints in pregnant women
make delivery easier. An effect of estrogen on the knee would be sort of a side
effect, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But other researchers have come up with other possible reasons for women's
higher risk. These include women's weaker muscles, as well as male-female
skeletal differences. Women can reduce their risk by developing greater muscle
control and better balance, Arendt said. And researchers should spend more time
looking into those strategies, she said.

<HEADLINE> Two Films Split Top Sundance Prize  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- The gritty boxing saga "Girlfight" and the tender
sibling-reunion tale "You Can Count on Me" shared top honors at the Sundance
Film Festival, the nation's top showcase for independent movies.
</P>

who also directed the film.
</P>
<P>
	   "Girlfight" stars Michelle Rodriguez as a young woman who channels her
fierce temper to become a champion boxer. "You Can Count on Me" features Laura
Linney and Mark Ruffalo as a sister and brother struggling to maintain a sense
of family years after their parents are killed in a car crash. Matthew Broderick
co-stars in the movie.

<P>
	   The grand jury prize for documentary went to "Long Night's Journey Into
Day," which examines four cases that came before South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission in the aftermath of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
	   The documentary directing award went to Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman for
"Paragraph 175," an exploration of Nazi atrocities against homosexuals.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> D.A. Pennebaker looks back at 'Don't Look Back'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - D.A. Pennebaker still remembers the look on young Bob
Dylan's face. The 26-year-old singer was watching himself in Pennebaker's
soon-to-be released documentary, "Don't Look Back."
<P>
	   Dylan appeared ... well, stunned is a good word.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the first time he saw it, he went into shock," Pennebaker recalls,
laughing slightly. "He had no idea that one camera sitting on one guy's shoulder
could make him feel so naked."
</P>
<P>
	   The chastened Dylan returned a night later, watched it again, then gave his
OK to Pennebaker's film. Now, three decades later, the director's chronicle of
Dylan's three-week 1965 British tour returns this month in an enhanced DVD
version released by New Video.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've always admired Dylan for letting (the film) go the way it was,"
Pennebaker says. "That was something a lot of lesser talents - and a lot of
greater talents - would have had trouble doing."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker's critically-acclaimed documentary, released in 1967, stands the
test of time - although its creator once felt the 96-minute film would never see
a theatrical release.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the kindness of several West Coast pornographic theaters that changed
that, he says - in particular, The Presidio in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   "This group of Western theaters was showing porno, and they wanted to
upgrade their act," the self-deprecating Pennebaker recalls. "It was perfect for
me, because my movie looked like porno, but it's not."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker, who earned an Academy Award nomination for his look at the
Clinton presidential campaign in "The War Room," is quick to poke fun at
himself. Talking about his acclaimed black and white Dylan piece, he describes
it as "a very ratty-looking film."
</P>
<P>
	   Critics disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "A portrait of the young Dylan tearing the pop world apart," a San Francisco
Examiner reviewer enthused in a typical rave.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker, an Illinois native, earned a degree in mechanical engineering at
Yale before going into filmmaking. Using his college skills, Pennebaker
developed a portable camera that allowed filmmakers full access - one of the
keys to the "cinema verite" style that he helped define.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Pennebaker, the movie wasn't his idea, and it wasn't Dylan's
either. The credit belongs to Dylan's late manager, Albert Grossman.
</P>
<P>
	   "I probably couldn't have convinced Dylan myself," Pennebaker says. "He was
mercurial. It would be hard to convince him of anything for three hours in a
row. But Albert Grossman asked me if I wanted to do a film with one of his
clients."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker knew little about his subject, who wore his hair long, his
sunglasses dark and his attitude on his sleeve: "I didn't have much of a take on
him. I knew who he was, probably heard a couple of his songs. To hear him sing
the first time, he wasn't Rudy Vallee. I was less than swept away."
</P>
<P>
	   That soon changed.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker, watching through his lens, saw "an amazing prodigy. Very smart
in an untutored way. He created his own persona right before your eyes. ... He
was a compendium of things it takes professors years to figure out - startlingly
naive, but smart."
</P>
<P>
	   The 74-year-old Pennebaker acknowledges that he had 40 to 50 extra hours of
footage from the Dylan sessions, and that the idea of recutting his movie
flashed through his brain.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought about it," he says. "I thought, 'This is a chance to make a new
film.' Then I thought, 'Why a new film? What would that get us?' ... It would be
interesting to people who'll take any Dylan you can give them, but not to a
major audience."
</P>
<P>
	   The extra footage, along with outtakes and originals of all Pennebaker's
work such as "Monterey Pop" and "The War Room," now sits in the archives of the
Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
	   The film's title appears in a line from Dylan's song "She Belongs to Me":
"She's an artist, she don't look back."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Pennebaker says the credit for his title actually goes to Negro Leagues
star and Hall of Famer Satchel Paige, who once advised, "Don't look back. It
might be gaining on you."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker offers his own tip on staying a step or two ahead of the
audience: "The one barometer I believe in is boredom. The minute people start to
lose interest, that's it."
</P>
<P>
	   That explains the tight running time of "Don't Look Back, barely an hour and
half.
</P>
<P>
	   The DVD comes with a bonus - five never before released Dylan audio
performances and a previously unreleased version of the landmark cue-card
flipping bit for "Subterranean Homesick Blues."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker's grainy video for the Dylan tune turned out to be about 20 years
ahead of its time, presaging MTV and VH1. So when he flips past the video music
channels today ...
</P>
<P>
	   "I think, 'Without me, they'd be bankrupt,"' he says, laughing loudly. "I'm
sure the check is in the mail."

<HEADLINE> For Andrew Cuomo, a tough Congressional session awaits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Andrew Cuomo has been in the crosshairs before.
<P>
	   With his New York liberal roots, his combative style and his penchant for
publicity, the federal housing secretary has long been a lightning rod for the
GOP. He's even managed to rub some of his fellow Democrats the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
	   Now Cuomo's in the fray again, this time in the middle of a fierce partisan
battle that almost everyone agrees has as much to do with New York's high-stakes
U.S. Senate race between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani as it does
with housing policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Republicans will grill Cuomo's Department of Housing and Urban
Development at a hearing next month. House hearings could follow.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican onslaught also comes as Cuomo, the eldest son of former Gov.
Mario Cuomo, makes his loudest rumblings yet that he's interested in running for
his father's old job.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a partisan witch hunt," Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-Manhattan, said. "The
Republicans are after Cuomo because of Hillary, they're after him because he's a
Democrat, they're after him because his last name is Cuomo."
</P>
<P>
	   At the heart of the flap is the decision of Cuomo, an ally of the first
lady, to yank some $60 million in U.S. homeless funds from Giuliani. Cuomo said
he had to take control of the money because of a court decision saying the New
York City mayor withheld it improperly from Housing Works, a nonprofit group
that has tussled with Giuliani over his policies on the homeless and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans cried politics and rallied around Giuliani. Sen. Christopher
Bond, R-Mo., announced he would hold a hearing on the matter in February. Bond
denies politics is involved and says he simply wants a detailed explanation of
why Cuomo took control of the money.
</P>
<P>
	   He says his repeated written requests for information from HUD have been met
with reams of paper outlining every law Congress has written dealing with HUD, a
response he described as "woefully inadequate."
</P>
<P>
	   There is even talk in some Republican circles of calling Mrs. Clinton's
campaign manager, Bill de Blasio, to testify at the Senate hearing. De Blasio
had been Cuomo's head of HUD operations in New York before leaving to head Mrs.
Clinton's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "The New York Senate race has moved to Washington," lamented Rep. Charles
Rangel, the Harlem Democrat who is dean of New York's 31-member congressional
delegation.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond's spokesman, Dan Hubbard, would say only that no decision had been made
yet on who would be asked to participate in the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   On a recent trip to upstate New York where Cuomo shed his urban image and
donned camouflage gear to hunt pheasants with a 12-gauge shotgun, the housing
secretary brushed aside the storm brewing miles away in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is all Hillary Clinton politics.... It's about Democrats and
Republicans, about Clinton and Cuomo," he said. "It's the political silly
season."
</P>
<P>
	   On that trip upstate, Cuomo made it clear that he is interested in running
for governor. Cuomo is most often mentioned as front-runner for White House
chief of staff if his friend Al Gore wins the presidency, and conventional
wisdom has held that he would only seek the governor's post if Gore lost. But
Cuomo said on that trip that he might run for governor in 2002 no matter what
the outcome of the presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
	   That could pit him against state Comptroller H. Carl McCall in a Democratic
primary. McCall, the first black elected to statewide office in New York, is
already lining up support, prompting some Cuomo supporters to urge Democrats to
hold off making commitments in the race, still some two years away.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show Cuomo making a respectable showing against Republican Gov. George
Pataki. One recent poll had him trailing Pataki 53 percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Some grumble that Cuomo's tenure as HUD secretary has all been in
preparation for a run for governor. Even Cuomo supporters say he has used the
everyday distribution of HUD money as a way to get himself in the news. In New
York, he has made frequent appearances doling out federal funds along the
economically depressed Erie Canal corridor.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Republicans became so upset by Cuomo's using HUD events for public
relations that last year they led a successful push in Congress to hand control
over $60 million in federal small cities money from Cuomo to Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats will almost certainly rally around Cuomo in Bond's hearings. Many
view HUD as the only federal agency devoted to serving the needs of the poor and
say that is the reason it has been subjected to GOP attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't fit into the Republican agenda," Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
	   But numerous congressional staffers said privately that Cuomo's relations
with New York's Democratic delegation can be frosty.
</P>
<P>
	   One example of the seeming ambivalence about Cuomo comes from Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y. While Schumer has said he is opposed to partisan hearings, he
also says that a closer look should be taken at federal decisions to seize
control from local governments.
</P>
<P>
	   But for Cuomo having the GOP klieg lights trained on him may not be all bad.
Nadler predicted the tactic would backfire against the Republicans and Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just gives him a platform to say why he doesn't trust Giuliani," Nadler
said. "I don't understand what the Republicans think they'll accomplish. I think
they end up looking foolish."

<HEADLINE> Vivendi, Vodafone Eye Internet Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PARIS (AP) -- French conglomerate Vivendi SA and Anglo-American
telecommunications giant Vodafone AirTouch PLC said Sunday that they will set up
a 50-50 multi-access European Internet portal and cooperate in mobile and fixed
line telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vivendi-Vodafone alliance is conditional on the success of Vodafone's
$170 billion hostile bid for Germany's Mannesmann, Vodafone Chief Executive
Officer Chris Gent said at a joint news conference with Vivendi Chairman
Jean-Marie Messier.
</P>
<P>
	   Messier said the venture, provisionally named MAP, for "multi-access
portal," will allow Vivendi's and Vodafone's 70 million pay-television, mobile
and fixed-line telecommunications customers access to content on the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the most compelling alliance of the Internet age in Europe and
beyond," Messier said, adding that the MAP venture is potentially worth tens of
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   Gent and Messier said they will also consider a stock exchange listing for
MAP.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is another important step in achieving our objective to become the
world's leading mobile multimedia operator," Gent said.
</P>
<P>
	   If Vodafone wins more than 50 percent control of Mannesmann, Gent said, it
will sell a 7.5 percent interest in French telecommunications company Cegetel to
Vivendi "at a fair price."
</P>
<P>
	   "We will thus put our equity holding (in Cegetel) in accordance with our
management rights," Messier said.
</P>
<P>
	   Vivendi has an indirect 44 percent stake in Cegetel, France's No. 2 mobile
phone operator; Mannesmann has a 15 percent share.
</P>
<P>
	   In Germany, a Mannesmann spokesman declined to comment on the
Vodafone-Vivendi link.
</P>
<P>
	   Vivendi and Vodafone will consider potential cooperation in fixed line
telecommunications through their existing operations in France, Germany and
Italy, Gent said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's pact is a blow for Mannesmann, which as late as Saturday was still
pushing for its own alliance with Vivendi on media and telecommunications
projects in Europe. Vivendi's board met Saturday to discuss a potential link
with Mannesmann, and Messier confirmed that Vivendi had considered a full merger
with the German company.
</P>
<P>
	   But Messier said he chose Vodafone instead because the British company
offers the best solutions for helping Vivendi save as much as three years in
bringing new Internet services to market.
</P>
<P>
	   Gent said later in a conference call with journalists that the deal
underpins the logic of Vodafone's bid for Mannesmann. The bid closes Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   "What it says is they (Vivendi) think we're going to win ... ," Gent said.
"Everyone was focusing on Mannesmann doing a deal with Vivendi, but I think they
liked our approach in terms of partnership."
</P>
<P>
	   Gent said he has not yet discussed the Vivendi deal with Mannesmann Chief
Executive Klaus Esser. He confirmed that Vodafone is prepared to make a "modest
increase" in the bid if Esser agrees to back Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
	   Messier said at the news conference that he is convinced Vodafone will
succeed in taking over Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
	   The alliance with Vodafone, he added, would not prevent Vivendi from bidding
for British mobile phone operator Orange, which Mannesmann took over last year,
helping spark Vodafone's hostile bid.
</P>
<P>
	   If it wins control of Mannesmann, Vodafone will spin off Orange to meet
competition concerns.

<HEADLINE> Bank Chief Satisfied With Euro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- Despite the euro hitting record lows against the dollar,
European Central Bank chief Wim Duisenberg said Sunday he is satisfied with the
performance of Europe's single currency because it has delivered stable prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our main purpose is to deliver a climate of stable prices, and that is what
we have done, and what we have achieved," Duisenberg said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. television interview.
</P>
<P>
	   "That the exchange rate has fallen somewhat is of course of much less
significance now, for the euro area in total, than it was in the past for the
individual countries because foreign trade, imports or exports, only represents
about 16 to 17 percent of the euro area GDP," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro has fallen 14 percent against the dollar since it was adopted by 11
of the 15 member-nations of the European Union, including France and Germany, in
January last year.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the euro hit 97.62 cents, slumping to a record low for the second
straight day after stronger than expected economic growth was reported in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Duisenberg said that compared with 1997-98, the euro had only fallen 5 or 6
percent against the dollar and that was because Europe was emerging from
recession while U.S. growth continued at a "surprisingly fast pace."
</P>
<P>
	   "The divergence in economic development is already disappearing and it will
disappear totally, in our expectation. And then the euro will show its
strength," said Duisenberg. "We do believe, we honestly believe, that the euro
has a potential to increase its value."
</P>
<P>
	   French Finance Minister Christian Sautter said Saturday he hopes currency
markets will soon take notice of economic recovery in the 11 countries that have
switched to the euro. That performance "isn't perceived sufficiently," he told
executives and politicians gathered here.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sooner or later, it should return to a level that is compatible with the
strength of the euro zone," Sautter said.
</P>
<P>
	   Duisenberg said British membership of the euro was years away because of
differences between the British and continental European economies.
</P>
<P>
	   "I mean if ever the United Kingdom were to decide to join, you are talking
about a moment in time which is years from today," said Duisenberg.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he believed it would be in Britain's interests to adopt the euro,
"but it is up to the people of Britain to come to the same conclusion."
</P>
<P>
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party government says it will
decide in principle whether to adopt the euro soon after national elections
which must be held by 2002.

<HEADLINE> 'The Pill' Might Prevent Acne Too  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Demand for one brand of "the pill" is soaring, but not for
the reason you think.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of Johnson &AMP; Johnson's Ortho Tri-Cyclen have tripled in the last three
years -- making it by far the No. 1 brand -- because it is the only oral
contraceptive that can also be sold as an acne fighter.
</P>
<P>
	   While medical ethicists doubt the double-duty pill is encouraging more young
girls to have sex, one says it may help them provide a "smokescreen" to their
parents -- allowing them to claim they want the drug for their acne when their
real aim is protection from pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sex and lying have a long history of association," said Arthur Caplan,
director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   The trend thrills family planning advocates, who welcome anything that
drives more women to use birth control to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anything that promotes the pill in a positive light is good for all of us,"
said Katie Kralovetz, a nurse practitioner with Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
	   Family planning advocates for years have tried to promote the lesser-known
health benefits of the pill, such as reducing the risk of ovarian cancer and
lessening menstrual cramps. But none has drawn as much attention as the pill's
effect on acne.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's like getting two drugs in one," said Darla Brown, 28, of Houston,
whose been on the pill for two years. "And it has worked wonders on my skin."
</P>
<P>
	   About 15 million U.S. women currently use oral contraceptives, the most
popular form of reversible birth control.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration gave J&AMP;J the right to sell Ortho Tri-Cyclen
for acne in 1997 after studies found it helped clear the skin of more than 80
percent of women who took it. The studies showed the pill decreased hormone
levels that trigger acne.
</P>
<P>
	   Although health experts say all oral contraceptives probably help fight
acne, only Ortho Tri-Cyclen has FDA clearance to advertise the added benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   That labeling difference has helped Johnson &AMP; Johnson to control about 40
percent of the oral contraceptive market, up from 30 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of Ortho Tri-Cyclen have risen from 330,000 prescriptions per month in
January 1997 to 1.2 million last November, according to IMS Health, a market
data firm.
</P>
<P>
	   The brand has leapfrogged from fourth place to first while sales of rival
pills, including other J&AMP;J brands, have largely been flat since 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   J&AMP;J has exploited the pill's pimple-fighting ability with ads in leading
women's magazines showing close ups of gorgeous models, promoting Ortho
Tri-Cyclen as "beauty aid" for women 15 and over.
</P>
<P>
	   Ortho Tri-Cyclen now outsells its closest competitor -- American Home
Products' Triphasil -- by a more than 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
	   J&AMP;J said the pill is still primarily for contraception, though executives
acknowledge some doctors may prescribe it mainly for acne on women who don't
respond to ointments.
</P>
<P>
	   Just 1 percent of prescriptions for Ortho Tri-Cyclen come from
dermatologists, said J&AMP;J spokesman Mark Monseau.
</P>
<P>
	   Ashley Wesson, 21, a college student in central Texas said she asked her
doctor last month if she could try the pill to help fight her acne. She was not
looking for birth control.
</P>
<P>
	   "Already, I've noticed small differences in how quickly my face heals," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Baseball author now writes about political hardball  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Nick Acocella's passion is hardball, whether practiced
by Willie Mays or Christie Whitman.
<P>
	   An author of 13 baseball books, Acocella now reports on the New Jersey
governor and other politicians for readers of his weekly newsletter, Politifax.
He says baseball and New Jersey politics have much in common.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're the two best spectator sports in America," he says. "They are both
incomprehensible to the outsider. Did you ever try to explain baseball to a
European? They look at you like you're crazy. Try and explain New Jersey
politics to somebody."
</P>
<P>
	   Acocella, 56, knocks out his four-page newsletter each week in his home
office in Hoboken. It is transmitted to a mainframe computer in California,
which "blast-faxes" it to political connoisseurs in New Jersey and Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The newsletter is a weekly mix of news and analysis, humor and rumor.
</P>
<P>
	   Acocella chronicled the early 1999 trips to Texas by delegations of
Republican leaders to pledge their support for George W. Bush for president.
</P>
<P>
	   He wrote that Whitman's decision to abandon her Senate candidacy "gives
credence to the persistent rumors that it was her husband who thought a Senate
run was a great idea and that she was uncomfortable with it from the start."
</P>
<P>
	   He began by focusing on statewide politics but increasingly plucks nuggets
from towns and counties.
</P>
<P>
	   He recently wrote about Westfield Councilman Neil Sullivan missing an
opportunity to appear on the television show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"
because his political opponent would not waive his right to equal time on the
network.
</P>
<P>
	   Acocella was, in a way, born into politics. He entered the world at Margaret
Hague Maternity Hospital, the Jersey City health care center built by legendary
Democratic boss Frank Hague and named for his mother.
</P>
<P>
	   As a baseball fan growing up in West New York, N.J., Acocella rooted for the
New York Yankees but also admired Willie Mays, who played for his father's
favorite team, the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning in 1970, he wrote or co-wrote 13 books on baseball, including "The
Ball Clubs," a history of every Major League team, active and defunct. He wrote
travel pieces for Fodor's and restaurant reviews for airline magazines.
</P>
<P>
	   From 1982 to 1992, he worked as national director of operations for the News
Election Service, now the Voter News Service, a consortium of news outlets that
counts votes and declares winners on election nights.
</P>
<P>
	   He talked and talked about his desire to write about New Jersey politics.
Finally, "a friend of mine said to me, 'I'm tired of listening to this. Either
do it or shut up."'
</P>
<P>
	   The inaugural Politifax appeared on fax machines throughout the Garden State
two weeks before the 1997 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   "It started very slowly," Acocella says. "People were wondering, who is this
lunatic? And very, very slowly, as the number of sources grew, the stories got
better and more varied, and the subscriptions grew."
</P>
<P>
	   He won't say how many people pay the $219 annual subscription but says the
newsletter is meeting the goals he set for it.
</P>
<P>
	   Every Wednesday, Acocella's latest work emerges on fax machines in New
Jersey and Washington. Subscribers include New Jersey's two senators, nine of 13
House members, as well as lobbyists, political analysts and reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Copies also go to two other writers in the family: Acocella's ex-wife Joan,
a staff writer at the New Yorker, and son Bart, chief speech writer for U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
	   Politics is his current stock in trade, but his interest in that other brand
of hardball brought Acocella some celebrity over the holidays. He appeared as an
analyst and baseball historian in 12 episodes of ESPN's series on the greatest
athletes of the century.
</P>
<P>
	   He can't help but boast about the episode on Joe DiMaggio. It included
commentary by Acocella and snippets from DiMaggio's ex-wife, Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was in the same TV show as Marilyn Monroe," he raves. "I consider that
the greatest thing I have ever achieved."

<HEADLINE> New housing, job training for disabled included in Whitman budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Betsy Reed knows firsthand how difficult it is to
find jobs for disabled New Jerseyans who want and can perform them.
<P>
	   She also knows how important it is to help them retain those long-sought
jobs once they get them.
</P>
<P>
	   That's why Reed, an employment counselor for an Atlantic County-based agency
for the disabled, appreciates Gov. Christie Whitman's new budget proposal
appropriating $1.3 million for programs such as hers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's great. Any help they can get is so worthwhile," said Reed, who
helped one blind client land a restaurant job peeling carrots and potatoes.
"Seeing people get and keep a job, they feel much more independent."
</P>
<P>
	   Reed acts as a job coach, steering her disabled clients toward receptive
employers. Once a job is secured, she makes sure the match remains successful.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, the restaurant owner who hired her blind client wanted him to
punch a clock, but he was unable. A fellow employee volunteered to fill out the
man's time sheet, solving the problem, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes, employers have problems relating to people with disabilities,"
Reed said. "With me being there, they realize they're just like ordinary
people."
</P>
<P>
	   Employment programs help foster independence among disabled persons and
contribute to the larger public good, said Renee West, Reed's boss at the
Disability Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
	   "They become citizens like everyone else and pay taxes like everyone else,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In her first term, Whitman frustrated advocates for the disabled with her
initial reluctance to cut independent living waiting lists for the
developmentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
	   But some of those early critics were cheered by her announcement last week
that there is $72 million in combined state and federal funds for the disabled,
including the funds for the employment program, tucked into her proposed $21.3
billion budget.	   "The governor's new initiative to help New Jersey citizens
who have disabilities is a step in the right direction," said Lois Mattson,
director of the New Jersey Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association. "People who
have mental illness want what everyone wants: a good job and a nice, affordable
place to call home."
</P>
<P>
	   Other groups praising the governor included The Arc of New Jersey, which
represents developmentally disabled people, and the Association for Choices in
Community Supports and Employment Services.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the governor's proposals:
</P>
<P>
	   - $1.3 million for the employment initiative, to serve 500 people with
mental and physical disabilities.
</P>
<P>
	   - $750,000 for the "Ticket to Work" program, enabling disabled people to
work without losing their Medicaid health care coverage.

<HEADLINE> Sharpton seeks upstate support in Diallo case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Taking his crusade in the Amadou Diallo case
upstate, the Rev. Al Sharpton urged members of a black church to demand justice
in the police shooting of the West African immigrant.
<P>
	   "There will be those who will tell you in the next couple weeks that we are
here because we don't like police, that we are here to divide the races,"
Sharpton told the congregation at Mount Calvary Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
	   "This has nothing to do with police. ... We're fighting against evil and
wickedness in high places. To shoot an unarmed man is a wicked thing," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton's remarks came on the eve of jury selection for the murder trial of
the four white police officers who killed Diallo last year in the Bronx. An
appeals court moved the trial to the state capital, agreeing with the defense
that a wave of pretrial publicity and protests in New York City had made it
impossible for the officers to get a fair trial there.
</P>
<P>
	   Plainclothes officers Sean Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss,
28, and Richard Murphy, 27, were indicted on second-degree murder charges in
March after they fired 41 bullets at Diallo - a street vendor carrying only a
wallet and a pager - while searching a Bronx neighborhood for violent suspects.
Diallo was hit by 19 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers pleaded innocent to charges they demonstrated a "depraved
indifference to human life" by firing the barrage into the vestibule of Diallo's
apartment building. They have said through their attorneys they believed Diallo
was reaching for a gun, and rightfully responded with deadly force.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the change-of-venue ruling, Diallo's family, Sharpton and other civil
rights activists have vowed to keep a constant vigil outside Albany's county
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
	   The victim's parents did not attend the Sunday service. But Sharpton
received a warm reception at the small, wood-framed church. He and the pastor,
the Rev. Robert Dixon, asked churchgoers not to commit "the sin of silence" in
the Bronx case.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're supporting Rev. Sharpton and we're supporting the crusade," Dixon
said. "You can't do something in the Bronx and bring it to Albany and think
we're going to go to sleep."
</P>
<P>
	   In a sermon interrupted by applause and calls of "Amen," Sharpton described
Diallo as an innocent man who "was shot down in his own doorway. No gun, no
knife, no drugs - nothing. Just going home. They say it was a mistake. Forty-one
shots. ... That's what we're in Albany about."
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton also planned to meet with local politicians and activists later in
the day.
</P>
<P>
	   About 2,000 Albany residents have been summoned for jury duty in the Diallo
case - 20 times the usual number called for most murder trials in the county.
Officials said the larger pool was needed because many residents probably have
formed opinions about the case based on intense media coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   About 300 jury candidates are expected to show up at the courthouse on
Monday. Attorneys have estimated selecting 12 jurors and four alternatives will
take a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Testimony is expected to last three to five weeks. Justice Joseph Teresi has
ruled that once the jury is picked, the trial can be televised.

<HEADLINE> D.A. Pennebaker looks back at 'Don't Look Back'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - D.A. Pennebaker still remembers the look on young Bob
Dylan's face. The 26-year-old singer was watching himself in Pennebaker's
soon-to-be released documentary, "Don't Look Back."
<P>
	   Dylan appeared ... well, stunned is a good word.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the first time he saw it, he went into shock," Pennebaker recalls,
laughing slightly. "He had no idea that one camera sitting on one guy's shoulder
could make him feel so naked."
</P>
<P>
	   The chastened Dylan returned a night later, watched it again, then gave his
OK to Pennebaker's film. Now, three decades later, the director's chronicle of
Dylan's three-week 1965 British tour returns this month in an enhanced DVD
version released by New Video.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've always admired Dylan for letting (the film) go the way it was,"
Pennebaker says. "That was something a lot of lesser talents - and a lot of
greater talents - would have had trouble doing."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker's critically-acclaimed documentary, released in 1967, stands the
test of time - although its creator once felt the 96-minute film would never see
a theatrical release.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the kindness of several West Coast pornographic theaters that changed
that, he says - in particular, The Presidio in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   "This group of Western theaters was showing porno, and they wanted to
upgrade their act," the self-deprecating Pennebaker recalls. "It was perfect for
me, because my movie looked like porno, but it's not."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker, who earned an Academy Award nomination for his look at the
Clinton presidential campaign in "The War Room," is quick to poke fun at
himself. Talking about his acclaimed black and white Dylan piece, he describes
it as "a very ratty-looking film."
</P>
<P>
	   Critics disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "A portrait of the young Dylan tearing the pop world apart," a San Francisco
Examiner reviewer enthused in a typical rave.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker, an Illinois native, earned a degree in mechanical engineering at
Yale before going into filmmaking. Using his college skills, Pennebaker
developed a portable camera that allowed filmmakers full access - one of the
keys to the "cinema verite" style that he helped define.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Pennebaker, the movie wasn't his idea, and it wasn't Dylan's
either. The credit belongs to Dylan's late manager, Albert Grossman.
</P>
<P>
	   "I probably couldn't have convinced Dylan myself," Pennebaker says. "He was
mercurial. It would be hard to convince him of anything for three hours in a
row. But Albert Grossman asked me if I wanted to do a film with one of his
clients."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker knew little about his subject, who wore his hair long, his
sunglasses dark and his attitude on his sleeve: "I didn't have much of a take on
him. I knew who he was, probably heard a couple of his songs. To hear him sing
the first time, he wasn't Rudy Vallee. I was less than swept away."
</P>
<P>
	   That soon changed.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker, watching through his lens, saw "an amazing prodigy. Very smart
in an untutored way. He created his own persona right before your eyes. ... He
was a compendium of things it takes professors years to figure out - startlingly
naive, but smart."
</P>
<P>
	   The 74-year-old Pennebaker acknowledges that he had 40 to 50 extra hours of
footage from the Dylan sessions, and that the idea of recutting his movie
flashed through his brain.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought about it," he says. "I thought, 'This is a chance to make a new
film.' Then I thought, 'Why a new film? What would that get us?' ... It would be
interesting to people who'll take any Dylan you can give them, but not to a
major audience."
</P>
<P>
	   The extra footage, along with outtakes and originals of all Pennebaker's
work such as "Monterey Pop" and "The War Room," now sits in the archives of the
Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
	   The film's title appears in a line from Dylan's song "She Belongs to Me":
"She's an artist, she don't look back."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Pennebaker says the credit for his title actually goes to Negro Leagues
star and Hall of Famer Satchel Paige, who once advised, "Don't look back. It
might be gaining on you."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker offers his own tip on staying a step or two ahead of the
audience: "The one barometer I believe in is boredom. The minute people start to
lose interest, that's it."
</P>
<P>
	   That explains the tight running time of "Don't Look Back, barely an hour and
half.
</P>
<P>
	   The DVD comes with a bonus - five never before released Dylan audio
performances and a previously unreleased version of the landmark cue-card
flipping bit for "Subterranean Homesick Blues."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker's grainy video for the Dylan tune turned out to be about 20 years
ahead of its time, presaging MTV and VH1. So when he flips past the video music
channels today ...
</P>
<P>
	   "I think, 'Without me, they'd be bankrupt,"' he says, laughing loudly. "I'm
sure the check is in the mail."

<HEADLINE> For Andrew Cuomo, a tough Congressional session awaits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Andrew Cuomo has been in the crosshairs before.
<P>
	   With his New York liberal roots, his combative style and his penchant for
publicity, the federal housing secretary has long been a lightning rod for the
GOP. He's even managed to rub some of his fellow Democrats the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
	   Now Cuomo's in the fray again, this time in the middle of a fierce partisan
battle that almost everyone agrees has as much to do with New York's high-stakes
U.S. Senate race between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani as it does
with housing policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Republicans will grill Cuomo's Department of Housing and Urban
Development at a hearing next month. House hearings could follow.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican onslaught also comes as Cuomo, the eldest son of former Gov.
Mario Cuomo, makes his loudest rumblings yet that he's interested in running for
his father's old job.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a partisan witch hunt," Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-Manhattan, said. "The
Republicans are after Cuomo because of Hillary, they're after him because he's a
Democrat, they're after him because his last name is Cuomo."
</P>
<P>
	   At the heart of the flap is the decision of Cuomo, an ally of the first
lady, to yank some $60 million in U.S. homeless funds from Giuliani. Cuomo said
he had to take control of the money because of a court decision saying the New
York City mayor withheld it improperly from Housing Works, a nonprofit group
that has tussled with Giuliani over his policies on the homeless and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans cried politics and rallied around Giuliani. Sen. Christopher
Bond, R-Mo., announced he would hold a hearing on the matter in February. Bond
denies politics is involved and says he simply wants a detailed explanation of
why Cuomo took control of the money.
</P>
<P>
	   He says his repeated written requests for information from HUD have been met
with reams of paper outlining every law Congress has written dealing with HUD, a
response he described as "woefully inadequate."
</P>
<P>
	   There is even talk in some Republican circles of calling Mrs. Clinton's
campaign manager, Bill de Blasio, to testify at the Senate hearing. De Blasio
had been Cuomo's head of HUD operations in New York before leaving to head Mrs.
Clinton's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "The New York Senate race has moved to Washington," lamented Rep. Charles
Rangel, the Harlem Democrat who is dean of New York's 31-member congressional
delegation.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond's spokesman, Dan Hubbard, would say only that no decision had been made
yet on who would be asked to participate in the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   On a recent trip to upstate New York where Cuomo shed his urban image and
donned camouflage gear to hunt pheasants with a 12-gauge shotgun, the housing
secretary brushed aside the storm brewing miles away in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is all Hillary Clinton politics.... It's about Democrats and
Republicans, about Clinton and Cuomo," he said. "It's the political silly
season."
</P>
<P>
	   On that trip upstate, Cuomo made it clear that he is interested in running
for governor. Cuomo is most often mentioned as front-runner for White House
chief of staff if his friend Al Gore wins the presidency, and conventional
wisdom has held that he would only seek the governor's post if Gore lost. But
Cuomo said on that trip that he might run for governor in 2002 no matter what
the outcome of the presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
	   That could pit him against state Comptroller H. Carl McCall in a Democratic
primary. McCall, the first black elected to statewide office in New York, is
already lining up support, prompting some Cuomo supporters to urge Democrats to
hold off making commitments in the race, still some two years away.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show Cuomo making a respectable showing against Republican Gov. George
Pataki. One recent poll had him trailing Pataki 53 percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Some grumble that Cuomo's tenure as HUD secretary has all been in
preparation for a run for governor. Even Cuomo supporters say he has used the
everyday distribution of HUD money as a way to get himself in the news. In New
York, he has made frequent appearances doling out federal funds along the
economically depressed Erie Canal corridor.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Republicans became so upset by Cuomo's using HUD events for public
relations that last year they led a successful push in Congress to hand control
over $60 million in federal small cities money from Cuomo to Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats will almost certainly rally around Cuomo in Bond's hearings. Many
view HUD as the only federal agency devoted to serving the needs of the poor and
say that is the reason it has been subjected to GOP attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't fit into the Republican agenda," Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
	   But numerous congressional staffers said privately that Cuomo's relations
with New York's Democratic delegation can be frosty.
</P>
<P>
	   One example of the seeming ambivalence about Cuomo comes from Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y. While Schumer has said he is opposed to partisan hearings, he
also says that a closer look should be taken at federal decisions to seize
control from local governments.
</P>
<P>
	   But for Cuomo having the GOP klieg lights trained on him may not be all bad.
Nadler predicted the tactic would backfire against the Republicans and Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just gives him a platform to say why he doesn't trust Giuliani," Nadler
said. "I don't understand what the Republicans think they'll accomplish. I think
they end up looking foolish."

<HEADLINE> Pyramid: Slow cleanup causes delay in expansion of Carousel Center  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Remember that planned expansion of Carousel
Center? It's still on but is being plagued by slow cleanup efforts.
<P>
	   The $200 million project, which will double the size of the mall to just
over 2 million square feet, likely won't begin before next year because of
problems with contaminated soil, according to Bruce Kenan of The Pyramid Cos.,
which own Carousel Center and 23 other malls in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   "The biggest issue out there right now is still the property cleanup," Kenan
said of Oil City, an 800-acre area that has been home to fuel storage tanks for
nearly a century. "The oil companies are approaching their cleanup
responsibilities with varying degrees of enthusiasm. None of them are done as of
now. One company has a long way to go."
</P>
<P>
	   Kenan said Pyramid is "frustrated" with the state Department of
Environmental Conservation, which is overseeing the cleanup of Oil City, site of
Carousel Center's planned expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   "They aren't approaching it aggressively," Kenan told the Syracuse Herald
American in Sunday's editions. "I don't want to get into a fight with them in
the newspaper, but this strikes me as peculiar. They have the regulatory weapons
at their disposal, much more so than us. I know they are getting somewhere with
the cleanup, but it's sort of like a rocking chair. There's a lot of feeling of
motion without going anywhere."
</P>
<P>
	   Citgo, Mobil and Sunoco are the oil companies involved in decontaminating
the 66 acres where the mall would be extended. Citgo has signed an agreement and
started to clean its property. Mobil and Sunoco are expected to sign cleanup
deals by February.
</P>
<P>
	   DEC Regional Director Ken Lynch said the three companies are cooperating
with the state and the cleanup is moving forward. He said it was unfair to blame
the state for Pyramid's delays.
</P>
<P>
	   "It really involves Pyramid coming to an agreement with the oil companies on
how the mall's construction can begin at the same time remediation activities
move ahead," Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
	   State environmental officials are willing to permit the mall construction
and cleanup work to continue simultaneously, Lynch said. But he said the state
has yet to see a proposal from Pyramid or the oil companies that would allow
such work to move forward.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunoco owns the largest and most contaminated property, covering 25 acres.
Even though the company has no formal cleanup agreement with the state, it has
spent more than $4.5 million to get a head start on the job, company spokesman
Jerry Davis said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have taken this responsibility very seriously, and we want to cooperate
and do the right thing," Davis said. "But it's in the best interests of everyone
that it be done right. From our part, there is no intent to delay."
</P>
<P>
	   Kenan said it is unlikely Pyramid will begin construction this year "unless
something changes."
</P>
<P>
	   Pyramid wants to add 1 million square feet to the 1.1 million-square-foot
Carousel Center, located at the southern end of Onondaga Lake. The expansion,
announced in 1997, includes 150 stores and restaurants, entertainment venues, an
aquarium, a hotel and first-class office space.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, plans by Pyramid to sell its 24 malls, which are scattered
throughout the Northeast, are off. Robert Congel, founding partner of the
Syracuse-based company, took it off the real estate market after no serious
buyers appeared.
</P>
<P>
	   "The sale is not something we are actively pursuing at this time," said
Kenan, also a partner in the business. "Talk about your windows of opportunity.
Things come and go. We went from a time where the sale had real potential to a
time, at least for now, where it doesn't."
</P>
<P>
	   Congel announced in April 1998 that he was trying to sell Pyramid, but the
frenzied buying and merging in the mall real estate market, which began in 1997,
already had begun to slow.

<HEADLINE> Rosie O'Donnell Stops 'Rosie Radio'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- This may be the Rose City, but handlers for afternoon
talk-show host Rosie O'Donnell say she has dibs on her name.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner Brothers and Telepictures, producer and distributor of O'Donnell's
show, claim that KRSK-FM is using her famous -- and trademarked -- first name
without her permission when the radio station refers to itself as "Rosie 105."
</P>
<P>
	   The companies have filed suit in federal court, demanding that Entercom, the
Pennsylvania-based firm that owns KRSK, quit using the "Rosie" nickname.
</P>
<P>
	   Station executives say the name honors Portland, which is known as the Rose
City.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was no intention to be associated with Rosie O'Donnell," said
Entercom's lawyer, Ramsey Alsalam. "We're not using 'Rosie' to create confusion
among our listeners."
</P>
<P>
	   O'Donnell's lawyers say the station is capitalizing on O'Donnell's fame.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is virtually certain that consumers of Rosie O'Donnell's television show
will be drawn to defendants' Rosie radio station in the mistaken belief that
defendants' Rosie broadcast entertainment emanates from the same source as
plaintiff's Rosie broadcast," the suit states.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Lawmakers Charge for Funeral  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Legislators billed the state of Florida nearly
$20,000 for the cost of attending the funeral of Gov. Lawton Chiles in 1998, The
Florida Times-Union reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty-three legislators spent up to three days traveling to Tallahassee for
the Democratic governor's funeral, billing the state for hotel stays, meals and
rental cars, the newspaper said, citing public records.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That would strike many constituents as ... perhaps not a good use of their
dollars,'' said Pete Sepp, spokesman for the Washington-based National Taxpayers
Union.
</P>
<P>
	   But some legislators who attended the funeral were upset anyone would
question the expense.
</P>
<P>
	   Edie Ousley, spokeswoman for Republican Senate President Toni Jennings,
called the issue ``nitpicking.'' She said legislators were compelled to attend
the governor's funeral on behalf of constituents.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers are routinely reimbursed for expenses deemed ``official
business.''
</P>
<P>
	   Chiles died of heart disease on Dec. 12, 1998.

	   "There will be those who will tell you in the next couple weeks that we are
here because we don't like police, that we are here to divide the races,"
Sharpton told the congregation at Mount Calvary Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
	   "This has nothing to do with police. ... We're fighting against evil and
wickedness in high places. To shoot an unarmed man is a wicked thing," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton's remarks came on the eve of jury selection for the murder trial of
the four white police officers who killed Diallo, a West African immigrant,
nearly a year ago. An appeals court moved the trial to the state capital,
agreeing with the defense that a wave of pretrial publicity and protests in New
York City had made it impossible for the officers to get a fair trial there.
</P>
<P>
	   Plainclothes officers Sean Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss,
28, and Richard Murphy, 27, were indicted on second-degree murder charges in
March after they fired 41 bullets at Diallo - a street vendor carrying only a
wallet and a pager - while searching a Bronx neighborhood for violent suspects.
Diallo was hit by 19 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers pleaded innocent to charges they demonstrated a "depraved
indifference to human life" by firing the barrage into the vestibule of Diallo's
apartment building. They have said through their attorneys they believed Diallo
was reaching for a gun, and rightfully responded with deadly force.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the change-of-venue ruling, Diallo's family, Sharpton and other civil
rights activists have vowed to keep a constant vigil outside Albany's county
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
	   The victim's parents did not attend the Sunday service. But Sharpton
received a warm reception at the small, wood-framed church. He and the pastor,
the Rev. Robert Dixon, asked churchgoers not to commit "the sin of silence" in
the Bronx case.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're supporting Rev. Sharpton and we're supporting the crusade," Dixon
said. "You can't do something in the Bronx and bring it to Albany and think
we're going to go to sleep."
</P>
<P>
	   In a sermon interrupted by applause and calls of "Amen," Sharpton described
Diallo as an innocent man who "was shot down in his own doorway. No gun, no
knife, no drugs - nothing. Just going home. They say it was a mistake. Forty-one
shots. ... That's what we're in Albany about."
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton later met behind closed doors with city officials, assuring them
any protests would be peaceful. Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings called the session
"cordial," adding, "We don't expect any difficulties because people are
communicating."
</P>
<P>
	   About 2,000 Albany residents have been summoned for jury duty in the Diallo
case - 20 times the usual number called for most murder trials in the county.
Officials said the larger pool was needed because many residents probably have
formed opinions about the case based on intense media coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials expect about 300 jury candidates to show up at the courthouse on
Monday. Attorneys have estimated selecting 12 jurors and four alternatives will
take a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Testimony should last another three to five weeks. Justice Joseph Teresi has
ruled that once the jury is picked, the trial can be televised.

<HEADLINE> Air Supply Cut in Blimp Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) -- Two workers killed inside an experimental
blimp at an airport hangar apparently suffocated after ordering an air pump shut
off, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Levon Samamyam, 35, of Burbank, and Marina Pasternak, 32, of Los Angeles,
were pronounced dead Thursday after being pulled unconscious from the blimp.
</P>
<P>
	   The two were patching punctures inside the blimp when they ordered other
crew members to shut off an air pump. They wanted to partially collapse an inner
balloon so they could reach a hole, according to the San Bernardino Fire
Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Helium that had gathered at the top of the balloon apparently displaced
remaining oxygen, authorities said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Report: Priests Dying of AIDS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Roman Catholic priests in the United States are
dying from AIDS-related illnesses at a rate four times higher than the general
population and the cause is often concealed on their death certificates, The
Kansas City Star reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first of a three-part series, the newspaper said death certificates
and interviews with experts indicated several hundred priests have died of
AIDS-related illnesses since the mid-1980s and hundreds more are living with
HIV, the virus that causes the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think this speaks to a failure on the part of the church,'' said
Auxiliary Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of the Archdiocese of Detroit. ``Gay priests
and heterosexual priests didn't know how to handle their sexuality, their sexual
drive. And so they would handle it in ways that were not healthy.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Star received 801 responses to questionnaires that were sent last fall
to 3,000 of the 46,000 priests in the United States. The margin of error of the
survey was 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Six of 10 priests responding said they knew of at least one priest who had
died of an AIDS-related illness, and one-third knew a priest living with AIDS.
Three-fourths said the church needed to provide more education to seminarians on
sexual issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How to be celibate and to be gay at the same time, and how to be celibate
and heterosexual at the same time, that's what we were never really taught how
to do. And that was a major failing,'' Gumbleton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about their sexual orientation, 75 percent said they were
heterosexual, 15 percent said they were homosexual, and 5 percent said they were
bisexual.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. John Keenan, who runs Trinity House, an outpatient clinic in
Chicago for priests, said he believes most priests with AIDS contracted the
disease through same-sex relations. He said he treated one priest who had
infected eight other priests.
</P>
<P>
	   The Star said precise numbers of priests who have died of AIDS or become
infected with HIV is unknown, partly because many suffer in solitude. When
priests tell their superiors, the cases generally are handled quietly.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper cited the case of Bishop Emerson Moore, who left the
Archdiocese of New York in 1995 and went to Minnesota, where he died in a
hospice of an AIDS-related illness. His death certificate attributed the death
to ``unknown natural causes'' and listed his occupation as ``laborer'' in the
manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
	   After an AIDS activist filed a complaint, officials changed the cause of
death to ``HIV-related illness,'' the Star said, but the occupation was not
corrected.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said the death rate among priests from AIDS appears to be at
least four times that of the rate for the general U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
	   Some priests and behavioral experts believe the church has scared priests
into silence by treating homosexual acts as an abomination and the breaking of
celibacy vows as shameful, the Star said.
</P>
<P>
	   Catholic cardinals in the United States and high-ranking church officials in
the Vatican declined requests to discuss the newspaper's findings, The Star
reported. The Vatican referred questions to local bishops.
</P>
<P>
	   Bishop Raymond Boland of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph said the AIDS
deaths show that priests are human.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Much as we would regret it, it shows that human nature is human nature,''
he said. ``And all of us are heirs to all of the misfortunes that can be foisted
upon the human race.''

<HEADLINE> Albany charter school students to be vanguard on Regents test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The fourth-grade students at the New Covenant
Charter School should be used to being first by now.
<P>
	   After all, for the rest of their lives they will be able to brag that they
were part of the first generation of charter school students in New York,
students whose schools work independently of the state Education Department yet
still get full public funding.
</P>
<P>
	   They are also as yet the only set of fourth graders in the charter school
system, with the state's other two charter schools only serving kindergartners
through third graders in their first year.
</P>
<P>
	   With that distinction comes a price: the New Covenant fourth graders will
also be the first charter school students to take the state's challenging new
English Language Art exam. The exam will be given to fourth graders statewide
starting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The question now is: Will the New Covenant students' test scores be high
enough to fulfill politicians' promises that charter schools are an acceptable
alternative to public schools?
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters say that trying to compare the New Covenant School's first-year
scores with public school test results is unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is going to take time for a new school to develop the skill and
abilities to dramatically change someone's performance," Gov. George Pataki
said. "I don't think you can look at an entire issue and come to a conclusion
based on one grade being tested at one school. ... I think you have to look at
it in a broader basis over a longer period of time."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki was instrumental in pushing a charter school bill through the state
Legislature in December 1998, saying the independent schools would give parents
"the freedom to choose where their child can get the best possible education
within the public system."
</P>
<P>
	   "We think we'll fare decently," said Aaron Dare, founder of New Covenant.
"But I don't think that after five months in existence that we can be expected
to do better than everyone else."
</P>
<P>
	   Albany School Superintendent Lonnie Palmer also refused to guess whether his
fourth-graders would do better than the ones who left to attend New Covenant. He
has a different reason, however.
</P>
<P>
	   Since New Covenant opened with 466 students, 50 of its students, including
seven special education students, have come back to the public schools. While
all of Palmer's elementary schools have a 10 percent special education
population, New Covenant has a 9 percent special ed population now, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ones that don't go to New Covenant come back to the public schools, he
said. "It looks like to me they're picking the ones that will do well," Palmer
said.
</P>
<P>
	   A lot rides on these exams.
</P>
<P>
	   Charter schools are taxpayer-funded but operate with an independent charter,
or license. The schools, some of which are run by for-profit companies, are
virtually exempt from all state and local rules not dealing with student health,
safety or civil rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Each school's charter lasts only five years before having to be renewed.
</P>
<P>
	   With the charter schools using different teaching methods, having fewer
students and using a different funding structure than public schools, there are
few ways to compare the quality of the education children are getting at
charters vs. public schools except standards like the fourth-grade English test.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the second year that the English Language Arts exams are being
administered as part of the state Board of Regents' more stringent academic
requirements statewide. The Regents started the fourth-grade tests last year to
ensure youngsters will be on track to pass a battery of Regents Exams in order
to graduate from high school.
</P>
<P>
	   The first-year test results will be used as a baseline for New Covenant to
help find out how much its students are learning from year to year, Dare said.
"We've got to look at it as not a sprint but a marathon," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, 52 percent of the fourth graders in public schools who took the
test failed to meet the minimum standards. Private schools didn't do much
better, with 47 percent of the students falling into the bottom categories of
"serious academic deficiencies" or "need extra help to meet the standards."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to a difficult test, students at New Covenant have some
distractions to get past.
</P>
<P>
	   They continue to attend class in portable structures instead of a permanent
building. The opening of the school was delayed after Hurricane Floyd washed out
construction work on the school's temporary facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, New Covenant parents complained to the school's trustees about
shortcomings at the school and Advantage Schools Inc., the school's management
partner, promised to fix the problems within two months.
</P>
<P>
	   A permanent principal, Glyn Johnson, was just hired at the beginning of
January. Johnson declined to say how his students would do on the English test,
saying he had not been at the school long enough to make a determination.

<HEADLINE> Advocates call for more focus on guard-inmate sex complaints  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A move to ban male guards from female living
quarters in the Westchester County Jail is drawing mixed responses from prison
and jail advocates.
<P>
	   It is also rekindling the debate on the prevalence of complaints about
female inmates being sexually abused by male guards in the state's correctional
facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they made the right decision. Other counties should follow suit,"
said Mishi Faruqee, director of the Women in Prison Project for the state
Correctional Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Faruqee said she's not advocating a complete ban of male guards in female
prisons, but rather wants guards of the same gender working in areas where
inmates have an expectation of some privacy, like shower rooms and sleeping
areas.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jamie Fellner, an associate counsel for the advocacy group Human Rights
Watch, said assigning jobs on the basis of gender would not be the solution. It
instead raises employment discrimination concerns and fails to address problems
of abuse that are not gender specific, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fundamental question is whether the officials train guards to have
proper behavior, ensure proper behavior and hold guards accountable in offense,"
Fellner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Fellner and Faruqee agree that female inmates are often too fearful and
worried about possible retaliation to report sexual misconduct by guards.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a lot of likelihood that they can be punished and ostracized,"
Faruqee said. Prison and jail officials, Fellner added, "often don't pay any
attention or take it seriously."
</P>
<P>
	   James Flateau, spokesman for the state Department of Correctional Services,
called such claims "irresponsible."
</P>
<P>
	   "We never felt that it was a major problem, but we wanted the authority to
act against the few who are offenders," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, a department-backed bill became law, making sexual contact between
inmates and guards in the state statutory rape, a felony. Even if consensual,
such sexual contact is a crime because the inmate's subservient position behind
bars makes consent impossible, sponsors of the bill argued.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Flateau, a dozen state prison guards have been charged in
connection with sexual offenses since 1996 under the law. Nine were convicted,
two were dismissed and one case is pending, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our policies are based upon a lack of any sexual contact between employees
and inmates - male or female," Flateau said. When such incidents occur, the
department seeks the dismissal of the guards involved and refers them for
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Steinhardt, a spokesman at the Commission of Corrections, a watchdog
agency over state prisons and local jails, said that when the commission
receives inmate complaints of sexual misconduct by guards in local jails, the
cases are turned over to the local district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, four male Westchester County Jail guards were arrested following
sexual offense complaints from female inmates. The guards - Carlos Aldarondo,
Javier Corona, Michael Downey and Robert Escalera - were accused of crimes
ranging from rape to making demands that inmates strip.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident prompted County Executive Andrew Spano to ban male officers
from 10 posts inside the women's living quarters in the jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Goodstein, who represents the Westchester County Correction Officer
Benevolent Association, said the union will file a lawsuit to block the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "What you're dealing with here is guilt by association," Goodstein said.
"They're accusing that every male is unfit to be posted there and that's
ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
	   Spano spokesman Terence Kelly countered that "we believe we're on solid
ground" in removing the male guards from the female inmates' living quarters.
Observing prisoners' right to privacy has been recognized as an acceptable
exception to following federal laws which prohibit discrimination based on
gender, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In state prisons, pat frisks can be handled by guards of both sexes against
inmates of either sex. Strip searches must be conducted by guards of the same
sex as the inmates. The only exception applies to Muslim inmates, who by court
order must be pat-frisked only by guards of the same gender because of religious
tenets.
</P>
<P>
	   Faruqee said that even pat-frisks should be a performed by same-sex
officers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's intrusive and emotionally upsetting to have a male officer pat down
all your private parts," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Flateau said the department tried to change that system several years ago
for some jobs in the female correctional facility in Albion, near Buffalo. For a
while it employed only female guards for certain jobs, like conducting pat
frisks. But the plan backfired when a female guard assigned to the position sued
because she was being pulled from another post she had bid for. She won the
lawsuit, Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   Job assignments for correction officers are based on a bid-by-seniority
system, where employees with the most years of service get first choice at the
post they want, Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a male wants a job working in a female facility and has more seniority,
that's the person who gets the job," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the main factors against having only female guards in female prisons
is the guards themselves. Flateau said while most male guards want to work in a
facility closest to home, about 80 percent of the female correction officers
prefer not to work in female facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   "For whatever reason, they prefer not to work there," Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   Faruqee said the state should offer incentives and benefits to encourage
female guards to stay in facilities housing female inmates. The state should
also try harder to hire more female guards, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state prison system currently houses 71,700 inmates - about 3,500 are
women. Flateau argued that the gender breakdown is about proportional to the
guard population. There are about 20,300 guards working in the facilities and 9
percent, or 1,800, are female.

<P>
	   MERRIMACK, N.H. (AP) -- From a meeting room near his office, Fred Henning
can gaze out at a stand of trees in the New Hampshire winter. Turn around, and
there's a high tech Fidelity Investments trading floor, where $275 billion in
assets is managed daily.
</P>
<P>
	   ``George W. (Bush) was on the trading floor,'' says Henning, who oversees
the company's fixed income division. ``Bill Bradley was on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
	   Once, these presidential hopefuls might have come to the first primary state
and stood outside factory gates when the shifts changed, greeting workers who
had jobs and pledging to help those who had lost them.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, with New Hampshire rebounding strongly from the recession, they're as
likely to visit Fidelity. Or Silknet Software, Al Gore did, in an old, brick
mill building along the Merrimack River in Manchester. Or a start-up company
along what the locals call the ``E-coast,'' helping fill up the old Pease Air
Force Base that closed after the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are now per capita the highest employer of high tech workers in the
country,'' says Stuart Arnett, director of the state Division of Economic
Development.
</P>
<P>
	   The last recession a decade ago was severe, a national downturn accompanied
by a statewide banking crisis and collapse in real estate prices. But
unemployment, once over 7 percent, was 2.6 percent last spring. The economy is
diversified, and the state is attracting young, well-educated residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Manufacturing jobs in traditional industries such as textiles, apparel and
paper products have declined steeply in recent years, accompanied by a rise in
production of items such as software, medical components and circuit boards.
</P>
<P>
	   The political impact of these changes has yet to play out in a state with
its outsized influence in the selection of a president, although some shifts are
obvious.
</P>
<P>
	   The recovery has allowed Vice President Al Gore to frame his appeal. ``You
remember what it was like in New Hampshire in the Reagan-Bush years, and you
remember the change,'' he told one audience recently.
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan's message of economic nationalism, which propelled him to a
second-place finish in 1992 and a victory in the 1996 GOP primary, no longer
seems potent in a state that sent $2 billion in goods overseas last year. ``We
export electronics, electrical instruments, very high-value added products,''
says Brian Gottlob, who studies the economy for the Business and Industry
Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Because economic recovery has been fueled by diversification, political
``pandering won't get you very far ... with regard to, say, protectionism or
agricultural subsidies, says Rep. John Sununu, one of the state's two GOP
congressmen.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time, registered independents -- they're called undeclareds in
New Hampshire -- outnumber Republicans and Democrats alike.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Independents wait right till the very end to make up their mind,'' says
Bill Gardner, the secretary of state. He adds, ``the big question is whether
they vote at all.''
</P>
<P>
	   They number just under 275,000, although Republican and Democratic
strategists agree that only about 10 percent to 20 percent of them are true
independents, and therefore susceptible to an appeal from candidates in both
parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., hopes to capture enough of them to win the
Republican primary. ``When McCain talks about reform, it's essentially these
newly arrived independent voters he's talking to,'' says campaign aide Dan
Schnur.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley hopes for the same thing on the Democratic side -- thus the unusual
December appearance with McCain at which the two men underscored their support
for an overhaul of the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Bell is one of these undeclareds and late-deciding voters. He served
six years in the Marines, then came home to New Hampshire and put himself
through school with jobs at McDonald's and elsewhere. Now, at Fidelity, he helps
service ``premium accounts,'' $500,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
	   Politically, he likes McCain, but after listening to rival Gary Bauer's
conservative appeal recently, says ``I haven't made up my mind yet.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer was the last presidential hopeful to visit Fidelity's campus when he
stopped by last Friday. Bush, Bradley, Steve Forbes and campaign dropouts Sen.
Orrin Hatch, Elizabeth Dole and Rep. John Kasich all had made the trip.
</P>
<P>
	   Fidelity, which occupied the property in 1996, has grown from 300 employees
to 3,000 on site and is one of eight regional centers. The global voice and data
network for all Fidelity companies also is located here, along with an Internet
operations center.

<HEADLINE> Exchange Dispute in Asia Continues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SINGAPORE (AP) -- The Singapore Exchange will meet its Malaysian counterpart
on Monday to discuss a long-running dispute over frozen Malaysian shares worth
more than $3 billion, Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on
government-controlled television Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The shares, which are mostly held by about 170,000 Singapore-based investors
on Singapore's Central Limit Order Book, were thrown into limbo when Malaysia
banned external trading of its stocks in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Several Malaysian companies have attempted to resolve the dispute by
proposing buyout schemes, none of which have been wholeheartedly accepted by the
mostly Singaporean investors.
</P>
<P>
	   It will be the first time the two institutions have met since September
1998, when an agreement was signed between Kuala Lumpur's Securities Clearing
Automated Network Services and the Singapore Exchange's Central Depository,
which were charged with settling the issue, Channel News Asia reported.

<HEADLINE> 'Eye of Beholder' Sees No. 1  </HEADLINE>

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- "Eye of the Beholder" opened atop the box office, but
competition from the Super Bowl, icy weather across much of the country and a
lack of attention-grabbing premieres made for a lackluster weekend, according to
industry estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Eye of the Beholder," a thriller starring Ashley Judd, had $6.2 million in
ticket sales. The only other opening in wide release, the Bette Midler film
"Isn't She Great," failed to crack the top 10.
</P>
<P>
	   The comedy "Next Friday" and the Denzel Washington drama "The Hurricane"
tied for second place with $6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Final figures were to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   For the second weekend in a row, none of the top 10 films made at least $10
million during the three-day period. That last happened in October 1998, said
Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Inc., a box office tracking
firm in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been a tough couple of weekends," Dergarabedian said. "For a top film
to do $6.2 million shows you what kind of state the box office is in at this
moment."
</P>
<P>
	   Super Bowl weekend is traditionally tough for the film industry, and stormy
weather across the country made it particularly harsh, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "People are going to be spending more time shoveling snow than they are
going to the theater," said Robert Bucksbaum of Reel Source Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the low overall numbers, "Eye of the Beholder" was a success for
Destination Films. The movie is only the second from the fledgling studio, which
also released "Bats" last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   It also confirms the rising star power of Judd. About 60 percent of "Eye of
the Beholder's" audience went to the film specifically to see the actress, star
of the past thrillers "Double Jeopardy" and "Kiss the Girls," Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
	   The weekend was a disappointment for "Isn't She Great." The biography of
"Valley of the Dolls" author Jacqueline Susann made an estimated $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Family films continued their impressive run.
</P>
<P>
	   "Stuart Little" and "Toy Story 2" finished in the top 10 and have
accumulated the highest grosses of any movie currently in general release.
"Stuart Little" has taken in $123 million in seven weeks. "Toy Story 2" has
brought in $234.4 million during an 11-week run.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North American theaters,
according to Exhibitor Relations Co:
</P>
<P>
	   1. "Eye of the Beholder," $6.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   2. (tie) "Next Friday," $6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   2. (tie) "The Hurricane," $6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   4. "Stuart Little," $4.8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   5. "The Green Mile," $4.1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   6. "Down to You," $4 million.
</P>
<P>
	   7. "Galaxy Quest," $3.5 million.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Canada Train Crash Injures 26  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIRAMICHI, New Brunswick (AP) -- A passenger train slammed into two parked
boxcars in eastern Canada on Sunday, leaving 26 people hospitalized with mostly
minor injuries, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The collision occurred north of Moncton, New Brunswick, when a Via Rail
train from Montreal carrying 127 passengers and 14 crew members ran into the
unoccupied boxcars, Via spokeswoman Catherine Kaloutsky said. She said 26 people
were taken to hospitals but that none of the injuries were considered
life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The extent of the injuries so far are bumps, bruises and burns,'' said
Sonya Green-Hache, spokeswoman for Miramichi Regional Hospital, where most of
the injured were taken.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow covering a dirt road leading to the accident site hindered rescuers.
They used snowmobiles to transport some of the injured to waiting rescue
vehicles, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Harris, a spokesman for the Canadian Transportation Safety Board, said
two of the train's engines and five cars derailed.

<HEADLINE> Dominica Election Tinged With Anger  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE FAUL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROSEAU, Dominica (AP) -- On an island known for virgin forests and
glittering waterfalls, opposition politicians are fighting to unseat a
government they accuse of corrupting Dominica's image by selling passports to
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
	   About 60,000 people are registered to choose 21 legislators in Monday's
vote. The leader of the party with the most seats usually becomes prime
minister, and polls suggest the contest will be tight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the government is doing with the rampant selling of passports to
criminals and criminal gangs all over the world is to eventually establish
Dominica as a center for international crime,'' said Bernard Wiltshire, a leader
of the opposition Dominica Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``International gangs would control our government from behind the scenes to
subvert the independence and freedoms of our people,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
	   The charges have angered Prime Minister Edison James, whose United Workers
Party is seeking a second term. At a rally Saturday night he called the
elections an ``all-out war.''
</P>
<P>
	   James said there is no evidence that ``economic citizens'' sold passports
for $50,000 -- many of whom are Russian or Chinese -- are criminals. His party
has tried to focus attention on its record of building new homes, schools and
roads, and economic growth of 3.5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Like several Caribbean countries, this former British colony started selling
passports under programs linked to offshore banking centers in the early 1990s,
as aid from traditional donors dried up and the banana industry collapsed under
a U.S. challenge to preferential trade rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and other countries have attacked the Caribbean's
secretive offshore industry and passport sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Concern has grown among the island's residents since November, when Canada
detained several Chinese carrying passports from Dominica on suspicion that they
were involved in an immigration smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
	   James denied Labor Party claims that Canada is considering introducing visa
requirements for Dominica passport holders. He said Canada is considering
``special treatment'' for the economic citizens -- a move that should diminish
the value of the citizenship prized for the ease with which passport holders
travel to North America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Such restrictions on that travel likely would upset islanders, especially
since at least 100,000 live in North America and Britain, compared to an
estimated 80,000 on the island.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Trade Barbs Before Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Al Gore and fellow Democrats jumped ``into bed with
special interests'' during the 1996 fund-raising scandal, rival Bill Bradley
said Sunday, as he struggled with questions about his own health two days before
New Hampshire's primary. Sen. John McCain claimed, ``There's only one man who is
fully prepared'' to be commander-in-chief, and he said it's not George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing Gore's once-commanding lead narrowing, the vice president
struggled to deal with Bradley's sudden eagerness to attack. A political
flame-thrower himself, Gore accused Bradley of impugning his integrity and
``stepping down ... to the level of personal vilification.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the two-term Texas governor and national GOP front-runner, said his
executive office experience would make for a better president. ``I'm not of the
Washington scene. I'm not a committee chairman,'' Bush said, digging at Senate
Commerce Committee chairman McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm the guy who can beat Al Gore,'' McCain replied, as the GOP and
Democratic campaigns appeared headed for close finishes. McCain holds a slight
edge or is tied with Bush in polls here, after leading the Texan for eight
weeks. Gore's edge over Bradley is slightly wider, but that contest also could
be close Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, McCain, Bush and Republican Alan Keyes made the round of Sunday
talk shows while the seven major-party White House hopefuls plowed toward
Tuesday's vote with rallies and news conferences.
</P>
<P>
	   Running a distant third in Republican polling here, millionaire publisher
Steve Forbes kept his eye on Bush. After the Texan told ``Fox News Sunday'' that
he would cut taxes ``hopefully in the first term,'' Forbes questioned Bush's
commitment to the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't want to say, 'I told you so' but having led with a timid tax cut
and now hedging about whether he can even get that, I think this is part of the
waffling and equivocating that people are tired of,'' Forbes said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, the conservative firebrand, picked up the endorsement of David
Schippers, chief GOP investigator for President Clinton's impeachment trial. He
said the race between Bradley and Gore is a choice between ``the devil or
Beelzebub.''
</P>
<P>
	   Fellow conservative Gary Bauer, struggling to keep his candidacy alive,
maintained a light schedule that included a Super Bowl party. Recognizing that
football, not politics, held voters' interests Sunday, most of the candidates
ended their day in front of the TV.
</P>
<P>
	   Lugging cheese popcorn and pretzels through a shopping center parking lot,
Manchester voter Dennis Ekerson dismissed a political question with a laugh.
``Gary Bauer? Does he play for Tennessee or Los Angeles,'' the registered
independent said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, a former basketball star, has been slow to reveal details about his
irregular heartbeat condition and acknowledged Sunday that he has briefly
undergone anesthesia three times for treatment since December 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   He told ABC ``it would be appropriate'' to invoke the 25th Amendment and
turn power over to his vice president if he underwent the same treatment as
president.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the candidate and his doctors say the condition is simply a medical
nuisance, it could become a political problem if voters worry about his health.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley lost badly to Gore in the Iowa caucuses last week and would be
staggered by a second-straight defeat in New Hampshire. The former lawmaker
surrendered his lead to Gore in New Hampshire polls during the vice president's
aggressive final week of campaigning in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, however, has enough money to continue beyond this state, and has
released a schedule showing that he intends to do so. The next contests -- a
series of March 7 primaries -- include states where Bradley is strong.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the waning days of the Iowa campaign, Bradley has been torn between a
need to attack Gore and a fear that negative campaigning will tarnish his
self-styled image as a non-politician. Daily polling, which is sometimes
unreliable, showed Bradley edging toward Gore -- and the vice president seemed
to be feeling the heat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why would Senator Bradley break his promise to run a different kind of
campaign and launch divisive, manipulative attacks?'' Gore asked supporters, as
Democratic leaders backing the vice president urged Bradley to curb his
criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has turned the tables on Gore: The vice president revitalized his
sagging campaign last fall by launching a full-throated case against Bradley's
health care plan and questioning the former New Jersey senator's commitment to
the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
	   With aides promising still harder attacks, Bradley stopped short of calling
Gore a liar. ``I don't think that he said the truth'' about his abortion record
in Congress, Bradley told ABC.
</P>
<P>
	   At a rally later, Bradley waved a recent article about Gore's 1996
fund-raising trip to a Buddhist Temple near Los Angeles and demanded an
explanation. He said the fund-raising scandal ``was a disgrace'' to both
parties, particularly Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When we all get into bed with the special interests, I think that makes a
more serious problem for us than for Republicans,'' Bradley said. He suggested
that Gore's role in the fund-raising abuses would make him vulnerable to attacks
by the GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless we clean up our own house, Republicans will clean it up for us this
fall,'' he told ABC.
</P>
<P>
	   Ability to be elected president also was an issue on the GOP side, where
Bush is closing the gap against McCain by pulling previously undecided
Republicans into the fold. McCain's candidacy depends on a strong turnout from
New Hampshire independents who can vote in either primary.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who filled the Peterborough city hall with red, white and blue
balloons and more than 1,000 people for his 114th -- and final -- New Hampshire
town hall, argued that his pledge to reform the political system makes him
better suited to expose Gore's weaknesses. The Arizonan and Navy veteran said
Bush is qualified to be president, but ``there's only one man who is fully
prepared. I am fully prepared,'' particularly on military and foreign policy
matters.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Welcomes Elian's Grandmothers  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers arrived back to Cuba on Sunday
without the child they had hoped to bring home, but they were greeted as heroes
nonetheless with an enormous government-organized parade through the streets of
the Cuban capital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are leaving but Elian is still here,'' said the 6-year-old boy's
paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, as she wrapped up her campaign for the
shipwrecked child's return to Cuba. Quintana spoke before departing with
maternal grandmother Raquel Rodriguez on a private plane from Dulles
International Airport in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He will never be happy (in the United States) because he grew up in
Cuba,'' she said. ``He is a Cuban boy. He has a father. He has four grandparents
and an entire family back there.''
</P>
<P>
	   As the women arrived, crowds clutching Cuban flags lined the 16-mile route
of their motorcade through Havana. Government television and radio stations
repeatedly broadcast the route and newspapers published schedules for special
buses to take people to it.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the national soccer championship game, which had been scheduled for
Sunday in Havana, was postponed for a week so players and spectators could
attend the event.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers were returning after ``brave and extraordinary work in the
United States, overcoming great obstacles and transmitting a persuasive message
to the U.S. people,'' said a government statement published on the front pages
of all newspapers here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found floating in an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25
after a boat wreck that killed his mother and 10 other people. He has been
staying with a great-uncle in Florida ever since. His Florida relatives are
seeking to keep Elian in the United States, while his father and other relatives
in Cuba are fighting to get him back.
</P>
<P>
	   The little boy also is caught in the midst of a major propaganda battle
between Fidel Castro's communist government and Cuban-American exile groups.
Some of the exile groups have complained that the boy should not return to his
father because it would be a victory for the Cuban leader.
</P>
<P>
	   The struggle over Elian has become one of the largest government campaigns
in recent Cuban history, with daily events, some drawing massive crowds, to
demand the child's return to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the two grandmothers left Havana on Jan. 21, the government has given
increasingly massive television and newspaper coverage to their tour of the
United States, crediting them with helping sway U.S. public opinion toward
Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The heroic behavior of these humble and good-natured grandmothers has
gained the respect, the admiration of the people who will await them with a warm
and massive reception,'' the government's Sunday statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The women -- until recently obscure housewives from the provincial city of
Cardenas -- have found themselves on worldwide television meeting congressmen,
senators and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think we have reached part of what we planned. We think we have a step
forward but still my grandson is here,'' Rodriguez, the maternal grandmother,
said before leaving Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would like to thank the American people and the Cuban Americans who are
here and who have helped us,'' she said. ``We would like to remind them to keep
helping us, because Elian is still here.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled Elian should be
returned to his father. But officials are awaiting the outcome of a federal
court challenge filed by Miami relatives before trying to return the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler will hear arguments Feb. 22 on whether
the Miami relatives' lawsuit should be dismissed.

<HEADLINE> 4 Hurt As Train Crashes Into Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Md. (AP) -- A coal train derailed Sunday morning in western
Maryland and one car slammed into a home, injuring two adults and two children.
</P>
<P>
	   A third child in the home was believed trapped in the wreckage and still
hadn't been located midday, said State Police Cpl. David Broadwater.
</P>
<P>
	   About half of the CSX train's 80 cars derailed, said Garry Wollenhaupt, a
spokesman for the railroad. The cause was not immediately determined.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the cars slammed into a house, a garage and at least two parked
vehicles, Wollenhaupt said.
</P>
<P>
	   The injured were taken to Cumberland Memorial Hospital. Broadwater said
troopers at the hospital told him ``injuries were minor to three of the people.
In one adult, it was a little more serious, but not life threatening.''
</P>
<P>
	   Their ages were not immediately known, Broadwater said. The two crew members
on the three-engine train were not hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   The train was traveling from Grafton, W.Va., to Cumberland.

<HEADLINE> Diallo Trial Set To Begin Monday  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- No one disputes the math.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Officer Sean Carroll squeezed off 16 rounds. So did Edward McMellon.
Kenneth Boss emptied five bullets from his pistol and Richard Murphy four, for a
total of 41.
</P>
<P>
	   Nineteen bullets tore through the body of Amadou Diallo within seconds,
turning the 5-foot-by-8-foot vestibule of his Bronx apartment building into a
dingy death trap. They pierced his heart, spinal cord, lungs, liver, spleen,
kidneys and intestines.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers had feared for their lives, they said, believing Diallo to be
an armed criminal. They learned too late that he was a 22-year-old West African
immigrant carrying only a pager and wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly a year later -- racial politics and a mother's plaintive cries
providing a backdrop -- a jury must decide whether the shooting by the four
white officers was murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection is set to begin Monday in Albany, N.Y., 140 miles north of
Diallo's neighborhood, because an appeals court agreed with defense attorneys
who argued that pretrial publicity and protests would make it impossible to find
impartial jurors in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, state Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi ruled the trial, which
is expected to last more than a month, could be televised -- partly to ensure
access to city residents. His ruling is unlikely to quell anger over the change
of venue.
</P>
<P>
	   Civil rights activists have vowed to go to Albany to rally behind the Diallo
family. They have urged federal authorities to monitor the case they say
symbolizes widespread police brutality against minorities. More than 1,200
people have been arrested for their roles in demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There will be those who will tell you in the next couple weeks that we are
here because we don't like police, that we are here to divide the races,'' the
Rev. Al Sharpton told members of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Albany on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This has nothing to do with police,'' he said. ``We're fighting against
evil and wickedness in high places. To shoot an unarmed man is a wicked thing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kadiatou Diallo, who arrived from her native Guinea five days after the
shooting, mourned openly for her eldest child.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice for everyone,'' she said
last year after the officers were indicted on charges of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 36; McMellon, 27; Boss, 28; and Murphy, 27, all pleaded innocent.
But prosecutors allege they demonstrated a ``depraved indifference to human
life'' by unleashing a barrage of bullets on a defenseless man.
</P>
<P>
	   The firepower stunned and polarized the city: ``In Cold Blood -- Police kill
unarmed man in hail of 41 bullets,'' read an early headline. A New Yorker
magazine cover portrayed a police officer at a shooting gallery with the sign
''41 shots 10 cents.'' The American Civil Liberties Union ran a full-page
newspaper ad dotted with 41 bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If a man was put in front of a firing squad, he would not expect to be
shot at 41 times,'' Sharpton said at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants' decision not to testify before a grand jury left no option
except murder charges carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison, said Bronx
District Attorney Robert Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Without (their) explanation, what we have is four people driving up to a
location, pulling out their guns and killing an individual,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys maintain the officers thought Diallo, who sold videotapes
on the streets, was reaching for a gun when they told him to freeze. The
officers have indicated they will testify in their own defense.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is ``about whether you give police officers the benefit of the
doubt,'' said McMellon's attorney, Stephen Worth.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You either somehow believe a bunch of cops thought, 'What the hell, we'll
shoot this guy for no good reason,' or you realize that they thought they were
in danger of being shot at, and took proper action.''
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants belonged to a roving Street Crime Unit credited with greatly
reducing shootings in New York by arresting armed suspects. Three had been
involved in previous shootings, one fatal. All were deemed justified. On the
night of Diallo's death, each officer was dressed in street clothes and
bulletproof vest and armed with a 16-shot semiautomatic pistol.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the defense, the officers stopped their unmarked car Feb. 4,
1999, after spotting Diallo duck into the shadows of his building. As they
approached him, Diallo ignored an order to freeze, then made a sudden move --
drawing gunfire.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense says that as the bullets flew, Carroll was so sure Diallo was
armed he yelled, ``Gun!'' McMellon slipped and fell backward, further creating
the impression of a gun battle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're talking about split-second decisions,'' said Steven Brounstein, the
attorney for Boss. ``What if this had gone the other way? What if (Boss) held
his fire while his partner was being shot? It would have been a police
funeral.''
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution is expected to use medical evidence in their contention that
Diallo was dropped by the first bullets, meaning the officers kept firing at him
on the ground. The defense contends he remained upright -- still a perceived
threat.
</P>
<P>
	   In the bullet-scarred vestibule where Diallo lost his life, his memory lives
today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Amadou,'' says one message, ``your life was not in vain.''

	   Bush, the two-term Texas governor and national GOP front-runner, said his
executive office experience would make for a better president. "I'm not of the
Washington scene. I'm not a committee chairman," Bush said, digging at Senate
Commerce Committee chairman McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm the guy who can beat Al Gore," McCain replied, as both rivals appealed
to GOP voters eager to reclaim the White House. McCain holds a slight edge or is
tied with Bush in polls here, after leading the Texan for eight weeks. Gore's
edge over Bradley is slightly wider.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, McCain, Bush and Republican Alan Keyes made the round of Sunday
talk shows while the seven major-party White House hopefuls plowed toward
Tuesday's vote with rallies and news conferences.
</P>
<P>
	   Running a distant third in Republican polling here, millionaire publisher
Steve Forbes kept his eye on Bush. After the Texan told "Fox News Sunday" that
he would cut taxes "hopefully in the first term," Forbes questioned Bush's
commitment to the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't want to say, 'I told you so,' but having led with a timid tax cut
and now hedging about whether he can even get that, I think this is part of the
waffling and equivocating that people are tired of," Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, the conservative firebrand, picked up the endorsement of David
Schippers, chief GOP investigator for President Clinton's impeachment trial. He
said the race between Bradley and Gore is a choice between "the devil or
Beelzebub."
</P>
<P>
	   Fellow conservative Gary Bauer, struggling to keep his candidacy alive,
maintained a light schedule that included a Super Bowl party. Recognizing that
football, not politics, held voters' interests Sunday, most of the candidates
ended their day in front of the TV.
</P>
<P>
	   Lugging cheese popcorn and pretzels through a shopping center parking lot,
Manchester voter Dennis Ekerson dismissed a political question with a laugh.
"Gary Bauer? Does he play for Tennessee or Los Angeles?" the registered
independent said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, a former basketball star, has been slow to reveal details about his
irregular heartbeat condition and acknowledged Sunday that he has briefly
undergone anesthesia three times for treatment since December 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   He told ABC "it would be appropriate" to invoke the 25th Amendment and turn
power over to his vice president if he underwent the same treatment as
president.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the candidate and his doctors say the condition is simply a medical
nuisance, it could become a political problem if voters worry about his health.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley lost badly to Gore in the Iowa caucuses last week and would be
staggered by a second-straight defeat in New Hampshire. The former lawmaker
surrendered his lead to Gore in New Hampshire polls during the vice president's
aggressive final week of campaigning in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, however, has enough money to continue beyond New Hampshire. The
next contests - a series of March 7 primaries - include states in which Bradley
is strong.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the waning days of the Iowa campaign, Bradley has been torn between a
need to attack Gore and a fear that negative campaigning will tarnish his
self-styled image as a non-politician.
</P>
<P>
	   With aides promising still harder attacks, Bradley stopped short of calling
Gore a liar Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think that he said the truth" about his abortion record in
Congress, Bradley told ABC.
</P>
<P>
	   At a rally later, Bradley waved a recent article about Gore's 1996
fund-raising trip to a Buddhist Temple near Los Angeles and demanded an
explanation. He said the fund-raising scandal "was a disgrace" to both parties,
particularly Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we all get into bed with the special interests, I think that makes a
more serious problem for us than for Republicans," Bradley said. He suggested
that Gore's role in the fund-raising abuses would make him vulnerable to attacks
by the GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unless we clean up our own house, Republicans will clean it up for us this
fall," he told ABC.
</P>
<P>
	   Ability to be elected president also was an issue on the GOP side, where
Bush is closing the gap against McCain by pulling previously undecided
Republicans into the fold. McCain's candidacy depends on a strong turnout from
New Hampshire independents who can vote in either primary.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain argued that his pledge to reform the political system makes him the
best candidate to expose Gore's weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm convinced I can beat Al Gore like a drum," he told NBC. The Arizonan
said Bush is qualified to be president, but "there's only one man who is fully
prepared. I am fully prepared," particularly on military and foreign policy
matters, the Navy veteran said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain held his 114th - and last - New Hampshire town hall, filling the
Peterborough city hall with red, white and blue balloons that were bounced aloft
by more than 1,000 people crammed into the colonial building. In July, McCain's
underdog candidacy drew just 40 voters to the same spot.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush continued to call McCain's tax-cut plan too small. "I believe he comes
from the school of thought that says we must leave money in Washington, D.C.,"
the governor said. "To me, that's a frightening proposition."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain bristled: "He's spinning like Bill Clinton."

<HEADLINE> Soros: IMF Should Not Help Russia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- U.S. financier George Soros said Sunday that the
International Monetary Fund should pull out of Russia in view of the current
political climate there.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign institutions and investors ``have lost the ability to influence the
direction of events'' in Russia, said Soros, chairman of the influential Soros
Fund Management, during a news conference at the World Economic Forum meeting in
Davos.
</P>
<P>
	   Soros pointed to the conflict in the breakaway republic of Chechnya as a
worrying sign.
</P>
<P>
	   With civilian deaths in Chechnya and hundreds of thousands of refugees
fleeing the fighting, Western countries have criticized the war, which is
popular among Russians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For 10 years...we had the ability to influence things in Russia and move
them in the right direction and we flubbed it,'' said Soros, who as a
philanthropist has spent more than $350 million on charitable projects in Russia
during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   With Russia now moving in the wrong direction, the IMF should pull out, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, the IMF's second-ranking official said the fund may delay
paying Russia the second $460 million installment of a $4.5 billion loan until
after presidential elections in March.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanley Fischer told reporters there is little evidence to suggest Moscow
has made progress with some economic reforms crucial to approving the
installment.
</P>
<P>
	   The payment originally was due in September, but was delayed after the IMF
imposed new conditions amid international concern about what happened to
previous loans.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian government is counting on receiving four IMF installments of
$460 million each in 2000 to help finance its budget. The IMF agreed to the loan
program last July, releasing $640 million at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers urged the Russian government Sunday
to rebuild its economy around the ``rule of law,'' taking steps to combat
corruption and revive confidence among both local and international investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers met Sunday with Mikhail Kasyanov, Russia's finance minister. The two
discussed economic conditions in Russia and -- ``in general terms'' -- Moscow's
rocky relationship with the IMF, Summers said.

<HEADLINE> Two men found dead in Brooklyn station  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Two young men were found dead in a Brooklyn subway
station Sunday morning, but transit officials did not believe they were struck
by a train and police were investigating.
<P>
	   The bodies were discovered at 7:19 a.m. in the Bay Parkway station on the N
line in Bensonhurst by workers on a passing train.
</P>
<P>
	   The motorman of a Manhattan-bound train on the local track reported seeing
one body on the adjoining express track, and his conductor noticed the other
body lying, face up, on the station platform, according to James Anyansi, a
spokesman for New York City Transit.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if there was any possibility that the men had been hit by that train
or an earlier train, Anyansi said: "On the contrary, we don't think that. ... If
the train goes over anything at all, no matter how little, the brakes usually
get activated. In this case, that hadn't happened."
</P>
<P>
	   The victims' blood had already stained the snow red by the time
investigators covered them with white sheets.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were on the scene but could not immediately provide any further
information about the cause of death or the victims' identities.
</P>
<P>
	   The men were believed to be in their 20s.
</P>
<P>
	   The bodies were turned over to the medical examiner's office Sunday
afternoon. Autopsies are scheduled to be performed Monday to determine the
precise cause of death, according to Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the
medical examiner.

<HEADLINE> Advocates call for more focus on guard-inmate sex complaints  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A move to ban male guards from female living
quarters in the Westchester County Jail is drawing mixed responses from prison
and jail advocates.
<P>
	   It is also rekindling the debate on the prevalence of complaints about
female inmates being sexually abused by male guards in the state's correctional
facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they made the right decision. Other counties should follow suit,"
said Mishi Faruqee, director of the Women in Prison Project for the state
Correctional Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Faruqee said she's not advocating a complete ban of male guards in female
prisons, but rather wants guards of the same gender working in areas where
inmates have an expectation of some privacy, like shower rooms and sleeping
areas.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jamie Fellner, an associate counsel for the advocacy group Human Rights
Watch, said assigning jobs on the basis of gender would not be the solution. It
instead raises employment discrimination concerns and fails to address problems
of abuse that are not gender specific, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fundamental question is whether the officials train guards to have
proper behavior, ensure proper behavior and hold guards accountable in offense,"
Fellner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Fellner and Faruqee agree that female inmates are often too fearful and
worried about possible retaliation to report sexual misconduct by guards.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a lot of likelihood that they can be punished and ostracized,"
Faruqee said. Prison and jail officials, Fellner added, "often don't pay any
attention or take it seriously."
</P>
<P>
	   James Flateau, spokesman for the state Department of Correctional Services,
called such claims "irresponsible."
</P>
<P>
	   "We never felt that it was a major problem, but we wanted the authority to
act against the few who are offenders," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, a department-backed bill became law, making sexual contact between
inmates and guards in the state statutory rape, a felony. Even if consensual,
such sexual contact is a crime because the inmate's subservient position behind
bars makes consent impossible, sponsors of the bill argued.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Flateau, a dozen state prison guards have been charged in
connection with sexual offenses since 1996 under the law. Nine were convicted,
two were dismissed and one case is pending, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our policies are based upon a lack of any sexual contact between employees
and inmates - male or female," Flateau said. When such incidents occur, the
department seeks the dismissal of the guards involved and refers them for
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Steinhardt, a spokesman at the Commission of Corrections, a watchdog
agency over state prisons and local jails, said that when the commission
receives inmate complaints of sexual misconduct by guards in local jails, the
cases are turned over to the local district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, four male Westchester County Jail guards were arrested following
sexual offense complaints from female inmates. The guards - Carlos Aldarondo,
Javier Corona, Michael Downey and Robert Escalera - were accused of crimes
ranging from rape to making demands that inmates strip.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident prompted County Executive Andrew Spano to ban male officers
from 10 posts inside the women's living quarters in the jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Goodstein, who represents the Westchester County Correction Officer
Benevolent Association, said the union will file a lawsuit to block the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "What you're dealing with here is guilt by association," Goodstein said.
"They're accusing that every male is unfit to be posted there and that's
ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
	   Spano spokesman Terence Kelly countered that "we believe we're on solid
ground" in removing the male guards from the female inmates' living quarters.
Observing prisoners' right to privacy has been recognized as an acceptable
exception to following federal laws which prohibit discrimination based on
gender, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In state prisons, pat frisks can be handled by guards of both sexes against
inmates of either sex. Strip searches must be conducted by guards of the same
sex as the inmates. The only exception applies to Muslim inmates, who by court
order must be pat-frisked only by guards of the same gender because of religious
tenets.
</P>
<P>
	   Faruqee said that even pat-frisks should be a performed by same-sex
officers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's intrusive and emotionally upsetting to have a male officer pat down
all your private parts," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Flateau said the department tried to change that system several years ago
for some jobs in the female correctional facility in Albion, near Buffalo. For a
while it employed only female guards for certain jobs, like conducting pat
frisks. But the plan backfired when a female guard assigned to the position sued
because she was being pulled from another post she had bid for. She won the
lawsuit, Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   Job assignments for correction officers are based on a bid-by-seniority
system, where employees with the most years of service get first choice at the
post they want, Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a male wants a job working in a female facility and has more seniority,
that's the person who gets the job," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the main factors against having only female guards in female prisons
is the guards themselves. Flateau said while most male guards want to work in a
facility closest to home, about 80 percent of the female correction officers
prefer not to work in female facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   "For whatever reason, they prefer not to work there," Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
	   Faruqee said the state should offer incentives and benefits to encourage
female guards to stay in facilities housing female inmates. The state should
also try harder to hire more female guards, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state prison system currently houses 71,700 inmates - about 3,500 are
women. Flateau argued that the gender breakdown is about proportional to the
guard population. There are about 20,300 guards working in the facilities and 9
percent, or 1,800, are female.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Mubarak Meet  </HEADLINE>
   By JOCELYN NOVECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak went looking for help from
Egypt's president Sunday to revive a flagging Middle East peace process, while
Israelis and Palestinians launched intensive talks in a last-ditch bid to meet a
deadline for a peace treaty framework.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israelis and Palestinians have set an ambitious Feb. 13 deadline for an
outline of a final accord that would solve the thorniest issues dividing them:
the return of Palestinian refugees, the borders of an independent Palestinian
state and the status of Jerusalem, among others.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators met secretly for two hours Sunday in an undisclosed location.
The talks were expected to last 10 days.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cairo, meanwhile, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak indicated he would do
his best to try to prod along the Israeli-Palestinian dialogue, according to a
senior Israeli official in Barak's delegation.
</P>
<P>
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mubarak has already
proven his ability to influence Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The prime minister told Mubarak he must emphasize to the Palestinians that
this is a crucial time to bring our positions together, not to sit and wait, or
assume the Americans will solve our problems,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mubarak, seeking to protect his role as a Mideast peacemaker, often acts as
a broker when talks are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak successfully revived talks with Syria and the Palestinians last year,
only to see both tracks falter in recent weeks. Both partners are now accusing
him of not taking their demands seriously.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest flurry of diplomatic activity -- Barak is to meet Arafat on
Thursday, and Jordan's king the following week -- comes as the Israeli leader is
under increasing fire at home. His party is under criminal investigation for
alleged campaign finance violations, and opponents suggest the diplomacy is a
smokescreen to divert attention from the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   At a joint news conference with Mubarak, Barak scoffed at those claims.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This government was elected to advance the peace process, and to do it
without any connection to any internal problem that arises in Israel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meeting for an hour and a half, the two leaders began by discussing the
stalled peace talks between Israel and Syria, officials said, and Mubarak's
recent trip to Damascus to meet with President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite reports that Mubarak came back from that meeting pessimistic about
chances for a Syria deal anytime soon, the Egyptian president told Barak he
thought a deal was ``certainly possible,'' the senior Israeli official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has pointedly praised Assad in recent days as a ``strong leader,'' but
on Sunday he reiterated Israel's refusal of a key Syrian demand: a prior
commitment to withdraw from all the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The two partners ... should negotiate without any preconditions,'' Barak
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinians have said they believe Barak is more interested in achieving an
agreement with Syria first, which would isolate the Palestinians and strengthen
Israel's hand. They also accuse Israel of dithering over interim issues,
including withdrawals from the West Bank and prisoner releases, and not paying
attention to the crucial final-status differences.
</P>
<P>
	   Saeb Erekat, a leading Palestinian negotiator, said the Feb. 13 deadline was
still reachable if Barak makes strides toward meeting Palestinian demands.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not the form of the negotiations, or how intensive they are -- it is
the substance,'' Erekat told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak on Sunday urged the Palestinians to ``honor their commitments'' as
well, an apparent reference to recent threats to unilaterally declare statehood
as early as next month. Barak is not opposed to Palestinian statehood, but a
unilateral declaration could cause him further damage at home, where he needs to
keep a fragile coalition together.
</P>
<P>
	   His justice minister, Yossi Beilin, said the Palestinians would do well to
consider what Barak's fall -- and the return to power of the right-wing Likud
party -- would bring.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Israel, there is a government which is committed to peace and which is
prepared to pay the price for peace, and any unilateral decision ... will be a
mistake,'' Beilin said.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Welcomes Elian's Grandmothers  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers arrived back in Cuba on Sunday
without the child they had hoped to bring home, but they were greeted as heroes
nonetheless with an enormous government-organized parade through the streets of
the Cuban capital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are leaving but Elian is still here'' in the United States, said the
6-year-old boy's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, as she wrapped up her
campaign for the child's return to Cuba. Quintana spoke before departing with
maternal grandmother Raquel Rodriguez on a private plane from Washington's
Dulles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He will never be happy (in the United States) because he grew up in
Cuba,'' she said. ``He is a Cuban boy. He has a father. He has four grandparents
and an entire family back there.''
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, embraced the women as they stepped
off a business jet at Jose Marti International Airport, then rode with them in a
convertible as they waved at the crowds of hundreds of thousands of people
waving Cuban flags in a scene reminiscent of the 1998 greeting for Pope John
Paul II.
</P>
<P>
	   Government television and radio stations, which broadcast the event live,
had repeatedly announced the route of the 16-mile ``caravan of dignity'' through
Havana, and newspapers published schedules for special buses to take people to
it.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the national soccer championship game, which had been scheduled for
Sunday in Havana, was postponed for a week so players and spectators could
attend the event.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers were returning after ``brave and extraordinary work in the
United States, overcoming great obstacles and transmitting a persuasive message
to the U.S. people,'' said a government statement published on the front pages
of all newspapers here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found floating in an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25
after a boat wreck that killed his mother and 10 other people. He has been
staying with a great-uncle in Florida ever since. His Florida relatives are
seeking to keep Elian in the United States, while his father and other relatives
in Cuba are fighting to get him back.
</P>
<P>
	   The little boy also is caught in the midst of a major propaganda battle
between Fidel Castro's communist government and Cuban-American exile groups.
Some of the exile groups have complained that the boy should not return to his
father because it would be a victory for the Cuban leader.
</P>
<P>
	   The struggle over Elian has become one of the largest government campaigns
in recent Cuban history, with daily events, some drawing massive crowds, to
demand the child's return to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the two grandmothers left Havana on Jan. 21, the government has given
increasingly massive television and newspaper coverage to their tour of the
United States, crediting them with helping sway U.S. public opinion toward
Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The heroic behavior of these humble and good-natured grandmothers has
gained the respect, the admiration of the people who will await them with a warm
and massive reception,'' the government's statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The women -- until recently obscure housewives from the provincial city of
Cardenas -- have found themselves on worldwide television meeting congressmen,
senators and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think we have a step forward but still my grandson is here,''
Rodriguez, the maternal grandmother, said before leaving Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would like to thank the American people and the Cuban Americans who are
here and who have helped us,'' she said. ``We would like to remind them to keep
helping us, because Elian is still here.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled Elian should be
returned to his father. But officials are awaiting the outcome of a federal
court challenge filed by Miami relatives before trying to return the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler will hear arguments Feb. 22 on whether
the Miami relatives' lawsuit should be dismissed.

<HEADLINE> Residents Panic After Test Siren  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. (AP) -- A test of a siren system to warn of a failure at
Casita Dam sent panicked residents rushing for higher ground, trampling fences
and jamming streets.
</P>
<P>
	   People within a nine-mile area of the Ventura River valley heard blaring
sirens late Saturday afternoon and a voice from a loud speaker declaring: ``This
is an emergency. Head for high ground. You have one hour.''
</P>
<P>
	   Radio and newspaper announcements of the test appeared last week. And the
loud speaker warning was prefaced with the statement, ``This is a test,'' but
many people apparently did not hear it, said sheriff's Sgt. Larry Meyers.
</P>
<P>
	   Worse, the warning message malfunctioned and kept replaying, said Jeff
McCracken, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Residents in the area
about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles said it played for about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People were going crazy,'' said Dee Peterson. ``There were people in
wheelchairs trying to roll down the hill, mothers pushing their babies like mad
in strollers with blankets on top of their shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
	   Emergency telephone lines were jammed with anxious callers, and police and
sheriff's deputies were called out to help calm the panic.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Eyes Putting VP in Charge  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley said
Sunday he might put his vice president in charge of running the country if
treatment for his non-life-threatening heart condition forced him under
anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that that's probably appropriate,'' Bradley said on ABC's ``This
Week. ``I'll make the decision at the time. But I think that it would be an
appropriate thing if I decided to'' undergo a course of treatment that
incapacitated him.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, 56, answered questions about his irregular heartbeat after
acknowledging that treatment required him to be unconscious three times since
1996, when the condition was diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
	   His doctors have reaffirmed that he is physically fit to be president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said that under this particular treatment, which uses a jolt of
electricity to return the heart to its normal rhythm, ``there is a period of
about, I'd say, three or four minutes when you are under anesthesia.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the public shouldn't worry that he might have to invoke the 25th
Amendment under such a circumstance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that it's a very simple procedure. There is virtually no risk,''
he said. ``And I don't think that that would be a problem since you'd only be
out about three or four minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The 25th Amendment outlines the process of presidential succession under a
number of scenarios, including if the president decides he's unfit to run the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   A president can make a written declaration to Congress ``that he is unable
to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he transmits them a
written declaration to the contrary,'' the vice president becomes acting
president.
</P>
<P>
	   The amendment also establishes who takes over if a president is removed,
dies or resigns (the vice president) and permits the vice president, when backed
by a majority of the Cabinet, to assume presidential powers after declaring to
Congress that the chief executive ``is unable to discharge the duties and the
powers of his office.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was ratified by Congress in 1967, four years after President Kennedy's
assassination. Until then, the Constitution did not specify what to do if a
president were alive but unable to serve.
</P>
<P>
	   George Bush, whose son, George W., is the front-runner for the GOP
presidential nomination, is the only vice president to assume powers under the
amendment. In 1985, when President Reagan had surgery to remove an intestinal
tumor, he transferred his powers to Bush for about nine hours.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Constitution Panel Closes  </HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE BORISE
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CIUDAD BOLIVAR, Venezuela (AP) -- A constitutional assembly that helped
begin President Hugo Chavez's so-called ``peaceful revolution'' shut itself down
Sunday after six months of shaking up Venezuela's legislature and judicial
system.
</P>
<P>
	   The assembly packed with Chavez supporters was elected last July in a
national referendum and given six months to draft a new constitution. But the
assembly also fired judges, limited Congress' powers and appointed Supreme Court
judges, an attorney general and a comptroller.
</P>
<P>
	   The assembly held previous meetings in the country's capital, Caracas. But
its members gathered Sunday for their final session in Ciudad Bolivar in
southeastern Venezuela because early leaders of the country signed its first
constitution in that region in 1811.
</P>
<P>
	   The closing of the assembly leaves a power vacuum, since it had assumed many
of Congress' duties. The regular Congress was completely eliminated after the
constitution was approved in another national referendum Dec. 15. On Thursday,
the assembly swore in a 21-member ``mini-Congress'' to handle legislative
duties.
</P>
<P>
	   Elections for a new, single house National Assembly are to be held in May or
June, along with elections for state governors, local mayors and the presidency.
The elections have been delayed because of floods and landslides in December
that killed thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say the now-defunct assembly overstepped its legal bounds and edged
Venezuela dangerously close to dictatorship by concentrating power in the hands
of Chavez, a former paratrooper who led a failed 1992 coup and was elected
president in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   But Chavez and his supporters say they are merely moving to crush a corrupt
oligarchy that has squandered massive oil reserves and left the nation
impoverished. Chavez says the new constitution will help clean up rampant
corruption and ease mass poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to reporters on Sunday in Ciudad Bolivar, about 440 miles southeast
of Caracas, Chavez said his program headed off the type of violent revolution
that has wracked many Latin American nations during the past two centuries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Here, the power of the people was awakened, the power of transformation,
and fortunately it awoke peacefully and democratically,'' Chavez said.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Family Builds New Life  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Parents of the only black student slain in the Columbine High
School massacre say they hope to rebuild their lives in a middle-class Houston
suburb.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael and Vonda Shoels, who relocated to Texas two weeks ago, said moving
was easier than trying to reclaim a normal life after their son Isaiah's death.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Under the circumstances, how can we be normal again?'' Shoels said in
Sunday's Houston Chronicle. ``We're going to try to live and do the best we
can.''
</P>
<P>
	   Isaiah, 18, was among 11 students and one teacher shot to death inside the
school last April before the two teen-age killers took their own lives.
</P>
<P>
	   Shoels said the death of his son, the public scrutiny, the cold shoulder
they felt they were getting from the community and anonymous threats to his
family contributed to their decision to leave Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Initially, they had the sympathy that the other victims' families had,''
said Sam Riddle, a family spokesman. ``As soon as the Shoelses started speaking
out about the almost perverse form of denial the state of Colorado was in
regarding hate, anti-Semitism and racism, they began to be treated as if they
pulled the trigger. That was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Shoelses, who have relatives in the region, requested that the newspaper
not identify the city where they live.

<HEADLINE> Gore Turns Up the Heat on Bradley  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOMERSWORTH, N.H. (AP) -- His past abortion-rights record and fund-raising
tactics held up for scrutiny, Vice President Al Gore lashed back Sunday and
accused rival Bill Bradley of trading ``character, courage and commitment'' for
``manipulative attack after manipulative attack.''
</P>
<P>
	   With two days to go before the state's first-in-the-nation primary, both
Democratic presidential contenders stormed through New Hampshire with
reinforcements from Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   These campaign surrogates stirred a bit of a melee outside the Gore rally at
Hilltop Equestrian Center, when shouting Gore supporters bore down with their
campaign posters as a trio of Bradley backers -- Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey, New
York Rep. Jerry Nadler and Washington Rep. Jim McDermott -- tried to speak with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerrey defended Bradley for raising questions about Gore's anti-abortion
votes as a Tennessee congressman and the campaign finance scandal surrounding
his 1996 re-election with President Clinton. ``It may be uncomfortable, but it's
not negative campaigning,'' said Kerrey.
</P>
<P>
	   If anything, Kerrey told reporters, Bradley has, before now, been too easy
on Gore in the face of the vice president's aggressive critique of Bradley's
record and agenda. ``Any human being who has been around Bradley for the last
six weeks is asking, 'Why do you act like a 6-foot, 5-inch Yoda?'''
</P>
<P>
	   In the sawdust outside the horse barn, Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, a Gore
supporter, tried to attract news cameras away from Bradley's defenders,
repeating the blistering lines he had delivered against Bradley inside before
Gore took the stage
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is in no position to ``lecture'' on campaign finance reform, Harkin
asserted, because he earned more than $2 million in lecture fees from businesses
and interest groups after retiring from the Senate in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Sunday, at Franklin Pierce Law School in Concord, Bradley told 200
people crammed into a classroom that Gore needs to explain to Democrats his part
in the ``embarrassing'' finance controversy surrounding his re-election with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless that explanation is forthcoming, the public will reject a candidate
in the fall that fails to come to terms with these circumstances in our
Democratic Party,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who has admitted his 1996 fund-raising practices were a mistake,
decried Bradley's remarks as ``personal vilification'' and suggested that voters
should score the negativity even more harshly against Bradley because he had
pledged to run a non-politician's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the closing days of the New Hampshire primary, Senator Bradley has
suddenly changed. Instead of the promised character, courage and commitment, we
have manipulative attack after manipulative attack,'' Gore said to howls from a
barn full of supporters who had been warmed up with honky-tonk music.
</P>
<P>
	   By Sunday night, the Bradley-Gore rivalry was played out in dueling Super
Bowl parties. Bradley, who hails from a small town outside of St. Louis, rooted
for the Rams. Gore gathered supporters at a Nashua restaurant to cheer the
Tennessee Titans.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Hints at Sharing Jerusalem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A top Israeli government official suggested Sunday that
Jerusalem could be shared with the Palestinians -- the first time Israel has
indicated willingness to compromise on one of the thorniest issues keeping the
sides from concluding a permanent peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh, who often speaks for Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, said Jerusalem's municipal boundaries could be expanded to
accommodate Palestinian aspirations for a presence in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if that meant a Palestinian presence in Jerusalem, Sneh told Israel
television, ``I don't want to commit,'' but immediately added: ``Teddy Kollek
wrote an article once on this and he called it `sharing united Jerusalem.'''
Kollek was a longtime mayor of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked where he would expand the borders, Sneh said eastward.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel captured traditionally Arab east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war
and, until now, Israeli governments have pledged never to divide the city.
Palestinians claim the eastern part of the city as their capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli officials have recently suggested that the Palestinians could
establish a capital in three Arab suburbs east of Jerusalem, but this was the
first time a senior government official offered to include the suburbs in an
expanded ``shared'' Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
	   That could allow the Palestinians to administer parts of the city where
Arabs still predominate. The Palestinian Authority has erected a large building
in one of the West Bank suburbs of the city, Abu Dis, which could function as a
parliament in a Palestinian capital.
</P>
<P>
	   By year's end, Palestinians and Israelis want to finish a final peace
agreement addressing the thorniest issues between them: Jewish settlements,
borders, Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees. They launched marathon talks Sunday
to meet a Feb. 13 deadline for an outline of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Likud opposition party immediately decried Sneh's comments as
capitulation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the name of God, what has become of us?'' said Michael Eitan, a Likud
legislator who appeared on the same interview program as Sneh. ``A deputy
defense minister of Israel is dividing Jerusalem before we even reached the
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
	   But even Eitan was willing to concede the West Bank suburbs of Jerusalem as
a Palestinian capital -- an on-the-record first for the hard-line Likud.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Poor bookkeeping responsible for $58 million school budget deficit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The multimillion-dollar budget gap in Newark's
school district was due to poor accounting practices that began before the state
took control of the district and continued under the management of
state-appointed officials, according to a published report.
<P>
	   Newark officials offered several explanations for the bookkeeping problems,
including blaming the $58 million budget gap on computer software glitches.
However, district documents reviewed by The Star-Ledger of Newark in Sunday's
editions show ongoing problems that began before the state's takeover of the
district in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Records also revealed that the state knew of the problems from the start,
but did not correct them.
</P>
<P>
	   The disclosure of the budget gap in a $572 million spending plan has ignited
finger-pointing, much of it at the state and its management of the
44,000-student district.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very disturbing that the state came in as reformers with charges of
mismanagement by the previous fiscal operation of the board of education, and
now we find out things are worse," said Newark Mayor Sharpe James, who has been
an outspoken critic of the takeover. "With sloppy bookkeeping and a $58 million
deficit and accountable to no one, that's the tragedy."
</P>
<P>
	   In a review of the budget, the most glaring problem was the district's
failure to file monthly reports. One costly result of that failure was more than
$2 million in unpaid utility bills. There was no record that they had existed or
needed to be paid.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997 and 1998, the district also failed to make timely payments of
employee Social Security contributions, leading to $1 million in federal
penalties.
</P>
<P>
	   Failure to file reports in a timely manner was listed as a weakness in
audits before the state took over the district in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   At that time, the state installed Beverly Hall to head the district. She
resigned in June to lead the Atlanta school district. Her chief operations
officer, Leonard Hellenbrand, also left the district around that time.
</P>
<P>
	   State Education Commissioner David Hespe has agreed to provide $14.8 million
in additional state aid to erase the budget's shortfall, shifting $10 million
from district accounts with a surplus, giving $5.3 million to adjust for higher
enrollment than expected, and forgiving $4.9 million owed to the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman has agreed to request an allocation in the state
budget for the remaining $22.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm committed to making a full accounting of what the department did and
taking every action necessary to make sure it doesn't happen again," Hespe said
last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Azzara, the state education department's director of finance,
admitted state officials had not taken action on the problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was never any evidence that they were being corrected," said Azzara,
who is now in charge of fixing the budget problems. "They had no control over
whether they were overspending their accounts."
</P>
<P>
	   Audits dating back to 1995 also showed overspent budget accounts, a direct
violation of state statutes. This resulted in finances that had spun out of
control, state officials admitted.
</P>
<P>
	   State and federal lawmakers have called for public hearings regarding
Newark's district budget problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Superintendent Marion Bolden said she was forced to devote more to time to
the district's finances and less time on academics.
</P>
<P>
	   "It has put the district on hold," Bolden said. "But we have tried not to
touch the instructional program at all. Everyone will remain in place for this
year, but for next year, we are putting together our staffing needs now."
</P>
<P>
	   But Gary Scala, a math teacher at West Side High School said the school was
short on supplies. He spent $350 of his own money to buy a copy machine.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're told to keep it down to a minimum and unfortunately, education for
inner city youth is a maximum, not a minimum," Scala said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- A Kenya Airways jet en route to Lagos, Nigeria,
with 180 people aboard crashed Sunday night into the sea, shortly after taking
off from Abidjan, airport and aviation officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, an Airbus 310, took off at 9:08 p.m. and crashed just a few
minutes later, airport officials said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Emergency workers were being dispatched, the officials said, but it was not
yet clear how far out into the ocean the plane had crashed. French military
firefighters, who are stationed at a French military base next to the airport,
were being asked for assistance, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   An official with Ivorian civil aviation authority, ASECNA, also speaking on
condition of anonymity, said there were 168 adult passengers on board the plane,
two children and 10 crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials did not know if there were any survivors, and had no further
information.

<HEADLINE> One dead, 31 others displaced from Camden apartment fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - One man was killed and 31 others escaped an early
morning fire that ripped through a two-story apartment building, officials said.
<P>
	   Samuel Donagan died when a fire broke out around 3:30 a.m. inside his
first-floor apartment on Davis Avenue, said Camden Police Lt. Joseph Richardson.
</P>
<P>
	   "The victim couldn't get out because of bars on the windows," Richardson
said. "Folks left without shoes or clothing, but no one was hurt."
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said the fire was accidental, but the cause is under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were candles in the apartment, but we don't know if that caused the
fire," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Donagan's girlfriend told officials he was asleep when the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know if she couldn't get to him, but she helped a man in a
wheelchair escape," Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Firefighters from Camden and neighboring departments fought the blaze, which
was brought under control shortly after 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   The 31 residents living in the two-story apartment building were sheltered
temporarily in an unoccupied apartment building nearby, then moved into a hotel
in Cherry Hill, Richardson said. He was unsure when residents would be able to
return to their apartments because of extensive smoke and fire damage.

<HEADLINE> Candidates on the Issues: Guns  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, The Associated Press asks the presidential candidates a
question on the issues. Today's question and the responses:
</P>
<P>
	   Guns
</P>
<P>
	   Do you believe law-abiding citizens should be able to carry concealed guns?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``We should take all measures necessary to improve gun safety
and reduce gun violence. There may be a few limited circumstances under which
some law-abiding citizens, such as former police officers, could be eligible for
concealed gun permits. But the carrying of concealed handguns generally
increases the likelihood that such weapons will be involved in either crime or
accidents. Concealed weapons should be the exception rather than the rule.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``No. We must not loosen the restrictions on concealed weapons. I
believe that, after all the gun violence we have seen, simple common sense
dictates that we must have stricter gun control measures to keep guns out of the
wrong hands, without unnecessarily imposing on the rights of law-abiding hunters
and homeowners.
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: No response.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bauer: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: ``I believe law-abiding citizens who pass rigorous
background checks and a firearm proficiency test should be able to protect
themselves and their families. This decision is best left to individual states.
I believe the federal government should enforce tough laws to keep guns out of
the hands of criminals, juveniles and others who should not have them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes: ``Yes. I am a strong supporter of the Second Amendment rights
of all law-abiding Americans. But those who commit crimes with guns should be
swiftly prosecuted and severely punished. ''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: ``Given the proper training and certification in safety and
responsibility, yes.''
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``Yes. I believe that law-abiding citizens should be able to
carry concealed guns consistent with state law. The Constitution assures the
right to bear arms. We have a duty to protect the rights of law-abiding
citizens, while taking the appropriate steps necessary to keep guns out of the
hands of criminals, children, and the mentally incompetent and to prosecute
those who criminally possess or use a firearm.''

<HEADLINE> Cuba Welcomes Elian's Grandmothers  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers arrived back in Cuba on Sunday
without the child they had hoped to bring home, but they were greeted as heroes
nonetheless with an enormous government-organized parade through the streets of
the Cuban capital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are leaving but Elian is still here'' in the United States, said the
6-year-old boy's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, as she wrapped up her
campaign for the child's return to Cuba. Quintana spoke before departing with
maternal grandmother Raquel Rodriguez on a private plane from Washington's
Dulles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He will never be happy (in the United States) because he grew up in
Cuba,'' she said. ``He is a Cuban boy. He has a father. He has four grandparents
and an entire family back there.''
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, embraced the women as they stepped
off a business jet at Jose Marti International Airport, then rode with them in a
convertible as they waved at the crowds of hundreds of thousands of people
holding Cuban flags in a scene reminiscent of the 1998 greeting for Pope John
Paul II.
</P>
<P>
	   After an hourlong, 16-mile trip through Havana by motorcade, the two women
wept as President Fidel Castro and about 1,700 schoolchildren greeted them with
cheers of ``Free Elian!'' at Havana's Convention Palace.
</P>
<P>
	   Flanked by their extended families, the women heard children chant poems and
sing songs in their honor.
</P>
<P>
	   Government television and radio stations, which broadcast the event live,
had repeatedly announced the route of the ``caravan of dignity,'' and newspapers
published schedules for special buses to take people to it. The event had been
announced less than 24 hours before it took place.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the national soccer championship game, which had been scheduled for
Sunday in Havana, was postponed for a week so players and spectators could
attend the event.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers were returning after ``brave and extraordinary work in the
United States, overcoming great obstacles and transmitting a persuasive message
to the U.S. people,'' said a government statement published on the front pages
of all newspapers here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found floating in an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25
after a boat wreck that killed his mother and 10 other people. He has been
staying with a great-uncle in Florida ever since. His Florida relatives are
seeking to keep Elian in the United States, while his father and other relatives
in Cuba are fighting to get him back.
</P>
<P>
	   The little boy also is caught in the midst of a major propaganda battle
between Castro's communist government and Cuban-American exile groups. Some of
the exile groups have complained that the boy should not return to his father
because it would be a victory for the Cuban leader.
</P>
<P>
	   The struggle over Elian has become one of the largest government campaigns
in recent Cuban history, with daily events, some drawing massive crowds, to
demand the child's return to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the two grandmothers left Havana on Jan. 21, the government has given
increasingly massive television and newspaper coverage to their tour of the
United States, crediting them with helping sway U.S. public opinion toward
Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The heroic behavior of these humble and good-natured grandmothers has
gained the respect, the admiration of the people who will await them with a warm
and massive reception,'' the government's statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The women -- until recently obscure housewives from the provincial city of
Cardenas -- have found themselves on worldwide television meeting congressmen,
senators and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think we have a step forward but still my grandson is here,''
Rodriguez, the maternal grandmother, said before leaving Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would like to thank the American people and the Cuban Americans who are
here and who have helped us,'' she said. ``We would like to remind them to keep
helping us, because Elian is still here.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled Elian should be
returned to his father. But officials are awaiting the outcome of a federal
court challenge filed by Miami relatives before trying to return the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler will hear arguments Feb. 22 on whether
the Miami relatives' lawsuit should be dismissed.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways Jet Crashes Into Sea  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- A Kenya Airways jet carrying 169 passengers and
10 crew members crashed Sunday night into the sea, shortly after taking off from
Abidjan, airport officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear if there were any survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, an Airbus 310, took off at 9:08 p.m. and crashed just one minute
later, according to George Dapre Yao, the head of air traffic at Abidjan's Felix
Houphouet-Boigny Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, which was en route to Lagos, Nigeria, carried 167 adult
passengers and two children, Yao said.
</P>
<P>
	   Albert Acho, a travel agency employee who greets incoming passengers at the
often hectic airport, said the streets outside the airport were jammed with
police officers, firefighters and onlookers, many yelling in panic.
</P>
<P>
	   The Abidjan airport is just a few hundred yards from the Atlantic Ocean
beach. Acho said boats could be seen already searching the water off the beach.
</P>
<P>
	   An official at the airport's control tower, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that wreckage of the plane could not be seen, but the area where
the plane had crashed was visible from the tower.
</P>
<P>
	   French military firefighters, who are stationed at a French military base
next to the airport, had also been dispatched to the scene, the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials had no further information.

<HEADLINE> US-NKorea High Level Talks Planned  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Accelerating an improvement in relations, North Korea will
send a senior official to Washington in March for high-level talks with the
Clinton administration, the State Department said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The visit is designed to match talks former Defense Secretary William Perry
held in Pyongyang last year as a special Clinton administration emissary.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea's deputy foreign minister, Kim Gye Gwan, and U.S. Envoy Charles
Kartman reached agreement for the North Korean visit during talks in Berlin that
ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides will work out the details next month, the State Department
James P. Rubin added in an announcement made aboard Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright's plane as she flew from Switzerland to Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials said there was no decision yet on who the North
Korean government would send to Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement is another step in U.S. efforts to coax North Korea out of its
isolation and to neutralize its nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, North Korea agreed to shelve its nuclear weapons program in
exchange for energy supplies from the United States, Japan and South Korea, and
has agreed to stop missile tests so long as discussions on a better relationship
continue.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States reciprocated by suspending some economic sanctions, but
North Korea is still listed by the State Department as a sponsor of terrorism.
This has the effect of prohibiting virtually all but humanitarian aid to
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
	   Likely topics of discussion at the March talks are ongoing diplomatic
efforts to officially end the Korean war, missile arsenals and terrorism.

</P>
<P>
	   No one was hurt, but passengers on The Capitol Limited spent the night in
the cars, eight of which had derailed. All the cars remained upright after the
derailment, said Amtrak spokesman Ray Lang.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a minor derailment that occurred at a very low rate of speed,''
Lang said. The cause of the derailment is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The cars had power and heat throughout the night, and passengers were given
free food and drinks, Lang said.
</P>
<P>
	   Buses arrived at 8:30 a.m. to take the passengers to Pittsburgh for
connections to Chicago by bus, train and air.

<HEADLINE> Judge Won't Apologize for Notes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A federal judge says he doesn't have to apologize for
notes he exchanged with courtroom staff that contained racially offensive
language and off-color remarks about ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spokesman-Review reported Sunday that U.S. District Judge Alan McDonald
wrote ``Ah is im po tent!'' in one note while a black man was testifying.
</P>
<P>
	   In a note court clerk Pam Posada gave the judge, she wrote: ``It smells like
oil in here -- too many 'Greasers.''' The courtroom was full of Hispanic
defendants and lawyers at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   McDonald said the notes were never intended for the public and were being
misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't need to apologize for them because they were never intended to be
in a situation where they could be misunderstood,'' McDonald told The
Spokesman-Review.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the notes were provided to the newspaper by Kathryn Blankenship, who
sued over being fired in 1995 after spending nine years as McDonald's court
reporter in Yakima. A federal appeals court dismissed her 1997 lawsuit; she has
appealed.
</P>
<P>
	   McDonald said Blankenship had performance problems and has a vendetta
against him.
</P>
<P>
	   Other notes written by McDonald and Posada were given to the newspaper by
Spokane attorney William Powell, who had saved notes that he and another
attorney fished out of a wastebasket during a 1990 trial.
</P>
<P>
	   William Fremming Nielsen, chief judge for the federal district in eastern
Washington that includes Yakima, asked McDonald to explain the notes to The
Spokesman-Review and sat in on the interview.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he was satisfied with McDonald's explanations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any communication that's short is subject to misinterpretation,'' Nielsen
said.
</P>
<P>
	   McDonald, 72, was nominated for the lifetime judgeship by President Reagan
and confirmed by the Senate in 1985. He has been on senior status since December
1996, drawing his full $141,300 salary while handling a reduced caseload.
</P>
<P>
	   Making disparaging comments about people in court violates rules for federal
judges, said Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics expert at New York University
School of Law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Speaking generally, if the notes reflect religious or racial animosity or
demeaning comments, that's a violation of the code of professional conduct for
U.S. judges. There could be a sanction, including a public reprimand,'' Gillers
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blankenship told the newspaper that some of the notes passed between the
judge and Posada were also passed to her. One concerned a black plaintiff --
Jesse Jackson Jr., no relation to the civil rights leader -- in a trial in San
Diego where McDonald was a visiting judge.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson Jr. had been vice president of Imperial Savings Association, a
California S&AMP;L that failed in the 1980s. He sued Imperial in 1991 over his
firing, but McDonald ruled against him in a directed verdict, ending the trial
before it went to the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   In one note, which Blankenship said McDonald passed to her while Jackson was
testifying, the judge wrote, ``Ah is Im po tent!''
</P>
<P>
	   McDonald said the note referred to himself, not Jackson. ``This is a term of
self-deprecation that I employ,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another note, which could not be linked to a specific trial, referred to
Mormons and other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's been a con man for a long time!'' Posada wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge replied: ``Yes, and in my experience, a Mormon money man makes the
Jews and Chinese look like rank amateurs!''
</P>
<P>
	   In his interview with the newspaper, McDonald said: ``I'm sure that I made
the remark out of respect for the Mormons I know.''
</P>
<P>
	   Posada told The Spokesman-Review she couldn't comment because of rules for
courthouse employees. But she added that Blankenship was trying to use the
newspaper to ``harass the judge and embarrass the system, knowing that those of
us who know the truth can't be heard.''

<HEADLINE> Albright in Moscow To Size Up Putin  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Sunday that
Russia's acting president is ``riding a tiger'' by pushing a military offensive
against rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no question the war is popular,'' Albright told reporters as she
flew here to size up Vladimir Putin and push arms control.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright noted that casualties are mounting and said Russia faces more
isolation in the international arena as the war drags on. ``They have to hear
over and over again that this is not working for them,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said he was ``hoping to have a meaty session'' with Putin when they get
together this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Persistent U.S. appeals to Russian leaders to end the conflict and negotiate
with the Chechnya separatists have failed. Albright did not predict success this
time, either, and she ruled out U.S. economic sanctions if persuasion does not
work.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Albright said, ``It is very clear to me that Russia is hurting itself
because of Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
	   In what could turn out to be a tradeoff, Albright was ready to discuss sharp
cuts in U.S. and Russian long-range nuclear arsenals while urging Putin to
approve ``modest adjustments'' in a ban on missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before landing in Moscow, she said talk of such a tradeoff is
``hypothetical.''
</P>
<P>
	   A deal would make it easier for the Clinton administration to go forward
with a $6.6 billion plan for a defense against missiles fired from Iran, North
Korea or other countries the United States considers rogue states.
</P>
<P>
	   Before taking off, Albright warned in a speech to the World Economic Forum
that ``economic anxieties'' in countries with democratically elected governments
were prompting the people to turn to authoritarianism and other failed remedies.
</P>
<P>
	   She said life in parts of the former Soviet Union often is tougher for
ordinary people than when Communists ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A majority of citizens in these countries have come to equate democracy
with inequality, insecurity and the unraveling of the social fabric,'' she said.
``We are concerned that in many countries, the arrival of electoral democracy
has been accompanied by economic expectations that are, as yet, unfulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
	   Her scheduled meeting with Putin will be the first by a top-ranked U.S.
official since Boris Yeltsin quit as president New Year's Eve and named the
former KGB domestic intelligence chief as his successor. Elections are due in
three months.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright ``wants to get a firsthand assessment of how he intends to operate
now that he's the acting president, which brings additional responsibilities,''
the State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright has described him as a leading reformer, but also said the
administration was not ``starry-eyed'' about Russia's future.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia has registered its opposition to missile defense systems as
potentially fueling a race to develop more powerful nuclear weapons to overcome
them.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1972 U.S.-Russia treaty bans missile defenses, but the Clinton
administration wants to make changes in it to go ahead with its program.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Russia wants to go further than the United States has
proposed in cutting nuclear missile stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright intends to renew a U.S. pitch that the Russian parliament ratify
the 1993 START II treaty, which calls for reducing the U.S. and Russian arsenals
of long-range nuclear warheads to 3,000 to 3,500 apiece.
</P>
<P>
	   But even Yeltsin's endorsement failed to convince nationalists in the
parliament to approve the agreement. It also did not persuade some Russian
military chiefs who object to the treaty partly because it eliminates Russia's
edge in some weapons and would require large outlays to build allowable weapons
in other categories.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has proposed a follow-up START III treaty,
setting a ceiling for both Russia and the United States of 2,000 to 2,500
warheads. Russia wants even deeper cutbacks, possibly to 1,500 strategic
warheads on each side.
</P>
<P>
	   That could ease the economic strain of building up to allowable ceilings in
some weapons categories.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said these approaches have been under discussion with Russia for
several months, and the talks will continue during Albright's visit.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, he said, Albright would like to see Russia agree to
``modest adjustments'' in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that banned
national missile defenses on the theory that the prospect of devastating
retaliation would forestall a nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any recognition by Russia that amendments to the ABM treaty can be
accomplished without undermining the fundamental purpose of the ABM treaty would
be a welcome step in the right direction, because it would mean that they have
understood that there are dangers,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright also is bound again to register strong U.S. condemnation of the
Russian military assault on Chechnya, even while supporting Russia's authority
to counter terrorism and secession in the rebellious republic.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, she is to have three meetings with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
and to see Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Prince Saud, Saudi Arabia's
foreign minister. They will be in Moscow for a meeting Tuesday of Arab and
Israeli officials on ways to promote economic development of the region.
</P>
<P>
	   King Abdullah of Jordan said at the economic conference on Sunday that
economic cooperation is ``the way of the future'' in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> NJ drug, biotech firms have $10.3 billion impact on state  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The economic clout of the dozens of pharmaceutical
and biotechnology companies based in New Jersey continues to grow, an industry
survey shows.
<P>
	   Counting direct employment, outsourced research and manufacturing work, and
other jobs indirectly supported by the industry, the companies are responsible
for an estimated 141,145 jobs - many paying six-figure salaries - in 1998,
according to the most recent figures available.
</P>
<P>
	   The HealthCare Institute of New Jersey also credits the industry with a
total economic impact on the state of $10.3 billion, including wages and
benefits, payments to suppliers, capital expenses, charitable donations and
taxes. That's up from a total economic impact of $8.5 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   "A concentration of industry leaders in New Jersey's 'Cure Corridor' has
resulted in the state's preeminence in drug discovery and medical technology
development," said institute president William H. Tremayne.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey has long led the states in the percentage of new drugs developed,
and last year 42.5 percent of medicines approved for sale by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration were developed by New Jersey companies. Among those drugs
were fat-blocker Xenical, anti-inflammatory pill Vioxx and the first influenza
treatment, Tamiflu.
</P>
<P>
	   The institute represents 21 large manufacturers of medicines, medical
devices and other health care products, including Merck &AMP; Co., Johnson &AMP; Johnson
and Warner-Lambert Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey, conducted for the institute by the PricewaterhouseCoopers
accounting and consulting firm, also includes figures from 29 nonmember drug and
health care products companies, along with 110 biotechnology firms.
</P>
<P>
	   The member companies alone registered 2,381 patents and sponsored 2,937
clinical studies in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the survey, in 1998 those 21 companies supported 57,629
full-time jobs in-house. A total of 9,600 jobs at the smaller biotechnology and
nonmember health product companies, along with outsourced work - from marketing
and information technology consulting to research projects and manufacturing -
added another 43,716 jobs in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   "One of the more significant trends among member companies over the last few
years is the increasing use of external organizations to support all aspects of
their businesses. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future,
and to increase the number of jobs created through outsourcing," said Joseph
Palo, who directed the survey.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, PricewaterhouseCoopers determined that other spending by the
member and nonmember companies and their employees at other New Jersey
businesses indirectly supported about 39,800 jobs, including construction work,
for the 141,145 total.
</P>
<P>
	   All those totals are likely to keep growing, with at least two companies -
Peapack-based Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn and Aventis Pharmaceuticals, which is being
created by the merger of Europe's Hoechst AG and Rhone-Poulenc SA - announcing
plans to bring 2,000 more jobs to New Jersey this year and at least 1,100 more
over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Pharmaceutical and medical technology companies are providing, directly and
indirectly, excellent jobs for New Jersey residents, and the strength of the
industry is being felt throughout the state's economy," Tremayne said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the survey, the 21 companies represented by the institute paid
salary and bonuses averaging $80,223 per employee in 1998. The many well-paid
researchers at those pharmaceutical companies pulled up the average income,
which includes all workers down to janitors and secretaries, said state
institute spokeswoman Rebecca Perkins.

<HEADLINE> Ice Storm Hits Southeast Again  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Temperatures rose above freezing for the first time in two
days, melting ice from roadways just in time Sunday as thousands of football
fans trekked to the Georgia Dome for Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
	   Early Sunday, trees were ``popping like popcorn'' and power lines shorted
out as the second storm in a week spread rain and ice across Georgia and headed
up the East Coast. Up to 10 inches of snow was expected in parts of the
Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm, which earlier dumped more than a foot of snow in parts of the
southern Plains and the South, carried rain, snow and ice into the Carolinas,
Virginia and Maryland on its way toward New England.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges asked Sunday for $9.2 million in federal
disaster aid to help the state dig out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Snow and ice have pelted South Carolina for a week now,'' Hodges said
Sunday in his request to President Clinton. ``It's clear this unusual run of
winter storms is causing unexpected problems.''
</P>
<P>
	   Icy pavement and heavy fog in West Virginia contributed to a
multiple-vehicle crash that killed three people Sunday morning west of
Charleston, state police reported. Two weather-related traffic deaths were
reported in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   By late afternoon Sunday, western Maryland had six inches of new snow and
dozens of flights had been canceled at Baltimore-Washington International
Airport. In Virginia, almost 80,000 electricity customers lost power as
conditions worsened through the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia utilities reported as many as 50,000 customers lost power Sunday
across the central part of the state -- far fewer than the 500,000 customers who
faced blackouts after a storm that stunned North Carolina with nearly 2 feet of
snow roled through a week ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Georgia just doesn't get two ice storms in a week,'' said Phyllis Turner,
spokeswoman for the Georgia Transmission Corp. She said power line repairs were
slowed because ``we'll get one up and then have to go back when a tree brings it
down again.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The trees have been popping like popcorn down here,'' Mike Doster said
Sunday from his home in Griffin, about 35 miles south of Atlanta. ``Had I not
moved my station wagon yesterday, it would have been flattened.''
</P>
<P>
	   Utility officials said there isn't much they can do to avoid outages during
ice storms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are blessed in Georgia to have a beautiful green state with pine trees
and hardwoods, but they don't like ice, so ... there's not anything we can do
proactively to prevent it.'' said Michael Whiteside, president of the
Coweta/Fayette Electric Membership Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia roads were still icy Sunday morning, but the number of accidents was
down substantially from Saturday, when hundreds of crashes tied up traffic,
including a 47-car pileup at the junction of two interstates.
</P>
<P>
	   In South Carolina, power was knocked out to about 20,000 customers as the
freezing drizzle encrusted lines, cars and roads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think a lot of people heeded the warnings and kept off the roads,'' said
Christie Hamilton, a spokeswoman for the state's Emergency Preparedness
Division. There were few accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   North Carolina's two major utilities reported more than 11,000 customers
without electricity Sunday afternoon. National Guard members took generators to
a nursing home and some shelters that lost power, said Renee Hoffman of the
state Emergency Operations Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the storm made driving hazardous over the western two-thirds of
North Carolina, authorities said most motorists appeared to be staying home,
especially with some stores closed and church services canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think people are realizing that they shouldn't be on the roads if they

<HEADLINE> Ca. Residents Panic Over Test Siren  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. (AP) -- A test of a siren system to warn of a failure at
Casitas Dam sent panicked residents rushing for higher ground, trampling fences
and jamming streets.
</P>
<P>
	   People within a nine-mile area of the Ventura River valley heard blaring
sirens late Saturday afternoon and a voice from a loud speaker declaring: ``This
is an emergency. Head for high ground. You have one hour.''
</P>
<P>
	   Radio and newspaper announcements of the test appeared last week. And the
loud speaker warning was prefaced with the statement, ``This is a test,'' but
many people apparently did not hear it, said sheriff's Sgt. Larry Meyers.
</P>
<P>
	   Worse, the warning message malfunctioned and kept replaying, said Jeff
McCracken, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Residents in the area
about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles said it played for about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People were going crazy,'' said Dee Peterson. ``There were people in
wheelchairs trying to roll down the hill, mothers pushing their babies like mad
in strollers with blankets on top of their shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
	   Emergency telephone lines were jammed with anxious callers, and police and
sheriff's deputies were called out to help calm the panic.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Suggests Sharing Jerusalem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A top Israeli government official suggested Sunday that
Jerusalem could be shared with the Palestinians -- the first time Israel has
indicated willingness to compromise on one of the thorniest issues keeping the
sides from concluding a permanent peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh, who often speaks for Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, said Jerusalem's municipal boundaries could be expanded to
accommodate Palestinian aspirations for a presence in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if that meant a Palestinian presence in Jerusalem, Sneh told Israel
television, ``I don't want to commit,'' but immediately added: ``Teddy Kollek
wrote an article once on this and he called it `sharing united Jerusalem.'''
Kollek was a longtime mayor of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked where he would expand the borders, Sneh said eastward.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel captured traditionally Arab east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war
and, until now, Israeli governments have pledged never to divide the city.
Palestinians claim the eastern part of the city as their capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli officials have recently suggested that the Palestinians could
establish a capital in three Arab suburbs east of Jerusalem, but this was the
first time a senior government official offered to include the suburbs in an
expanded ``shared'' Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
	   That could allow the Palestinians to administer parts of the city where
Arabs still predominate. The Palestinian Authority has erected a large building
in one of the West Bank suburbs of the city, Abu Dis, which could function as a
parliament in a Palestinian capital.
</P>
<P>
	   By year's end, Palestinians and Israelis want to finish a final peace
agreement addressing the thorniest issues between them: Jewish settlements,
borders, Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees. They launched marathon talks Sunday
to meet a Feb. 13 deadline for an outline of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Likud opposition party immediately decried Sneh's comments as
capitulation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the name of God, what has become of us?'' said Michael Eitan, a Likud
legislator who appeared on the same interview program as Sneh. ``A deputy
defense minister of Israel is dividing Jerusalem before we even reached the
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
	   But even Eitan was willing to concede the West Bank suburbs of Jerusalem as
a Palestinian capital -- an on-the-record first for the hard-line Likud.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the Palestinians are willing to establish the center of authority
outside the borders of united Jerusalem, why should we oppose it?'' Eitan said.

<HEADLINE> 'The Pill' Might Prevent Acne Too  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Demand for one brand of "the pill" is soaring, but not for
the reason you think.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of Johnson &AMP; Johnson's Ortho Tri-Cyclen have tripled in the last three
years -- making it by far the No. 1 brand -- partly because it is the only oral
contraceptive that can also be sold as an acne fighter.
</P>
<P>
	   While medical ethicists doubt the double-duty pill is encouraging more young
girls to have sex, one says it may help them provide a "smokescreen" to their
parents -- allowing them to claim they want the drug for their acne when their
real aim is protection from pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sex and lying have a long history of association," said Arthur Caplan,
director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   The trend thrills family planning advocates, who welcome anything that
drives more women to use birth control to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anything that promotes the pill in a positive light is good for all of us,"
said Katie Kralovetz, a nurse practitioner with Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
	   Family planning advocates for years have tried to promote the lesser-known
health benefits of the pill, such as reducing the risk of ovarian cancer and
lessening menstrual cramps. But none has drawn as much attention as the pill's
effect on acne.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's like getting two drugs in one," said Darla Brown, 28, of Houston,
whose been on the pill for two years. "And it has worked wonders on my skin."
</P>
<P>
	   About 15 million U.S. women currently use oral contraceptives, the most
popular form of reversible birth control.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration gave J&AMP;J the right to sell Ortho Tri-Cyclen
for acne in 1997 after studies found it helped clear the skin of more than 80
percent of women who took it. The studies showed the pill decreased hormone
levels that trigger acne.
</P>
<P>
	   Although health experts say all oral contraceptives probably help fight
acne, only Ortho Tri-Cyclen has FDA clearance to advertise the added benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   That labeling difference has helped Johnson &AMP; Johnson to control about 40
percent of the oral contraceptive market, up from 30 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of Ortho Tri-Cyclen have risen from 330,000 prescriptions per month in
January 1997 to 1.2 million last November, according to IMS Health, a market
data firm.
</P>
<P>
	   The brand has leapfrogged from fourth place to first while sales of rival
pills, including other J&AMP;J brands, have largely been flat since 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   J&AMP;J has exploited the pill's pimple-fighting ability with ads in leading
women's magazines showing close ups of gorgeous models, promoting Ortho
Tri-Cyclen as "beauty aid" for women 15 and over.
</P>
<P>
	   Ortho Tri-Cyclen now outsells its closest competitor -- American Home
Products' Triphasil -- by a more than 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
	   J&AMP;J said the pill is still primarily for contraception, though executives
acknowledge some doctors may prescribe it mainly for acne on women who don't
respond to ointments.
</P>
<P>
	   Just 1 percent of prescriptions for Ortho Tri-Cyclen come from
dermatologists, said J&AMP;J spokesman Mark Monseau.
</P>
<P>
	   Ashley Wesson, 21, a college student in central Texas said she asked her
doctor last month if she could try the pill to help fight her acne. She was not
looking for birth control.
</P>
<P>
	   "Already, I've noticed small differences in how quickly my face heals," she
said.

<HEADLINE> GM's $560M Factory an Image Boost  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The $560 million factory that General Motors Corp.
will build in Lansing isn't just another assembly plant, but a dissertation on
six years of lessons learned the hard way.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant, plans for which were to be unveiled
Monday, is the first all-new factory built by GM in the United States since the
Saturn complex near Spring Hill, Tenn., in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   It's also GM's attempt to shed its reputation for bloated, old-school
manufacturing and prove it can build vehicles as efficiently as any other
automaker in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   "The concepts you have to have to compete are embedded in this plant," said
Donald Hackworth, director of GM's North American manufacturing. "Our vision is
to be a leader."
</P>
<P>
	   Here are three of those lessons, and how the world's largest automaker plans
to put them to use.
</P>
<P>
	   LESSON NO. 1: Work with workers, not against them.
</P>
<P>
	   GM has long been known for having the worst relationship with the United
Auto Workers union. The UAW's 1998 strike of GM parts plants in Flint cost the
company $1.5 billion; GM had suffered more strikes than Ford or Chrysler in the
1990s, as the company tried to shed unneeded plants and workers.
</P>
<P>
	   GM further antagonized the UAW early last year by announcing plans for
Project Yellowstone, a factory of the future where large sections of the vehicle
-- the entire front suspension, for example -- would be built by outside
suppliers, who tend to pay less and use fewer union workers.
</P>
<P>
	   GM hoped to use the plant to build the small cars it currently loses money
on, but suspended the plans after union officials said Yellowstone was simply a
fancy term for outsourcing jobs. When Hackworth briefed reporters about the new
plant last week, his first statement was: "Yellowstone's dead."
</P>
<P>
	   Since the strike, GM has been working to rebuild its relationship with the
UAW. Hackworth said the UAW locals have been involved from the start in planning
the new plant, and that one of the guiding principles for its design was taking
care of the worker.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of the usual foreman-line worker arrangement, the workers at Lansing
Grand River will be cast into teams, with team leaders and group supervisors.
Workers will be trained on a variety of tasks, and teams will be in charge of
their areas.
</P>
<P>
	   While the plant will be brand new, GM plans to hire no new workers, filling
the 1,500 jobs with workers from other plants near Lansing.
</P>
<P>
	   LESSON NO. 2: There's no shame in taking ideas from the best.
</P>
<P>
	   For many years, Japanese automakers have been the leaders in efficiency. The
Harbour Report, an annual survey of automakers' factories, found last year that
Nissan was spending an average of 19.2 hours to assemble a vehicle in its
American factories. GM took 31.6 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   So when GM decided to improve its manufacturing process in 1994, one of its
first moves was to import talent from Toyota, and to study the production lines
at the California factory the two automakers run together.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not embarrassed, at all, to steal any great idea from anyone,
including the competition, when we see it," said Tom LaSorda, GM's vice
president of quality, competitiveness and competitive operations implementation
and a former Toyota employee.
</P>
<P>
	   One of those ideas is the Japanese practice called "andon." When a problem
crops up on the assembly line, a team member can set off an alarm that lights up
a scoreboard-like display above the line, instead of leaving his post to track
down a foreman.
</P>
<P>
	   LESSON NO. 3: The future's never certain.
</P>
<P>
	   When the plant starts up in late 2001, it will have a capacity of 150,000
vehicles. Its first product will be a new version of the Cadillac Catera luxury
sedan. But it is capable of handling two more luxury vehicles on the same lines,
and can build cars, traditional trucks or a crossover sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
	   GM officials said making the plant as variable as possible was one of the
keys to helping GM compete.
</P>
<P>
	   "About three years out, we're wrong 100 percent of the time on predictions,"
Hackworth said. "It's very important to be flexible ... when you can't predict
what the consumer wants."
</P>
<P>
	   The plant was also designed to be friendly to the idea of build-to-order
systems. Automakers currently estimate how many vehicles they need to build,
then push dealers to sell the stock, often resorting to incentives to clear out
inventory. Many are studying ways to do what Dell did for computers -- building
only to customer orders, cutting the expenses of large inventories.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem has been the complexity of building vehicles with hundreds of
options and thousands of possible combinations. Hackworth said GM can deliver a
custom-ordered Cadillac in 18 days, but that automakers were working on cutting
the time down to as little as three days.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know how to do it. We know who the people are who don't know how to do
it," Hackworth said. "We don't know how to do it everyplace. But it's coming."

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways Jet Crashes Into Sea  </HEADLINE>
   By TIM SULLIVAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- A Kenya Airways jet carrying 169 passengers and
10 crew members crashed into the sea Sunday night, shortly after taking off from
Abidjan, airport officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear if there were any survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, an Airbus 310, took off at 9:08 p.m. and crashed just one minute
later, according to George Dapre Yao, the head of air traffic at Abidjan's Felix
Houphouet-Boigny Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, which was en route to Lagos, Nigeria, carried 167 adults
passengers and two children, Yao said. A Kenya Airways official said the plane's
final destination was Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
	   Search efforts were concentrated on a beach about 1 mile east of the
airport. Late Sunday night, the beach was jammed with hundreds of people
including soldiers, police officers, firefighters and onlookers.
</P>
<P>
	   Police boats cruised the Atlantic immediately off the beach and a helicopter
chattered noisily overhead.
</P>
<P>
	   An official at the airport's control tower, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said French military firefighters, who are stationed at a French
military base next to the airport, had also been dispatched to the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   A few times, cheers rippled through the crowds and people rushed to the
water's edge after hearing word that survivors had been found. But each time,
the reports turned out to be false.
</P>
<P>
	   Anne Yeze was worshipping at the Celestial Christian Church, a
concrete-and-metal building just off the beach, when the plane slammed into the
water nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were praying and we heard a noise, like something hitting the water,''
she said. The parishioners rushed outside but did not see any evidence of a
downed plane. They then called the airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Philippe Kuoakuo, a young man who lives in the area, said saw the plane come
down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I heard it hit the water twice,'' said Kuoakuo, who was watching the
rescue operations late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Abidjan airport is just a few hundred yards from the Atlantic Ocean. The
control tower official said that wreckage of the plane could not be seen, but
the area where the plane had crashed was visible from the tower.

<HEADLINE> 4 Tried in 'Date-Rape Drug' Death  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM SUHR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Samantha Reid's mother remembers the time when her daughter,
at age 10, saved her allowance for weeks to throw her a surprise birthday party,
even inviting 30 friends she found in her mom's address book.
</P>
<P>
	   Judi Clark recalls how even as a teen-ager, Samantha would meet her at the
door each night and ask about her day at work.
</P>
<P>
	   The last memory she has of her daughter is from a year ago, when Samantha,
at 15, lay comatose, poisoned by the ``date-rape drug'' GHB, and doctors said it
was time to let her go.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They said `We keep bringing her back, and she keeps dying. We've brought
her back three times, and she's died three times. How many times do you want to
let her keep dying?''' says Ms. Clark, her voice quaking.
</P>
<P>
	   GHB -- gamma-hydroxybutyrate -- is an odorless and nearly tasteless drug
linked to at least 58 deaths and more than 5,700 overdoses nationwide since
1990. Public sales are banned by the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, in one of the nation's first trials resulting from a GHB-related
death, jury selection begins for the manslaughter trial of four men accused of
slipping the drug into Samantha's soft drink at a party.
</P>
<P>
	   The four defendants, all of suburban Detroit, are Erick Limmer, 26, Joshua
Cole, 19, Daniel Brayman, 18, and Nicholas Holtschlag. They are charged with
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say young people often believe that GHB and other ``club drugs''
aren't ``real drugs'' like cocaine, or they take them unknowingly as Samantha
did. Recipes and ingredients -- some of them common household products -- are
easily available from the Internet and other sources.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of people who use them believe they are benign drugs and don't see
them for what they are -- taken under some circumstances, life-threatening,''
says Alan Leshner, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   From the start, Samantha was on the go. ``Hammy Sammy,'' they called the
attention-craving youngster even before her first birthday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If there was no action happening, she'd make it happen,'' her mother says.
</P>
<P>
	   Allowances often went to help pay her friends' way into movies. She
befriended children who other kids ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She loved to make other people happy,'' Ms. Clark says. ``She was there
for the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mother and daughter talked often and openly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I told her about people slipping stuff into drinks, but it was never
something I harped on because she was only 15,'' Ms. Clark says. ``When you
think of Rohypnol (another date-rape drug), you think of bars. You never dream,
my God, it's going to happen to a 15-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   In January 1999, Samantha, two friends and four guys they'd just met went to
a party on Grosse Ile, an affluent island community in the Detroit River.
</P>
<P>
	   Samantha was handed a soft drink and moments later she was vomiting and
unconscious.
</P>
<P>
	   Her best friend, then 14, drank what she believed to be orange juice and
vodka, felt herself ``getting drunk pretty quick'' and also lost consciousness.
The third girl escaped serious effects.
</P>
<P>
	   An attorney for Cole says his client spiked the drinks with what he believed
was only a harmless intoxicant. Brayman and Holtschlag say they were unaware GHB
was even present. Limmer says he was gone or in his bedroom most of the night
the girls were drugged.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   GHB, originally developed as a surgical anesthetic, is sometimes used as an
aphrodisiac, or a weight loss aid, or by body builders as a supplement. It's
hard to trace, often out of the body within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   It can make users feel euphoric. It also can lead to breathing problems,
seizures, long-term effects on the brain, coma and death.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This has become the upscale, inclusive social scene thing to do,'' says
Arthur Dean of the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America.
</P>
<P>
	   A person who drinks a soda laced with a few drops of GHB can lose
consciousness within 20 minutes and have no memory of what happened, hence its
reputation as a ``date-rape drug'' used to render women helpless against sexual
advances.
</P>
<P>
	   GHB-related hospital emergency visits have rocketed nationally from 20 in
1992 to 1,283 in 1998, according to the Drug Abuse Warning Network.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Institute on Drug Abuse opened an Internet site at
www.clubdrugs.org and sends information cards and brochures to community groups
and schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're trying to stave off what could become the equivalent of a public
health plague,'' the institute's Leshner says.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Clark is working with a planned task force that would campaign against
date-rape drugs, saying it could be Samantha's legacy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just miss her energy. I miss her friendship,'' she says, her voice
cracking again.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She kept me young.''

<HEADLINE> Cuba Welcomes Elian's Grandmothers  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers arrived back in Cuba on Sunday
without the child they had hoped to bring home, but they were greeted as heroes
nonetheless with an enormous government-organized parade through the streets of
the Cuban capital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's very sad,'' said the boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez,
breaking down in tears before President Fidel Castro and 1,700 schoolchildren
who greeted the grandmothers at Havana's Convention Palace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You are here and Elian cannot be because we could not bring him,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before leaving Dulles International Airport in suburban Washington on
Sunday, Elian's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, said the boy would never
be happy growing up in the United States ``because he grew up in Cuba. ... He is
a Cuban boy. He has a father. He has four grandparents and an entire family back
there.''
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, embraced the women as they stepped
off a business jet at Jose Marti International Airport, then rode with them in a
convertible as they waved at the crowds of hundreds of thousands of people
holding Cuban flags in a scene reminiscent of the 1998 greeting for Pope John
Paul II.
</P>
<P>
	   After an hourlong, 16-mile trip through Havana by motorcade, the two women
wept as the children greeted them with cheers of ``Free Elian!'' at the
Convention Palace.
</P>
<P>
	   Flanked by their extended families, the women heard children chant poems and
sing songs in their honor.
</P>
<P>
	   Government television and radio stations, which broadcast the event live,
had repeatedly announced the route of the ``caravan of dignity,'' and newspapers
published schedules for special buses to take people to it. The event had been
announced less than 24 hours before it took place.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the national soccer championship game, which had been scheduled for
Sunday in Havana, was postponed for a week so players and spectators could
attend the event.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers were returning after ``brave and extraordinary work in the
United States, overcoming great obstacles and transmitting a persuasive message
to the U.S. people,'' said a government statement published on the front pages
of all newspapers here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found floating in an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25
after a boat wreck that killed his mother and 10 other people. He has been
staying with a great-uncle in Florida ever since. His Florida relatives are
seeking to keep Elian in the United States, while his father and other relatives
in Cuba are fighting to get him back.
</P>
<P>
	   The little boy also is caught in the midst of a major propaganda battle
between Castro's communist government and Cuban-American exile groups. Some of
the exile groups have complained that the boy should not return to his father
because it would be a victory for the Cuban leader.
</P>
<P>
	   The struggle over Elian has become one of the largest government campaigns
in recent Cuban history, with daily events, some drawing massive crowds, to
demand the child's return to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the two grandmothers left Havana on Jan. 21, the government has given
increasingly massive television and newspaper coverage to their tour of the
United States, crediting them with helping sway U.S. public opinion toward
Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The heroic behavior of these humble and good-natured grandmothers has
gained the respect, the admiration of the people who will await them with a warm
and massive reception,'' the government's statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The women -- until recently obscure housewives from the provincial city of
Cardenas -- have found themselves on worldwide television meeting congressmen,
senators and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think we have a step forward but still my grandson is here,''
Rodriguez, the maternal grandmother, said before leaving Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would like to thank the American people and the Cuban Americans who are
here and who have helped us,'' she said. ``We would like to remind them to keep
helping us, because Elian is still here.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled Elian should be
returned to his father. But officials are awaiting the outcome of a federal
court challenge filed by Miami relatives before trying to return the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler will hear arguments Feb. 22 on whether
the Miami relatives' lawsuit should be dismissed.

<HEADLINE> NH Poll: Half Say Issues Important  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About half of the likely New Hampshire primary voters
cite a candidate's position on issues as the most important factor in deciding
who should be president, although no one issue dominated, a new poll says.
</P>
<P>
	   And, three days before the first presidential primary Tuesday, at least a
third of all likely voters said they had yet to make a firm decision, the polls
suggest.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican race has tightened to a dead heat in many polls between Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain, as Bush wins increased backing from
previously undecided Republicans, pollsters say. On the Democratic side, Vice
President Al Gore has built a lead by pulling even with Bill Bradley among two
groups of voters -- independents and men -- where Bradley had been the
strongest, though that lead has narrowed in the last couple of days.
</P>
<P>
	   REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain, the Arizona senator, are tied in several of the latest
pre-primary polls, while McCain holds a slim lead in a couple of others.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked in a Boston Herald-WCVB poll which issue is the most important in
their decision, 15 percent chose the economy, 13 percent chose taxes and 12
percent picked education. Social Security-Medicare and moral issues each were
chosen by 11 percent of respondents, followed by 9 percent who said abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   The quality selected most often by likely Republican voters is a candidate
who stands up for what he believes, followed by a strong and decisive leader, in
a University of New Hampshire-WMUR-Fox News tracking poll. Only 4 percent said
having the best chance of winning in November is most important, something Bush
supporters have used as an argument to support their candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Among conservatives, neither Steve Forbes nor Alan Keyes has made much
progress in New Hampshire after strong showings in Iowa, with Forbes in the
teens in the polls and Keyes still in single digits. Gary Bauer was at about 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The stakes in New Hampshire were underlined by a new South Carolina poll by
Time-CNN showing Bush with a large, but shrinking lead over McCain, 52 percent
to 32 percent, in a state with a crucial Republican primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
	   Gore built a lead in most polls from the days leading up to the Iowa
caucuses Jan. 24 to the days just after. His lead was in double digits in
several polls until a recent Bradley surge brought it back under 10 points. Gore
led 48-41 in the Boston Globe-WBZ-TV poll, 48-39 in the Boston Herald-WCVB poll
and 53-42 in the UNH-WMUR-Fox News poll. The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll taken
Saturday and Sunday showed a 51-45 edge for Gore, while an MSNBC poll gave him a
49-37 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Each candidate's base of support has shifted somewhat,'' said R. Kelly
Myers, the pollster for the Herald-WCVB poll. He said Gore has closed the gap
among independents and men, while Bradley was getting stronger support from more
liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   When likely voters were asked which issue was most important in their
decision, 22 percent said education, 20 percent chose health care, 16 percent
each picked Social Security-Medicare and the economy, and 8 percent said
abortion, according to the Herald-WCVB poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore led Bradley by 18 points among those who viewed health care as the top
issue, by 25 points among those who picked education and 28 points among those
who chose Social Security-Medicare, according to the Herald-WCVB poll.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Herald-WCVB poll was taken Wednesday and Thursday of 403 likely
Democratic primary voters and 402 likely Republican voters. The Boston Globe-WBZ
poll was taken Friday and Saturday of 400 likely voters in each primary. Both
polls taken for the Boston newspapers had error margins of plus or minus 5
percentage points. The UNH-WMUR-Fox News poll was taken Wednesday through
Saturday of 487 likely voters in the Republican primary, with an error margin of
4 percentage points, and 340 likely voters in the Democratic primary, with an
error margin of 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The CNN-USA Today poll of 911 likely Republican primary voters and 716
likely Democratic voters was taken Saturday and Sunday and had an error margin
of plus or minus 3 percentage points for Republicans and 4 percentage points for
Democrats. The MSNBC poll was taken of 502 likely Republican primary voters and
501 likely Democratic voters on Saturday and Sunday and has an error margin of
plus or minus 4.5 percentage points for each group.

<HEADLINE> US-NKorea High Level Talks Planned  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Accelerating an improvement in relations, North Korea will
send a senior official to Washington in March for high-level talks with the
Clinton administration, the State Department said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The visit is designed to match talks former Defense Secretary William Perry
held in Pyongyang last year as a special Clinton administration emissary.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea's deputy foreign minister, Kim Gye Gwan, and U.S. Envoy Charles
Kartman reached agreement for the North Korean visit during talks in Berlin that
ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides will work out the details next month in New York, the State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin added in an announcement made aboard
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's plane as she flew from Switzerland to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials said there was no decision yet on who the North
Korean government would send to Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement is another step in U.S. efforts to coax North Korea out of its
isolation and to neutralize its nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, North Korea agreed to shelve its nuclear weapons program in
exchange for energy supplies from the United States, Japan and South Korea, and
has agreed to stop missile tests so long as discussions on a better relationship
continue.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States reciprocated by suspending some economic sanctions, but
North Korea is still listed by the State Department as a sponsor of terrorism.
This has the effect of prohibiting virtually all but humanitarian aid to
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
	   Likely topics of discussion at the March talks are ongoing diplomatic
efforts to officially end the Korean war, missile arsenals and terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways Jet Crashes Into Sea  </HEADLINE>
   By TIM SULLIVAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- A Kenya Airways jet carrying 169 passengers and
10 crew members crashed into the sea Sunday night, shortly after taking off from
Abidjan, airport officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, an Airbus 310, took off at 9:08 p.m. and crashed just one minute
later, according to George Dapre Yao, the head of air traffic at Abidjan's Felix
Houphouet-Boigny Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, which was en route to Lagos, Nigeria, carried 167 adults
passengers and two children, Yao said. A Kenya Airways official said the plane's
final destination was Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said the plane never appeared to get sufficient altitude as it
crossed over the airport's wall and headed out over the ocean, just a few
hundred yards away.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I saw it take off,'' said an itinerant trader who goes by the name
Alogouleta. ``After it went over the wall, it was still very low. Then it hit
the water. I heard the sound two times,'' as the plane slammed into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he heard no explosion, saw no flames and that the plane did not veer
as it flew overhead.
</P>
<P>
	   Emergency officials -- firefighters, police officers, soldiers and divers --
were combing the beach near the crash scene late Sunday night, about 1 mile east
of the airport, but had found no survivors or corpses. Police boats cruised the
Atlantic off the beach and a helicopter chattered noisily overhead, scanning the
dark ocean with a bright searchlight.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of people, who live nearby or were praying in churches along the
beach road, heard the plane slam into the water.
</P>
<P>
	   A few immediately jumped into the water, hoping to get to survivors, but
were quickly driven back by the harsh surf that slams noisily into the white
sand beach.
</P>
<P>
	   A few times late Sunday, cheers rippled through the crowds and people rushed
to the water's edge after hearing word that survivors had been found. But each
time, the reports turned out to be false.
</P>
<P>
	   Anne Yeze was worshipping at the Celestial Christian Church, a
concrete-and-metal building just off the beach, when the plane crashed into the
water nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were praying and we heard a noise, like something hitting the water,''
she said. The parishioners rushed outside but did not see any evidence of a
downed plane. They then called the airport.
</P>
<P>
	   An official at the airport's control tower, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said French military firefighters, who are stationed at a French
military base next to the airport, had also been dispatched to the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was clear in Abidjan at the time of the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The control tower official said that wreckage of the plane could not be
seen, but the area where the plane had crashed was visible from the tower.

<HEADLINE> Dominica Election Tinged With Anger  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE FAUL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROSEAU, Dominica (AP) -- On an island known for virgin forests and
glittering waterfalls, opposition politicians are fighting to unseat a
government they accuse of corrupting Dominica's image by selling passports to
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
	   About 60,000 people are registered to choose 21 legislators in Monday's
vote. The leader of the party with the most seats usually becomes prime
minister, and newspapers suggest the contest will be tight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the government is doing with the rampant selling of passports to
criminals and criminal gangs all over the world is to eventually establish
Dominica as a center for international crime,'' said Bernard Wiltshire, a leader
of the opposition Dominica Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``International gangs would control our government from behind the scenes to
subvert the independence and freedoms of our people,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
	   The charges have angered Prime Minister Edison James, whose United Workers
Party is seeking a second term. At a rally Saturday night he called the
elections an ``all-out war.''
</P>
<P>
	   James said there is no evidence that ``economic citizens'' sold passports
for $50,000 -- many of whom are Russian or Chinese -- are criminals. His party
has tried to focus attention on its record of building new homes, schools and
roads, and economic growth of 3.5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Like several Caribbean countries, this former British colony started selling
passports under programs linked to offshore banking centers in the early 1990s,
as aid from traditional donors dried up and the banana industry collapsed under
a U.S. challenge to preferential trade rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and other countries have attacked the Caribbean's
secretive offshore industry and passport sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Concern has grown among the island's residents since November, when Canada
detained several Chinese carrying passports from Dominica on suspicion that they
were involved in an immigration smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
	   James denied Labor Party claims that Canada is considering introducing visa
requirements for Dominica passport holders. He said Canada is considering
``special treatment'' for the economic citizens -- a move that should diminish
the value of the citizenship prized for the ease with which passport holders
travel to North America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Such restrictions on that travel likely would upset islanders, especially
since at least 100,000 live in North America and Britain, compared to an
estimated 80,000 on the island.

<HEADLINE> Gas Tank Explosion Kills Teen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORA VISTA, N.M. (AP) -- A gas tank explosion that killed one teen-ager and
critically injured another was apparently caused when one of the boys threw a
cigarette lighter into the 12,000-gallon tank, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shiloh Gallegos, 16, was killed in the explosion, and 15-year-old
Christopher Gillaspy suffered burns to 25 to 30 percent of his body, said a
spokesman for University Hospital in Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheriff's Sgt. Scott Eckstein said it appears the boys were playing atop the
tank and one of them threw a lighter into it, causing it to explode at 5:30 p.m
Saturday. The tank was about one-third full with a fuel known as ``drip gas,'' a
liquid form of natural gas, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It ignited and the lid was blown off,'' Eckstein said. ``The victim was
thrown about 90 feet. The other victim tore off his burning shirt and ran for
help. I don't know what they were doing up there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Eckstein said it appears that Gillaspy was not standing directly on the lid
when it blew.
</P>
<P>
	   The blast shook the northwestern New Mexico home of Leona and Dalton King.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All I saw was the tank on fire,'' said King. ``It was melting that tank.
It was pretty red.''
</P>
<P>
	   Eckstein said there was no fence surrounding the tank, but he did see
warning signs stating it was a hard hat area.

<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - One man was killed and 31 others escaped an early
morning fire that ripped through a two-story apartment building, officials said.
<P>
	   Samuel Donegan died when a fire broke out around 3:30 a.m. inside his
first-floor apartment on Davis Avenue, said Camden Police Lt. Joseph Richardson.
</P>
<P>
	   "The victim couldn't get out because of bars on the windows," Richardson
said. "Folks left without shoes or clothing, but no one was hurt."
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said the fire was accidental, but the cause is under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were candles in the apartment, but we don't know if that caused the
fire," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Donegan's girlfriend told officials he was asleep when the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know if she couldn't get to him, but she helped a man in a
wheelchair escape," Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Firefighters from Camden and neighboring departments fought the blaze, which
was brought under control shortly after 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   The 31 residents living in the two-story apartment building were sheltered
temporarily in an unoccupied apartment building nearby, then moved into a hotel
in Cherry Hill, Richardson said. He was unsure when residents would be able to
return to their apartments because of extensive smoke and fire damage.

	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Mel Bolden, an artist and political activist who once
designed a Christmas card for President Carter, died over the weekend. He was
81.
</P>
<P>
	   Bolden was a former member of the state's Commission for Human Rights. He
also was known for his paintings of Christa McAuliffe, the Concord teacher
killed in the 1986 Challenger explosion.
</P>
<P>
	   Bolden was born in Baltimore, son of a pressman for black newspapers. He
attended Philadelphia College of Art and moved in 1945 to New York, where he
worked as a freelance illustrator. He moved to New Hampshire with his wife,
Gwen, in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
	   In the late 1960s, Bolden was elected Democratic Party chairman for
Merrimack County, the only black Democratic county chairman in the country at
the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Bolden designed posters for former Gov. Hugh Gallen's political campaigns

<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Thomas ``Beans'' Bowles, who played the saxophone and flute
on several Motown hits, died Friday of prostate cancer. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
	   In Detroit, Bowles worked various jazz clubs, including Sonny Wilson's
Forest Club and the Flame Showbar where he played with Billie Holiday and Billy
Eckstine before landing a management job with Motown.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowles contributed to several classic Motown hits, including Marvin Gaye's
``Stubborn Kind of Fellow'' and ``What's Goin On,'' Martha and the Vandellas'
``Heat Wave'' and the Supremes' hit ``Baby Love.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bowles created the ``Motown Revue'' along with Ester Gordy Edwards, a sister
of Motown Records founder Berry Gordy Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He left quite a legacy here,'' Teddy Harris, a Motown pianist, said of
Bowles. ``It's going to be a big hole left in the musical community. He's going
to be quite missed around here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bowles moved to Detroit from his hometown of South Bend, Ind., in 1944 to
study at Wayne State University. He then left school and played in a Navy band,

Harold H. Greene
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene, who oversaw the
breakup of AT&AMP;T as a jurist and played a key role in shaping two of the nation's
landmark civil rights laws as a government attorney, died Saturday of a cerebral
hemorrhage. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
	   Greene spent more than three decades as a judge on District of Columbia and
federal courts, presiding over hundreds of cases. But his name is most attached
to the 1984 AT&AMP;T breakup, the largest antitrust case in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
	   For years afterward, he continued to supervise the consent decree that broke
``Ma Bell'' into seven regional operating companies, helping to spark the
technological revolution that has transformed telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
	   Americans, as a result, now can shop for the best price for long-distance
service and buy their own phones instead of renting them forever.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, as a senior Justice Department attorney, Greene drafted much of the
1965 Voting Rights Act as well as the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
	   Born Heinz Gruenhaus in Frankfurt, Germany, in February 1923, Greene became
a U.S. citizen and Americanized his name after his Jewish parents fled Germany
in 1939.
</P>
<P>
	   He earned his law degree at night at George Washington University, became an
assistant U.S. attorney and later moved to Justice Department headquarters,
heading the Civil Rights Division's appeals and research section.
</P>
<P>
	   Greene took senior status on the District Court with a reduced workload on
Aug. 6, 1995, 30 years to the day after President Johnson named him to the
District of Columbia Court of General Sessions. In 1978, President Carter
promoted him to the federal bench from the chief judgeship of the D.C. Court of
Appeals.

	   He said he heard no explosion, saw no flames and that the plane didn't veer
as it flew overhead.
</P>
<P>
	   Emergency officials -- firefighters, police officers, soldiers and divers --
were combing the beach near the crash scene late Sunday night, about 1 mile east
of the airport, but had found no survivors or corpses. Police boats cruised the
Atlantic off the beach and a helicopter chattered noisily overhead, scanning the
dark ocean with a bright searchlight.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of people, who live nearby or were praying in churches along the
beach road, heard the plane slam into the water.
</P>
<P>
	   A few immediately jumped into the water, hoping to get to survivors, but
were quickly driven back by the harsh surf that slams noisily into the white
sand beach.
</P>
<P>
	   A few times late Sunday, cheers rippled through the crowds and people rushed
to the water's edge after hearing reports that survivors had been found. But
each time, the reports turned out to be false.
</P>
<P>
	   Anne Yeze was worshipping at the Celestial Christian Church, a
concrete-and-metal building just off the beach, when the plane crashed into the
water nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were praying and we heard a noise, like something hitting the water,''
she said. The parishioners rushed outside, but couldn't see the crash. They then
called the airport.
</P>
<P>
	   An official at the airport's control tower said French military
firefighters, who are stationed at a French military base next to the airport,
had also been dispatched to the scene. The French Foreign Ministry in Paris
confirmed that a Marine infantry battalion was taking part in the rescue
operation.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was clear in Abidjan at the time of the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The control tower official said that wreckage of the plane could not be
seen, but the area where the plane had crashed was visible from the tower.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Down in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks fell in early trading Monday following a decline
on Wall Street on Friday. The U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 119.05 points, or 0.61
percent, to 19,315.73 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Friday, the average
closed up 225.06 points, or 1.17 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was quoted at 106.86 yen, up 2.00 yen from its level of 104.86
yen Friday in Tokyo but below its level of 106.98 yen in New York late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Tokyo stock market, the Nikkei declined after Wall Street investors
sold shares Friday on fresh fears of a U.S. interest rate increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors are worried that the U.S. Federal Reserve will try to contain
inflationary pressures by raising interest rates at its meeting this week,
curbing business expansion by making it more expensive to borrow money. There
also are worries that the Fed will raise rates again later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Banks, industrial and technology companies posted the largest drops.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index on Friday suffered its
second-biggest point drop ever as investors dumped shares in usually popular
Qualcomm, Intel and Oracle.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average on Friday tumbled 289.15 points, or 2.6
percent, to 10,738.87, its lowest level since Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first-section companies was down
0.89 points in the early going Monday, or 0.05 percent, at 1,701.72. The TOPIX
rose 16.71 points, or 0.99 percent, to 1,702.61 Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, the dollar rose against the yen, after falling Friday
amid a selloff of the euro to acquire the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar had been pulled down against the yen because euro holders first
bought dollars, which were then sold to buy yen.
</P>
<P>
	   Early Friday in Tokyo, the euro was quoted at 104.76 yen, up from 103.34 yen
late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was unchanged
from its Friday finish of 1.6600 percent. Its price remained 100.34.

<HEADLINE> Train Crashes Into Home, 1 Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Md. (AP) -- A coal train derailed Sunday morning near the
Maryland-West Virginia border and one car plowed into a house, killing a
teen-age boy and injuring four members of his family.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of rescue workers with dogs searched through spilled coal, rubble
and snow before finding the body of Eddie Lee Rogers, 15, in the remnants of the
living room about 12 hours after the crash, state police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-six of the train's 80 cars, each carrying 120 tons of coal, derailed
about 7 a.m. in this small Potomac River town, CSX spokesman Gary Wollenhaupt
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Coal and debris pelted the two-story house, which was pushed 25 feet off its
foundation by the impact of the derailed car. The cause of the derailment was
not immediately determined.
</P>
<P>
	   Rescue workers extricated the boy's mother, Libby A. Holstein, 35; her
daughter Brandy N. Holstein, 18; Eugene F. Liller, 32; and his daughter Amanda
M. Liller, 13. Mrs. Holstein was in serious condition at Cumberland Memorial
Hospital. State police said the others were not seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The two crew members on the train were not hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   The train was eastbound from Grafton, W.Va., to Cumberland on a route used
primarily for coal and merchandise traffic. Wollenhaupt said it could take days
to get the cars back on the track and weeks to remove the spilled coal.

<HEADLINE> Storm Strikes Southeast Second Time  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A winter storm that glazed much of the Southeast in a thick
coat of ice moved up the coast on Sunday, leaving warmer temperatures and drier
roads for thousands of football fans who trekked to Georgia Dome to watch the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm brought snow, sleet and rain from the Carolinas to southeastern
New York, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The same storm had dumped more than a foot of snow in parts of the southern
Plains and the South just days earlier. It was expected to reach western Maine
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   By Sunday evening, six inches of snow had fallen in western Maryland and
dozens of flights were canceled at Baltimore-Washington International Airport.
In Virginia, more than 150,000 electricity customers lost power as conditions
worsened through the day.
</P>
<P>
	   In eastern Pennsylvania, where drivers were still sliding on side streets
slick with ice from a storm earlier in the week, up to 12 inches of snow were
expected overnight. The Legislature canceled its Monday sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   A mix of snow, freezing rain and sleet was expected across Connecticut,
Massachusetts and Rhode Island through Monday night, with accumulations of as
much as eight inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the icy conditions made driving hazardous, North Carolina
authorities said there were few accidents and most motorists appeared to be
staying home Sunday, especially with some stores closed and church services
canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think people are realizing that they shouldn't be on the roads if they
don't know how to drive in it,'' said Penny Roark, a dispatcher in Watauga
County, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   North Carolina's two major utilities reported more than 11,000 customers
without electricity Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   In Georgia early Sunday, trees were ``popping like popcorn'' and power lines
shorted out under the weight of the ice.
</P>
<P>
	   Temperatures rose above freezing for the first time in two days, clearing
off roads that had been so icy Saturday even walking had been treacherous. Both
the Tennessee Titans and the St. Louis Rams canceled plans to practice in the
Georgia Dome on Saturday after hundreds of accidents were reported, including a
47-car pileup.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges requested $9.2 million in federal disaster
aid to help his state dig out. Power was knocked out to about 20,000 customers
as the freezing drizzle encrusted lines, cars and roads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Snow and ice have pelted South Carolina for a week now,'' Hodges said in
his request to President Clinton. ``It's clear this unusual run of winter storms
is causing unexpected problems.''
</P>
<P>
	   Icy pavement and heavy fog in West Virginia contributed to a
multiple-vehicle crash that killed three people Sunday morning west of
Charleston, state police reported. Two weather-related traffic deaths were
reported in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia utilities reported as many as 50,000 customers lost power across the
central part of the state -- far fewer than the 500,000 customers who faced
blackouts after a storm that stunned North Carolina with nearly 2 feet of snow
roled through a week ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Georgia just doesn't get two ice storms in a week,'' said Phyllis Turner,
spokeswoman for the Georgia Transmission Corp. She said power line repairs were
slowed because ``we'll get one up and then have to go back when a tree brings it
down again.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The trees have been popping like popcorn down here,'' Mike Doster said
Sunday from his home in Griffin, about 35 miles south of Atlanta. ``Had I not
moved my station wagon yesterday, it would have been flattened.''

<HEADLINE> Austin, Phoenix Judged Best Cities  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL SHEPARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With robust finances and well-trained public work forces,
Austin, Texas, and Phoenix are the best-managed major American cities, according
to an analysis by Syracuse University.
</P>
<P>
	   The study rated the municipal governments of the nation's 35 largest cities
in terms of revenues, assigning grades from A to F on five management criteria:
finances, human resources, capital, information technology and results.
</P>
<P>
	   Phoenix was the only one with an A or A- in all five categories. Austin
finished with an A- average because of a B grade on its use of information
technology.
</P>
<P>
	   Indianapolis, Minneapolis and Virginia Beach, Va., averaged B+. New York,
Philadelphia, Honolulu, Milwaukee, San Diego, San Antonio, Seattle and Long
Beach, Calif., all had Bs.
</P>
<P>
	   A common factor in cities that scored well was strong leadership, said
Patricia W. Ingraham, director of the Government Performance Project at
Syracuse's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. The project was
financed by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Where there is a strong mayor, there is a well-run city, which attracts
residents and visitors,'' Ingraham said. ``Contrary to what many of us think,
the days of mediocre city management are coming to an end.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said the most improved cities are those that were in the worst shape
five to eight years ago -- Detroit, Philadelphia, New York and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit, for example, has earned nine upgrades from bond rating agencies.
Washington has eliminated its debt, and Philadelphia is tracking its revenues
and expenditures better after both cities flirted with bankruptcy, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York, the first major city to use technology for organizing
crime-fighting efforts, was praised for establishing a World Wide Web site that
allows it citizens to apply for licenses and permits through the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways Jet Crashes Into Sea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- A Kenya Airways jet carrying 169 passengers and
10 crew members crashed into the sea Sunday night, shortly after taking off from
Abidjan, airport officials said. At least seven people survived.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, an Airbus 310, took off at 9:08 p.m. and crashed just one minute
later, according to George Dapre Yao, the head of air traffic at Abidjan's Felix
Houphouet-Boigny Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya Airways Flight 431, which was en route to Lagos, Nigeria, carried 167
adults passengers and two children, Yao said. Kenya Airways officials said the
plane's final destination was Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
	   Six or seven survivors were found early Monday floating in the wreckage off
Abidjan and were being taken to an area hospital, said Raymond Kesse, an
official with the Ivorian Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, another survivor, a Frenchman, was brought to the same hospital
with cuts and bruises.

<HEADLINE> Kurt Warner Is Super Bowl MVP  </HEADLINE>
    By HAL BOCK AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Kurt Warner's storybook season ended with the ultimate
exclamation point Sunday -- a record-breaking Super Bowl MVP performance.
</P>
<P>
	   The quarterback who once tossed rolls of toilet paper around an Iowa
supermarket, threw passes just as easily in the glare of pro football's most
dramatic setting, picking apart Tennessee's secondary and leading the St. Louis
Rams to the NFL championship, 23-16.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner completed 18 passes for 277 yards in the first half alone, with six
straight completions in one drive, and set a Super Bowl halftime record for
attempts with 35.
</P>
<P>
	   He constructed a 16-0 lead. Then, when Tennessee made a furious second-half
comeback to tie the score, he won the game with a 73-yard touchdown pass to
Isaac Bruce.
</P>
<P>
	   That gave him a record 414 yards for the game, breaking Hall of Famer Joe
Montana's record of 357.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner was following in the Super Bowl successes of high profile passers
such as Bart Starr, Roger Staubach, Terry Bradshaw and Joe Namath.
</P>
<P>
	   The difference was that those guys were future Hall of Famers, expected to
produce championships for their teams. Warner came out of football's shadows to
bring this one to the Rams, who had struggled through nine straight losing
seasons before finding him almost by accident.
</P>
<P>
	   This was a success story almost too corny to be true.
</P>
<P>
	   After playing at Northern Iowa -- hardly a hotbed of NFL talent -- Warner
spent three seasons on the outskirts of pro football with the Iowa Barnstormers
of the fringe Arena Football League, and one more in NFL Europe with the
Amsterdam Admirals.
</P>
<P>
	   He was a backup with the Rams, an insurance policy that St. Louis cashed in
when $16.5 million free agent Trent Green was injured in training camp. And
suddenly, the anonymous quarterback blossomed into a full-fledged NFL star.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner directed a high-powered St. Louis attack to a 13-3 season, setting a
team record for passing yards with 4,353 and throwing 41 touchdown passes. He
joined Dan Marino as the only player in NFL history to throw 40 or more TDs in a
season.
</P>
<P>
	   He was the regular season MVP, a most unlikely candidate for the award,
given his humble football roots. A year ago, he said, even he wouldn't have
dreamed of this.
</P>
<P>
	   "At the time, it wasn't very realistic to think I'd be the starter in the
Super Bowl," Warner said. "They were trying to figure out if I was good enough
to be the backup.
</P>
<P>
	   "I always believed in myself. There were no doubts that if I ever got the
opportunity, that I could be successful. I continued to believe that through the
times I worked in the supermarket and the times I played in Arena Football. I
never lost sight of that. To me, that's what it's all about -- believing in
yourself, waiting for that opportunity and then seizing it when it came.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was just hoping I would get an opportunity throughout the season to play
and to show people what I could do."
</P>
<P>
	   And that turned out to be plenty.
</P>
<P>
	   His performance bordered on startling. He led the league with a quarterback
rating of 109.2 and gave every longshot football player the hope that someday he
could duplicate this kind of unexpected success.
</P>
<P>
	   For Warner, it was no surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just went out and did what I expected myself to do from day one, things
I've been doing for the last few years," he said. "It just happens that some
people who hadn't seen me do it, got to see me do it this year."
</P>
<P>
	   And on Sunday he did it in pro football's top showcase.

	   Passenger Train Crashes in Miramichi
</P>
<P>
	   MIRAMICHI, New Brunswick (AP) -- A crewman was hospitalized with serious
burns and dozens more people were injured after a Via Rail passenger train
slammed into parked boxcars in Miramichi on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight people were admitted in three different New Brunswick hospitals. Five
were considered to have serious injuries, but none were life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
	   Sonya Green-Hache, a spokeswoman for the Miramichi Regional Hospital, said
41 people were taken to the hospital's emergency room Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   By early evening, 21 of them had been released.
</P>
<P>
	   Via spokeswoman Catherine Kaloutsky said there were 113 passengers and 14
crew members on the train, which was about an hour and a half north of Moncton,
New Brunswick, when the collision occurred at about 10:15 a.m. local time.
------ Saskatchewan RCMP Find 1,227 Kilos of Hash
</P>
<P>
	   INDIAN HEAD, Saskatchewan (AP) -- RCMP in Saskatchewan made a huge drug bust
during the weekend when they stumbled on 1,227 kilograms of hashish during a
routine traffic stop.
</P>
<P>
	   The small moving van was headed eastbound on the Trans-Canada Highway near
Indian Head, 34 miles east of Regina, when it was stopped Saturday for a traffic
violation.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with the hash, officers seized $19,000 in cash, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two British Columbia men, aged 54 and 41, were scheduled to appear in
provincial court in Melville on Monday charged with possession for the purposes
of trafficking and possession of the proceeds of crime. ------
Approval Expected Canada Trust Takeover
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Federal regulators and Finance Minister Paul Martin were
scheduled to announce Monday that they'll approve an $8-billion Toronto-Dominion
Bank takeover of Canada Trust.
</P>
<P>
	   Two separate studies of the proposal, by the Competition Bureau and the
Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, were scheduled for
public release early Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government also promised to issue its response to the studies at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike the fruitless bank mega-merger proposal of a year ago, it has been
widely expected that the takeover of Canada's last big, independent trust
company would be approved.
</P>
<P>
	   TD Bank has said it would cut about 4,900 positions over three years after
it merges with Canada Trust, with 2,000 of those spots absorbed by normal staff
turnover.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank has also estimated that 275 branches would be closed. ------

	   Reform Party Supporters Have Some Selling To Do
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Supporters of folding the Reform party into a new right-wing

	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams rediscovered their offensive firepower
just in time, and the Tennessee Titans came up just 1 yard short.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurt Warner's 73-yard touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce with 1 minute, and 54

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Down at Midday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's benchmark stock index was lower at midday Monday
following a steep decline Friday on Wall Street. The U.S. dollar rose against
the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 39.70 points, or 0.2 percent, to
19,395.08 at the end of the morning session. On Friday, the average closed up
225.06 points, or 1.17 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was quoted at 106.85 yen, up 1.99 yen from its level of 104.86
yen Friday in Tokyo but below its level of 106.98 yen in New York late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Tokyo stock market, the Nikkei declined after Wall Street investors
sold shares Friday on fresh fears of a U.S. interest rate hike.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors are worried that the U.S. Federal Reserve will try to contain
inflationary pressures by raising interest rates at its two-day meeting this
week, curbing business expansion by making it more expensive to borrow money.
There also are worries that the Fed will raise rates again later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Banks, industrial and technology companies posted the largest drops in Tokyo
in Monday morning's session.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index on Friday suffered its
second-biggest point drop ever as investors dumped shares in usually popular
Qualcomm, Intel and Oracle.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, buying by individual investors and brokerage dealers will likely
offer some support to Tokyo prices, said Hitoshi Ichio, equity strategist at
Commerz Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average on Friday tumbled 289.15 points, or 2.6
percent, to 10,738.87, falling to its lowest level since Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index fell 152.61, or 3.8 percent, to 3,886.95.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first-section companies closed
the morning session 10.91 points higher Monday, or 0.64 percent, at 1,713.52.
The TOPIX rose 16.71 points, or 0.99 percent, to 1,702.61 Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, the dollar rose against the yen, after falling Friday
amid a selloff of the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar had been pulled down against the yen because euro holders first
bought dollars, which were then sold to buy yen.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 104.56 yen midday Monday in
Tokyo, up from 103.34 yen late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was unchanged
from its Friday finish of 1.6600 percent. Its price remained 100.34.

<HEADLINE> Rams Nip Titans 23-16 in Super Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE GOLDBERG AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams rediscovered their offensive firepower
just in time, and the Tennessee Titans came up just 1 yard short.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurt Warner's 73-yard touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce with 1 minute, and 54
seconds left, gave the Rams their first Super Bowl win Sunday after the Rams had
blown a 16-0 lead in the 19 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The TD capped an improbable season for St. Louis, which was 3-13 a year ago
and 13-3 this season as they scored 526 points, third best in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
	   But they struggled all the way, and Steve McNair and Eddie George almost led
Tennessee to another miracle finish.
</P>
<P>
	   On the game's final play with six seconds left, McNair's pass was caught by
Kevin Dyson at the Rams 5. He scrambled for the end zone only to be stopped just
short by Mike Jones, Dyson's outstretched arm holding the ball toward the goal
line in vain.
</P>
<P>
	   Dyson was the hero in the miracle finish that beat Buffalo in the wild-card
game, taking a lateral and going 75 yards for a touchdown on a kickoff return
with three seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams dominated for much of the game but had to settle for three field
goals to take a 9-0 lead before finally scoring a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis seemed to have put the game away when Warner threw a 9-yard pass
to Torry Holt with 3:59 left in the third quarter to take a 16-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   But suddenly the Titans' offense came to life and the St. Louis defense
began to wear down behind the battering of George and short passes from McNair.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee scored on its next two possessions, both on 1-yard runs by George
to make it 16-13 with 7:21 left. It would have been 16-14, but the Titans chose
to go for two points on their first TD and failed.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Al Del Greco's 43-yard field goal tied it with 2:12 left.
</P>
<P>
	   The win was vindication for St. Louis coach Dick Vermeil, who returned to
coaching in 1997 after being gone for 14 years. He had lost his only other Super
Bowl appearance, in 1981 with Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams outgained the Titans 294 yards to 89 in the first half, but led
just 9-0.
</P>
<P>
	   The first three possessions ended with field-goal attempts and the Rams
holding a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis took the opening kickoff and drove from its own 31 to the Titans
17, twice converting third and long plays. But holder Mike Horan fumbled the
snap on what would have been a 35-yard field-goal attempt and Tennessee got the
ball at its own 29.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans then moved to the St. Louis 26 on a 32-yard screen pass from
McNair to George.
</P>
<P>
	   But a delay of game penalty stalled the drive and Del Greco missed a 47-yard
field goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner, the Super Bowl MVP, then hit two quick passes, 32 yards to Torry
Holt and 17 to Marshall Faulk. But that drive stalled at the 9-yard line and
Jeff Wilkins hit a 27-yard field goal to give St. Louis the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams got another chance when Warner found Faulk all alone for a 52-yard
completion to the 17. But Wilkins missed a 34-yard attempt 12 seconds into the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans kept the Rams out of the end zone again after St. Louis drove 73
yards from its own 16 to the Tennessee 11. This time Isaac Bruce dropped a pass
in the end zone and Wilkins ended up kicking a 29-yard field goal to make it
6-0.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams then went 67 yards in 13 plays but ended up again with just a field
goal, a 29-yarder by Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans reached the St. Louis 27 on the opening possession of the second
half. But Del Greco's 47-yard field-goal attempt was blocked by Todd Lyght.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams followed the block with a 68-yard, eight-play drive for the game's
first touchdown. It came two plays after the game was delayed for about 10
minutes while Titans safety Blaine Bishop was treated for a strained neck.
</P>
<P>
	   On third-and-goal from the 9, Holt slid inside of Dainon Sidney and Warner
sidearmed the ball to him through the Tennessee pass rush and it was 16-0.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Titans came back, driving 66 yards for their first score, a 1-yard
TD run by George with 14 seconds left in the third quarter. The key on that
drive was McNair's 23-yard scramble to the 2, the first time he broke loose all
day.
</P>
<P>
	   But McNair threw wide of an open Frank Wycheck on the 2-point conversion
attempt, so it stayed 16-6.

<HEADLINE> Rams Hold Titans on Final Play  </HEADLINE>
    By EDDIE PELLS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Super Bowl came down to one play. Mike Jones came
through by heeding a lesson he's learned since the first day he strapped on
shoulder pads.
</P>
<P>
	   See the ball carrier, get lower than him, wrap him up and make the tackle.
</P>
<P>
	   That's what the St. Louis linebacker did to Tennessee's Kevin Dyson at the
2-yard line as the clock ran out in the Super Bowl on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   That's how the Rams held on to a 23-16 victory over the Titans in what will
go down as one of the most thrilling finishes ever.
</P>
<P>
	   With six seconds remaining and the desperation that only a last play can
induce, Steve McNair backed up to pass and hit Dyson at the Rams' 5-yard line.
Dyson scooted toward the end zone, but ran into Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones wrapped him up, Dyson fell forward and reached his right hand toward
the goal line. He came up a heartbreaking three feet short.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams stormed the field in celebration. Dyson laid there in despair.
</P>
<P>
	   It was quite a different scene three weeks ago for Dyson. He was the
receiver who took the disputed lateral from Frank Wycheck and ran the
last-minute kickoff back against Buffalo. That was a play that helped propel the
Titans into the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, it was something less spectacular. Just a good, clean tackle from
a player who has been making good tackles all his life.
</P>
<P>
	   And because Jones held onto Dyson, moments later, he got to wrap his hands
around the Super Bowl trophy.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways Jet Crashes Into Sea  </HEADLINE>
   By TIM SULLIVAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- A Kenya Airways jet carrying 169 passengers and
10 crew members crashed into the sea Sunday night, shortly after taking off from
Abidjan. Airport officials said at least seven people survived.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, an Airbus 310, took off at 9:08 p.m. and crashed just one minute
later, according to George Dapre Yao, the head of air traffic at Abidjan's Felix
Houphouet-Boigny Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya Airways Flight 431, which was en route to Lagos, Nigeria, carried 167
adults passengers and two children, Yao said. Kenya Airways officials said the
plane's final destination was Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
	   Six or seven survivors were found early Monday floating in the wreckage off
Abidjan and were being taken to an area hospital, said Raymond Kesse, an
official with the Ivorian Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, another survivor, a Frenchman, was brought to the same hospital
with cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was a good swimmer. That's how he managed to survive,'' said Dr. Tanoh
Koutoua, who treated the unidentified man.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said the plane never appeared to get sufficient altitude as it
crossed over the airport's wall and headed out over the ocean, just a few
hundred yards away.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I saw it take off,'' said an itinerant trader who identified himself as
Alogouleta. ``After it went over the wall, it was still very low. Then it hit
the water. I heard the sound two times,'' as the plane slammed into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he heard no explosion, saw no flames and that the plane did not veer
as it flew overhead.
</P>
<P>
	   Emergency officials -- firefighters, police officers, soldiers and divers --
were combing the beach near the crash scene late Sunday night, about 1 mile east
of the airport, looking for survivors and corpses. Police boats cruised the
Atlantic off the beach and a helicopter chattered noisily overhead, scanning the
dark ocean with a bright searchlight.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of people, who live nearby or were praying in churches along the
beach road, heard the plane slam into the water.
</P>
<P>
	   A few immediately jumped into the water, hoping to get to survivors, but
were quickly driven back by the harsh surf that slams noisily into the white
sand beach.
</P>
<P>
	   A few times late Sunday, cheers rippled through the crowds and people rushed
to the water's edge after hearing reports that survivors had been found. Those
reports turned out to be false.
</P>
<P>
	   Anne Yeze was worshipping at the Celestial Christian Church, a
concrete-and-metal building just off the beach, when the plane crashed into the
water nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were praying and we heard a noise, like something hitting the water,''
she said. The parishioners rushed outside, but couldn't see the crash. They then
called the airport.
</P>
<P>
	   An official at the airport's control tower said French military
firefighters, who are stationed at a French military base next to the airport,
had also been dispatched to the scene. The French Foreign Ministry in Paris
confirmed that a Marine infantry battalion was taking part in the rescue
operation.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was clear in Abidjan at the time of the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The control tower official said that wreckage of the plane could not be
seen, but the area where the plane had crashed was visible from the tower.

<HEADLINE> Storm Strikes Southeast Second Time  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A winter storm that glazed much of the Southeast in a thick
coat of ice moved up the coast on Sunday, leaving warmer temperatures and drier
roads for thousands of football fans who trekked to Georgia Dome to watch the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm brought snow, sleet and rain from the Carolinas to southeastern
New York, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The same storm had dumped more than a foot of snow in parts of the southern
Plains and the South just days earlier. It was expected to reach western Maine
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are a lot of cars out there tonight, slipping and sliding all over
the place,'' said Richard Parese Sr., whose towing company in Sinking Springs,
Pa., had 30 calls from stranded motorists in less than three hours Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought most people would have stayed home tonight to watch the Super
Bowl,'' Parse said.
</P>
<P>
	   By Sunday evening, six inches of snow had fallen in western Maryland and
dozens of flights were canceled at Baltimore-Washington International Airport.
In Virginia, more than 175,000 electricity customers lost power as conditions
worsened through the day.
</P>
<P>
	   In eastern Pennsylvania, where drivers were still sliding on side streets
slick with ice from a storm earlier in the week, up to 12 inches of snow were
expected overnight. The Legislature canceled its Monday sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   A mix of snow, freezing rain and sleet was expected across Connecticut,
Massachusetts and Rhode Island through Monday night, with accumulations of as
much as eight inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the icy conditions made driving hazardous, North Carolina
authorities said there were few accidents and most motorists appeared to be
staying home Sunday, especially with some stores closed and church services
canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think people are realizing that they shouldn't be on the roads if they
don't know how to drive in it,'' said Penny Roark, a dispatcher in Watauga
County, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   North Carolina's two major utilities reported more than 11,000 customers
without electricity Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   In Georgia early Sunday, trees were ``popping like popcorn'' and power lines
shorted out under the weight of the ice.
</P>
<P>
	   Temperatures rose above freezing for the first time in two days, clearing
off roads that had been so icy Saturday even walking had been treacherous. Both
the Tennessee Titans and the St. Louis Rams canceled plans to practice in the
Georgia Dome on Saturday after hundreds of accidents were reported, including a
47-car pileup.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges requested $9.2 million in federal disaster
aid to help his state dig out. Power was knocked out to about 20,000 customers
as the freezing drizzle encrusted lines, cars and roads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Snow and ice have pelted South Carolina for a week now,'' Hodges said in
his request to President Clinton. ``It's clear this unusual run of winter storms
is causing unexpected problems.''
</P>
<P>
	   Icy pavement and heavy fog in West Virginia contributed to a
multiple-vehicle crash that killed three people Sunday morning west of
Charleston, state police reported. Two weather-related traffic deaths were
reported in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia utilities reported as many as 50,000 customers lost power across the
central part of the state -- far fewer than the 500,000 customers who faced
blackouts after a storm that stunned North Carolina with nearly 2 feet of snow
rolled through a week ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Georgia just doesn't get two ice storms in a week,'' said Phyllis Turner,
spokeswoman for the Georgia Transmission Corp. She said power line repairs were
slowed because ``we'll get one up and then have to go back when a tree brings it
down again.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The trees have been popping like popcorn down here,'' Mike Doster said
Sunday from his home in Griffin, about 35 miles south of Atlanta. ``Had I not
moved my station wagon yesterday, it would have been flattened.''

<HEADLINE> Titans Run Out of Miracles  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans ran out of miracles on the 2-yard line.
</P>
<P>
	   Eddie George's two touchdowns in an eight-minute span of the second half
almost sparked one of the greatest rallies ever, but the Titans fell a Tennessee
two-step short, losing to the St. Louis Rams 23-16 Sunday night in the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee trailed 16-0 before the Beast took over.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1995 Heisman Trophy winner was a non-factor in the first half, nearly
ignored, carrying the ball only seven times and gaining just 18 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   But then came the third quarter, and he flashed the form that made him one
of only four backs to gain 1,200 yards or more in each of his first four NFL
season.
</P>
<P>
	   First, he capped a 12-play drive with a 1-yard TD run with 14 seconds left
in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   That was nothing compared with his fourth-quarter performance.
</P>
<P>
	   He carried seven times on the Titans' next possession, the final one a
beauty.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee had second-and-goal from the 1, and George just couldn't be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
	   He broke not one, not two, but three tackles to reach the end zone, getting
some help from officials, who failed to rule the play dead when his left knee
touched the turf short of the goal line. Another burst put him over the line and
the knee was overlooked.
</P>
<P>
	   Then George, who became the Titans' head cheerleader this season, stood up
and screamed for his teammates to get going.
</P>
<P>
	   But on the final drive, which began with 1:54 remaining, there wasn't enough
time for a ground game, so the Titans turned to Steve McNair.
</P>
<P>
	   George had one last chance to help. But after catching 47 passes in the
regular season, he failed to turn around for a pass from McNair with half a
minute left, and the ball bounced off his elbow.
</P>
<P>
	   With six seconds left, McNair almost came through, finding Kevin Dyson over
the middle just inside the 5 on what would be the final play. McNair spun toward
the end zone, trying and trying to reach it as time expired.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mike Jones was there to hook his hip and bring him down. No touchdown.
No tie. No more miracles.
</P>
<P>
	   George could only watch.

<HEADLINE> Albright in Moscow To Size Up Putin  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Sunday that
Russia's acting president is ``riding a tiger'' by pushing a military offensive
against rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no question the war is popular,'' Albright told reporters as she
flew here to size up Vladimir Putin and push arms control.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright noted that casualties are mounting and said Russia faces more
isolation in the international arena as the war drags on. ``They have to hear
over and over again that this is not working for them,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said he was ``hoping to have a meaty session'' with Putin when they get
together this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Persistent U.S. appeals to Russian leaders to end the conflict and negotiate
with the Chechnya separatists have failed. Albright did not predict success this
time, either, and she ruled out U.S. economic sanctions if persuasion does not
work.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Albright said, ``It is very clear to me that Russia is hurting itself
because of Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
	   In what could turn out to be a tradeoff, Albright was ready to discuss sharp
cuts in U.S. and Russian long-range nuclear arsenals while urging Putin to
approve ``modest adjustments'' in a ban on missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before landing in Moscow, she said talk of such a tradeoff is
``hypothetical.''
</P>
<P>
	   A deal would make it easier for the Clinton administration to go forward
with a $6.6 billion plan for a defense against missiles fired from Iran, North
Korea or other countries the United States considers rogue states.
</P>
<P>
	   Before taking off, Albright warned in a speech to the World Economic Forum
that ``economic anxieties'' in countries with democratically elected governments
were prompting the people to turn to authoritarianism and other failed remedies.
</P>
<P>
	   She said life in parts of the former Soviet Union often is tougher for
ordinary people than when Communists ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A majority of citizens in these countries have come to equate democracy
with inequality, insecurity and the unraveling of the social fabric,'' she said.
``We are concerned that in many countries, the arrival of electoral democracy
has been accompanied by economic expectations that are, as yet, unfulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
	   Her scheduled meeting with Putin will be the first by a top-ranked U.S.
official since Boris Yeltsin quit as president New Year's Eve and named the
former KGB domestic intelligence chief as his successor. Elections are due in
three months.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright ``wants to get a firsthand assessment of how he intends to operate
now that he's the acting president, which brings additional responsibilities,''
the State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright has described him as a leading reformer, but also said the
administration was not ``starry-eyed'' about Russia's future.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia has registered its opposition to missile defense systems as
potentially fueling a race to develop more powerful nuclear weapons to overcome
them.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1972 U.S.-Russia treaty bans missile defenses, but the Clinton
administration wants to make changes in it to go ahead with its program.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Russia wants to go further than the United States has
proposed in cutting nuclear missile stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright intends to renew a U.S. pitch that the Russian parliament ratify
the 1993 START II treaty, which calls for reducing the U.S. and Russian arsenals
of long-range nuclear warheads to 3,000 to 3,500 apiece.
</P>
<P>
	   But even Yeltsin's endorsement failed to convince nationalists in the
parliament to approve the agreement. It also did not persuade some Russian
military chiefs who object to the treaty partly because it eliminates Russia's
edge in some weapons and would require large outlays to build allowable weapons
in other categories.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has proposed a follow-up START III treaty,
setting a ceiling for both Russia and the United States of 2,000 to 2,500
warheads. Russia wants even deeper cutbacks, possibly to 1,500 strategic
warheads on each side.
</P>
<P>
	   That could ease the economic strain of building up to allowable ceilings in
some weapons categories.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said these approaches have been under discussion with Russia for
several months, and the talks will continue during Albright's visit.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, he said, Albright would like to see Russia agree to
``modest adjustments'' in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that banned
national missile defenses on the theory that the prospect of devastating
retaliation would forestall a nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any recognition by Russia that amendments to the ABM treaty can be
accomplished without undermining the fundamental purpose of the ABM treaty would
be a welcome step in the right direction, because it would mean that they have
understood that there are dangers,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright also is bound again to register strong U.S. condemnation of the
Russian military assault on Chechnya, even while supporting Russia's authority
to counter terrorism and secession in the rebellious republic.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, she is to have three meetings with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
and to see Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Prince Saud, Saudi Arabia's
foreign minister. They will be in Moscow for a meeting Tuesday of Arab and
Israeli officials on ways to promote economic development of the region.
</P>
<P>
	   King Abdullah of Jordan said at the economic conference on Sunday that
economic cooperation is ``the way of the future'' in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> 4 Tried in 'Date-Rape Drug' Death  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM SUHR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Samantha Reid's mother remembers the time when her daughter,
at age 10, saved her allowance for weeks to throw her a surprise birthday party,
even inviting 30 friends she found in her mom's address book.
</P>
<P>
	   Judi Clark recalls how even as a teen-ager, Samantha would meet her at the
door each night and ask about her day at work.
</P>
<P>
	   The last memory she has of her daughter is from a year ago, when Samantha,
at 15, lay comatose, poisoned by the ``date-rape drug'' GHB, and doctors said it
was time to let her go.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They said `We keep bringing her back, and she keeps dying. We've brought
her back three times, and she's died three times. How many times do you want to
let her keep dying?''' says Ms. Clark, her voice quaking.
</P>
<P>
	   GHB -- gamma-hydroxybutyrate -- is an odorless and nearly tasteless drug
linked to at least 58 deaths and more than 5,700 overdoses nationwide since
1990. Public sales are banned by the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, in one of the nation's first trials resulting from a GHB-related
death, jury selection begins for the manslaughter trial of four men accused of
slipping the drug into Samantha's soft drink at a party.
</P>
<P>
	   The four defendants, all of suburban Detroit, are Erick Limmer, 26, Joshua
Cole, 19, Daniel Brayman, 18, and Nicholas Holtschlag, 18. They are charged with
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say young people often believe that GHB and other ``club drugs''
aren't ``real drugs'' like cocaine, or they take them unknowingly as Samantha
did. Recipes and ingredients -- some of them common household products -- are
easily available from the Internet and other sources.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of people who use them believe they are benign drugs and don't see
them for what they are -- taken under some circumstances, life-threatening,''
says Alan Leshner, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   From the start, Samantha was on the go. ``Hammy Sammy,'' they called the
attention-craving youngster even before her first birthday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If there was no action happening, she'd make it happen,'' her mother says.
</P>
<P>
	   Allowances often went to help pay her friends' way into movies. She
befriended children who other kids ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She loved to make other people happy,'' Ms. Clark says. ``She was there
for the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mother and daughter talked often and openly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I told her about people slipping stuff into drinks, but it was never
something I harped on because she was only 15,'' Ms. Clark says. ``When you
think of Rohypnol (another date-rape drug), you think of bars. You never dream,
my God, it's going to happen to a 15-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   In January 1999, Samantha, two friends and four guys they'd just met went to
a party on Grosse Ile, an affluent island community in the Detroit River.
</P>
<P>
	   Samantha was handed a soft drink and moments later she was vomiting and
unconscious.
</P>
<P>
	   Her best friend, then 14, drank what she believed to be orange juice and
vodka, felt herself ``getting drunk pretty quick'' and also lost consciousness.
The third girl escaped serious effects.
</P>
<P>
	   An attorney for Cole says his client spiked the drinks with what he believed
was only a harmless intoxicant. Brayman and Holtschlag say they were unaware GHB
was even present. Limmer says he was gone or in his bedroom most of the night
the girls were drugged.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   GHB, originally developed as a surgical anesthetic, is sometimes used as an
aphrodisiac, or a weight loss aid, or by body builders as a supplement. It's
hard to trace, often out of the body within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   It can make users feel euphoric. It also can lead to breathing problems,
seizures, long-term effects on the brain, coma and death.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This has become the upscale, inclusive social scene thing to do,'' says
Arthur Dean of the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America.
</P>
<P>
	   A person who drinks a soda laced with a few drops of GHB can lose
consciousness within 20 minutes and have no memory of what happened, hence its
reputation as a ``date-rape drug'' used to render women helpless against sexual
advances.
</P>
<P>
	   GHB-related hospital emergency visits have rocketed nationally from 20 in
1992 to 1,283 in 1998, according to the Drug Abuse Warning Network.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Institute on Drug Abuse opened an Internet site at
www.clubdrugs.org and sends information cards and brochures to community groups
and schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're trying to stave off what could become the equivalent of a public
health plague,'' the institute's Leshner says.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Clark is working with a planned task force that would campaign against
date-rape drugs, saying it could be Samantha's legacy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just miss her energy. I miss her friendship,'' she says, her voice
cracking again.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She kept me young.''

<HEADLINE> Rams Hold Titans on Final Play  </HEADLINE>
    By EDDIE PELLS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Super Bowl came down to one play. Mike Jones came
through by heeding a lesson he's learned since the first day he strapped on
shoulder pads.
</P>
<P>
	   See the ball carrier, get lower than him, wrap him up and make the tackle.
</P>
<P>
	   That's what the St. Louis linebacker did to Tennessee's Kevin Dyson at the
1-yard line as the clock ran out in the Super Bowl on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   That's how the Rams held on to a 23-16 victory over the Titans in what will
go down as one of the most thrilling finishes ever.
</P>
<P>
	   With six seconds remaining and the desperation that only a last play can
induce, Steve McNair backed up to pass and hit Dyson at the Rams' 5-yard line.
Dyson scooted toward the end zone, but ran into Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones wrapped him up, Dyson fell forward and reached his right hand toward
the goal line. He came up a heartbreaking three feet short.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams stormed the field in celebration. Dyson laid there in despair.
</P>
<P>
	   It was quite a different scene three weeks ago for Dyson. He was the
receiver who took the disputed lateral from Frank Wycheck and ran the
last-minute kickoff back against Buffalo. That was a play that helped propel the
Titans into the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, it was something less spectacular. Just a good, clean tackle from
a player who has been making good tackles all his life.
</P>
<P>
	   And because Jones held onto Dyson, moments later, he got to wrap his hands
around the Super Bowl trophy.

<HEADLINE> Titans Surge, Then Fall Short  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans ran out of miracles on the 1-yard line.
</P>
<P>
	   Eddie George's two touchdowns in an eight-minute span of the second half
almost sparked one of the greatest rallies ever, but the Titans fell a Tennessee
two-step short, losing to the St. Louis Rams 23-16 Sunday night in the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee trailed 16-0 before the Beast took over.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1995 Heisman Trophy winner was a non-factor in the first half, nearly
ignored, carrying the ball only seven times and gaining just 18 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   But then came the third quarter, and he flashed the form that made him one
of only four backs to gain 1,200 yards or more in each of his first four NFL
season.
</P>
<P>
	   First, he capped a 12-play drive with a 1-yard TD run with 14 seconds left
in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   That was nothing compared with his fourth-quarter performance.
</P>
<P>
	   He carried seven times on the Titans' next possession, the final one a
beauty.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee had second-and-goal from the 1, and George just couldn't be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
	   He broke not one, not two, but three tackles to reach the end zone, getting
some help from officials, who failed to rule the play dead when his left knee
touched the turf short of the goal line. Another burst put him over the line and
the knee was overlooked.
</P>
<P>
	   Then George, who became the Titans' head cheerleader this season, stood up
and screamed for his teammates to get going.
</P>
<P>
	   But on the final drive, which began with 1:54 remaining, there wasn't enough
time for a ground game, so the Titans turned to Steve McNair.
</P>
<P>
	   George had one last chance to help. But after catching 47 passes in the
regular season, he failed to turn around for a pass from McNair with half a
minute left, and the ball bounced off his elbow.
</P>
<P>
	   With six seconds left, McNair almost came through, finding Kevin Dyson over
the middle just inside the 5 on what would be the final play. McNair spun toward
the end zone, trying and trying to reach it as time expired.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mike Jones was there to hook his hip and bring him down. No touchdown.
No tie. No more miracles.
</P>
<P>
	   George could only watch.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Boots Heard From Wizards  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSEPH WHITE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Well, Michael Jordan never promised he would be tactful.
</P>
<P>
	   From the day he pledged to put his "imprints and footprints all over" the
Washington Wizards, Jordan gave coach Gar Heard the cold shoulder. Jordan spent
virtually no one-on-one time with the coach while negotiating in secret to
replace him with an old buddy.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan was not around when he fired Heard on Saturday night. He was in
Atlanta for the Super Bowl, while Heard and his players were feeling good about
a gritty victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. General manager Wes Unseld was
left to deliver the news.
</P>
<P>
	   "The timing was kind of funny," forward Aaron Williams said. "Everybody's
spirits were up after a good win that we really needed."
</P>
<P>
	   The Wizards scheduled a Monday afternoon news conference to announce Heard's
successor, and there were conflicting reports as to who it will be. The players
were told after Saturday's game that Golden State assistant Rod Higgins,
Jordan's friend and golfing pal, will be the new coach, but CNN and ESPN
reported Sunday on their Web sites that former Toronto coach Darrell Walker will
get the job.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan sought and received permission from the Warriors to interview
Higgins. Higgins did not attend the Golden State's practice Sunday, but coach
Garry St. Jean told reporters that, as far as he knew, a deal had not been
completed and that Higgins was still employed by the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
	   Heard saw the writing on the wall shortly after Jordan was made part-owner
and president of basketball operations Jan. 19. Jordan met individually with
several veterans and at length with Unseld, but never with Heard.
</P>
<P>
	   "You never have a chance to show what you can do," Heard said.
"Unfortunately, that's the nature of the business. I think they had their mind
made up when he got here. I never got an opportunity to talk to him. When you
come in you want to bring your own people."
</P>
<P>
	   Other than a 9-44 stint as interim head of the Dallas Mavericks in 1993, the
Wizards were Heard's first chance to be a head coach, a reward for toiling 12
years as an assistant with Dallas, Indiana, Philadelphia and Detroit. He was
given a three-year, $3.6 million contract on June 19, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   But his old-school style did not suit a team entrenched in its ways. Heard
clashed with Rod Strickland and Juwan Howard, and he lay some of the blame on
the players for the Wizards' 14-30 record.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a coach, I know what to do," Heard said. "The point is, are they willing
to do it? You have to work. You have to come to work every day. You can't not
come to practice and play.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most of the guys worked hard, but I'm sure you have some guys who think
they're not getting fair treatment. As coach, you're the first one to go, the
easiest one to remove."
</P>
<P>
	   Unseld also said the "onus is always on the players" and refused to
elaborate on Heard's shortcomings when the firing was announced Saturday night.
Unseld did not return calls Sunday, and Jordan was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Higgins, who has no previous head coaching experience, turns 40 Monday. He
has been an assistant with the Warriors for six seasons, following a 13-year
playing career with Chicago, Seattle, San Antonio, New Jersey, Sacramento,
Cleveland and Golden State. He played with Jordan in Chicago during Jordan's
rookie season in 1984-85 season and again at the end of the 1985-86 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Walker walked out on the Raptors, who seemed headed nowhere at the time, in
February 1998. He most recently has been coach of the Rockford Lightning of the
CBA.
</P>
<P>
	   Whoever gets the job will take charge of a team that hasn't won consecutive
games in more than a month, has not won a playoff game in 12 years and has
underachieving veterans such as Strickland, Howard and Mitch Richmond whose high
salaries make them almost untradable. Barring a trade, the Wizards are years
away from having significant salary cap room to sign a star player.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been tough around here," Strickland said. "The atmosphere hasn't been
good. It's been a lot of negativity, so put it on the players, put it on the
coaches, put it on everybody -- things weren't right, and it wasn't fun."
</P>
<P>
	   Also fired were assistants Butch Beard and Mike Bratz. Assistant Tree
Rollins will be retained.

<HEADLINE> Rams Nip Titans 23-16 in Super Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE GOLDBERG AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams rediscovered their offensive firepower
just in time, and the Tennessee Titans came up just 1 yard short.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurt Warner's 73-yard touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce with 1 minute, 54
seconds left gave the Rams their first Super Bowl win Sunday, 23-16.
</P>
<P>
	   The TD capped an improbable turnaround for St. Louis, which was 3-13 a year
ago and 13-3 this season as they scored 526 points, third best in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
	   But Steve McNair and Eddie George almost led Tennessee to another miracle
finish, rallying them from a 16-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   On the game's final play with six seconds left, McNair's pass was caught by
Kevin Dyson at the Rams 5. He scrambled for the end zone only to be stopped just
short by Mike Jones, as Dyson's outstretched arm held the ball toward the goal
line in vain.
</P>
<P>
	   "I always believed in myself, and had a whole bunch of people who believed
in me," said Warner, the Super Bowl MVP who did a victory lap around the Georgia
Dome. "We're the world champions! How about the Rams!"
</P>
<P>
	   Warner, a former Arena League and NFL Europe quarterback, finished 24-of-45
for 414 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams dominated for much of the game but had to settle for three field
goals to take a 9-0 lead before finally scoring a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis seemed to have put the game away when Warner threw a 9-yard pass
to Torry Holt with 3:59 left in the third quarter to take a 16-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   But suddenly the Titans' offense came to life and the St. Louis defense
began to wear down behind the battering of George and short passes from McNair.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee scored on its next two possessions, both on 1-yard runs by George
to make it 16-13 with 7:21 left. It would have been 16-14, but the Titans chose
to go for two points on their first TD and failed.
</P>
<P>
	   Al Del Greco's 43-yard field goal tied it with 2:12 left. Then the Rams'
quick strike for a touchdown set up one of the most exciting finishes in Super
Bowl history. The Titans, however, just didn't have enough at the very end.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been doing this off and on during the year. We knew we had an
opportunity to go on in and score," McNair said of the game's final play on
Dyson's near-touchdown lunge. "We said on the sideline when they scored that the
only fault they did was scoring too quick. We fell just short."
</P>
<P>
	   Dyson almost became a big hero for the second time this season. He was the
key player in the miracle finish that beat Buffalo in the wild-card game, taking
a lateral and going 75 yards for a touchdown on a kickoff return with three
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams' victory was vindication for coach Dick Vermeil, who returned to
coaching in 1997 after being gone for 14 years. He had lost his only other Super
Bowl appearance, in 1981 with Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   "You know I'm an emotional guy but right now I feel so good and so proud of
this football team and organization," said Vermiel, known for shedding a tear or
two at times. "To be able to bring this home to St. Louis, such a wonderful
city. I know they appreciate us a little more right now."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams outgained the Titans 294 yards to 89 in the first half, but led
just 9-0.
</P>
<P>
	   The first three possessions ended with field-goal attempts and the Rams
holding a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis took the opening kickoff and drove from its own 31 to the Titans
17, twice converting third and long plays. But holder Mike Horan fumbled the
snap on what would have been a 35-yard field-goal attempt and Tennessee got the
ball at its own 29.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans then moved to the St. Louis 26 on a 32-yard screen pass from
McNair to George.
</P>
<P>
	   But a delay of game penalty stalled the drive and Del Greco missed a 47-yard
field goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner then hit two quick passes, 32 yards to Torry Holt and 17 to Marshall
Faulk. But that drive stalled at the 9-yard line and Jeff Wilkins hit a 27-yard
field goal to give St. Louis the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams got another chance when Warner found Faulk all alone for a 52-yard
completion to the 17. But Wilkins missed a 34-yard attempt 12 seconds into the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans kept the Rams out of the end zone again after St. Louis drove 73
yards from its own 16 to the Tennessee 11. This time Isaac Bruce dropped a pass
in the end zone and Wilkins ended up kicking a 29-yard field goal to make it
6-0.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams then went 67 yards in 13 plays but ended up again with just a field
goal, a 29-yarder by Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans reached the St. Louis 27 on the opening possession of the second
half. But Del Greco's 47-yard field-goal attempt was blocked by Todd Lyght.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams followed the block with a 68-yard, eight-play drive for the game's
first touchdown. It came two plays after the game was delayed for about 10
minutes while Titans safety Blaine Bishop was treated for a strained neck.
</P>
<P>
	   On third-and-goal from the 9, Holt slid inside of Dainon Sidney and Warner
sidearmed the ball to him through the Tennessee pass rush and it was 16-0.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Titans came back, driving 66 yards for their first score, a 1-yard
TD run by George with 14 seconds left in the third quarter. The key on that
drive was McNair's 23-yard scramble to the 2, the first time he broke loose all
day.
</P>
<P>
	   But McNair threw wide of an open Frank Wycheck on the 2-point conversion
attempt, so it stayed 16-6.

<HEADLINE> HDTV Makes Super Bowl Crystal Clear  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    EDITOR'S NOTE: AP Sports Writer Alan Robinson watched the Super Bowl on a
40-inch high-definition TV connected to a satellite dish, as well as a 35-inch
direct-view set connected to cable. Here is his review: By ALAN ROBINSON AP
Sports Writer
</P>
<P>
	   In some ways, the first Super Bowl televised in high definition was a
no-frills throwback to the first Super Bowl telecast in 1967.
</P>
<P>
	   No fancy graphics and no glitzy production tricks. The emphasis was on the
action, not the sideshow that often threatens to overwhelm the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Of course, with a picture like this, who needs exploding helmets and
whirling logos, cameras mounted in blimps or strapped to helmets?
</P>
<P>
	   Oblivious to most of America except the small number of households that have
ignored the high costs -- sets cost from $2,700 to $110,000 -- and dire
predictions that high-def won't catch on for many more years to come, ABC
produced two Super Bowl broadcasts Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   One was the version seen -- in standard, very low definition -- by millions
of Americans via cable or local TV stations. The other, seen mostly by a few
thousand early conformers to a technology that startles the senses much like
color TV did to those who grew up in the black-and-white age, was a
high-definition broadcast shown on 23 digital stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The NFL likes to say the game is the thing. With high-definition TV, the
picture is the thing.
</P>
<P>
	   Oh, the picture.
</P>
<P>
	   Watching the two telecasts side-by-side, on screens of comparable size,
provided as big a contrast as the Tennessee Titans' offense did in the second
half compared to the first.
</P>
<P>
	   The high definition picture is like watching a moving photograph --
seamless, with vivid colors and a picture so sharp that the handwriting on a
referee's thrown flag is clearly visible. So is every stitch on a player's
uniform, every feather on Rams quarterback Kurt Warner's wife Brenda's blue boa.
</P>
<P>
	   The regular, NTSC signal that has been America's TV standard since the days
when "I Love Lucy" was the program of choice, not "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire," looked as dated as the single wing by comparison to the new
technology.
</P>
<P>
	   The scanning lines that form the picture become as visible as those on a
coach's face (no offense, Dick Vermeil). Colors aren't as bright, details aren't
as sharp and fans in the stands are faceless figures, rather than animated,
enthused objects.
</P>
<P>
	   With an extremely high production cost-to-viewers ratio, ABC's HDTV
broadcast was as remarkable for its stark quality as its vivid picture. The
colorful graphics -- like the exploding helmets -- on the regular telecast were
missing, replaced by plain text or low-tech substitutes. Not that it mattered.
</P>
<P>
	   Also missing: the computer-generated yellow stripe that represents the
first-down line. And there were only nine HDTV cameras, fewer than half those on
the regular telecast, mostly because they are the only such cameras in the
country. They aren't owned by ABC but, rather, are leased to the network by
Panasonic, which received several complimentary high-def ads in payment.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcers, Al Michaels and Boomer Esiason, were the same, but the
high-def picture didn't always match their words. With so many fewer cameras,
the HDTV broadcast couldn't explore as many nooks and crannies of the Georgia
Dome as the regular telecast did, and it didn't try.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, by the second quarter, the HDTV crew began inserting a
picture-in-a-picture of the regular telecast during those occasions when the
shot didn't match Michaels' words.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, with poorer camera positions than those of the main telecast, the
high-def telecast sometimes pulled back to camera angles so wide they resembled
the entire-field shots on the videos watched by NFL coaches.
</P>
<P>
	   Sometimes, though, HDTV's relatively Spartan production was superior to the
multimillion dollar main telecast. On Rams receiver Torry Holt's non-catch in
the first half, for example, the HDTV telecast had shown two superior replays by
the time the main telecast had shown one.
</P>
<P>
	   The Disney-produced (with Disney-owned ABC showing the game, you expected
something else?) halftime show, with its colorful, moving images and
pyrotechnics, also was far superior on HDTV.
</P>
<P>
	   Not all was perfect, of course; the main TV cameraman cut in front of the
HDTV camera during John Elway's sideline interview, leaving viewers with a huge
closeup of the back of a minicamera. Not exactly must-see TV.
</P>
<P>
	   But the picture. Too bad most of America still can't see it.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Ads Have Web Focus  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet advertisers, making their most ambitious use yet
of TV's most expensive commercial showcase, ranged from poetic to prosaic in
trying to make names for themselves in Sunday's Super Bowl telecast.
</P>
<P>
	   Monster.com, the job site and Super Bowl repeater, ran a black-and-white ad
that showed a woman listening to passersby recite poetry by Robert Frost about
how taking the road less traveled had made all the difference.
</P>
<P>
	   Two others poked fun at themselves in their commercials.
</P>
<P>
	   The online broker E-Trade showed two men and a monkey in a garage, clapping
in time to cha-cha music. "Well, we've just wasted $2 million. What are you
doing with your money," one of three ads from E-Trade said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lifeminders.com, a Web site that delivers personalized e-mail to its
members, ran an ad that consisted of a typewritten message that started by
saying "This is the worst commercial on the Super Bowl." But the ad explained
that while the company wasn't good at advertising, it was good at alerting its
subscribers to items they may be interested in seeing.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventeen dot-coms, as Internet companies are known, were among about three
dozen advertisers who paid a record average of $2.2 million for a 30-second
commercial on the ABC telecast which saw the St. Louis Rams beat the Tennessee
Titans 23-16.
</P>
<P>
	   Only three dot-com advertisers were involved in last year's Super Bowl
telecast, and this year's participation by many more of them helped pushed the
ad price up nearly 38 percent from last year's $1.6 million average.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the other dot-coms, the pet supplier Pets.com featured its sock puppet
singing Chicago's "Don't Go" in a plea for pet owners to stay home with their
pets and use the Web site to get what the animals need.
</P>
<P>
	   Healtheon/WebMD, which runs an internet health care site, showed film taken
earlier this year of revered former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali shadow
boxing at his home. Ali, who has Parkinson's, doesn't speak in the ad but the
text indicates he hopes the Internet can help make medical advances.
</P>
<P>
	   Hotjobs.com, another repeat Super Bowl advertiser, was back with an ad that
makes a computer hand its icon, driving a hard bargain with a prospective
employer.
</P>
<P>
	   A third job site, Kforce.com, made its Super Bowl debut, offering itself as
the alternative to "Internet job sites that lead you nowhere."
</P>
<P>
	   But Internet advertisers weren't the only ones gaining attention with
unusual Super Bowl advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Express delivered the helium that gave the lollypop gang their
distinctive voices in welcoming Dorothy to the Munchkinland in an ad that used
clips from the classic "Wizard of Oz" movie.
</P>
<P>
	   Paralyzed actor Christopher Reeve appeared to rise from his chair in an ad
for the mutual fund company Nuveen Investments which advised viewers to "invest
well" and possibly bring about the day when Reeve and others could be recognized
for overcoming spinal cord injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Anheuser-Busch was the single biggest advertiser in the game with five
minutes of commercials. In one, it creates a parody of dog-food ads by having
the dog describe it keeps its owner happy and healthy. In another ad, a dog on a
movie set produces the required yowl only by recalling its worst moment -- when
it ran into the side of a van as it chased a Budweiser truck. Former hockey star
Wayne Gretzky drives a tipsy friend home on a Zamboni in another ad for the
brewer.
</P>
<P>
	   Pepsi-Cola pitched Mountain Dew with an ad that showed a bicycle rider
outracing a cheetah, and then reaching his arm in the cat's mouth for a stolen
can of the soft drink,
</P>
<P>
	   Cats also figured in a Bud Light ad where a man was cornered by his new girl
friend's tiger when he took a Bud Light from the refrigerator. EDS showed
cowboys herding cats in another commercial, which EDS said is like the tough job
it does managing technology for its customers.

Rams Beat Titans 23-16 in Super Bowl
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Kurt Warner's 73-yard touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce with 1
minute, 54 seconds left gave the Rams their first Super Bowl win tonight, 23-16.
The TD capped an improbable turnaround for St. Louis, which was 3-13 a year ago
and 13-3 this season as they scored 526 points, third best in NFL history. But
Steve McNair and Eddie George almost led Tennessee to another miracle finish,
rallying them from a 16-0 deficit. On the game's final play with six seconds
left, McNair's pass was caught by Kevin Dyson at the Rams 5. He scrambled for
the end zone only to be stopped just short by Mike Jones, as Dyson's
outstretched arm held the ball toward the goal line in vain.

Survivors Recovered From Plane Crash

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Airport officials said at least seven people
survived after a Kenya Airways plane crashed shortly after takeoff Sunday night.
The plane, an Airbus 310, took off at 9:08 p.m. and crashed just one minute
later, according to George Dapre Yao, the head of air traffic at Abidjan's Felix
Houphouet-Boigny Airport. Kenya Airways Flight 431, which was en route to Lagos,
Nigeria, carried 167 adults passengers and two children, Yao said. Kenya Airways
officials said the plane's final destination was Nairobi, Kenya.

Soros: IMF Should Not Help Russia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- U.S. financier George Soros said today that the
International Monetary Fund should pull out of Russia in view of the current
political climate there. Soros pointed to the conflict in the breakaway republic
of Chechnya as a worrying sign. On Saturday, the IMF's second-ranking official
said the fund may delay paying Russia the second $460 million installment of a
$4.5 billion loan until after presidential elections in March. The payment
originally was due in September, but was delayed after the IMF imposed new
conditions amid international concern about what happened to previous loans.

Elian's Grandmothers Return To Cuba
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers returned to Cuba today to a
heroes welcome, although they didn't bring their grandson back with them. "It's
very sad," said the boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, breaking down
in tears before President Fidel Castro and 1,700 schoolchildren who greeted the
grandmothers at Havana's Convention Palace. Since the two grandmothers left
Havana on Jan. 21, the government has given increasingly massive television and
newspaper coverage to their tour of the United States, crediting them with
helping sway U.S. public opinion toward Elian's return.

Calif. Exec Found Beaten in Beijing

	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A Silicon Valley entrepreneur visiting Beijing for
a high-tech conference sponsored by the Chinese government was declared brain
dead after he was severely beaten and left unconscious in a bar, relatives say.
Family members told the San Jose Mercury News that Steven Leung, chairman of
Mountain View-based Scenix and the president of Santa Clara-based Emvix
Communications Inc., was found unconscious with a head wound on Jan. 18 in a
karaoke bar several hours after the conference. Beijing police told a U.S.
Embassy official that Leung was found slumped over the table of the An Ka bar
and dance hall in downtown Beijing, but family members and associates insist he
doesn't frequent such places.

Austin, Phoenix Judged Best Cities

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With robust finances and well-trained public work forces,
Austin, Texas, and Phoenix are the best-managed major American cities, according
to an analysis by Syracuse University. The study rated the municipal governments
of the nation's 35 largest cities in terms of revenues, assigning grades from A
to F on five management criteria: finances, human resources, capital,
information technology and results. A common factor in cities that scored well
was strong leadership, said Patricia W. Ingraham, director of the Government

Storm Strikes Southeast Second Time
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A winter storm that glazed much of the Southeast in a thick
coat of ice moved up the coast today, leaving warmer temperatures and drier
roads for thousands of football fans who trekked to the Georgia Dome to watch
the Super Bowl. The storm brought snow, sleet and rain from the Carolinas to
southeastern New York, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers. The
same storm had dumped more than a foot of snow in parts of the southern Plains
and the South just days earlier. It was expected to reach western Maine on
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Jockey Found Dead, Hanging  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- A decomposing body found hanging from a tree at
the Hollywood Park race track was identified as a jockey who committed suicide,
a coroner's investigator said.
</P>
<P>
	John Suarez was found Thursday by track security guards, Los Angeles County
coroner's investigator Dana Bee said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	Suarez, 49, lived in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County coroner's investigator
David Smith said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	Suarez, who was injured and lived at the track, had been dead about a month,
Bee said.
</P>
<P>
	Calls seeking comment from a track spokesman were not immediately returned
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	He was hanging from a tree by a noose in a secluded area of the track grounds.
Suarez was wearing only long underwear. He was identified by his Hollywood Park
identification, which was found in a jacket nearby, Bee said.
</P>
<P>
	Jockeys and trainers had been complaining for more than three weeks about a
foul odor on the east side of the practice track, Bee said.
</P>
<P>
	Family members said he was depressed about a worker's compensation claim he had
trouble collecting, Bee said.
</P>
<P>
	Suarez was last seen alive by his family at Christmas. Concerned relatives had
gone to the track in the past month but had been unable to locate him, Bee said.

   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- To Vice President Al Gore, they were the Tennessee
Titans, but Gov. George W. Bush insisted on thinking of them as still the
Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he's rooting for the Houston Oilers, that is typical of living in the
past,'' said Gore with a chuckle, sporting a Titan cap at his Super Bowl party
at a Nashua restaurant.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president a former congressman and senator from Tennessee adopted
the team after it moved from Houston and confidently told a radio interview on
Saturday they would win by three points.
</P>
<P>
	   By kickoff, he was less bold about playing, as they call it in politics, the
expectations game.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A win is a win,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   His caution turned out to be prudent, as the St. Louis Rams, formerly the
Los Angeles Rams, managed a 20-13 victory over the Titans.
</P>

</P>
<P>
	   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- The crowds have grown steadily at rallies over the
weekend for Gov. George W. Bush, with the latest show of political force Sunday
at the former Pease Air Force Base here where his organization turned out
approximately 1,000 people a Super Bowl party in an old hangar.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush arrived just before kickoff, the horn blasting on his campaign bus and
the lights flashing on top of a police escort car.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind a stage hung a huge banner reading, ``New Hampshire Loves Bush,'' and
the stage itself was transformed into a living room, with lounge chairs, end
tables and bowls of snacks. The middle had a set of goal posts.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Albright in Moscow To Size Up Putin  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Sunday that
Russia's acting president is ``riding a tiger'' by pushing a military offensive
against rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no question the war is popular,'' Albright told reporters as she
flew here to size up Vladimir Putin and push arms control.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright noted that casualties are mounting and said Russia faces more
isolation in the international arena as the war drags on. ``They have to hear
over and over again that this is not working for them,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said he was ``hoping to have a meaty session'' with Putin when they get
together this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Persistent U.S. appeals to Russian leaders to end the conflict and negotiate
with the Chechnya separatists have failed. Albright did not predict success this
time, either, and she ruled out U.S. economic sanctions if persuasion does not
work.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Albright said, ``It is very clear to me that Russia is hurting itself
because of Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 150 Russian nationalists and religious activists gathered outside the
U.S. Embassy to protest her visit and accuse her of backing Chechen rebels and
war crimes in Yugoslavia. One sign said Albright was coming to Russia to ``save
the Chechen bandits.''
</P>
<P>
	   In what could turn out to be a tradeoff, Albright was ready to discuss sharp
cuts in U.S. and Russian long-range nuclear arsenals while urging Putin to
approve ``modest adjustments'' in a ban on missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before landing in Moscow, she said talk of such a tradeoff is
``hypothetical.''
</P>
<P>
	   A deal would make it easier for the Clinton administration to go forward
with a $6.6 billion plan for a defense against missiles fired from Iran, North
Korea or other countries the United States considers rogue states.
</P>
<P>
	   Before taking off, Albright warned in a speech to the World Economic Forum
that ``economic anxieties'' in countries with democratically elected governments
were prompting the people to turn to authoritarianism and other failed remedies.
</P>
<P>
	   She said life in parts of the former Soviet Union often is tougher for
ordinary people than when Communists ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A majority of citizens in these countries have come to equate democracy
with inequality, insecurity and the unraveling of the social fabric,'' she said.
``We are concerned that in many countries, the arrival of electoral democracy
has been accompanied by economic expectations that are, as yet, unfulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
	   Her scheduled meeting with Putin will be the first by a top-ranked U.S.
official since Boris Yeltsin quit as president New Year's Eve and named the
former KGB domestic intelligence chief as his successor. Elections are due in
three months.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright ``wants to get a firsthand assessment of how he intends to operate
now that he's the acting president, which brings additional responsibilities,''
the State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright has described him as a leading reformer, but also said the
administration was not ``starry-eyed'' about Russia's future.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia has registered its opposition to missile defense systems as
potentially fueling a race to develop more powerful nuclear weapons to overcome
them.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1972 U.S.-Russia treaty bans missile defenses, but the Clinton
administration wants to make changes in it to go ahead with its program.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Russia wants to go further than the United States has
proposed in cutting nuclear missile stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright intends to renew a U.S. pitch that the Russian parliament ratify
the 1993 START II treaty, which calls for reducing the U.S. and Russian arsenals
of long-range nuclear warheads to 3,000 to 3,500 apiece.
</P>
<P>
	   But even Yeltsin's endorsement failed to convince nationalists in the
parliament to approve the agreement. It also did not persuade some Russian
military chiefs who object to the treaty partly because it eliminates Russia's
edge in some weapons and would require large outlays to build allowable weapons
in other categories.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has proposed a follow-up START III treaty,
setting a ceiling for both Russia and the United States of 2,000 to 2,500
warheads. Russia wants even deeper cutbacks, possibly to 1,500 strategic
warheads on each side.
</P>
<P>
	   That could ease the economic strain of building up to allowable ceilings in
some weapons categories.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said these approaches have been under discussion with Russia for
several months, and the talks will continue during Albright's visit.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, he said, Albright would like to see Russia agree to
``modest adjustments'' in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that banned
national missile defenses on the theory that the prospect of devastating
retaliation would forestall a nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any recognition by Russia that amendments to the ABM treaty can be
accomplished without undermining the fundamental purpose of the ABM treaty would
be a welcome step in the right direction, because it would mean that they have
understood that there are dangers,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright also is bound again to register strong U.S. condemnation of the
Russian military assault on Chechnya, even while supporting Russia's authority
to counter terrorism and secession in the rebellious republic.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, she is to have three meetings with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
and to see Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Prince Saud, Saudi Arabia's
foreign minister. They will be in Moscow for a meeting Tuesday of Arab and
Israeli officials on ways to promote economic development of the region.
</P>
<P>
	   King Abdullah of Jordan said at the economic conference on Sunday that
economic cooperation is ``the way of the future'' in the Middle East.

   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- To Vice President Al Gore, they were the Tennessee
Titans, but Gov. George W. Bush insisted on thinking of them as still the
Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he's rooting for the Houston Oilers, that is typical of living in the
past,'' said Gore with a chuckle, sporting a Titan cap at his Super Bowl party
at a Nashua restaurant.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president a former congressman and senator from Tennessee adopted
the team after it moved from Houston and confidently told a radio interview on
Saturday they would win by three points.
</P>
<P>
	   By kickoff, he was less bold about playing, as they call it in politics, the
expectations game.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A win is a win,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   His caution turned out to be prudent, as the St. Louis Rams, formerly the
Los Angeles Rams, managed a 20-13 victory over the Titans.

	   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- The crowds have grown steadily at rallies over the
weekend for Gov. George W. Bush, with the latest show of political force Sunday
at the former Pease Air Force Base here where his organization turned out
approximately 1,000 people a Super Bowl party in an old hangar.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush arrived just before kickoff, the horn blasting on his campaign bus and
the lights flashing on top of a police escort car.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind a stage hung a huge banner reading, ``New Hampshire Loves Bush,'' and
the stage itself was transformed into a living room, with lounge chairs, end
tables and bowls of snacks. The middle had a set of goal posts.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush worked his way through the crowd during the first half, shaking hands,
signing autographs and posing for pictures. Meanwhile, his wife, Laura,

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways Jet Crashes Into Sea  </HEADLINE>
   By TIM SULLIVAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- A Kenya Airways jet carrying 169 passengers and
10 crew members crashed into the sea Sunday night, shortly after takeoff from
Abidjan. At least seven people were pulled from the water alive, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, an Airbus 310, took off at 9:08 p.m. and crashed into the
Atlantic Ocean just one minute later, according to George Dapre Yao, the head of
air traffic at Abidjan's Felix Houphouet-Boigny Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya Airways Flight 431, which was en route to Lagos, Nigeria, carried 167
adults passengers and two children, Yao said. Kenya Airways officials said the
plane's final destination was Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
	   Six or seven survivors were found early Monday floating in the wreckage off
Abidjan and were being taken to an area hospital, said Raymond Kesse, an
official with the Ivorian Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, another survivor, a Frenchman, was brought to the same hospital
with cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was a good swimmer. That's how he managed to survive,'' said Dr. Tanoh
Koutoua, who treated the unidentified man.
</P>
<P>
	   In Nairobi, Steve Clarke, the technical director for Kenya Airways, said
most of the passengers were believed to be Nigerians. The route is popular among
Nigerians heading to Dubai for duty-free shopping.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The aircraft started its initial climb with no problem and then suddenly
descended,'' Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Abidjan, witnesses said the plane never appeared to get sufficient
altitude as it crossed over the airport's wall and headed out over the ocean,
just a few hundred yards away.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I saw it take off,'' said an itinerant trader who identified himself as
Alogouleta. ``After it went over the wall, it was still very low. Then it hit
the water. I heard the sound two times,'' as the plane slammed into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he heard no explosion, saw no flames and that the plane did not veer
as it flew overhead.
</P>
<P>
	   Emergency officials -- firefighters, police officers, soldiers and divers --
were combing the beach near the crash scene late Sunday night, about 1 mile east
of the airport, looking for survivors and corpses. Police boats cruised the
Atlantic and a helicopter chattered noisily overhead, scanning the dark ocean
with a bright searchlight.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of people, who live nearby or were praying in churches along the
beach road, heard the plane slam into the water.
</P>
<P>
	   A few immediately jumped into the water, hoping to get to survivors, but
were quickly driven back by the harsh surf that slams noisily into the white
sand beach.
</P>
<P>
	   A few times late Sunday, cheers rippled through the crowds and people rushed
to the water's edge after hearing reports that survivors had been found. Those
reports turned out to be false.
</P>
<P>
	   Anne Yeze was worshipping at the Celestial Christian Church, a
concrete-and-metal building just off the beach, when the plane crashed into the
water nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were praying and we heard a noise, like something hitting the water,''
she said. The parishioners rushed outside, but couldn't see the crash. They then
called the airport.
</P>
<P>
	   An official at the airport's control tower said French military
firefighters, who are stationed at a French military base next to the airport,
had also been dispatched to the scene. The French Foreign Ministry in Paris
confirmed that a Marine infantry battalion was taking part in the rescue
operation.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was clear in Abidjan, the Ivory Coast's commercial city, at the
time of the crash. The temperature was about 77 degrees, with a light wind.
</P>
<P>
	   The control tower official said that wreckage of the plane could not be
seen, but the area where the plane had crashed was visible from the tower.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya Airways has a partnership with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Together, the
two airlines operate four flights a week from London to Nairobi, via Amsterdam.
Sunday's crash was the first such disaster for Kenya Airlines, which has been
operating since 1977, Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kenyan government retains a significant interest in its national carrier
while KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is the largest individual shareholder with a 26
percent stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Airbus Industrie Web site, the A310 is a 220-seat,
wide-bodied plane.

	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Owner Georgia Frontiere made a difficult decision in 1995 --
moving the Los Angeles Rams to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, she said it was all worth it when the Rams beat the Tennessee
Titans 23-16 in the Super Bowl at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am so thrilled. I'm thrilled for St. Louis. I'm thrilled for the Rams,"
she said in accepting the Lombardi Trophy from NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
	   "It proves that we did the right thing by going to St. Louis," she said of
the move to her hometown five years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "This trophy belongs to our coach, our team and our fans in St. Louis."

	   SWEET MOMENT: After 10 years in the NFL, defensive tackle Ray Agnew now
knows what winning the Super Bowl feels like.
</P>
<P>
	   "It feels great. There is no better feeling. It is sweet. I wish there were
a way to package this moment so I could keep re-living it over and over," said
the 6-foot-3, 285-pounder, who was in his second season with the Rams after
playing five years with New England and three with the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is the sweetest day of my life," said Agnew, who was asked if winning
the Super Bowl late in his career made it better.
</P>
<P>
	   "It think it is great no matter when it happens. I guess I was starting to

	   SUPER PLAYERS: Nine sportswriters and a former NFL administrator, all of
whom have attended all 33 previous Super Bowls, were polled to select the best
players at each position in the NFL's championship game.
</P>
<P>
	   The offensive selections were quarterback Joe Montana, running backs Franco
Harris and Emmitt Smith, tight end Jay Novacek, wide receivers Jerry Rice and
Lynn Swann, tackles Forrest Gregg and Joe Jacoby, guards Gene Upshaw and Bob

Hendricks and Chuck Howley, cornerbacks Herb Adderley and Mel Blount, and
safeties Ronnie Lott and Jake Scott.
</P>
<P>
	   The punter was Ray Guy, and the kicker was Jan Stenerud. The kick returner
was Desmond Howard and the coach was Chuck Noll.
</P>
<P>
	   The selection committee was Don Weiss of the NFL, Larry Felser of the
Buffalo News, John Steadman of the Baltimore Sun, Jerry Green of the Detroit
News, Jerry Izenberg of the Newark Star-Ledger, Dave Klein of e-Giants, Will

	   The Titans were the 10th team to fail to score in the first half of the
Super Bowl. All 10 wound up losing.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans had been 5-0 against teams that had won 13 games during the
regular season beating Jacksonville three times, Indianapolis and St. Louis.
Tennessee beat the Rams 24-21 on Oct. 31 at home.

</P>
<P>
	   Holt missed Wednesday's practice leading up to the Super Bowl, and the Rams
kept backup wide receiver Chris Thomas active on Friday just in case Holt, who
had been listed as probable, couldn't go. Just a precaution.
</P>
<P>
	   But he also had a cortisone shot. And after the game he couldn't lift his
right arm above waist level.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had to get a lot of treatment," Holt said. "Luckily, the training staff
got me ready to play and I was able to come up with some big things."
</P>
<P>
	   The sixth pick of the draft, and not Isaac Bruce, has been quarterback Kurt
Warner's go-to guy throughout the playoffs. The Super Bowl was another big day
for Holt, who caught seven passes for 109 yards in the Rams' 23-16 victory over
the Tennessee Titans on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was just into my game," Holt said. "I was just vibing, I was into the
rhythm, and was able to use my athletic ability to get open."
</P>
<P>
	   Holt caught six passes for 100 yards in the first half and then scored the
game's first touchdown on a 9-yard reception midway through the third quarter
that put the Rams ahead 16-0.
</P>
<P>
	   On the touchdown, Holt beat the one-on-one coverage of nickel back Dainon
Sidney, breaking free after some jukes at the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first half, Holt's work was crucial to all three of Jeff Wilkins'
field goals. The only thing lacking was a touchdown pass, but he wasn't alone.
Despite Warner's 277 yards passing, the Rams led only 9-0 on the three short
field goals.
</P>
<P>
	   Holt beat Blaine Bishop for a 32-yard catch on the drive that produced a
27-yarder by Wilkins for the game's opening score. He had gains of 13 and 15
yards to help set up Wilkins' second field goal, a 29-yarder in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   In a span of three plays on the third field goal drive of the half, Warner
hit Holt for first-down catches of 16 and 18 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Holt was the top player on the Rams' draft board, regardless of position,
and he had a solid rookie season with 52 receptions, a 15.2-yard average and six
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
	   He caught a touchdown pass in each of his first two career starts. He went
without a score the next eight games, during which he also dropped more than his
share of balls. He concluded the regular season with two 100-plus yard receiving
games.
</P>
<P>
	   Martz said Holt hit a wall, mentally and physically, in the second half of
the season, and then got back to speed for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think like a lot of rookie players, after about Game 11 he was looking
for a bowl game or something," Martz said. "Once the season ended, he realized
this thing was going to continue to go and that he belongs in this mix of
receivers."
</P>
<P>
	   In the first two playoff games, Holt totaled 13 catches for 133 yards.

<HEADLINE> Titans' Bishop Taken to Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- Tennessee safety Blaine Bishop strained his neck in a scary
collision during the third quarter of the Super Bowl and lay motionless on the
field for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bishop, who jammed his helmet into the back of St. Louis tight end Ernie
Conwell on a tackle, did have movement in his arms and legs before he was taken
off the field on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
	   Players on both teams prayed on the sidelines while Bishop was being tended
to by trainers. St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner, a devout Christian, even
knelt beside the motionless Bishop.
</P>
<P>
	   Bishop was taken to Piedmont Hospital for precautionary X-rays that were
negative.
</P>
<P>
	   The injury left the Titans without both their starting safeties.
</P>
<P>
	   Second-year safety Perry Phenix replaced Bishop. Free safety Marcus
Robertson broke his left leg in the AFC Championship game and was replaced by
Anthony Dorsett.

<HEADLINE> Titans Surge, Then Fall Short  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- One yard, 36 measly inches.
</P>
<P>
	   For a month now, Tennessee had been getting that extra break. On Sunday
night, the Titans fell a Tennessee two-step short.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's ironic isn't it," Dyson said. "We're 16 seconds away from not even
being here and not even being in this game. It's ironic."
</P>
<P>
	   Dyson, who pulled out a victory over Buffalo in the AFC wild-card game with
a last-second return, couldn't do it again Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   His right arm fell a yard short of the end zone as time expired, just
missing what could have been the tying touchdown in a 23-16 loss to the Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew we had an opportunity to go down and score," said quarterback Steve
McNair, who helped bring back the Titans from a 16-0 deficit. "Unfortunately, we
got down there and just fell short."
</P>
<P>
	   Ever since Jan. 8, the Titans had been calling themselves a team of destiny.
That was the day they trailed Buffalo 16-15 with 16 seconds remaining, then
stunned the Bills when Dyson caught a cross-field lateral from Frank Wycheck and
ran 75 yards untouched for a touchdown and a 22-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Instant replay helped them twice in the divisional round against
Indianapolis. One replay gave them the inches they needed for a first down on a
carry by McNair, and a second replay nullified a Terrence Wilkins' punt return
to the Tennessee 3 and preserved the Titans' lead.
</P>
<P>
	   They got no such help against the Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans tied the game at 16 on a 43-yard field goal by Al Del Greco with
2:12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurt Warner needed just one play to find Isaac Bruce on a 73-yard touchdown
pass play. Titans cornerback Denard Walker was running with step for step with
Bruce until the receiver stopped for a half-stride, enough space to catch the
ball and lose Walker for what would be the winning TD.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Serial Killings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A 37-year-old man was charged Sunday in the slayings of 10
women on the city's South Side, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Andre Crawford was arrested Friday after police received a tip about him,
Chicago police Cmdr. Frank Trigg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Crawford was charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder, 11 counts of
aggravated criminal sexual assault and one count of attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Trigg said Crawford confessed to the murders of seven women that were part
of a string of murders that stretched back six years on Chicago's South Side. He
also admitted to three other murders that police hadn't linked to the case,
Trigg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators have connected him to the murders through DNA testing, Trigg
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Crawford also was identified in a lineup by a woman who was allegedly
assaulted by him but escaped, Trigg said.
</P>
<P>
	   The first of the 10 murders Crawford is charged with occurred in September
1993 and the last was in February 1999. The victims were described as women
whose activities put them in secluded locations with people who they did not
know.
</P>
<P>
	   All of the victims were either strangled or suffered blunt trauma to the
head, Trigg said. Their bodies were left in abandoned buildings or vacant lots,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Crawford has a criminal history dating back to 1985, Trigg said, but he
wouldn't provide details.

<HEADLINE> Storm Strikes Southeast Second Time  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A winter storm that glazed much of the Southeast in a thick
coat of ice moved up the coast on Sunday, leaving warmer temperatures and drier
roads for thousands of football fans who trekked to Georgia Dome to watch the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm brought snow, sleet and rain from the Carolinas to southeastern
New York, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The same storm had dumped more than a foot of snow in parts of the southern
Plains and the South just days earlier. It was expected to reach western Maine
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are a lot of cars out there tonight, slipping and sliding all over
the place,'' said Richard Parese Sr., whose towing company in Sinking Springs,
Pa., had 30 calls from stranded motorists in less than three hours Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought most people would have stayed home tonight to watch the Super
Bowl,'' Parese said.
</P>
<P>
	   By Sunday evening, six inches of snow had fallen in western Maryland and
dozens of flights were canceled at Baltimore-Washington International Airport.
In Virginia, more than 175,000 electricity customers lost power as conditions
worsened through the day.
</P>
<P>
	   In eastern Pennsylvania, where drivers were still sliding on side streets
slick with ice from a storm earlier in the week, up to 12 inches of snow were
expected overnight. The Legislature canceled its Monday sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   A mix of snow, freezing rain and sleet was expected across Connecticut,
Massachusetts and Rhode Island through Monday night, with accumulations of as
much as eight inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the icy conditions made driving hazardous, North Carolina
authorities said there were few accidents and most motorists appeared to be
staying home Sunday, especially with some stores closed and church services
canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think people are realizing that they shouldn't be on the roads if they
don't know how to drive in it,'' said Penny Roark, a dispatcher in Watauga
County, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   North Carolina's two major utilities reported more than 11,000 customers
without electricity Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   In Georgia early Sunday, trees were ``popping like popcorn'' and power lines
shorted out under the weight of the ice.
</P>
<P>
	   Temperatures rose above freezing for the first time in two days, clearing
off roads that had been so icy Saturday even walking had been treacherous. Both
the Tennessee Titans and the St. Louis Rams canceled plans to practice in the
Georgia Dome on Saturday after hundreds of accidents were reported, including a
47-car pileup.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges requested $9.2 million in federal disaster
aid to help his state dig out. Power was knocked out to about 20,000 customers
as the freezing drizzle encrusted lines, cars and roads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Snow and ice have pelted South Carolina for a week now,'' Hodges said in
his request to President Clinton. ``It's clear this unusual run of winter storms
is causing unexpected problems.''
</P>
<P>
	   Icy pavement and heavy fog in West Virginia contributed to a
multiple-vehicle crash that killed three people Sunday morning west of
Charleston, state police reported. Two weather-related traffic deaths were
reported in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia utilities reported as many as 50,000 customers lost power across the
central part of the state -- far fewer than the 500,000 customers who faced
blackouts after a storm that stunned North Carolina with nearly 2 feet of snow
rolled through a week ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Georgia just doesn't get two ice storms in a week,'' said Phyllis Turner,
spokeswoman for the Georgia Transmission Corp. She said power line repairs were
slowed because ``we'll get one up and then have to go back when a tree brings it
down again.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The trees have been popping like popcorn down here,'' Mike Doster said
Sunday from his home in Griffin, about 35 miles south of Atlanta. ``Had I not
moved my station wagon yesterday, it would have been flattened.''

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israel Leader Killed in Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
   By BUTROS WANNA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- Iranian-backed guerrillas on Sunday killed a top
pro-Israeli militia leader in southern Lebanon, heightening tensions that could
undermine chances of peace between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel promised retaliation, and its military aircraft began nighttime raids
on targets in guerrilla-controlled territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanese security officials said Col. Akl Hashem -- considered the
second-highest ranking leader in the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia
-- was working in an orchard near his house in Dibel village when a bomb went
off, killing him instantly. The SLA said in a statement that the bomb exploded
outside his home, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier reports erroneously said Hashem was killed by a roadside bombing of
his convoy.
</P>
<P>
	   Hashem, 48, was regarded as the likely successor of Gen. Antoine Lahd, the
commander of the Israeli-backed militia.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed responsibility. Its
Voice of Al-Noor radio broadcast statements calling Hashem a criminal and adding
that his assassination was ``a great qualitative achievement in the framework of
dismantling the militia.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak promised that the killers of Hashem would
be punished.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday night, Israeli military aircraft staged attack sorties against
targets in the guerrilla stronghold of Iqlim al-Tuffah, which faces the
Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon. Lebanese security officials said more
than 10 missiles were fired.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, the army spokesman confirmed that aircraft fired on targets in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate word on casualties or on what were the exact targets.
</P>
<P>
	   The SLA's 2,500 soldiers help 1,500 Israeli soldiers control a swath of
South Lebanon occupied by Israel. Israel calls the area a security zone, using
it as a buffer against guerrillas attacks on its northern towns. Hezbollah is
leading the war to liberate the area.
</P>
<P>
	   SLA militiamen sealed off the site of the attack, a few miles north of the
Israeli border and 20 miles southwest of Marjayoun, the main town in the
occupied enclave.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said civilians in areas outside Israeli control celebrated
Hashem's killing.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack came amid rising tension in southern Lebanon in recent days. Two
guerrillas and an Israeli soldier were killed in separate clashes. Israel has
warned that the hostilities could undermine the Syrian-Israeli peace talks,
which are already on ice.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak told reporters in Cairo, where he held talks with Egypt's President
Hosni Mubarak, that Israel would retaliate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that this incident emphasizes the potential for a deterioration
in the atmosphere in Lebanon. We will do everything so that those who harmed Akl
Hashem will receive their just punishment and I expect that the situation won't
deteriorate,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ephraim Sneh, Israel's deputy defense minister and a former commander of
Israeli forces in South Lebanon, accused Syria of ordering the bombing. ``This
shows that Damascus is not really interested in the success of the (peace)
negotiations,'' he told Israeli radio stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria is the main power-broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Hashem was commander of the Western Brigade of the SLA, in charge of about
1,000 men from areas west of Marjayoun to the Mediterranean coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Hashem was a former Lebanese army sergeant who joined the ranks of
Israeli-allied militiamen in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   Hashem's death is expected to reduce the morale of the SLA, which has been
shaken by guerrilla attacks and by Barak's pledge to withdraw from Lebanon by
July, with or without a peace agreement with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   But pulling out without an agreement could leave the SLA facing the wrath of
the Lebanese government and the guerrillas, who consider allies of Israel to be
traitors.

<HEADLINE> McNair Comes up Short in Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NEWBERRY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- For Steve McNair, the numbers don't mean a thing. He doesn't
listen to his critics. Winning is the only thing that matters.
</P>
<P>
	   He came up 1 yard short in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   McNair, trying to become the second black quarterback to lead his team to an
NFL championship, sparked a remarkable comeback that led the Tennessee Titans to
the brink of forcing the first overtime Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The St. Louis Rams won 23-16 on Kurt Warner's 73-yard pass to Isaac Bruce
with 1:54 remaining, but not before McNair led his team back from a 16-0 deficit
and took the Titans 88 yards on their final drive.
</P>
<P>
	   The season ended with Kevin Dyson taking a quick pass from McNair and
sprawling toward the end zone, only to be stopped at the 1-yard line as time ran
out.
</P>
<P>
	   "We did what we wanted to do," McNair said. "We wanted to have a chance to
win in the fourth quarter. We just came up short."

    ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A rally and parade were planned for downtown St. Louis on
Monday to honor the Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams beat the Tennessee Titans 23-16 Sunday to win the city's first-ever

about $15,000 worth of fireworks.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the Super Bowl began Sunday, city officials were ready to

<HEADLINE> Titans Surge, Then Fall Short  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- One yard, 36 measly inches.
</P>
<P>
	   For a month now, Tennessee had been getting that extra break. On Sunday
night, the Titans fell a Tennessee two-step short.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's ironic isn't it," Dyson said. "We're 16 seconds away from not even
being here and not even being in this game. It's ironic."
</P>
<P>
	   Dyson, who pulled out a victory over Buffalo in the AFC wild-card game with
a last-second return, couldn't do it again Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   His right arm fell a yard short of the end zone as time expired, just
missing what could have been the tying touchdown in a 23-16 loss to the Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew we had an opportunity to go down and score," said quarterback Steve
McNair, who helped bring back the Titans from a 16-0 deficit. "Unfortunately, we
got down there and just fell short."
</P>
<P>
	   Ever since Jan. 8, the Titans had been calling themselves a team of destiny.
That was the day they trailed Buffalo 16-15 with 16 seconds remaining, then
stunned the Bills when Dyson caught a cross-field lateral from Frank Wycheck and
ran 75 yards untouched for a touchdown and a 22-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Instant replay helped them twice in the divisional round against
Indianapolis. One replay gave them the inches they needed for a first down on a
carry by McNair, and a second replay nullified a Terrence Wilkins' punt return
to the Tennessee 3 and preserved the Titans' lead.
</P>
<P>
	   They got no such help against the Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans tied the game at 16 on a 43-yard field goal by Al Del Greco with
2:12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurt Warner needed just one play to find Isaac Bruce on a 73-yard touchdown
pass play. Titans cornerback Denard Walker was running with step for step with
Bruce until the receiver stopped for a half-stride, enough space to catch the
ball and lose Walker for what would be the winning TD.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Jeff Fisher said that Walker, who dressed and quickly left the locker
room after the game, tripped on the play.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have made those kind of plays all year and this particular play we
didn't," Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans had made a habit of rallying in the second half. They won five
games in the regular season and all three of their playoff games by doing just
that.
</P>
<P>
	   They thought they plenty of time left with 1:54 to go. McNair drove them
down the field and found Dyson slanting across the field just inside the 5 in
the last seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's set up exactly like we worked on it in practice," Dyson said of the
play called "Sliver Right." "It came down to the linebacker making a great
tackle. It was ironic, it came down to something like that."
</P>
<P>
	   Dyson caught the ball and thought he would score. Then, Rams linebacker Mike
Jones grabbed him.
</P>
<P>
	   "I realized as soon as I stretched out and was going down that I didn't get
the point of the ball over the goal line," Dyson said. "When he got his hands on
me, I thought I'd break the tackle, but he slid down to my foot like you're
supposed to and made a great play. Maybe I should have pitched it back to
somebody."
</P>
<P>
	   Offensive coordinator Les Steckel said Dyson, who had four catches for 41
yards in the game, cut the play a little early. The Titans had practiced it
three times in the past week.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the intensity of the moment," Steckel said, "people cut things a little
short."

<HEADLINE> Vermeil Cool During Victory  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM LITKE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- To know how sweet it is, remember from how far back Dick
Vermeil came. And how close he came to going back there again.
</P>
<P>
	   People who think old coaches can't learn new tricks -- one or two, anyway --
didn't see Vermeil when the game ended with the Tennessee Titans out of time and
a yard short of forcing overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil was so calm at that moment, he almost looked scary. In that same
situation, in his last go-round as a coach, that kind of cool was beyond his
reach.
</P>
<P>
	   "When the ball went in the air, I was going to get on the phone," Vermeil
recalled. He was planning to call up offensive coordinator Mike Martz and have
him script the first series of plays for the extra period.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis linebacker Mike Jones made sure that wasn't necessary. The ball

   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- To Vice President Al Gore, they were the Tennessee
Titans, but Gov. George W. Bush insisted on thinking of them as still the
Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he's rooting for the Houston Oilers, that is typical of living in the
past,'' said Gore with a chuckle, sporting a Titan cap at his Super Bowl party
at a Nashua restaurant.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president a former congressman and senator from Tennessee adopted
the team after it moved from Houston and confidently told a radio interview on
Saturday they would win by three points.
</P>
<P>
	   By kickoff, he was less bold about playing, as they call it in politics, the
expectations game.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A win is a win,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   His caution turned out to be prudent, as the St. Louis Rams, formerly the
Los Angeles Rams, managed a 23-16 victory over the Titans.

	   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- The crowds have grown steadily at rallies over the
weekend for Gov. George W. Bush, with the latest show of political force Sunday
at the former Pease Air Force Base here where his organization turned out
approximately 1,000 people a Super Bowl party in an old hangar.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush arrived just before kickoff, the horn blasting on his campaign bus and
the lights flashing on top of a police escort car.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind a stage hung a huge banner reading, ``New Hampshire Loves Bush,'' and
the stage itself was transformed into a living room, with lounge chairs, end
tables and bowls of snacks. The middle had a set of goal posts.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush worked his way through the crowd during the first half, shaking hands,
signing autographs and posing for pictures. Meanwhile, his wife, Laura,
supporter Elizabeth Dole and others waited on stage for his arrival.
</P>
<P>
	   His voice getting hoarse after a long day of campaigning, Bush gave an
abbreviated stump speech.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not going to stop working and I hope you don't either,'' he said. I'm
going to work all the way up to election night, and I'm asking you to join this
crusade.''

	   HOPKINTON, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain bowed to tradition and attended a
couple of Super Bowl parties with supporters Sunday, but admitted he wasn't
paying much attention to the game.
</P>
<P>
	   He was accompanied by some fellow POWs from his days as a captive in North
Vietnam, including Col. Bud Day, his original cellmate, and Orson Swindle, a
conservative Republican who left the party for a while to work for Ross Perot
before returning to the GOP and making an unsuccessful bid for Congress from
Hawaii in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain watched the game out of the corner of his eye at one party for a few
minutes, but mostly chatted up supporters eager to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
	   The television on his campaign bus was tuned to the game as he went from one
party to another private gathering at a second private home.
</P>
<P>
	   Even on the bus, McCain was more interested in talking to reporters than
watching the game.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he hadn't had time to watch much football this year, and had no
particular rooting interest in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides, he said he wanted to get to sleep early to prepare for an early
campaign appearance Monday.

	   AUBURN, N.H. (AP) -- Gary Bauer attended a Super Bowl party at a private
home without about 30 friends and family.

good game, although if anyone wins I hope it would be Tennessee because I'm from
Kentucky.''
</P>

	   Bauer was set up in a plush chair with foot stool, joined by wife and kids,
Elyse, 23, and Zach, 13.

	   KEENE, N.H. (AP) -- Alan Keyes didn't pretend to be interested in the Super
Bowl, but did take advantage of about 100 people gathered for a party at the
home of a supporter to give his stump speech and answer questions.
</P>
<P>
	   A few stragglers actually watched the game, but most people hung out with
Keyes, who criticized Sen. John McCain for his stance on campaign finance
reform. ``He is pointing the finger at everybody and meanwhile he himself is
guilty of it all,'' said Keyes.

<HEADLINE> Wife Held in Husband's Slaying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- A Scottsdale beauty salon owner told police she dumped
her estranged husband's headless torso into a trash bin after finding him dead
because she feared she would be accused of murder, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Valerie Pape, 47, was arrested Friday on suspicion of first-degree murder in
the slaying of a man believed to be Ira Pomerantz.
</P>
<P>
	   She's ``pretty shell-shocked,'' said her attorney, James Belanger. ``She
doesn't even understand what goes on in the American legal system.''
</P>
<P>
	   The mutilated torso was found Thursday afternoon in a trash bin behind a
Mesa supermarket. Police on Sunday were still trying to verify that it was the
60-year-old Scottsdale man. Ms. Pape reported him missing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Police suspect others may have had roles in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Pape was estranged from her husband, the former owner of two area bars.
Police had been called to their Scottsdale home a half dozen times for domestic
complaints, and Ms. Pape had sought an order of protection against Pomerantz.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the court documents, Ms. Pape told police she found her
husband's body in a pool of blood in her Scottsdale home Monday morning with a
gun nearby. Police said he had been fatally shot in the back with a medium- to
large-caliber gun.
</P>
<P>
	   She admitted cleaning up the blood and said she hid the weapon under the
seat of her car and tossed her husband's torso behind the store, but she did not
tell police how the body was dismembered, Mesa Det. Butch Gates wrote in court
documents.
</P>
<P>
	   A deliveryman told Mesa police that he had spotted Ms. Pape driving to the
dumpster in her Jaguar.

<HEADLINE> Rams Hold Titans on Final Play  </HEADLINE>
    By EDDIE PELLS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Kevin Dyson made the catch just inside the 5 and turned
toward the end zone, straining his arm toward the goal line and praying it would
stretch far enough to save the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Rams linebacker Mike Jones wrapped up Dyson below the waist and held on with
all his might, just the way his coaches had been teaching it for years.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the most fundamental skills on any football field -- the art of
tackling -- made the difference in the Super Bowl on Sunday. Jones held Dyson
out of the end zone by three tantalizing feet and St. Louis held on for a 23-16
victory over Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you're a little kid, you dream about scoring touchdowns, not stopping
them," Jones said. "I just grabbed him, held on and fell down. When I looked up,
the clock said 'zero-zero' and we had won the Super Bowl."
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee's last-second drive began at the Rams' 12 with 1:54 remaining and
one timeout.
</P>
<P>
	   As he had all season, Steve McNair never lost his cool. He moved the team
down and gave the Titans a final chance for yet another miracle.
</P>
<P>
	   There were six seconds remaining and Tennessee had used its last timeout
when the Titans lined up for the play that capped the most exciting Super Bowl
finish ever.
</P>
<P>
	   The play was called "Sliver Right." The Titans had run the play three times
in practice from the 10-yard line against the same defense the Rams came out in.
</P>
<P>
	   McNair threw the ball to the middle of the field, meaning it was a touchdown
or nothing. Dyson ran the route a tad shallow.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes in the heat of the moment, you tend to cut things a little
short," Titans offensive coordinator Les Steckel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dyson made the catch, then scooted toward the end zone, but ran into Jones,
an ninth-year veteran who has made a living on his solid fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones wrapped up, the receiver's reach wasn't long enough, and while the
Rams soaked in the confetti and the celebration, the Titans rolled around in
despair.
</P>
<P>
	   "To come this far and be a half-yard short is just a sick feeling," Dyson
said. "When he got his hands on me, I thought I'd break the tackle. But he slid
down to my foot, like you're supposed to, and made a great play. I realized as
soon as a I stretched out and was going down, that I didn't get the point of the
ball over the goal line."
</P>
<P>
	   It was quite a different scene three weeks ago for Dyson.
</P>
<P>
	   He was the player who took the disputed lateral from Frank Wycheck and ran
the last-minute kickoff back against Buffalo. That was a play that helped propel
the Titans into the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, it was something less spectacular. Just a good, clean tackle from
a player who has been making good tackles all his life.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a great throw and catch," Titans coach Jeff Fisher said. "He got
tripped up. The Rams have done that all year and congratulations to them. We
have made those kind of plays all year, and this particular play we didn't."
</P>
<P>
	   So, the Titans trudged off knowing they'll be part of the game film that
coaches everywhere will use to inspire their players to appreciate the art of
tackling.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams will be part of that tape, too -- but on the winning end.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody says this game comes down to fundamentals," said co-defensive
coordinator Peter Giunta. "It's a simple game. It's blocking and tackling."
</P>
<P>
	   Tackling, to be more precise.
</P>
<P>
	   And because Jones made a good one, he was wrapping his arms around a Super
Bowl trophy, as well.

<HEADLINE> Titans' Bishop Taken to Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- Tennessee safety Blaine Bishop strained his neck in a scary
collision during the third quarter of the Super Bowl and lay motionless on the
field for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bishop, who jammed his helmet into the back of St. Louis tight end Ernie
Conwell on a tackle, did have movement in his arms and legs before he was taken
off the field on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
	   "I lost feeling in my neck and left arm. But everything is cool now. I'm
going to be OK," said Bishop, who was wearing a neck brace after the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "The doctors said I just pinched a nerve. It didn't mess up the bones or
anything."
</P>
<P>
	   Players on both teams prayed on the sidelines while Bishop was being tended
to by trainers. St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner, a devout Christian, even
knelt beside the motionless Bishop.
</P>
<P>
	   Bishop was taken to Piedmont Hospital for precautionary X-rays that were
negative.
</P>
<P>
	   The injury left the Titans without both their starting safeties.
</P>
<P>
	   Second-year safety Perry Phenix replaced Bishop. Free safety Marcus
Robertson broke his left leg in the AFC Championship game and was replaced by
Anthony Dorsett.

<HEADLINE> Kurt Warner Is Super Bowl MVP  </HEADLINE>
    By HAL BOCK AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Kurt Warner laughs at the suggestion that this season of his
is some kind of fairy tale, a farfetched script dreamed up by a writer with a
vivid imagination.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think of it as a Hollywood story," he said after finishing it off
Sunday with the ultimate exclamation point -- a record-breaking Super Bowl MVP
performance. "It's my life. I take it one day at a time. I'm truly blessed. If
it can be a source of hope to anybody, I'm happy to be a part of it."
</P>
<P>
	   The quarterback who once tossed rolls of toilet paper around an Iowa
supermarket turned the Super Bowl into his private playground in a 23-16 victory
over the Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   He picked apart Tennessee's secondary, completing 24 of 45 passes for a
record 414 yards, breaking Hall of Famer Joe Montana's mark of 357.
</P>
<P>
	   First, Warner constructed a 16-0 lead. Then, when Tennessee made a furious
second-half comeback to tie the score with two minutes to play, he won the game
with a 73-yard touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce.
</P>
<P>
	   Stuff like this reads like fiction. Warner knows that. He just shrugs it off
and delivers an important message for every outsider, every player who was ever
told he wasn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
	   "Don't ever lose sight of the goal," he said. "Don't let anybody tell you
you can't reach it. Keep it in you, and there's no reason you can't do it."
</P>
<P>
	   Warner did not for a moment believe the Rams would not win this game, even
in the face of the Titans' comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've got two minutes," he said. "We've been up and down the field all day.
There was no reason we couldn't move it for a field goal to win it. By no means
were we doubting that we could win the game."
</P>
<P>
	   But like a kid in a sandlot, Warner went for broke on first down instead of
playing it conservatively.
</P>
<P>
	   Naturally, it worked.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a go route," he said. "We called it earlier and Isaac beat his guy.
We thought we could get a big one right off the bat. Maybe they weren't
expecting it."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce broke loose and took Warner's pass into the end zone, giving the Rams
the lead and pushing the quarterback into exclusive company -- Super Bowl heroes
such as Bart Starr, Roger Staubach, Terry Bradshaw and Joe Namath.
</P>
<P>
	   The difference was that those guys were future Hall of Famers, expected to
produce championships for their teams. Warner came out of football's shadows to
bring this one to the Rams, who had struggled through nine straight losing
seasons before finding him almost by accident.
</P>
<P>
	   This was a success story almost too corny to be true.
</P>
<P>
	   After playing at Northern Iowa -- hardly a hotbed of NFL talent -- Warner
spent three seasons on the outskirts of pro football with the Iowa Barnstormers
of the fringe Arena Football League, and one more in NFL Europe with the
Amsterdam Admirals.
</P>
<P>
	   He was a backup with the Rams, an insurance policy that St. Louis cashed in
when $16.5 million free agent Trent Green was injured in training camp. And
suddenly, the anonymous quarterback blossomed into a full-fledged NFL star.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner directed a high-powered St. Louis attack to a 13-3 season, setting a
team record for passing yards with 4,353 and throwing 41 touchdown passes. He
joined Dan Marino as the only player in NFL history to throw 40 or more TDs in a
season.
</P>
<P>
	   He was the regular season MVP, a most unlikely candidate for the award,
given his humble football roots. A year ago, he said, even he wouldn't have
dreamed of this.
</P>
<P>
	   "At the time, it wasn't very realistic to think I'd be the starter in the
Super Bowl," Warner said. "They were trying to figure out if I was good enough
to be the backup.
</P>
<P>
	   "I always believed in myself. There were no doubts that if I ever got the
opportunity, that I could be successful. I continued to believe that through the
times I worked in the supermarket and the times I played in Arena Football. I
never lost sight of that. To me, that's what it's all about -- believing in
yourself, waiting for that opportunity and then seizing it when it came.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was just hoping I would get an opportunity throughout the season to play
and to show people what I could do."
</P>
<P>
	   And that turned out to be plenty.
</P>
<P>
	   His performance bordered on startling. He led the league with a quarterback
rating of 109.2 and gave every longshot football player the hope that someday he
could duplicate this kind of unexpected success.
</P>
<P>
	   For Warner, it was no surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just went out and did what I expected myself to do from day one, things
I've been doing for the last few years," he said. "It just happens that some
people who hadn't seen me do it, got to see me do it this year."
</P>
<P>
	   And on Sunday he did it in pro football's top showcase.

<HEADLINE> Vermeil Cool During Victory  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM LITKE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- To know how sweet it is, remember from how far back Dick
Vermeil came. And how close he came to going back there again.
</P>
<P>
	   People who think old coaches can't learn new tricks -- one or two, anyway --
didn't see Vermeil when the game ended with the Tennessee Titans out of time and
a yard short of forcing overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil was so calm at that moment, he almost looked scary. In that same
situation, in his last go-round as a coach, that kind of cool was beyond his
reach.
</P>
<P>
	   "When the ball went in the air, I was going to get on the phone," Vermeil
recalled. He was planning to call up offensive coordinator Mike Martz and have
him script the first series of plays for the extra period.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis linebacker Mike Jones made sure that wasn't necessary. The ball
that Vermeil watched so intently went from Titans quarterback Steve McNair to
receiver Kevin Dyson at about the 3-yard line, but Jones expertly wrestled Dyson
to the ground at the 1. At that moment, Vermeil let a torrent of emotions go.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've been in the other locker room," he said after the Rams' 23-16 win was
in the books. "I've been in the Super Bowl and lost, so I know how it feels. And
believe me, this feeling is much better."
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil's word is fine, but to understand exactly how much better, remember
his actions the last time he got to the Super Bowl. That was in 1981, almost an
entire career ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil was coaching the Eagles back then, one of the NFL's ambitious young
Turks. A relentless worker, he took over in 1976 and immediately started driving
the team as hard as he drove himself. After two losing seasons, they carried him
to the playoffs as a wild-card entry in their third, the NFC divisional playoffs
the next year and the conference championship the year after that.
</P>
<P>
	   With Vermeil refusing to take his foot off their necks, the Eagles advanced
to the Super Bowl in 1981. There they met a boisterous, curfew-breaking Raiders
squad that seemed like the evil twin of the polished, disciplined outfit Vermeil
brought to New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
	   Not that it did them any good. The Raiders hammered Philadelphia 27-10. In
the locker room afterward, with a voice so flat it sent chills down the spine,
Vermeil said, "Anyone who says one loss cannot ruin a season never lost a Super
Bowl."

<HEADLINE> Wilkins Kicks Rams Into High Gear  </HEADLINE>
    By R.B. FALLSTROM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Jeff Wilkins and his sore left knee got quite a workout.
</P>
<P>
	   The kicker was the St. Louis Rams' biggest question mark heading into the
Super Bowl due to chronic tendinitis in his plant leg. And that was with good
reason, considering his performance in the Rams' 23-16 victory over the
Tennessee Titans on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilkins made three short attempts in the first half for the only points in a
9-0 lead. But he also was wide right on a 34-yarder.
</P>
<P>
	   "I made it through, and that's all that matters," Wilkins said. "All I
needed was one game, and I made it through."
</P>
<P>
	   Wilkins said he will undergo surgery in a week or so. The injury has
affected his kicking all season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams needed Wilkins a lot more than usual due to unaccountable
breakdowns inside the 20, especially in the first half. Results: mixed. A fifth
attempt was botched when holder Mike Horan mishandled the snap and placed the
ball on its side instead of a point, and Wilkins never got off a kick.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Wilkins and Horan blamed overly slick balls for the kick he didn't get
to try.
</P>
<P>
	   "The ball boys wouldn't even let us touch them so that we had an idea of
what to expect," Horan said. "They're a lot different than practice balls, and
even the new ones we brought out to use this week."
</P>
<P>
	   Wilkins had no excuse for the 34-yard miss. He missed only one of 13
attempts inside the 40 in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just mis-hit it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also shrugged it off, despite the magnitude of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "It wasn't a perfect day," Wilkins said. "But in the past I've let things
bother me more than I probably should. This time I didn't let it bother me."
</P>
<P>
	   All the work didn't seem to overly affect him. Wilkins forced a touchback
after kicking off following his third field goal near the end of the half, and
also reached the end zone to open the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams led the NFL in scoring efficiency inside the 20 in the regular
season, with 38 touchdowns and 12 field goals in 59 trips. Kurt Warner joined
Dan Marino as the only quarterbacks to throw 40 or more touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first half, Warner passed for 277 yards and the Rams penetrated the
20 five times. But he never really came close to converting.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had some problems in the red zone, but we were trying to get the ball in
there," running back Marshall Faulk said. "But we were trying to get the ball in
there. We knew eventually we would get in there."
</P>
<P>
	   Twice in the playoffs, Wilkins talked the Rams out of signing 43-year-old
Nick Lowery, who hasn't kicked since 1996. Lowery came to Atlanta on his own,
and brought his kicking shoe just in case.
</P>
<P>
	   But during the Super Bowl buildup, Wilkins reasoned it was just "one dang
game."
</P>
<P>
	   Wilkins was 20-of-28 during the regular season, but has been bothered by the
injury much of the time. He missed a mid-range field goal attempt in each of the
Rams' previous two playoff games.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilkins hurt his right leg against the Titans on his 38-yard miss in the
final minute of a 24-21 loss Oct. 31, but he didn't miss any games because of
it.

<HEADLINE> Rams Nip Titans 23-16 in Super Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE GOLDBERG AP Football Writer 	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A game of yards came
down to inches for the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl.
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The result was a victory for Kurt Warner, Dick Vermeil and the Rams that six
months ago seemed no more than a dream after a 4-12 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner's 73-yard touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce with 1 minute, 54 seconds
left accounted for the winning score, 16 seconds after Al Del Greco's field goal
brought Tennessee back from a 16-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   But it took Mike Jones' tackle of Kevin Dyson at the 1-yard line on the
game's final play that finally gave St. Louis its win in one of the most
thrilling Super Bowl finishes ever.
</P>
<P>
	   Dyson was left sprawled on the ground in Jones' arms, stretching the ball
toward the goal line in vain. So, a team known for its high-powered offense won
its first Super Bowl with the most memorable of defensive plays.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner passed for a Super Bowl record 414 yards and was voted MVP, capping a
season that began with him fighting for a backup job and ended with him as the
NFL's MVP.
</P>
<P>
	   "Kurt Warner is Kurt Warner and it's not a fairy tale," coach Vermeil said.
"He is a book. He is a movie."
</P>
<P>
	   Added Warner: "You may think of this as a Hollywood story, but it's just my
life."
</P>
<P>
	   But he almost had to rewrite the script after the Titans scored on three
straight drives to tie the score at 16.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee's comeback was engineered by Steve McNair and Eddie George. But it
was Dyson who almost pulled off his second miracle finish in four weeks, coming
up just short of the tying touchdown after taking a look-in pass from McNair at
the 5 and scrambling for the end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought we could do it but we came up about 6 inches from having a chance
to do it," Titans coach Jeff Fisher said. "As much as this hurts we have an
awful lot of pride in coming so close."
</P>
<P>
	   Dyson was the man at the end of the "Music City Miracle," the 22-16 win over
Buffalo in a wild-card game, taking a lateral from Frank Wycheck and returning
it 75 yards for the winning touchdown with three seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought he was going to get in," McNair said. "But you've got great
athletes on both sides of the ball and they made the play. It was a matter of
who won the one-on-one battle and they won it."
</P>
<P>
	   Jones said: "The name of the game is to get the man on the ground. They won
the wild-card game with a big play and we knew they'd come roaring back. We just
made the big play at the end. You get tired chasing Steve McNair and making
plays."
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first NFL title for the Rams since 1951 and the first football
title ever for St. Louis, which lost the Cardinals after the 1987 season and
gained the Rams from Los Angeles in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   It not only capped an improbable season for the team but also for Warner,
who played in the Arena League and NFL Europe and was left unprotected in the
expansion draft last spring. He got the starting job when free agent Trent Green
was hurt and went on to win the NFL MVP and throw 41 touchdown passes, only the
second quarterback in NFL history to surpass 40.
</P>
<P>
	   It was also a triumph for the 63-year-old Vermeil, who was out of football
for 14 years before joining the Rams in 1997. He had lost the Super Bowl in 1981
in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   "You know I'm an emotional guy, but right now I feel so good and so proud of
this football team," Vermeil said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams couldn't quite break open the game while opening up a 16-0 lead.
Three straight times they had to settle for field goals by Jeff Wilkins of 29,
27 and 28 yards. Wilkins missed another field goal and another was aborted by a
fumbled snap.
</P>
<P>
	   So even though Warner threw for 277 yards in the first half and the Rams
outgained the Titans 294-89, it was only 9-0 at intermission.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had some problems in the red zone," said Marshall Faulk, who was held to
17 yards on 10 carries but had five catches for 90 yards. "They played us tough
but we came away with field goals."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams seemed to put it away when Warner hit Torry Holt with a 9-yard
touchdown pass with 3:59 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Two plays earlier, the Titans, already without free safety Marcus Robertson
and top receiver Yancey Thigpen, lost strong safety Blaine Bishop with a neck
sprain that delayed the game for about 10 minutes while was taken off.
</P>
<P>
	   But suddenly, McNair and George got energized and the Rams' defense began to
wear down.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans scored touchdowns on their next two possessions as George, who
ran for 95 yards on 28 carries, scored twice on 1-yard runs. Tennessee's 2-point
conversion attempt failed after the first TD.
</P>
<P>
	   Al Del Greco tied the game on a 43-yard field goal with 2:12 left.
</P>
<P>
	   McNair completed nine straight passes during the final drive, and threw for
214 yards in the game and scrambled for a Super Bowl-record 64 more. That
included a 23-yard run that set up the first score and a 12-yard scramble with a
15-yard face mask penalty added in the final rally.
</P>
<P>
	   "He left everything out there on the field," Fisher said. "I told him we
will be back. Don't ever forget this moment because we will be back. We will be
back because he has the heart of a champion."
</P>
<P>
	   But it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
	   On the first play after Del Greco's tying field goal, Warner went deep to
Bruce, who outleaped Tennessee's Denard Walker at the 38, then cut back twice to
score. The play was called by offensive coordinator Mike Martz, who will take
over as coach when Vermeil retires.
</P>
<P>
	   "He said 'Let's take a shot. Let's go to Isaac,"' Vermeil said. "If we
didn't make it, we'd try to get it on the next two downs."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce said: "We had been getting field goals. We needed to get the ball in
the end zone."
</P>
<P>
	   That still left the Titans with 1:54 and one time out. They worked the ball
methodically down the field with two big plays -- 27 yards on McNair's scramble
and the ensuing penalty and a 16-yard pass to Dyson to put the ball on the 10
with five seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Then the Titans called their final time out.
</P>
<P>
	   The final play was a slant. Dyson grabbed the ball and lunged for the end
zone with Jones grabbing him by the ankles. He went down less than a yard from
the goal, trying to get his hand with the ball in it over the goal line.
</P>
<P>
	   "When he got his hands on me I thought I'd break the tackle but he slid down
to my foot like you're supposed to and made a great play," Dyson said. "I
realized as soon as I stretched out and was going down that I didn't get the
point of the ball over the goal line."
</P>
<P>
	   That was a huge relief for the Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I saw that ball go in the air, I said 'It's a touchdown,"' Vermeil
said. "I was ready to call coach Martz and tell him to get the script ready for
overtime.".
</P>
<P>
	   Instead they wrote a script for a celebration.

<HEADLINE> Titans Surge, Then Fall Short  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- One yard, 36 measly inches.
</P>
<P>
	   For a month now, Tennessee had been getting that extra break. On Sunday
night, the Titans fell a Tennessee two-step short.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's ironic isn't it," Kevin Dyson said. "We're 16 seconds away from not
even being here and not even being in this game. It's ironic."
</P>
<P>
	   Dyson, who pulled out a victory over Buffalo in the AFC wild-card game with
a last-second return, couldn't do it again Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   His right arm fell a yard short of the end zone as time expired, just
missing what could have been the tying touchdown in a 23-16 loss to the Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew we had an opportunity to go down and score. Unfortunately, we got
down there and just fell short," said quarterback Steve McNair, who helped bring
back the Titans from a 16-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   "Falling short like that," left tackle Brad Hopkins said, "really tears your
heart out."
</P>
<P>
	   Ever since Jan. 8, the Titans had been calling themselves a team of destiny.
That was the day they trailed Buffalo 16-15 with 16 seconds remaining, then
stunned the Bills when Dyson caught a cross-field lateral from Frank Wycheck and
ran 75 yards untouched for a touchdown and a 22-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Instant replay helped them twice in the divisional round against
Indianapolis. One replay gave them the inches they needed for a first down on a
carry by McNair, and a second replay nullified a Terrence Wilkins' punt return
to the Tennessee 3 and preserved the Titans' lead.
</P>
<P>
	   They got no such help against the Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans tied the game at 16 on a 43-yard field goal by Al Del Greco, who
missed one attempt left and had another blocked, with 2:12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurt Warner needed just one play to find Isaac Bruce on a 73-yard touchdown
pass play. Titans cornerback Denard Walker was running with step for step with
Bruce until the receiver stopped for a half-stride, enough space to catch the
ball and lose Walker for what would be the winning TD.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Jeff Fisher said that Walker, who dressed and quickly left the locker
room after the game, tripped on the play.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have made those kind of plays all year and this particular play we
didn't," Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans had made a habit of rallying in the second half. They won five
games in the regular season and all three of their playoff games by doing just
that.
</P>
<P>
	   They thought they had plenty of time left with 1:54 to go. McNair drove them
down the field and found Dyson slanting across the field just inside the 5 in
the last seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's set up exactly like we worked on it in practice," Dyson said of the
play called "Sliver Right." "It came down to the linebacker making a great
tackle."
</P>
<P>
	   Dyson caught the ball and thought he would score. Then, Rams linebacker Mike
Jones grabbed him.
</P>
<P>
	   "I realized as soon as I stretched out and was going down that I didn't get
the point of the ball over the goal line," Dyson said. "When he got his hands on
me, I thought I'd break the tackle, but he slid down to my foot like you're
supposed to and made a great play. Maybe I should have pitched it back to
somebody."
</P>
<P>
	   Offensive coordinator Les Steckel said Dyson, who had four catches for 41
yards in the game, cut the play a little early. The Titans had practiced it
three times in the past week.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the intensity of the moment," Steckel said, "people cut things a little
short."
</P>
<P>
	   With the Titans realizing their run finally had stopped, their dressing room
was quiet enough to hear a pin drop after the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Eddie George, who scored two touchdowns within 7 minutes, 53 seconds of the
second half to put the Titans in position to tie, said he never doubted that
they would send the Super Bowl into overtime. He said coming so close will drive
him throughout the offseason to try and get back to the Super Bowl next year.
</P>
<P>
	   But he took a minute and thought about the Titans' run through the playoffs,
a 16-4 record and the franchise's first-ever Super Bowl. He reflected on the
victory over Buffalo, the win over Indianapolis and becoming the first NFL team
to beat a team (Jacksonville) three times in one season, including twice on the
road.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was one hell of a ride," George said. "It will always be special to me.
We just fell short. We didn't make enough plays to win it. That's just the
bottom line."

Kenya Airlways Flight Crashes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- A Kenya Airways jet carrying 169 passengers and
10 crew members crashed into the sea Sunday night, shortly after takeoff from
Abidjan. At least seven people were pulled from the water alive, officials said.
The plane, an Airbus 310, took off at 9:08 p.m. and crashed into the Atlantic
Ocean just one minute later, according to George Dapre Yao, the head of air
traffic at Abidjan's Felix Houphouet-Boigny Airport. In Abidjan, witnesses said
the plane never appeared to get sufficient altitude as it crossed over the
airport's wall and headed out over the ocean, just a few hundred yards away.

Study Finds Austin, Phoenix Best Cities

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With robust finances and well-trained public work forces,
Austin, Texas, and Phoenix are the best-managed major American cities, according
to an analysis by Syracuse University. The study rated the municipal governments
of the nation's 35 largest cities in terms of revenues, assigning grades from A
to F on five management criteria: finances, human resources, capital,
information technology and results. A common factor in cities that scored well
was strong leadership, said Patricia W. Ingraham, director of the Government

thick coat of ice moved up the coast Sunday, leaving warmer temperatures and
drier roads for thousands of football fans who trekked to the Georgia Dome to
watch the Super Bowl. The storm brought snow, sleet and rain from the Carolinas
to southeastern New York, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers.
The same storm had dumped more than a foot of snow in parts of the southern

	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Kurt Warner's 73-yard touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce with 1

The TD capped an improbable turnaround for St. Louis, which was 3-13 a year ago
and 13-3 this season as they scored 526 points, third best in NFL history. But
Steve McNair and Eddie George almost led Tennessee to another miracle finish,
rallying them from a 16-0 deficit. On the game's final play with six seconds
left, McNair's pass was caught by Kevin Dyson at the Rams 5. He scrambled for
the end zone only to be stopped just short by Mike Jones, as Dyson's
outstretched arm held the ball toward the goal line in vain.

to my foot like you're supposed to and made a great play," Dyson said. "I
realized as soon as I stretched out and was going down that I didn't get the
point of the ball over the goal line."

<P>
	   That was a huge relief for the Rams.

	   "When I saw that ball go in the air, I said 'It's a touchdown,"' Vermeil
said. "I was ready to call coach Martz and tell him to get the script ready for
overtime.".

	   Instead they wrote a script for a celebration.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Author Kurt Vonnegut was hospitalized Sunday after suffering
smoke inhalation in a fire at his Manhattan home.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was reported at 7 p.m. in a fourth-floor bedroom in Vonnegut's
four-story brownstone on East 48th Street, said firefighter Jim Spollen, a
department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Vonnegut, 77, was taken to New York Presbyterian Hospital for treatment of
smoke inhalation, Spollen said. An administrator at the hospital confirmed that
the author was being treated but declined to comment on his condition.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no other injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Spollen said the cause of the fire was under investigation but it did not
appear to be suspicious. It took firefighters about 20 minutes to put out.
</P>
<P>
	   A bestseller author and social critic, Vonnegut's book include ``Breakfast
of Champions,'' ``Slaughterhouse-Five,'' ``Cat's Cradle,'' and ``Hocus Pocus.''
