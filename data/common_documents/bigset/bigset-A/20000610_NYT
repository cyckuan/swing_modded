USC'S LUNETTA IS AILING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. - USC is fortunate it opens College World Series
play today instead of Friday, or the Trojans might have been
without star freshman Anthony Lunetta, who has the flu and missed
both practices here.
</P>
<P>
   Lunetta, the Pacific-10 Conference freshman of the year, came
down with the virus Thursday and has been held out of all workouts.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Mike Gillespie said there were indications Lunetta
might have strep throat but expected him to start at second base
today when the fourth-ranked Trojans play fifth-ranked Florida
State at Rosenblatt Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We allowed him a day and a half to get fine, and if he's not,
he'll still be fine,'' Gillespie said. ``He's feeling better now.
He's on an upswing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunetta is one of USC's most dangerous hitters, leading the
Trojans with 22 doubles. Overall, he is hitting .350 with 11 home
runs and 49 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Borchard weighing options: Stanford right fielder Joe Borchard
of Camarillo, the 12th pick in the baseball amateur draft, hit a
towering home run Friday night in the Cardinal's 6-4 victory over
Louisiana-Lafayette, then said after the game he had not decided if
he would return to play quarterback for the football team in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all going to be worked out in the near future,''
Borchard said. ``I have to keep my options open. I didn't know I
would get drafted so high. At this point, everything is still
speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the chances were he would play football, Borchard
replied: ``Right now, it's tough to say anything. We have a big
game to play Sunday. It is nice to be able to relax right now with
everything that went on in the draft this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Still the underdog: Gillespie believes the Trojans have been
mentally sharp in the regionals and super regionals, but is
concerned how USC will react to playing in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week, it's been about taking the next step. Are we
overrated by taking this next step? Quite frankly, it's what I
worry about right now,'' he said. ``I hope they believe they can do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't seem to be a problem with the players, who are not
lacking self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really want to win this thing,'' USC pitcher Mark Prior
said. ``The thing that gives me confidence is we're playing so well
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   No jitters: USC pitcher Rik Currier pitched two games in
Rosenblatt Stadium during the Trojans' last visit here in 1998,
victories over Mississippi State and then Arizona State in the
national-championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember I couldn't believe I was here,'' Currier said. ``By
the fifth or sixth inning, I was on the mound and just kind of
looked at the crowd and went, `Wow.' The only way pitching here
before will help me is with nerves.''

YANKEE FANS BOO CLEMENS OFF FIELD AS METS BEAT YANKEES, 12-2 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roger Clemens stepped off the mound in the sixth
inning of Friday night's game at Yankee Stadium and walked steadily
into a head wind of boos, the tempest of Yankee fans raging over
his horrible performance against the Mets. Clemens crossed the
first base line, the discontent growing louder, reaching a pitch
just before he disappeared into the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Tyner of the Mets, five days into his major league career,
had been the first batter to get to Clemens and Mike Piazza all but
finished him with a grand slam in the third inning, as the Mets
destroyed the Yankees, 12-2, in the opener of their three-game
weekend series.
</P>
<P>
   Two events have occurred without fail in each of Clemens' three
starts in the series against the Mets since he joined the Yankees:
Piazza has hit a home run, and Al Leiter has been the pitcher who
beat him.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter (7-1) allowed seven hits and two runs last night; Clemens
(4-5) has allowed 21 runs (20 earned) in 13 innings in the three
games against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Before he pitches, Clemens covers his body with a scentless balm
called Red Hot to help him get ready, even on warm and muggy
nights. He finished his warm-ups under a coating of sweat, walked
to Monument Park, pressed a palm against Babe Ruth's plaque and
took the field, at 37, the oldest starter in the season's first of
six games between the New York City rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The game's youngest player batted first: Tyner, tall and
bat-handle thin, 22 years old, and he pushed Clemens to a full
count before lining a game-opening double over the head of Bernie
Williams in center.
</P>
<P>
   Tyner did not score in the inning, but he did scamper to third
on a ground ball to Derek Jeter's right at shortstop, beating
Jeter's throw.
</P>
<P>
   What the Yankees understood from this play about Tyner is that
he is not afraid to take chances. Maybe this is what weighed on
Clemens' psyche in the third inning, affecting everything he did in
the game's decisive inning.
</P>
<P>
   Tyner opened the third by pushing a bunt in front of home plate,
toward the mound, the ball rolling perhaps 15 feet before the
catcher Jorge Posada grabbed it and threw to first _ high, taking
Tino Martinez off the base. Tyner was on and the Yankees obsessed
over him.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens came set, ready to pitch to Derek Bell, who had four
hits in his last 54 at-bats (.074), and the pitcher stepped off,
watching Tyner. Clemens threw a fastball and Bell swung through it;
in fact, all six pitches Clemens threw to Bell in the at-bat were
fastballs, the pitch most advantageous in throwing out base
runners.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens pitched out on the second pitch and Tyner wasn't moving.
Clemens threw to first, pushing Tyner back, then pumped a fastball
high to Bell; two balls and one strike. Tyner broke from first on
the next pitch with a good jump, and Bell fouled off the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens rushed his delivery and threw high, and with the count
full, he rushed again, his fastball sailing out of the strike zone
for ball 4 on the slump-ridden Bell, a killer walk.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had first and second and nobody out in a scoreless
game.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens fired high again on the first pitch to Edgardo Alfonzo,
Posada wincing as the ball bounced out of his glove for a passed
ball, and both runners advanced. Clemens walked Alfonzo, as well,
loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   A roar of anticipation followed Piazza as he walked to the plate
to face Clemens, off whom he had five hits in 10 career at-bats,
including two home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens tried to spin a slider. Piazza was ready, swinging, his
left leg stiffening and serving as anchor, and the ball rocketed
toward center field, Clemens' head jerking skyward as the ball
carried over the fence. It was only the second grand slam Clemens
has allowed in the 3,542 innings of his career, and it was the 11th
Piazza has hit in his career.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the signature hit Friday night, for Leiter was
pitching effectively, and with the Mets now leading 4-0, the rest
of the game seemed unnecessary, other than to inflame the feelings
of Yankee fans toward Clemens. There were 55,822 in the park, most
of them cheering for the Yankees .
</P>
<P>
   Bell singled home a run in the fourth inning, his fifth hit in
55 at-bats, and after the Yankees got a run in the fourth, the Mets
got another in the fifth. Tyner pulled a single through the right
side of the infield, haunting Clemens, then taking second when
Clemens bounced a pick-off attempt into the first base stands.
</P>
<P>
   Bell doubled inside the right field line, scoring Tyner, and
before Alfonzo batted, Posada walked toward the mound to say
something to Clemens, turned and looked toward the dugout, wiping
his brow with his gloved hand.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens pitched to Alfonzo, there was a sharp crack, and in an
instant Alfonzo's drive had landed beyond the wall in center.
</P>
<P>
   Now Yankees Manager Joe Torre stepped onto the field to get his
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The booing began, and Clemens spoke to the infielders
surrounding him as they waited for Torre. But before Clemens
departed, Torre spoke into his right ear, knowing what Clemens
would hear on the way back to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The booing was scathing, the message clear: Throughout Clemens'
tenure with the Yankees, fans have extended his probation,
occasionally embracing him, but now they were furious. He had
flopped badly in a game that means more to them than any other
regular season game he has pitched.

N.J. COURT ORDERS PAROLE FOR CONVICTED KILLER; STATE APPEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LODI, N.J. _ In a rare judicial step, a New Jersey appeals panel
Friday ordered the parole of a 62-year-old convict who has been
imprisoned since 1964 for pistol-whipping and fatally shooting two
Lodi police officers in a highway bar.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel of the Appellate
Division instructed the New Jersey Parole Board to release the
inmate, Thomas Trantino, in 30 days. He is serving a life sentence
from which the only release is parole.
</P>
<P>
   The order represents a victory for Trantino, who has been in
state prison longer than any other New Jersey inmate and has been
campaigning for freedom for 20 years, over the objections of many
in Bergen County, where the officers were killed in August 1963.
</P>
<P>
   The judges told the state Department of Corrections to transfer
Trantino immediately to a halfway house or residential center as
preparation for his release. But in response to a request by the
state attorney general, the judges ordered a temporary postponement
of the transfer, said Chuck Davis, a spokesman for Attorney General
John J. Farmer Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that on Monday the panel would review Farmer's
request that it also set aside the order to release Trantino in 30
days while the New Jersey governor's administration appeals the
order to the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The judges' order rankled parole board officials, who said that
Trantino was only the second state prison inmate in history to win
court-ordered parole. The other, a man serving 10 years for
molesting a 10-year-old girl, was ordered released this week by
another appeals panel, said Michael Carlin, deputy executive
director of the parole board.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin said the two orders ``raised very serious legal issues''
about the courts interfering with the workings of the executive
branch of government.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also touched off a new round of protest by Bergen
County and municipal officials, representatives of seven police
departments and survivors of the two slain officers, Sgt. Peter
Voto, 40, and Officer Gary Tedesco, a 22-year-old rookie patrolman.
For years, the county's elected representatives and law enforcement
officials have argued, in rallies and candlelight vigils, that
parole for Trantino would be disrespectful to the memories of the
two officers.
</P>
<P>
   Against this heated political backdrop, the parole board has
rejected nine parole applications from Trantino since he became
eligible in 1980. And Friday's appellate ruling suggests that the
state's judicial system has grown impatient with the board's
handling of Trantino's case and its legal reasoning for the latest
rejection, which was issued last June.
</P>
<P>
   The three judges _ Michael P. King, John E. Wallace and Robert
A. Fall _ found that the parole board's conclusions and findings
were unreasonable, based on the evidence in Trantino's file, and
conveyed a ``sense of wrongness.'' The judges said the state's
parole laws and standards required them to intervene and reverse
the board, which had failed to adequately consider the
``substantial and positive'' factors in Trantino's parole
application.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, other appellate panels and the New Jersey Supreme
Court, the state's highest tribunal, found flaws in the parole
board's rejections of Trantino's applications. But those rulings
always instructed the board to again review Trantino's case. This
time, the appeals judges did not order the board to review the
case, instead ordered Trantino's parole in 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer, the state attorney general, said Friday that Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman had instructed him to appeal the case. In a
written statement, he said the parole board believed that Trantino
had no plan for life after parole, could not handle stress and was
easily agitated and prone to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lethal combination created an unacceptable risk of
recidivism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling in May 1998, the state Supreme Court refined the
legal standard for Trantino's parole, saying he should be freed
unless the parole board found a ``substantial likelihood'' that
Trantino would commit a crime after parole. The court also
suggested that Trantino did not pose such a risk and told the board
to look at his case again.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's ruling said the board had not properly applied the 1998
``substantial likelihood'' standard. In part, the decision said,
the board had improperly based its rejection on the opinion of a
board psychologist, Glen Ferguson, who in the mid-1990s favored
parole for Trantino, but in 1999 and said that Trantino had the
potential for committing new violent crimes if freed.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's ruling, about 30 police officers from Lodi and
surrounding towns gathered outside Lodi's municipal building, next
to an eagle-topped memorial to Voto and Tedesco. The Bergen County
executive, William P. Schuber, vowed to fight what he called a
``wrong, wrong decision.''

BOTTENFIELD PITCHED IN PAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -- Pitcher Kent Bottenfield tried to pitch through the
tendinitis in his right shoulder for the past three weeks, but
finally came to the realization that he was only hurting himself
and the team by going to the mound every five days.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield said he had the same problem at the same time of the
season last year with the Cardinals, but got through it without a
trip to the disabled list. He wasn't so lucky this time, as the
Angels placed him on the DL Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The later I'd get into games the less I could get my arm and
shoulder into position they needed to be in,'' he said. ``I tried
to throw a fastball down and away and it would be up and in. That's
not me. If I were to keep throwing to the point of fatigue, I was
only setting myself up for injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield admitted that being the only veteran in the starting
rotation might have played a role in him trying to pitch through
the problem. But he said missing one or two starts is better than
risking missing one or two months.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield is eligible to come off the DL June 23, roughly
coinciding with the returns of Tim Belcher, Ken Hill and Jason
Dickson.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two weeks, everybody will be back in the rotation,'' he
said. ``We're going to be in this race. You have to give so much
credit to the offense. They don't sit around and moan about the
pitchers giving up leads. I've never been on a team this mentally
tough in my entire life. It's been fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia admitted that past performances against
Diamondbacks pitcher Randy Johnson came into play when he made out
his lineup Friday, but it wasn't the determining factor. Otherwise,
player-turned-broadcaster Rex Hudler would have been playing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had hit Johnson well during his career, Hudler said:
``No ... only about .450!''
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Garret Anderson and second baseman Adam Kennedy
-- both left-handed hitters -- did not start Friday's game.
Anderson is 0 for 9 in his career against Johnson and Kennedy has
never faced him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some pitchers you might look at matchups a little more,''
Scioscia said. ``But G.A. needed a day off. He's been pressing the
last week. He needed a breather and this was a good day for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad moved from left to center, and Edgard Clemente
started in left. Benji Gil started at second base in place of
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's game was Scioscia's first opportunity to manage a major
league game under National League rules. Before the game he said he
was looking forward to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different approach, with things like the double
switch,'' he said. ``In some aspects it's more of a challenge. In
other aspects, some strategy goes out the window with the DH. We
use the DH to manufacture runs at the bottom of the lineup. I enjoy
that part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as any advice for the Angels pitchers hitting, Scioscia
said: ``(Hitting coach) Mickey (Hatcher) said `Close your eyes and
swing from your (rear).' ''

O'NEAL TOO MUCH FOR PACERS AS L.A. WINS GAME 2, 111-104 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The handmade placard at the Staples Center
illustrated well the plight of the Indiana Pacers. ``Stop Shaq?
You're joking, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Fouling him hard, swarming him each time he received the ball,
they tried desperately Friday night. But at 7 feet 1 inch and 330
pounds, with the moves of a lithe swingman, Shaquille O'Neal is
beginning to resemble the bully at recess, holding the ball above
his head while all his inferior classmates jump in futility.
</P>
<P>
   It does not look fair.
</P>
<P>
   Too big, too strong and simply too good, O'Neal again backpacked
the Los Angeles Lakers to a 2-0 lead in the four-of-seven-game
National Basketball Association finals.
</P>
<P>
   He had 40 points and 24 rebounds and made 18 of 39 free throws
in the Lakers' 111-104 Game 2 victory over Indiana before a loud,
to-be-seen-and-heard crowd of almost 19,000. His total of 39 free
throws was an NBA finals record.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal may even have to climb higher on Sunday night. With the
series moving to Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis for Games 3, 4
and possibly 5, the Lakers may be without the other half of their
young All-Star tandem.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant was injured in the first quarter and did not return.
After hitting a 17-foot jump shot over Jalen Rose, Bryant fell
awkwardly to the floor with 3 minutes 26 seconds left. He rolled
his left ankle on Rose's foot while coming down after releasing the
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Helped to the locker room, he was told he had a moderately
sprained ankle after X-rays came up negative. Listed as day to day,
his status for Game 3 was questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant injured the same ankle in Game 5 of the Western
Conference finals, but returned in time for Game 6. He had been
undergoing therapy for the injury since last week, using
range-of-motion exercises to increase flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Pacers coach Larry Bird said he would not employ the Hack-a-Shaq
defense, in which O'Neal is repeatedly fouled to increase
possessions for Indiana and free-throw misses for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But with the game in the balance in the fourth quarter, Bird
resorted to the same strategy used by Portland in the Western
Conference finals. Other than whether O'Neal would miss badly or
sink the shot, it made for awful theater. But it did stop the clock
and give the Pacers a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Rose led the Pacers with 30 points. Reggie Miller finished with
21 points.
</P>
<P>
   But Rik Smits again played poorly. He picked up his fifth foul
with 7:09 left in the third quarter and made only two of six shots.
Unable to stop O'Neal on defense or at least make him guard him
from the perimeter on offense, Smits is hurting Indiana like no
other player.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the Lakers were resilient, the Pacers were not up to
the challenge. With a few minutes left, they essentially were
battling a team that had missed 18 of 36 free throws and was
without the services of its second-best player.
</P>
<P>
   This was the opportunity Bird had wanted for so long, this was
the best chance Indiana had of putting fear into Phil Jackson's
often-fragile team. Who knew when Bryant would play again or if he
would have the same effectiveness?
</P>
<P>
   They were right there, trailing by only 93-89 with 3:14 left.
All they needed was a crucial stop on defense. But they could not
get it. Robert Horry outdueled Austin Croshere for a long rebound
off a miss by Ron Harper.
</P>
<P>
   And seconds later, O'Neal was at the line. He made only one of
two shots _ missing the first with a line-drive delivery that
nearly chipped paint off the rim. But that five-point lead would
stand.
</P>
<P>
   Miller had an open look at a 3-pointer to cut it to within two
points with less than 3 minutes left, but he could not connect.
</P>
<P>
   Without Bryant, role players like Glen Rice and Ron Harper
shouldered the scoring load and played as if they were the key
components to the triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was so strong and forceful, not even the officiating crew
could fathom his power and agility.
</P>
<P>
   With less than seven minutes left, the Lakers center appeared to
cleanly block a driving layup by Travis Best, who used his forearm
to initiate the contact.
</P>
<P>
   But the referee Eddie F. Rush somehow called a flagrant foul on
O'Neal, which had the Laker bench up in anger.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers withstood every Pacer run, finally putting the game
away midway through the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the fourth, O'Neal attempted his 25th free
throw _ the most by a player in finals history.
</P>
<P>
   Harper contributed 20 points to the victory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With O'Neal swarmed, Harper drove the lane instead of forcing
the ball inside. He scored on four driving layups and made his
medium-range jump-shot count each time.
</P>
<P>
   Rice was lethal from the perimeter, spotting up from beyond the
arc. He made four of five 3-pointers. As a team, the Lakers did not
miss a 3-pointer in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Miller found his rhythm on offense, making seven of 14 shots
through three quarters and consistently keeping the Pacers in the
game with a timely jump shot. But with 6:40 left in the game, he
had yet to attempt a shot in the fourth period.

   The study can't prove the chemical, ammonium perchlorate, caused
the hormone spikes or even that it is harmful to humans. But Ross
Bre chner, chief of the state Department of Health Services
epidemiology of fice, said it underscores the need for more
in-depth research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to scare the public because there's nothing to
be scared about,'' said Brechner, who will present his findings to
the American Water Works Association on Thurs day in Denver. ``But
we hope it will put more money into some sort of definitive study
of the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuma officials had not seen the study Friday and were not
prepared to comment, city spokesman Mike Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   Brechner studied the results of the state newborn screening
program in Yuma, which takes all of its drinking water from the
Colorado River, and Flagstaff, which uses no water from the river.
He found slightly higher levels of the thyroid stimulating hormone
in some Yuma newborns.
</P>
<P>
   The study provided a unique oppor tunity to examine how
perchlorate affects humans, said Will Humble, chief of the DHS
environmental health office, because the newborn screening program
tests for thyroid problems.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe ammonium per chlorate interferes with the
thyroid's ability to regulate hormone produc tion and can impair
metabolism and growth, especially in young children. But so little
is known for certain that federal officials can't even establish a
safe level of exposure for the chemi cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what this study means for sure, except that it
adds to the picture,'' Brechner said.
</P>
<P>
   He expects more feedback from other scientists when his work is
published later this year in the ``Journal of Occupational and Envi
ronmental Medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Perchlorate seeped into the lower Colorado River, which provides
drinking water for 20 million people in Nevada, Arizona and
California, from an industrial complex outside Las Vegas. Nevada
officials have been monitoring levels since 1997 and have
discovered high concentra tions in Lake Mead.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona also has measured perchlo rate levels along the Colorado
and in water delivered by the Central Ari zona Project, which draws
1.5 mil lion acre-feet a year from the river.
</P>
<P>
   That survey found levels of the chemical ranging from
undetectable in most Phoenix area locations to about 6 parts per
billion at Lake Havasu and near Yuma, well below Arizona's risk
guideline of 14 parts per billion. No perchlorate was found in
groundwater wells.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Department of Envi ronmental Quality is working with
the federal Environmental Protection Agency and a special
perchlorate task force to establish a health standard, spokesman
Kurt Maurer said. The state agency plans to measure levels along
the Colorado, within the CAP systems and in a number of groundwater
wells again later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it occurs, and we don't anticipate it going away for a
little while yet,'' said Tony Curry, admin istrator of the CAP's
environmental compliance program. ``It is going to be an issue,
probably a greater issue than it has been in the past if this study
pans out to be significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Humble said the DHS study was possible because of recent
advances in measurement technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at lower levels, new problems can surface,'' he
said, which is why more research is critical.

AIDS RATES RISING AMONG
 MINORITIES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service

 BY DANIEL GONZALEZ 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - After having unprotected sex with another man,
Willie Johns ton was surprised to discover that he had the AIDS
virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (AIDS) was something that gay men had,'' said
Johnston, 40, who is Black, explaining why he didn't take
precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, father of four by two women, doesn't consider himself
gay or bisexual.
</P>
<P>
   His confusion about who is at risk for AIDS may help explain why
minorities represent a growing per centage of AIDS and HIV cases in
Arizona, according to AIDS preven tion educators.
</P>
<P>
   Other cultural factors, such as resist ance to condom use, also
factor in, which is why AIDS prevention work ers have begun
reaching out to minority groups where they live and work.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts are aimed at people like Maudie Battle, who was
suicidal after learning she was HIV positive six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she attends a support group for women infected with human
immunodeficiency virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out I'm not the only one,'' said Battle, a Phoenix
resident.
</P>
<P>
   New AIDS cases have declined steadily to 255 new cases in 1999
from a high of 708 in 1992, accord ing to the state Department of
Health Services. But at the same time, minorities account for a
greater percentage of those cases: 49 percent in 1999, up from 18
percent a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities also accounted for 45 percent of the 331 HIV cases in
1999, compared with 29 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The growing HIV and AIDS rates among minorities suggest that the
stigma about homosexuality among men of color may be standing in
the way of AIDS prevention in their communities, AIDS prevention
workers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk to communities of color they think it's a gay
White man's disease,'' said Garry Robin son, program coordinator of
TRIBE, a community-based AIDS prevention program that targets
Blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try to do is educate communities of color that AIDS is
a human disease, and it can and will affect anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about the disease isn't reaching minorities at the
same level as Whites, and underscores the need for culturally
sensitive information, AIDS prevention workers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``(W)hat I'm seeing with Hispanics is that they may not know
they are infected, so they don't seek out treatment; or they know
they are infected, but they don't know where to get treatment,''
said Federico Saenz, program coordinator of La Zona Hispana, an
AIDS prevention program that targets Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   In both the Black and Latino com munities, homosexuality is more
ta boo than the larger society, said Frank Repice, director of
prevention and outreach for AIDS Project Arizona, the largest
provider of HIV-related services in the state. That's partly
because of church influences, and partly due to fear of being
ostracized by family members and community, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to help stem the spread of AIDS in communities of
color, TRIBE and La Zona Hispana will hold an HIV and AIDS
awareness health fair Saturday at a south Phoenix park.
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts have taken on a sense of urgency because health
officials pre dict an increase in the number of AIDS cases in
Arizona linked to a recent jump in syphilis cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same behavior that is going to infect someone with
syphilis could infect someone with HIV,'' said Denise Boyd, who
monitors HIV trends for the state. ``In other words, unprotected
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   HIV can lead to AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
The virus is primarily spread by having unprotected sex with an
infected partner or by sharing intravenous drug needles with
someone infected with the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The virus can weaken the immune system, making it hard to fight
off infections. Medical advances can slow the rate at which HIV
weakens the immune system, but there is no known cure.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several months, out reach workers from TRIBE and La
Zona Hispana have been passing out AIDS prevention information and
condoms at bars, street corners, grocery stores, even laundries.
They also distribute needle sterilization kits to IV drug users in
minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating efforts to pre vent the spread of AIDS in
commu nities of color is the steady influx of non-English speaking
immigrants from Mexico. Many are ignorant of the AIDS threat and
come from a culture that enables machismo be havior, Hispanic
outreach workers say.
</P>
<P>
   Separated from wives back home and confined to close living
quarters, Mexican migrant workers sometimes engage in sex with
other men, said Graciela Mera, an outreach worker at La Zona
Hispana.
</P>
<P>
   Men looking for sex also prey upon migrants desperate for cash
by prop ositioning day laborers waiting for work on street corners,
Mera said.
</P>
<P>
   To help educate Mexican workers about AIDS, Mera passes out AIDS
prevention information to day labor ers on street corners.
</P>
<P>
   Health workers say another factor fueling AIDS infection rates
among some Hispanics is the phenomenon of married men having sex on
the side with other men.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Hispanic male will consider himself macho and believe he can
have sex with either a man or a woman and still not consider
himself a homosexual as long as he is not penetrated,'' Saenz said.
</P>
<P>
   The practice puts not only them selves at risk, but their wives,
Saenz said.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS prevention workers are also finding that more
African-American and Latino men than White men resist using
condoms.
</P>
<P>
   And many women of color will not insist on their male partner
using condoms, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Johnston discovered he had AIDS three years ago, after
his male lover of four years died of the disease. At a friend's
suggestion, Johnston was tested for the virus and came up positive.
</P>
<P>
   His then-girlfriend, who bore his two youngest children, has
tested nega tive for the AIDS virus, as have his children.
</P>
<P>
   Now that his 14-year-old son is showing interest in girls,
Johnston is counseling him against having sex. He also advises him
to use condoms, should the boy not choose absti nence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out and bought him a pack of rubbers,'' Johnston said.
``I tell him rubbers are like a bicycle helmet. You've got to have
it.''

HEALTH OFFICIALS CONFIRM WEST NILE VIRUS KILLED BIRDS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Three crows found dead _ two in New York and one in New Jersey _
were confirmed Friday as this year's first known victims of the
West Nile virus, the mosquito-borne disease that killed seven
people in New York City last year, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, one male and one female crow, believed to be a
mating pair that had been in the area since March, were found near
each other in New City by passers-by on May 22, and taken to the
Rockland County Health Department. The West Nile virus was
confirmed as the cause of the two birds' death Friday, said Ward
Stone, the chief wildlife pathologist for the New York state
Department of Environmental Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, the state Department of Health and Senior
Services announced that a crow found in River Edge, in Bergen
County, 15 miles south of New City, was confirmed to have died from
the virus. Christine Grant, New Jersey's state health commissioner,
said the bird was believed to have been recently infected. Stone
said the Rockland County birds had also been recently infected, and
were believed to have contracted the virus from mosquito bites in
the area where they died .
</P>
<P>
   Steve Ostraff, associate director of the National Center for
Infectious Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, said the birds were the first confirmed cases of the
West Nile virus anywhere in the United States this year.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said new cases of the virus had been expected to surface
as mosquitoes proliferate with the arrival of warm weather.
Mosquitoes carry the disease, picking up the virus from infected
birds and transmitting it to other birds, and to humans, that they
bite. Among other symptoms, West Nile virus can cause encephalitis,
or brain swelling, and older people and people with weakened immune
systems are most susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockland County executive, C. Scott Vanderhoff, issued a
statement Friday reminding residents that people and animals cannot
contract the disease directly from birds. The county health
commissioner, Gabriel R. Guardarramus, urged residents to use
insect repellent, repair broken screens on windows and doors in
their homes, and avoid mosquito habitats _ just about anywhere
water is allowed to pool.
</P>
<P>
   The disease control center is still reviewing New York state's
test results, although federal health officials said they had no
reason to doubt the state's confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of birds from 20 species died from the virus in New
York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland last year.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's outbreak prompted widespread fear of the virus,
and sweeping efforts by city, county and state health officials to
watch for the disease this year, plus efforts to eradicate the
mosquito population through treatment of mosquito breeding grounds
with larvicide, and campaigns to improve public education.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's cases surfaced much earlier in the year than the first
cases last year, but Ostraff cautioned against any inference that
the disease may be more widespread this summer. ``Last year,'' he
said, ``nobody was looking for the virus.''

JOHNSON STOPS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -- Troy Glaus made it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' third baseman hit a 97-mph fastball from Arizona
Diamondbacks pitcher Randy Johnson 457 feet and into the
second-deck restaurant at Bank One Ballpark Friday night for a
second-inning home run and 1-0 Angels lead.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus' homer was the third longest in the ballpark's brief
history, but they don't award extra runs for distance. It turned
out to be the Angels' only run in a 4-1 loss before 39,468 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson returned to the rotation after missing a start with a
sore shoulder, and that was the only reason he lasted only six
innings. Besides the homer to Glaus, he gave up just two other hits
-- singles by Mo Vaughn and Scott Spiezio -- and improved to 10-1.
His ERA actually went up from 1.41 to 1.42.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Brian Cooper was up to the challenge of facing
Johnson, at least for four innings. But the Diamondbacks scored all
four or their runs in the fifth inning against him.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Womack tripled and scored on a single by Jay Bell. Luis
Gonzalez followed with a two-run homer for a 3-1 Diamondbacks'
lead. They added one unearned run in the inning on a throwing error
by Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper (2-2) lasted five innings, gave up the four runs (three
earned) and six hits and got the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson started with a bang, striking out the side in the first
inning, including Vaughn on a 98-mph fastball that ended the
inning. He struck out eight in all, which gave him 2,832 in his
career, tying Mickey Lolich for 13th on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second time in 28 games the Angels have been
held to less than two runs in a game. They had five hits in all,
and had only three baserunners get into scoring position after
Glaus' homer.

PACERS GET A WAKE-UP CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Pacers got that bus thing down, but life on
the road found a new hurdle on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A very early one.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 6 a.m. the fire alarm went off at their Santa
Monica hotel. And kept going off.
</P>
<P>
   Rise and shine, Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go out,'' said Pacers forward Jalen Rose. ``I wasn't
going to go out until I saw smoke. I would have been the last one
to leave, trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so for the Pacers' main man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got out,'' said coach Larry Bird. ``I was already up.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, of course, no fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' Rose said. ``The fire alarm in
the hotel went off, and kept going off. Then somebody got on the
recorder, telling us to follow the fire drill rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another 10, 15 minutes after that, they notified us it was a
false alarm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers know all about fire alarms on the road during the
Finals, having experienced the same thing in Philadelphia in 1983
and Boston in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicion, naturally, is that some local fans thought it
would be a really clever idea to wake the invaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being from Detroit PSL (Public School League), I've seen all
kinds of tricks,'' Rose said. ``I went to games where they left
some kind of dust on the floor so it will be slippery, or flat
balls, or a losing team trying to tip our bus over. This is a lot
more sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just part of being a road team. You take it as it
comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Get outta my face: Bird was never afraid to challenge his
teammates while a member of the Celtics - he spared no one after a
25-point loss to the Lakers in the 1984 Finals - but he's taken
another tactic as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Bird said despite the rough loss in Game 1, he did not get in
the face of any Pacer. His comments are reserved for more private
moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individually I talk to them,'' he said. ``But not on the
court. ... You know, these guys are very sensitive. Everything you
say to them, they take to heart. It's always better to do it
one-on-one with this group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some coaches that would challenge you in front of the
team, and they get embarrassed by it. But these guys are good if
you bring them in and talk to them one-one-one.''
</P>
<P>
   No second guessing: Forward-center Sam Perkins is expected to
retire after the Finals, but don't look for him to utilize his
degree from North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins majored in communications but can't see himself joining
the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' he said. ``The last thing I can talk about
are other players. The last thing I can do is analyze other guys
and tell them what they're not doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoosierville: The Lakers can expect a different atmosphere when
the series moves to basketball-mad Indiana for the next three
games.
</P>
<P>
   First off, there is the Pacers' new facility, Conseco
Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a basketball feel, as opposed to Staples
Center,'' Rose said. ``Staples Center is for basketball, but it's
also for entertainment. They have two teams from the NBA that plays
here, which is a unique situation. From the outside looking in,
it's like a varsity and a JV team.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the general basketball attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Indianapolis at a game, it's a lot different,'' Rose said.
``In L.A. you have people willing to pay $10,000 for a ticket;
celebrities. And rightfully so, this is a great arena in a great
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Indiana being a small-market team, we're more of a unit.
We love our fans, and our fans love us. We come back from a huge
win or a tough loss, we may have fans waiting for us at the
airport. Entire families are Pacer fans, from the baby in the crib
to the grandmother in the rocking chair.''

WORKERS RALLY FOR AMNESTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ National labor union leaders expect more than
10,000 participants in a public forum with state and federal
officials at the Los Angeles Sports Arena to push for amnesty for
millions of undocumented workers.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting Saturday is the culmination of a series of similar
town hall discussions on immigrant worker issues sponsored in
recent weeks by unions in New York, Chicago and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO, which represents hundreds of thousands of workers
nationwide, made a historic policy shift in February, calling for a
general amnesty for the estimated 6 million undocumented workers
currently living in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The unions, which have not spelled out a specific proposal,
intend to draw attention to the issue during a presidential
election year, especially with recent union contract victories in
Los Angeles, said Eliseo Medina, national vice president of the
Service Employees International Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amnesty would let workers and their families participate
in society and live their dreams,'' Medina said. ``That also allows
them to make a bigger contribution to our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the early 1900s, when most immigrants came from Europe to
look for work, he said, recent years have brought mostly
job-seeking Latinos and Asians, who face tougher obstacles
receiving U.S. residency status.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they have in common is that they are often mistreated by
bosses and limited in their possibilities because they lack the
legal rights of residents,'' Medina said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee for
president, has not come out in favor of a general amnesty but
instead proposed expanding current amnesty programs.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the apparent Republican presidential
nominee, has so far been opposed to any amnesty expansion.
</P>
<P>
   While both candidates compete for the key support of Latino
voters nationwide, the amnesty issue could become a deciding factor
in their campaigns leading up to the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new era in friendly government toward unions and
immigrants,'' said Miguel Contreras, secretary-treasurer of the Los
Angeles County Federation of Labor. ``Working people just want the
same rights as everyone else, nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   The forum is scheduled for noon at the Sports Arena in
Exposition Park.

<P>
   George Segal, whose rough-surfaced casts of actual people
brought a new, often eerie realism to postwar sculpture and made
him one of the most quietly influential artists of his time, died
Friday at his home in South Brunswick, N.J. He was 75 years old and
had lived in South Brunswick for 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Claes Oldenburg, Segal was often considered one of
the pre-eminent sculptors of pop art. But Oldenburg and pop art
painters like Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist
found inspiration in the products of popular culture, be they
comics, magazine ads, movie-star photographs or hamburgers. In
contrast, Segal fixed his gaze on the ordinary consumers of that
culture, and through his use of the full-body plaster cast he
devised a way to incorporate them into his work virtually warts and
all. His influence can be traced through several generations of
figurative sculpture, some of it cast, some of it meticulously
handmade, by American artists like Duane Hanson, Charles Ray,
Robert Gober, John Ahearn and Kiki Smith.
</P>
<P>
   A casual, approachable man known for his sense of humor, Segal
worked for much of his career in a 300-foot-long former chicken
coop on his family's farm near South Brunswick, N.J. There he
applied Johnson &AMP; Johnson cotton bandages dipped in plaster to the
faces and forms of sundry family members, friends and neighbors.
His wife, Helen, whom he married in 1946, was one of his most
frequent subject models, having first sat for her husband in the
1940s and '50s when he was still a painter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Segal is survived by a daughter, Rena,
of Somerset, N.J., a son, Jeffrey, of Vineland, N.J., and his
brother, Morris, of North Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   To create appropriate settings for his figures, Segal developed
what he called ``assembled environments'' by incorporating, uncast,
props like chairs, tables, beds or a pinball machine; sections of
cars, school buses and even a subway car and a butcher shop window
as well as brick walls, gas pumps and windows. He paired a
full-length portrait of his dealer, Sidney Janis, with one of the
Mondrian paintings that Janis owned. (Janis commissioned the work
and on his death bequeathed it to the Museum of Modern Art.) And
for a 1965-67 portrait of the sculptor John Chamberlain, he showed
the sculptor wielding the chunks of automobile bodies from which
he, Chamberlain, made his own work.
</P>
<P>
   Segal's tableaus were emotionally confounding, at once deeply
familiar in their forms and subjects, yet ghostly and strange in
their stillness. To a great extent, these works had an emotional
resonance that was alien to pop art and that reflected Segal's
beginnings as an expressionist painter. His tableaus also connected
to several long-running artistic traditions, most notably a strain
of understated American realism that included Thomas Eakins, Walker
Evans and Edward Hopper; the 20th-century evolution of collage and
assemblage as practiced by Kurt Schwitters, Joseph Cornell and
Robert Rauschenberg, and finally the history of figurative
sculpture that reached from Rodin back to the Greeks. More than one
observer also likened them to the monochromatic figure casts
created by archaeologists to record the postures of Romans found at
Pompeii.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Over the course of his career, Segal did not veer too far from
his original and rather simple formula, yet it seemed to be capable
of almost infinite variation and elaboration. He sometimes reduced
his figures to shallow paintinglike reliefs, or zeroed in on his
subjects, making busts, or isolating an arm or leg from which the
viewer extrapolated the body.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the 1970s, he sometimes painted the figures and
their settings in bright, flat colors, giving them a visual
vibrancy that again reflected his roots in painting. (His painting
background was also manifest in the robustly worked pastels that he
made throughout his career and that occasionally showed up in his
tableaus). The figurative nature of his work also allowed him to
revisit traditional themes, starting with ``The Legend of Lott,''
from 1966 and including a public commission, ``In Memory of May 4,
1970, Kent State: Abraham and Isaac,'' of 1980, at Princeton
University.
</P>
<P>
   Public and outdoor commissions became possible in the 1970s when
he turned to casting in bronze, which he often finished in white to
resemble plaster. Other public works include ``Gay Liberation,'' a
portrayal of two same-sex couples installed in Christopher Park in
Greenwich Village that commemorates the Stonewall riot there; and
``The Holocaust, a work incorporating both standing and fallen
figures and a barbed wire fence created for Golden Gate Park in San
Francisco in 1983. He also created the three large tableaus for the
Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington: ``Depression
Breadline,'' ``Appalachian Farm Couple'' and ``Fireside Chat.''
</P>
<P>
   As these works suggest, a strong sense of social conscience was
another thing that separated Segal from the pop artists.
</P>
<P>
   Segal was born in the Bronx, N.Y., in 1926, the son of Jacob
Segal, whose small Kosher butcher shop his son memorialized in one
of his sculptures. In 1940 he moved with his family to the South
Brunswick farm where he lived until the end of his life. His father
had decided to try his hand at chicken farming.
</P>
<P>
   Segal studied art at the Cooper Union Art School, Pratt
Institute, New York University, Rutgers and the State University of
New Jersey, where he earned a bachelor's degree in art education in
1950 and a master's degree in fine art in 1963. He also studied
with Hans Hofmann and several other Abstract Expressionist
painters, but was untempted. ``I couldn't divorce myself from the
sensual things of life _ things I could touch,'' he later
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Like many artists who came of age in the mid-1950s, Segal began
his career as a painter, edging toward sculpture almost
unconsciously. Pressure came from the dominance of Abstract
Expressionist painting and from a growing interest in reality, in
the potential for using objects and events that existed outside art
that was already evident in the work of Jasper Johns and
Rauschenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Segal may also have been pushed toward reality by his friendship
with Allan Kaprow, one of the inventors of the multimedia events
called Happenings, whom he met at Rutgers. Kaprow staged the first
such event at Segal's farm in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   In that year, Segal began making sculpture out of chicken wire
and plaster. He later wrote that he did so out of ``a need to
achieve my own grasp of pictorial space ... what would happen if I
ventured into real space?'' He hit upon the idea of the plaster
casts in 1960, when one of his students brought him a large supply
of medical scrim used by physicians in making casts for broken
bones. He was his own first subject, having his wife wrap him in
the plaster-soaked gauze, and ended up with a sculpture that he
later titled ``Man at a Table.'' He wasn't quite sure that he was
making sculpture. ``People call what I created sculpture,'' he
wrote. ``But my own reaction to it is as to the presence of man in
his daily life.''
</P>
<P>
   He initially thought that this new process would be direct and
easy, rather like taking a photograph. But he soon found it
necessary to work every square inch of surface of the plaster, not
unlike a painter, both as it was drying on the sitter and
afterward, to get the effect he wanted. In an interview, he once
attributed the unusual emotional reality of his figures to the
fatigue of his models. ``To hold a pose for 40 minutes, you can't
be in a social or artificial posture,'' he said. ``Then the body
reveals certain truths about itself.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s, Segal had had several solo shows at the Hansa
Gallery, an artists' cooperative near 57th Street. He had met with
little success and resigned himself to a life of teaching art. But
his new sculpture caught on. In 1960 he had the first of three solo
shows at the Green Gallery, run by the perceptive dealer Richard
Bellamy, who showed younger artists interested in bringing new
physical realities to their work. They included Oldenburg and
Chamberlain, and also Dan Flavin, Donald Judd, Yayoi Kusama, Lee
Bontecou and Lucas Samaras.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962 Segal was included in ``New Realists,'' an important
group show that helped anoint pop art, at the Sidney Janis Gallery.
From 1965 onward, he was represented by the Janis Gallery. He was
soon successful enough to give up teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Segal was the recipient of many awards and honors, including the
Premium Imperiale from Japan, which he received in 1998, and a
National Medal of the Arts, in 1999. The list of museums that own
his work, nearly three pages long and divided according to
continents, attests to the broad appeal of his art. As he put it,
``I count heavily on the human ability to spot metaphor. The urge
to read poetry into things is universal.''

REBOULET TO THE RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DICK KAEGEL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ It was Buck Night but not the Bucs' night.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Reboulet's one-out single drove in Rey Sanchez in the 10th
inning, giving the Royals a 6-5 interleague victory Friday night
over the Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing like this all year,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many have we won like that? Ten, 11, 12? I don't know how
many.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the 14th time the Royals have won in their last at-bat
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good change from last year, I think,'' said Royals starter
Jeff Suppan.
</P>
<P>
   Sure is. That's two more of the derring-do wins than the club
had all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a typical Royals game,'' said Mike Sweeney, who had
four hits, including a homer.
</P>
<P>
   It provided a nice dessert for 30,963 fans after they'd wolfed
down $1 hot dogs, peanuts and soft drinks. They groaned when,
before the ninth inning, an announcement was made that the usual
fireworks display was canceled because of dry, windy conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pirates' Brian Giles quickly provided fireworks of his
own, smashing closer Jerry Spradlin's first pitch into the
waterfall in right-center field, an estimated 440 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Giles' second homer of the game created a 5-5 tie.
</P>
<P>
   So into the 10th they battled. Sanchez opened the inning with a
double to left field against left-hander Jason Christiansen. Johnny
Damon advanced him with a sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect Christiansen,'' Royals manager Tony Muser said.
``Johnny hasn't been extremely hot, and I wanted to get the guy to
third base because there are more ways to score from third than
from second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do the little things to help us win. That's the
way we're going to do it, and we've got people who don't mind doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The count went full on Reboulet, and he suspected he'd get a
pitch to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``On 3-2, I'm always looking for anything,'' Reboulet said,
``but I felt like they were going to come after me with Mike
(Sweeney) and Jermaine (Dye) hitting behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Reboulet stroked a single into short right field, and the Royals
had their ninth walk-off win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of dorked it out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first four-RBI game in Reboulet's nine-year career.
He cleared the bases with a double in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reboulet is a hero tonight,'' Muser said. ``Many people
thought that with Carlos Febles being hurt, that we were going to
miss out on something. Jeff is a veteran player who has filled in
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney had a four-hit game for the fifth time this year and
launched his 13th homer against Pirates starter Jason Schmidt. But
Sweeney bowed in Reboulet's direction after this latest thriller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of the unlikely hero,'' Sweeney said. ``He came
through when we needed him.''
</P>
<P>
   All four runs in the Royals' fourth were unearned after first
baseman Kevin Young couldn't handle Damon's bouncer, which would
have been the third out. Instead the bases were loaded. Reboulet
grounded a double past third base and then scored on Sweeney's
single.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a play that Kevin usually makes,'' Pirates manager Gene
Lamont said. ``If he does, we get out of the inning. But if we get
Reboulet out, then we'd have been out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney has 61 RBIs in 59 games, and no Royal in history has
gotten to the 60-mark quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Young and Giles each homered off Suppan, who went seven innings.
He gave up seven hits but no walks. The Pirates got their fourth
run off Jose Santiago. Spradlin was charged with his third blown
save _ the team's 15th against 14 saves _ but wound up with his
second victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals are 12-6 in one-run games this season, giving them
one more victory in that category than they had last year. They
were only 11-32 in one-run games in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Muser, as usual, was thinking of the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we won the game because I know they were disappointed
about the fireworks,'' he said.

 Plan to send Robinson to prison in 1985 backfired  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ As detectives searched in 1985 for clues to the fate
of Lisa Stasi, who disappeared with her infant daughter shortly
after meeting John Edward Robinson Sr., they found another woman
they hoped could help them send Robinson to prison.
</P>
<P>
   But because they feared that the woman _ Teresa L. Williams, 21
_ might be in danger, they hid her and wouldn't let Robinson's
lawyer talk to her out of concern that Robinson would learn her
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, that maneuver backfired.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who was on probation at the time in a white-collar
crime, now is charged in Johnson County with sexually assaulting
two women, and authorities have linked him to the disappearance of
three women besides Stasi and the discovery in the last week of
five women's bodies in barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Stasi, 19, was last seen after Robinson put her up in an
Overland Park motel as part of what he called charity for young,
single mothers and their babies, according to investigators'
records at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Her disappearance led to an investigation by two FBI agents and
Robinson's probation officer into allegations of drugs, guns and
prostitution. Officials suspected Robinson might have sold her
5-month-old baby.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, one of the women authorities talked to in the
investigation, appeared to be in such danger that they hid her from
Robinson, thus preventing Robinson's lawyer from subpoenaing her
for a deposition.
</P>
<P>
   A Missouri appeals court later ruled that by hiding the key
witness against Robinson in the probation violation case,
prosecutors and investigators had violated his constitutional
rights to confront his accuser.
</P>
<P>
   ``There cannot be the least doubt that the actions of the
probation officer and the FBI agents denied (Robinson) due process
rights,'' judges on the Missouri Court of Appeals' Western District
wrote in July 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's victory was short-lived, however. He soon was
convicted for fraud in Johnson County and was imprisoned in Kansas.
That conviction violated his Clay County probation. At the
conclusion of his Kansas sentence in 1991, he returned to prison in
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The 1985 investigation into Robinson is detailed in area court
files.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Robinson was on probation from a 1981 felony
conviction in Clay County, where he had pleaded guilty to stealing
a $6,000 check from Guy's Foods in Liberty when he was a personnel
manager there.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show that Williams had been living in an apartment
at 8110 Troost Ave. that Robinson rented for her. During interviews
with her in June 1985, she told probation officer Stephen Haymes
that Robinson had both guns and marijuana, a probation violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She states that approximately two weeks after she began living
at the apartment rented by Robinson, he brought to her a half bag
of marijuana and gave it to her,'' Haymes wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also told the probation officer that Robinson carried a
pistol in a shoulder holster and showed a disturbing tendency for
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robinson threatened her with the handgun and sexually
assaulted her with the handgun,'' Haymes wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And Williams told investigators about a diary she was
fabricating under Robinson's instructions that made them fear for
her safety.
</P>
<P>
   In the diary, which Williams said Robinson gave her with orders
to transcribe it in her own writing, Williams was to discredit a
man who was going to testify against Robinson in the probation
revocation hearing. It was supposed to end on June 15, 1985, with
an entry about her fear that something would happen to her, and
instructions for Robinson's attorney to receive the diary and
property she had in a safe-deposit box.
</P>
<P>
   Haymes' report notes a promise to the woman: ``Williams states
that Robinson told her he was going to take her to the Bahamas on
6-14-85 and that her belongings would be put in storage.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators quickly moved Williams to a new apartment and
ultimately bought her a plane ticket out of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It...appears that (Robinson) has continued to use people to
his own end, including Ms. Williams, with whom there is concern for
her safety...,'' Haymes wrote in a June 1985 probation report.
</P>
<P>
   Haymes declined to comment this week, but a woman identifying
herself as Teresa L. Williams called /{The Kansas City Star/}
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   She asked for information about the case and suggested that the
newspaper buy her story. She was told that /{The Star/}'s policy
does not allow payment for news information.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had started a new life since leaving Kansas City
and expressed concern for her safety, questioning the ability of
authorities to keep Robinson in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Before she ended the brief conversation, she said, ``I had
nightmares for life about this.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1985 probe intensified when investigators learned that
Robinson had contact with Stasi before she vanished earlier that
year. But FBI agents Tom Lavin and Jeff Dancer could not
conclusively link Robinson to Stasi's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Bruce Houdek, who represented Robinson, argued for the
right to interview Williams in motions to Clay County Circuit Judge
John Hutcherson, who since has retired. Her written statements,
which Houdek had been given, were vague and inconsistent, Houdek
contended.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Investigators) were just hiding her,'' Houdek said Friday.
``(Her written statements) were all over the place. She was a very
unreliable person, and they didn't want to pin her down. The FBI
couldn't make a case against him, and they took the easy way out by
getting his probation revoked.''
</P>
<P>
   Houdek said he never considered Robinson dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutcherson also was concerned about Williams' safety. This
week, the retired judge said that had he required Williams to give
an interview, she may have been compelled to disclose her new
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to let (Robinson) have that address,''
Hutcherson said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hutcherson used Williams' testimony in court to revoke
Robinson's probation in July 1985, the appeals court reversed his
decision the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Clay County Prosecutor Don Norris, who helped file the initial
stealing charges against Robinson in 1981, said authorities always
had a bad feeling about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that the officers said this guy is dangerous and we
need to put him away,'' Norris said this week. ``We filed the
charges and tried to accomplish that. We had a suspicion about this
guy, and now, years later, we hear there may be something to it.''

DRUG WAR: WE CITIZENS ARE VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Karen Dillon's recent chronicle in /{The Star/} of
what amounts to brigandry by many in law enforcement underscores
why the war on drugs not only was doomed to fail, but also why
fighting it assured erosion of regard for the first principles on
which the nation was founded.
</P>
<P>
   When the federal government declared its war on drugs in the
mid-1980s, it looked like a perfect example of a government program
that would make the problem being addressed worse rather than
better.
</P>
<P>
   My skepticism was based on the belief that humankind usually
behaves in an economically rational manner. This meant the war on
drugs would become an industry on which many eventually would
depend for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   As more anti-drug warriors joined the crusade, the most
compelling economic incentives would demand an approach ensuring
that the war would never end. What would be the point of winning
the war, after all, when so much economic benefit depended on
fighting it?
</P>
<P>
   A never-ending war on drugs was assured because government would
make fighting it an increasingly lucrative enterprise. Government,
unlike a private enterprise, never acknowledges failure because its
supply of money is endless. Therefore, when a program fails, the
federal government's response is to increase its funding in the
belief more money can solve any problem.
</P>
<P>
   With spending on the war against drug abuse having exploded over
the past 15 years or so, the predicted outcome has long since
become a nightmarish reality. The illegal drug scourge is as
pernicious as ever, the numbers of those making a living from
government financing is so large it will be politically impossible
to abandon it as a wasteful boondoggle, and the Bill of Rights is
being trashed in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Investigative reporter Dillon's report focused on the practice
of state and local law departments working with federal agency
counterparts to improperly keep millions of dollars in the course
of anti-drug actions. Without going into the details, what amounts
to circumvention of state laws in these forfeiture cases is
possible because /{federal law makes it easier to abrogate what
should be constitutionally protected rights./}
</P>
<P>
   What happens, Dillon related, is that when a state or local
officer stops a car or invades a home, the action can result in
seizure of cash and property even if little evidence of a crime
exists, drug-related or otherwise. The locals hand off the haul to
the feds because state laws generally have tighter requirements for
a forfeiture than federal laws do. The feds later return most of
the loot to the locals.
</P>
<P>
   So, as it turns out, not only has the war on drugs enriched its
warriors through taxpayer largess, but also allows for them to
profit handsomely from searches and seizures that violate the
Fourth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The scariest part of this is that most Americans either don't
know or don't care that it's happening. Many Americans may accept
this state of affairs as a reasonable trade-off if it helps win the
war against drug abuse, but they are playing a fool's game.
</P>
<P>
   The war will never be won as long as it's so rewarding for those
fighting it. And even if it could be won, winning wouldn't be worth
devaluing the liberties of law-abiding citizens in the process.

TAX PREPARER'S SHARES SINK TO THREE-YEAR LOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Shares in H&AMP;R Block Inc. fell to their lowest levels
in more than three years Friday before recouping some of the loss
by the end of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City-based diversified tax preparer and financial
services provider warned investors after markets closed Thursday
that profits for the fiscal year 2000 may be almost 20 cents a
share lower than analysts had been forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy selling when the markets opened Friday dropped the price
of Block shares to 26 a share, down more than 4 points from
Thursday's close and to levels last seen in November 1996. By the
end of trading Friday, shares had rebounded to close at 28, down 2
</P>
<P>
   Block said Thursday profits would be lower than expected partly
because of overstaffing at its more than 9,000 U.S. tax offices
when a surge of last-minute taxpayers failed to materialize. Block
also attributed the profit setback to a change in the way it
accounts for the cost of assets it acquired last year and a
one-time loss connected to mortgage operations it sold.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives said they expect earnings for the fiscal year
that ended April 30 to be the equivalent of somewhere between $2.52
and $2.55 a share when final numbers are tallied and released June
21.
</P>
<P>
   The expected profits are still larger than the equivalent of
$2.36 a share Block earned in fiscal 1999, but well below the
$2.72-a-share range Wall Street anticipated before the warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers were disappointing, particularly because this is
the second time Block has come to the well,'' said Michael Millman,
an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Block warned investors six weeks ago that it expected pretax
losses on its fledgling e-commerce operations would be about $18
million, or twice what analysts previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Those losses and the additional profit-trimming costs disclosed
Thursday are widely regarded as growing pains resulting from
Block's rapid diversification into mortgage lending, investment
brokering and other financial services in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been punished more than adequately,'' Millman said.
``Their basic business continues to be strong. They've learned a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Prestopino, an analyst at Tucker Anthony Cleary Gull in
Chicago, said he thought investors overreacted Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those situations where the glass is half empty
or half full,'' Prestopino said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The encouraging news is that it now appears the company is
going to go back and re-evaluate how it's going to spend money in
the future,'' he said.

 Officials in several states working to overhaul asset-forfeiture
laws  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN DILLON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANAS CITY _ In Missouri, lawmakers are vowing that next time
they'll succeed.
</P>
<P>
   California legislators just took a big step toward reform, while
education attorneys in North Carolina are just beginning their own
battle.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, officials in several states across the country
have pledged action to block local law enforcement from keeping
property confiscated in drug busts and traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   Most states have passed laws blocking seized property from going
directly back to police, and many states require seized property to
be used for other purposes, such as education.
</P>
<P>
   But last month /{The Kansas City Star/} reported that police
agencies in more than two dozen states checked by the newspaper
circumvent their own laws and keep millions of dollars in seizures.
</P>
<P>
   When police seize money or property, they hand it off to a
federal law enforcement agency instead of going to a state court.
The federal agency keeps a cut, usually 20 percent, and returns the
rest to police.
</P>
<P>
   Police say they need the money to fight the war on drugs. But
lawmakers and some legal experts sa the circumvention threatens
civil liberties by bypassing state laws, which generally provide
more protection to property owners than federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many legislators elsewhere, those in Missouri already
knew about the federal handoffs and passed a reform bill in the
state Senate this year. But the bill died on the last day of the
session.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sen. Harry Wiggins, a Kansas City Democrat who co-sponsored
the bill, pledges to make it his primary goal to get the bill
passed by February. The session begins in January.
</P>
<P>
   The other sponsor, Rep. Jim Kreider, a Nixa Democrat and speaker
pro tem, said he will be pushing from his side of the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's high on my radar screen,'' Kreider said. ``This is the
right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri law prohibits police from handing seized property over
to a federal law enforcement agency. Instead police are required to
notify a prosecutor. A judge then decides whether the property
should be forfeited and go to education or be transferred to a
federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   But police say when they give property to federal agencies, they
are not doing anything wrong because they have not seized it _ they
only detained it until a federal agent seizes it.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins and Kreider sponsored a bill that would:
</P>
<P>
   Try to close any loophole by defining a seizure ``as the point
at which any law enforcement officer or agent discovers and
exercises control over property.''
</P>
<P>
   Require detailed reports of each seizure as well as audits.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was blocked with only about three minutes left in the
session by Rep. Craig Hosmer, a Springfield Democrat, who thinks
police departments need seizure money to fight the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in my read of our constitution that what they
are doing is illegal,'' Hosmer said. ``They are using another
avenue that is available to make sure they have resources to do the
job that they believe is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreider disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rep. Hosmer believes the bill will hurt law enforcement,''
Kreider said. ``I sincerely believe that it will hurt law
enforcement worse the way it is now. It will hurt their reputation.
It will hurt them in the long run by circumventing the law and
possibly violating the rights of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mel Carnahan said this week through his spokesman that
police were doing nothing illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor believes law enforcement is operating within the
law,'' said spokesman Jerry Nachtigal. ``The governor stands by the
highway patrol. They are doing their best to slow down the drug
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nachtigal said the governor would not comment on state law
requiring forfeitures to go to education or discuss whether he
believes keeping the proceeds is a conflict of interest for police.
</P>
<P>
   Developments in other states:
</P>
<P>
   {California.} The state Senate this month passed a bill that
would require police to get a court order before drug money could
be transferred to a federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now must pass the House, where lawmakers expect a
stronger fight from law enforcement. The bill would make it a crime
for police to hand off seizures without a court order _ possibly
the toughest such provision in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lure of increased revenue has blinded local law
enforcement to their responsibility to abide by our state policy
and to protect the due process rights of our citizens,'' said Sen.
John Vasconcellos, a Santa Clara Democrat, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   {Kansas.} Rep. Ralph Tanner, a Baldwin City Republican, plans to
meet with the speaker of the House next week to discuss introducing
a bill to redirect forfeited money away from law enforcement and to
education.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would specify that only a judge could decide if
forfeiture proceeds should be transferred to the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   {North Carolina.} Attorneys for school boards are talking about
reform after discovering that little forfeiture money is going to
education, as the state's constitution requires.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Michael Crowell, an attorney who works for the
state board of education, is researching legal remedies. He said he
is going to speak to the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to pursue this,'' Crowell said.
</P>
<P>
   {Massachusetts.} A citizens group says it won't back away from
reform efforts despite new opposition from law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition for Fair Treatment is pushing for a voter
initiative that would direct most forfeited money to a
substance-abuse fund.
</P>
<P>
   But the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association and the
commonwealth's 11 district attorneys filed a lawsuit Tuesday in
state Supreme Judicial Court asking for an injunction to block the
November vote. The lawsuit says the initiative signed by more than
100,000 Massachusetts voters is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative would not prohibit law enforcement agencies from
handing off property to the federal government. But in cases where
the federal government returned money to police, the initiative
would prohibit police from keeping it. Instead, the money would be
turned over to a substance-abuse fund.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says federal law requires returned money to be spent
on law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   But Carl Valvo, an attorney for the Coalition, said the
initiative does not conflict with federal law. In fact, the
requirement on how the money must be spent is a U.S. Department of
Justice guideline and not law, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the National Conference of State Legislatures, a
lobbying organization made up of lawmakers from every state, is
considering a session based on /{The Star's/} series at its annual
meeting next month, said Michael Bird, senior federal affairs
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, conference members passed a policy that laid out
some legislators' concerns about forfeitures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal asset-forfeiture law should not be designed to
encourage law enforcement to avoid state asset-forfeiture laws,''
the policy says.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Adkins, who was chairman of the conference's committee
that proposed the policy, said every state legislator should be
concerned that the separation between local and federal law
enforcement is eroding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a very, very clear dividing line that states
handled criminal law,'' said Adkins, a former Colorado legislator.
``I think legislators are obligated to look at the potential
conflict.''

BROTHER OF MISSING WOMAN RECALLS HER ATTEMPT AT NEW LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN BORMANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Catherine Clampitt moved to Overland Park, Kan., from
Wichita Falls, Texas, in 1987 to start a new life with her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Months after what was to be a new beginning, she disappeared
without a note, phone call or goodbye. This week, authorities told
her family that they are actively investigating her missing person
case once again after finding two bodies in barrels on the property
of Clampitt's former employer, John Edward Robinson Sr., and three
more bodies in barrels in his Raymore storage locker.
</P>
<P>
   The news gave Clampitt's brother, Robert Bales of Lenexa, the
chills.
</P>
<P>
   ``A flush went over me. I knew that name,'' he said, referring
to Robinson. ``I never will forget it, not in my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Bales heard that authorities had found
women's bodies on a piece of property in Linn County, Kan., but he
didn't pay attention until he heard Robinson's name. Bales
remembered that his sister had worked for Robinson's company, Equi
II.
</P>
<P>
   The task force investigating the Robinson case initially
released Clampitt's name as ``Katherine Clampet'' but on Friday
confirmed the new spellings.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed in the deaths of the women found in
the barrels. Robinson has been charged with aggravated sexual
battery and felony theft relating to sadomasochistic sexual
encounters with two women he met on the Internet. He is being held
in Johnson County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Bales said he picked up Clampitt at the Kansas City bus station
on a January night in 1987. She needed a fresh start, and Bales and
his wife had agreed to take her in.
</P>
<P>
   She left Texas to escape drugs and drinking, but starting over
meant leaving her young son, Ryan, now 16, behind in her parents'
custody, her mother said Friday in a telephone interview from
Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came up here to get away from the crowd,'' Bales said.
</P>
<P>
   Clampitt was born in Korea but grew up in Texas after she was
adopted by Bales' mother. Bales described his petite sister as an
intelligent woman with a wild side.
</P>
<P>
   Once she arrived, Bales lined up interviews for his sister, and
she began looking for a job. Clampitt discovered Equi II through a
newspaper ad, Bales said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It promised a great job, a lot of traveling and a new
wardrobe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bales said it did seem a little far-fetched to him and his wife,
but Clampitt was 27 and old enough to make her own decision, they
decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a grown lady; you don't lock her in a room and say you
can't come out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once she started working, Clampitt traveled often and would
sometimes stay at local hotels for several nights at a time. When
she didn't return for weeks, Bales called police.
</P>
<P>
   Bales said he spent eight months investigating her
disappearance. He put together a file of receipts, pictures and
anything he could.
</P>
<P>
   He became consumed with finding his sister. He called Robinson's
office often and at one point took to staking out the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew I was looking for her,'' Bales said of Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   He said that police talked to Robinson but that there wasn't
enough evidence to connect him to Clampitt's disappearance in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Now the family will wait as police continue the latest
investigation. Bales turned over his file to police this week, and
Clampitt's mother also gave police more identification.
</P>
<P>
   Logically, Bales said, he didn't expect to find Clampitt alive,
but he never gave up hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spiritually, emotionally, I always had hoped she was flying
over Europe or Asia,'' he said.

MURDER SUSPECT LINKED TO FORMER PRISON LIBRARIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By By SCOTT CANON and TANYANIKA SAMUELS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Police are investigating the 1994 disappearance of
Beverly Bonner, a former Cameron, Mo., woman who may have met John
Edward Robinson Sr. when she worked in a prison library.
</P>
<P>
   She may also have rented a storage unit where barrels containing
three bodies were found Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cass County Prosecutor Chris Koster said one of the leads
investigators were following involved the statement Robinson
reportedly made to a worker at Stor-Mor For Less in Raymore that he
was storing furniture for ``Beverly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he was renting the space for his sister,'' in
addition to at least one unit for himself, said a worker Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson also remarked to storage workers that the sister was
enjoying herself traveling so much she might never come back.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who is being held in connection with bodies found on
his property in Linn County and in Stor-Mor units he rented, has
two sisters, but neither is named Beverly.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner's second husband, physician William Bonner of Stockton,
Mo., was also contacted by investigators from Raymore and the task
force probing the allegations against Robinson. William Bonner said
he suspects that Beverly Bonner came to know Robinson well when the
two worked in the Western Missouri Correctional Center library in
Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner dropped out of sight after coming to the Kansas City
area. Following a pattern of missing women linked in various ways
to Robinson, she told friends that she had an excellent job
prospect, in this case a job that would take her abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In Bonner's case, however, she would have known that Robinson
had a criminal background. Her former husband, who worked as a
physician at the facility, recalled Robinson and remembered talking
with his wife about him.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was serving time for a probation violation after being
convicted of felony theft from Guys Foods in 1981. He was released
in April 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very gregarious, outgoing, friendly,'' William Bonner
said. ``He came across well-spoken grammatically. He seemed like a
businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner suspects Beverly visited Robinson in the Kansas City area
after his release. When she left Cameron after their 1994 divorce,
Bonner sent monthly checks to a post office box in Olathe, but he
said he did not know why a woman ostensibly working overseas for a
Chicago company would need money sent to Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   He has not seen his ex-wife since they both left Cameron.
Acquaintances told him that they thought at one time she was in a
Scandinavian country, but he hasn't heard from her since 1994.
Movers told him that her belongings were to be stored in a Raymore
storage locker, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was living in Belton at the time. Nancy Jo Robinson,
his wife, managed the Southfork Mobile Home Community and they
resided at 464 Valeen Lane from 1993 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Former neighbors said they saw little of the Robinsons. Kathy
Reed said she would occasionally see his wife because she worked in
the manager's office, but rarely saw him.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at Stor-Mor said Nancy Jo Robinson rented the first unit
in November 1992. John Robinson Sr. rented others in November 1992
and May 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The facility's owner said he never saw Robinson and never
suspected anything illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I did, I would have called the police,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, the Stor-Mor worker said, first inquired about
Robinson's wife about three months ago. She said Friday that
investigators had asked her not to comment further on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Elston and Mary Gann had become close friends with Beverly
Bonner during her years in Cameron. After she left, they mailed a
letter to a Kansas address she had left with them. It was returned
to sender.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Bonner has two sons from her first marriage, both of
whom lived with their father in Kansas City, North, after the end
of her second marriage. Randy, the eldest, died in December 1995.
She did not attend his funeral, said one person who did.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County District Attorney Paul Morrison, who has been
leading the investigation, declined to comment on Bonner's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing anything on that this weekend,'' Morrison
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators Friday afternoon finished searching Robinson's
16-acre lot west of La Cygne, Kan., but found little to help build
a case, said Linn County Sheriff Marvin Stites.
</P>
<P>
   The sealed barrels recovered from the storage units Monday
contained three sets of human remains. Earlier they found two
similar barrels at the Robinson property in Linn County.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has been held since June 2, but has not been charged
with murder in any of the set of remains. Authorities said they
have identified only one body, that of Suzette Marie Trouten.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the Johnson County judge assigned to hear the
sexual assault case pending against Robinson issued an order
outlining what police and prosecutors can say to the media.
</P>
<P>
   District Judge John Anderson III met in his chambers at the
courthouse in Olathe Friday morning with Regional Defender Byron
Cerrillo and Morrison before issuing the order.
</P>
<P>
   While some reports have referred to it as a ``gag order,''
Friday's action is a reiteration of the rules that attorneys in a
criminal case are required to follow in every case.
</P>
<P>
   The same day, the court also received Robinson's signed
affidavit to show that he qualifies for the court-appointed
attorney he requested during his initial court appearance on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the affidavit, Robinson has been unemployed for at
least the last 12 months and receives $1,021 a month in Social
Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   He owns land that is valued at $28,000, according to the
affidavit. It does not state if that refers to the field in Linn
County, where two bodies were found last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 investigators will continue to work through the
weekend, although each has the option of taking one day off. They
have received countless calls, and still ask anyone with
information to call the task force at (913) 477-7633 or toll-free
from out of the area at (877) 732-6322.

MISSING IN ACTION _ AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The work in progress that is Reggie Miller in the
NBA Finals took its next step Friday in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   The results: Slight improvement, but not enough to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't New York, and Spike Lee isn't in the Staples Center
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one expected Miller, late of Riverside High and UCLA,
to duplicate his 1-for-16 performance in Game 1, and he didn't,
scoring 21 points on 7-of-16 shooting. He had his first field goal
after just 41 seconds, a far cry from Wednesday, when he went
scoreless in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the fourth period - crunch time, Miller's time, if you
will - Miller was as invisible as he was Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   When the fourth period began, the Lakers led 73-69 and Miller
had 19 points. With 1:14 to play, Miller made two free throws,
ending a scoring drought that began after he scored a field goal
with 4:47 left in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Since Miller didn't score another field goal, that's more than
15 minutes without a point and 16:47 without a field goal. He
attempted just two shots in the fourth period.
</P>
<P>
   Pacers coach Larry Bird said it wasn't anything the Lakers did
on Miller in the fourth period. Rather, others were taking care of
the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jalen (Rose) was doing most of the scoring, and Austin had a
good game,'' Bird said. ``We had enough firepower.''
</P>
<P>
   The day before Game 2, Miller said he felt the need to carry his
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done a good job of performing in the Milwaukee, Philly
and New York series,'' he said. ``Now that we're in the bigger
stage, you know, I feel I have to play my absolute best to help
this team beat a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen Friday night, nor did it happen this season at
Staples. With Ron Harper shadowing Miller, Miller had difficulty
getting open.
</P>
<P>
   This was in contrast to Game 1, when Miller got several open
looks but couldn't sink the shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers knew Miller would come out shooting, and he did,
scoring eight points, mostly from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   But when he picked up his second foul in the first period, to
the bench he went, and he only played half of the first half. He
had two points in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie got off to a great start,'' Bird said. ``Too bad he
picked up that cheap foul.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller wasn't surprised Harper defended him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great defender because he plays great position
defense,'' Miller said before Game 2. ``As you know, covering
Chicago and throughout the series we had with them two years ago
.... him, Kobe and even Brian Shaw, all three play great position
defense. Every time I made a move, (Harper) was right there. You
have to give him credit.''
</P>
<P>
   So back to Indianapolis they go for Sunday. Miller said he
believes the Pacers have the confidence to make the series
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe shoot as if he were in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how to make adjustments, which we do,'' he said. ``And
we'll let the chips fall where they may.''

<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ The parents of Katherine Kreisel and Cally Mullins
loved that the girls were together so much. The high school
sophomores often spent weekends at each others' homes or, as on
June 3, hanging out in Sedalia.
</P>
<P>
   But when Jim Kreisel learned that his daughter was killed in a
car wreck, his first hope was that Mullins wasn't with her. She
was. Both girls died in a collision with a suspected drunken driver
who was driving north in the southbound lane.
</P>
<P>
   Kreisel and Mullins, both 16, were buried Friday in a joint
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone says that we've lost a daughter, we consider it
like we've lost two. They were that close,'' Jim Kreisel said.
</P>
<P>
   The girls' lifelong bond had created an extended family among
their relatives who found some peace by sharing their grief.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Cole Camp, 110 miles southeast of Kansas City,
offered support, too. In a town of about 1,000 residents, more than
500 mourners attended the funeral in the high school gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of mourning, their families also have found
surprising solace in the girls' friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives reminisce about the zest with which Kreisel and
Mullins lived. They can picture the girls driving home on U.S. 65
that final night. The music surely was blaring. They surely were
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Now their relatives are glad they were together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a comfort to know that,'' said Kreisel's sister
Jennifer. ``They were always laughing, yapping. You know that's
what they were doing just before they hit. You know that their last
few seconds were happy.''  &LR; brk:`We're all feeling this'
 &LR; tx:Friendships last in Cole Camp. The mothers of Kreisel and
Mullins went to high school together. So did their fathers. The
girls' friendship began at age 3 in the Sunday school of Trinity
Lutheran Church.
</P>
<P>
   The families still have a picture of their kindergarten
graduation. Both wore the same style dress _ one in blue, one in
pink.
</P>
<P>
   As the girls grew up, their interests diverged.
</P>
<P>
   Kreisel, the musical one, played in three school bands. She was
a cheerleader and joined the math and science clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Mullins, the athletic one, played on the volleyball, basketball
and softball teams. She also served as sophomore class treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Their parents said they supported each other _ no matter what.
Relatives can't recall them ever fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like they compacted a lifetime into 16 years,'' said
Tom Smith, Mullins' stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night so many residents attended a prayer service
that it took nearly an hour for them to file into the gym. About
150 plants and flower displays surrounded the girls' matching
caskets.
</P>
<P>
   Students wrote farewells on two paper banners stretched across
cafeteria tables. ``I know you will be watching over us all,'' one
wrote. Another lamented: ``I'll just never get to see that smile of
yours anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every student knows every other student here. It's not like
Kansas City where you have 1,200 kids, somebody dies and you might
know them,'' Principal William Smart said. ``All of my students
know who Cally and Katherine are. We're all feeling this.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding the service in the gymnasium was bittersweet. The
spacious facility, which one resident compared to an NBA arena, was
completed in mid-May after months of anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Kreisel and Mullins were looking forward to cheering and playing
in the new gym. Mullins proudly proclaimed that her volleyball team
would be the first squad to compete in the gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hoped and anticipated coming to this gymnasium,'' the
Rev. Randal Ehrichs told mourners. ``They couldn't have anticipated
coming here together under these circumstances.''  &LR; brk:Anger mixed
with grief  &LR; tx:Ehrichs tried to comfort the grieving by saying they
should be filled with joy that the girls are with God. The families
can accept that, but feel nothing but anger toward the man who
caused the fatal accident.
</P>
<P>
   In November the license of Dale R. McCaslin, 43, was suspended
for an alcohol violation. State records show that he didn't have a
valid Missouri license.
</P>
<P>
   The Highway Patrol says McCaslin was driving north in the
southbound lane of U.S. 65. His car struck Mullins' Ford Escort as
it reached the top of a hill. She had no chance to swerve.
</P>
<P>
   McCaslin was arrested for driving while intoxicated. He died in
a Columbia hospital two days after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The Highway Patrol has not released results of blood-alcohol
tests, even to the girls' families. But relatives say troopers told
them of finding a fifth of Jack Daniels in McCaslin's car. Most of
it was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to have this Christian attitude when he has
taken something so precious,'' said Kreisel's mother, Gail.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives hope to start a Students Against Drunk Driving chapter
at the high school. Donations are filling jars in businesses all
over town.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the families turn again to the girls' friendship for
inspiration. In recent days, they've come across letters and notes
between the two. Almost every one closes with ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   And Verna Smith, Mullins' mother, can't help but think back to
the trooper's description of the accident scene.
</P>
<P>
   He told Smith that the girls' bodies were found on top of each
other, forming the shape of a cross. Smith and other relatives see
this as a sign that God was with the girls.
</P>
<P>
   Just as comforting, Kreisel and Mullins had each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went through this world together. They were lost
together,'' Tom Smith said. ``We're not happy that this happened,
but if they had to be with someone, we all would have wanted it
this way.''

ARGENTINE CITRUS TO ENTER 34 STATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID GREENBERG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. _ The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced
it has approved a controversial policy that allows the import of
Argentine citrus into 34 U.S. states that do not grow the produce.
</P>
<P>
   Local growers and industry leaders blasted the ruling, claiming
the imports will come from areas infested with crop-destroying
diseases and pests. Ventura County would be particularly vulnerable
because of its strong tourism base.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we're concerned about is citrus canker,'' said
Ventura County Agricultural Commissioner Earl McPhail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that, with the lack of inspections down there,
fruits can get commingled and then get shipped out as if it came
from a pest- and disease-free area. The last I heard, the USDA had
one inspector down (in Argentina).''
</P>
<P>
   ``People bring illegal fruits and vegetables into California all
the time. If it's contaminated, we have a problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 40,000 acres of lemons, Valencia and naval oranges, and a
small amount of grapefruit are grown in Ventura, Oxnard and the
Santa Clara Valley. Citrus constitutes approximately 30 percent of
the county's $955 million agricultural industry.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA made its ruling behind closed doors Thursday, after
more than a year of often-heated debate.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will implement a three-phase plan, with the first
allowing for the immediate importation of lemons, oranges and
grapefruit to 34 states.
</P>
<P>
   Phase two will begin in May 2002, when imports will be allowed
into ``buffer'' states of Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia,
Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Argentine citrus would be allowed into California and the rest
of the continental United States when phase three begins in May
2004.
</P>
<P>
   USDA spokeswoman Sue McCalley said Friday that Argentina has
implemented stringent risk mitigation measures to prevent rotten
fruit entering the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are pest mitigation measures at each level to ensure the
fruit doesn't have any pests that can come into the United
States,'' she said. Industry experts acknowledged that damaged
produce arriving in the United States would be tossed out before it
is placed on supermarket shelves. But they also questioned whether
Argentina's inspection process is adequate to prevent bad citrus
from being shipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think science has taken a back seat to trade politics,''
said Joel Nelson, a board member of the U.S. Citrus Science
Council, an ad hoc group of lemon producers who oppose the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Fruit disease) is a communicable disease. It can come on
brush, clothing, in the air and the bottoms of shoes. You could be
transmitting the disease. The USDA's science is inadequate. And if
they are wrong, we're the ones who suffer the consequences,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Oxnard, and U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., will monitor the effects of the policy, their aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stance is that if they are going to import fruit in the
United States, that it be disease-free,'' said Tom Pfeifer,
spokesman for Gallegly. ``He has been in constant conversations
with Dan Glickman, secretary of agriculture, to make sure the
proper steps have been taken.''

L.A. COUNTY JOBLESS RATE EDGES DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Southern California's economy shook off the
effects of an actor's strike during May as unemployment drifted
down 0.2 percentage points on an annual basis, the state said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's unemployment rate dipped to 5.6 percent in Los
Angeles County from 5.8 percent in May 1999, the California
Employment Development Department said Friday. The rate was 5.5
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the jobless rate fell to 5 percent from 5.3 percent a
year ago. The statewide rate was 4.8 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment has been low for months, but the surprise in May
came from the motion picture sector, which added 7,200 jobs on a
monthly basis even though the Screen Actors Guild struck commercial
production companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the heck was the SAG strike?'' wondered Jack Kyser,
chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good, solid growth report for L.A. County.''
</P>
<P>
   The only sour note locally was the aerospace sector, which is
down 11,000 jobs on an annual basis. However, that trend could
start reversing later this year when SR Tecnics of Switzerland
opens a facility in Palmdale that could employ up to 6,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, by the end of the year, we will see some
stabilization,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   Total nonfarm employment grew by 31,400 jobs from April to May.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that unemployment in the Los Angeles/Long Beach area
rose slightly on a monthly basis was not unexpected or troubling,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 12 months, the county has added 91,800
nonagricultural jobs, with 38,500 of them government-related.
</P>
<P>
   However, 14,200 of those jobs were temporary positions added
last month because of the 2000 Census, said Bill Freed, a state
labor market analyst who tracks the region.
</P>
<P>
   The state and county numbers followed the same trend as the
national numbers released a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, May's unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, slightly
lower than the 4.2 percent rate a year ago and up from 3.9 percent
in April.

</P>
<P>
   NKOREA-FOOD (Tumen, China) _ In the last month, North Korea's
reclusive leader has made historic overtures to the outside world,
but his new international openness springs in part from ongoing
domestic tragedy: His government has been unable or unwilling to
solve by itself Korea's desperate longstanding food crisis. Five
years into food shortages that experts say have killed up to 2
million people, death rates in Korea are dropping. But that is
largely because of Western food aid, and because North Koreans have
themselves developed survival strategies to blunt the lethal impact
of what U.N. experts have called a ``slow-motion famine.'' By
Elisabeth Rosenthal.

   SAFRICA-RACE (Tsakane, South Africa) _ For years, the country
girl wished she could wiggle out of her skin and shed her color
like the molting snakes that rustled through the green fields. It
was the 1960s and she was the daughter of white Afrikaners, who
proudly supported the government's brutal system of apartheid and
racial segregation. But for Sandra Laing, it was hard to swallow
the message of hate. Her birth certificate said she was white, but
when she looked in the mirror, she saw a honey brown face framed by
a halo of kinky-curly hair. For a time, the Laings ignored the
whispers about the African blood many suspected flowed through
their veins. But by age 15, Sandra Laing had been expelled from her
all-white school and disowned by her humiliated parents, and her
story had become the country's most harrowing example of a family
destroyed by the crushing weight of apartheid. The saga should have
faded into the yellowing pages of forgotten newspapers. But about
eight months ago, Laing drove home for the first time in nearly 30
years, accompanied by a documentary filmmaker, and what she saw
became prime-time news. By Rachel Swarns.

   BRAZIL-GAYS (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) _ After legislation on

one of the highest rates of anti-gay crimes, but where cities and

   RELIGION-COLUMN (New York) _ By now, many Americans can claim at
least a passing familiarity with the 14th Dalai Lama, the exiled

for example, to have drawn an audience in the tens of thousands for
a public teaching he gave in Central Park last August. And, perhaps
more to the point, he has had a book, ``The Art of Happiness''
(Riverhead), on the best-seller lists for well over a year. But how
many know of the 41st Sakya Trizin, supreme head of one of Tibetan
Buddhism's four traditions, or schools? He has just embarked on a
three-month teaching visit to the United States and Canada that
began this week in New York. ``He's second only in importance to

there was one important area where young George did excel: people
skills. It was in high school that he first seemed to cultivate

   MICROSOFT-WINDOWS (Seattle) _ A spectrum of events now taking
place in the computer industry suggests that whether Microsoft wins
or loses its appeal of the antitrust ruling that could break the

linked to a growing belief that because the software publisher is
under government scrutiny it has found it more difficult to flex
its industry might. Others are linked to the emergence of new

SPORTS COLUMN: METS AND YANKEES, ONE YEAR LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Omar Minaya stood by the visitors' dugout at Yankee
Stadium Friday. Minaya, the Mets' assistant general manager,
chatted with players and reporters and soaked up the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   I walked over to Minaya, and we exchanged pleasantries. He said
something about how time flies, how things change.
</P>
<P>
   At this time last season the Mets were in a shambles. Before the
first game of their first meeting with the Yankees, Bobby Bonilla
and Brian McRae arrived at Yankee Stadium and learned they had been
placed on irrevocable waivers. Then after the second game, the Mets
dismissed three coaches. Manager Bobby Valentine followed that by
announcing that if the Mets' tailspin continued, he should be
dismissed as well. That put in motion the most bizarre four-month
stretch of baseball in the Mets' history _ a stretch that ended
with the Mets facing Atlanta for the National League pennant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are better today after 59 games than we were last year
after the same number of games,'' Minaya said Friday night before
the Mets and the Yankees met for the first time this season. ``Last
June the last thing on my mind was Atlanta and a championship
series. There was a lot going on: We had coaches we had to let go,
the team was on a losing streak and we were trying to put the
pieces back together.''
</P>
<P>
   So Friday night the Mets crushed the Yankees. On the way to a
12-2 victory they pummeled Roger Clemens, pounding out nine runs on
10 hits in a barrage that underlined the severity of the Yankees'
pitching woes.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza hit a grand slam off of Clemens and Edgardo Alfonzo
hit a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd way, the roots of the Mets' confidence this season go
back to Oct. 20, 1999, in Atlanta, Game 6 of the National League
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Minaya remembered how the Braves went ahead, 5-0, in the first
inning by routing Al Leiter. ``I was dejected,'' Minaya said. ``I
left to go to the bathroom and the next thing you know I was
standing in a corridor and we were coming back. I told myself, `I
ain't moving from here _ this is a good-luck spot.' I stood there
the rest of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets tied the game, 7-7, in the seventh inning, I left
the Turner Field press box, went downstairs and saw Minaya standing
in a corridor amid Atlanta fans, looking up at a television
monitor.
</P>
<P>
   We stood there, without really speaking, but thinking about the
improbable history unfolding. Then the Mets took a one-run lead in
the eighth inning; we watched Atlanta tie the score in the bottom
of the eighth. The Mets took a 9-8 lead in the top of the 10th
inning.
</P>
<P>
   In Minaya's mind, that was how close the Mets came to facing the
Yankees in the World Series, to having the chance to settle a
deeply rooted grudge, to heal the deep wounds inflicted by history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were two outs away from going to that seventh game,''
Minaya said. ``The general sense, looking at the faces of the
Braves after this comeback, was that we were going to beat them
that seventh game. It was very exciting. I'm a New Yorker, so a
subway series meant so much to me, especially being part of one of
the teams in the series.''
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta tied the score in the bottom of the 10th. In the
bottom of the 11th _ well, you know the sad history: a leadoff
double; the runner moves to third on a sacrifice bunt. A pair of
intentional walks to load the bases and finally a walk to Andruw
Jones to force in the winning run. Minaya and I shook hands and
took different routes to the Mets' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, that game seemed like a century ago; the two ballparks,
Shea Stadium and Yankee Stadium, seemingly so close last October,
seemed oceans apart. The Mets and the Yankees were back at the
beginning; back at the mouth of a long, seemingly endless tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Last October Minaya was deflated. ``When something hasn't
happened in 40 years, and in your mind you're two outs away from it
happening,'' Minaya said, ``you're disappointed. But as a baseball
man, you pick yourself up over the winter and you go at it again.''
</P>
<P>
   There's such a long way to go. The Yankees need pitching help
desperately. The Mets need another good player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' Minaya said, ``teams are jockeying for position
until they make a decision on how they are going to improve the
club. I guarantee you, whoever wins the championship is not going
to win the championship with the team they have today.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a long time, that's truer for the Yankees
than it is for the Mets. &QL;

ADVERSITY AN UNWELCOME VISITOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A sickeningly familiar face from days gone by made
the Staples Center scene Friday. Pamela Anderson Lee didn't create
as much of a stir parading to her courtside seat as did this tawdry
vixen, who had clung to the Lakers like a groupie in seasons past.
</P>
<P>
   She had been conspicuously absent this year, not that anybody
missed her. So unwelcome a sight was she that heads naturally
turned and gasps punctured the silence that greeted her when she
made her grand entrance to Game 2 of the NBA Finals between the
Pacers and the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived late, of course. The game was nearly nine minutes
old when Adversity looked at the startled faces on the Lakers bench
and breathed,``I'm back.''
</P>
<P>
   Adversity, like so many other two-bit players in this city, is
famous for her multitude of disguises. This time she took the form
of a sprained ankle that Kobe Bryant suffered when his left foot
rolled over one of Jalen Rose's feet as Bryant was touching down
after launching a perfect strike from 17 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant crumpled to the court as though he had been shot and was
writhing in pain in full view of the Lakers' bench as the Pacers
pushed the ball upcourt and Austin Croshere put up an errant shot.
Bryant was still struggling to stand when his starting backcourt
mate, Ron Harper, drove for a layup a few feet away from him after
receiving a pass from Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, limping so noticeably the 18,997 spectators ached, made
it to the bench and was promptly shepherded to the locker room for
X-rays by trainer Gary Vitti. By the end of the night, the results
were in and they were as good as the Lakers could have hoped for:
Bryant's X-rays came back negative and the Lakers took an injurious
situation and turned it into a positive, defeating the Pacers
111-104 to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a village to replace Bryant, who had four assists, one
blocked shot and one defensive rebound when he went down. One by
one, the bodies stepped forward to fill the void: Harper had 21
points, 13 more than his postseason average. His aim was so true,
it looked for a while as though he was going to score his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shifted back into Cleveland mode tonight,'' said Bryant of
Harper, alluding to the latter's days as the Cavaliers' go-to guy
in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Glen Rice, who missed seven of eight shots in
Game 1 and had finished with single-digit scoring in four of the
Lakers' previous seven games dating back to Game 2 of their Western
Conference final against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Rice strung together 13 points by halftime and finished with 21
points, reminding us anew what he can do when the offense flows
like electricity through him. He got 15 shots, one more than he had
in any previous playoff game, and got into a groove outside the
arc, making five of his six 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' bench manned the crisis hotline with aplomb; Robert
Horry, Rick Fox, Derek Fisher, Brian Shaw and Travis Knight
combined for 23 points to offset Indiana super sub Croshere's 24.
</P>
<P>
   Adversity can be so overbearing, the Lakers did well to hold her
off. Goodness knows they were a sucker for her advances last year,
weakening at the knees when the season was delayed by a work
stoppage, when coach Del Harris was fired, when Dennis Rodman was
signed and scrapped and when the San Antonio Spurs snuffed them in
the second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson's hiring last June seemed to scare her off. Either
that or Adversity couldn't score seats in the Lakers' new arena.
Whatever the reason, the Lakers in the first year of Jackson's
coaching reign got by with just a few rumored sightings of
Adversity Bryant missed the first 15 games of the season with a
broken right hand and Brian Shaw sat out Game 5 of the Portland
series because of a suspension. They didn't see her in the flesh
until Bryant fell down.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's status for Sunday's Game 3 at Indianapolis is
uncertain. If the Lakers thought it was a challenge winning a
playoff game he started but couldn't finish, they haven't seen any
hardships yet. If the Lakers have to face a hostile Conseco
Fieldhouse crowd with Bryant sitting in street clothes, they'll
feel Adversity's full sway. It was wonderful they were able to keep
her at arm's length Friday, but the sterner test of their character
is just ahead.

2 RECORD LABELS REACH AGREEMENT WITH MP3.COM 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite 1st two grafs. In 2nd graf, distinguishes between
Time Warner and Warner Music Group.)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Signaling a new era of cooperation in the
volatile world of online music distribution, two major record
labels said Friday that they had settled a copyright lawsuit with
MP3.com in a deal that permits the music start-up to store
consumers' record libraries and provide access to them over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, MP3.com will pay roughly $20 million each
to BMG Entertainment, a unit of Bertelsmann AG, and Warner Music
Group, a subsidiary of Time Warner, along with licensing fees for
use of the labels' music on the service, parties close to the
negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal hardly dispels the recording industry's pressing
concerns about music piracy online, nor does it yet make the bulk
of the music from the major record labels available for purchase
and listening over the Internet. But it appears to signal a
recognition by the labels and MP3.com that the traditional and
online businesses need each other, and can profit going forward by
working together.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Robertson, chairman and chief executive of MP3.com,
declined to discuss the amount of the settlements, but said that
even if the reports were accurate, the fees would not jeopardize
the company's long-term viability.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company, which is based in San Diego, has $380
million in cash reserves. ``The reality is, cash is not an issue,''
he said, adding that he believed the settlement paved the way for
growth of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Sheirer, an entertainment analyst with Forrester Research,
a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass., said that by settling,
the music labels at once scored a victory but also signaled a
willingness to embrace the online marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   He said that it was of symbolic importance that the record
labels settled with MP3.com, which is just one of the companies
that uses the MP3 format to distribute music on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge day for the recording industry,'' he said. ``They
are embracing a business model that revolves around the MP3
format.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean, however, that the labels are embracing a
mechanism for piracy, record industry officials said. They said
that the use of the MP3 format under the settlements announced
Friday was confined to allowing consumers to listen only to music
that they had already purchased, and not to download or trade music
they did not own.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that could have more dramatic implications, the
Recording Industry Association of America remains in litigation
with Napster, an online service that provides software that
Internet users employ to share and trade music files, including
copyrighted material. The service says it is not responsible if
some people use its software to pirate music, but the recording
industry disagrees, and asserts, generally speaking, that piracy
costs the industry and the artists it represents tens of millions
of dollars in lost sales. That case is still being heard in a
federal court in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal announced Friday, MP3.com has agreed to license,
for undisclosed fees, the use of songs from BMG and Time Warner for
use in its My.MP3.com service. The service allows consumers to
store their own record collections on MP3.com's computers in
so-called ``virtual lockers'' _ and access them via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com launched the My.MP3.com service in January. In hopes of
making the service easy to use, the company itself purchased tens
of thousands of commercial compact discs. Consumers who proved they
owned a copy of a given disc, by inserting it into their PC while
visiting the site, would then be able to access that music from the
MP3.com computers.
</P>
<P>
   But the recording industry argued in court that MP3.com was
violating copyrights by copying the music, compiling a vast
database without permission or license. Although Robertson argued
that his service simply extended to cyberspace consumers' legal
rights to make a copy of their own music, a federal judge in New
York agreed with the labels in April, finding that the practice
violated copyright law because MP3.com had not received permission
from the recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   Three other major record labels, including Sony Music, EMI and
Universal Music Group, said they were continuing independent
settlement negotiations, and declined further comment. A spokesman
for Time Warner said the company declined comment on the
settlement; in a press release, Kevin Conroy, chief marketing
officer and president of new technology for BMG Entertainment, said
that ``the best enforcement is the creation of legitimate
alternatives for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was brought by the Recording Industry Association of
America, which represents the five major record labels, but because
of antitrust regulations, the labels must settle the licensing
agreements separately, industry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Presuming that the other labels settle for around $20 million
also, as industry analysts expect, the cost to MP3.com could be
upward of $100 million, excluding future licensing fees, people
close to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the My.mp3.com service has about 500,000 accounts,
but the virtual lockers do not now include music from the major
labels. Robertson said the service would continue to be free,
despite the fact that Mp3.com will have to pay licensing fees to
the labels, and he said the revenue would be raised largely by
advertising. The site, which also sells some items online, also
offers music from independent artists.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to any deal struck with the major labels, MP3.com is
seeking licensing deals with music publishing groups, and Robertson
said that the service would not be fully functional until both sets
of deals were finalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is building foundation for creating a massive online
business,'' Robertson said, calling the settlement a ``win-win''
for the two parties. ``Shareholders of major record labels are
getting a bite of the online apple.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal apparently played well with investors. Shares of
MP3.com were up $1.938, or 11.23 percent, to $19.188 in late
trading Friday on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said the settlement may represent a partial
victory for MP3.com and for Robertson, who has ruffled many
feathers in the recording industry by asserting that traditional
music business models have been outdated in the Internet era.
</P>
<P>
   Michael B. Nathanson, a music industry analyst with Sanford
Bernstein &AMP; Co. in New York, said he was surprised the settlement
came so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have thought they would punish Robertson,'' he said.
``But what it shows me is they realize there's a lot of traffic on
his site and that, at the end of the day, it makes sense to work
with these sites rather than oppose them.''

PEREZ IMPRESSIVE, BUT DODGERS LOSE 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The more the plan seems laid out and ready to be
executed, the better left-hander Carlos Perez performs, throwing
said plan out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   With right-hander Orel Hershiser pitching 65 miles away in the
minor leagues and lying in wait to rejoin the Dodgers, and perhaps
their starting rotation, Perez went out and had his best outing of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Perez allowed a season-low one run on three hits in seven
innings, but it was wasted thanks to reliever Antonio Osuna's third
straight brutal outing. Olmedo Saenz hit a two-run homer in the
eighth off Osuna to lift the Oakland A's to a 3-1 win over the
Dodgers at Dodger Stadium on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna (0-3) walked Jason Giambi with two outs to set up Saenz's
homer, and is in the midst of a rough time. Osuna's allowed five
runs, walked eight and hit a batter in his last three appearances,
totaling 3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Tam (1-2) struck out four in 1 innings of relief for the
win and right-hander Jason Isringhausen pitched the ninth for his
15th save.
</P>
<P>
   While the loss dropped the Dodgers (32-26) three games behind
West Division-leading Arizona, there is a bigger picture, and
that's Perez. His outing throws a kink, albeit possibly only
temporarily, into what the Dodgers were thinking of doing. They're
still likely to recall Hershiser for the upcoming series against
Arizona, but instead of joining the starting rotation he'll go to
the bullpen, which he should be better prepared to do this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Hershiser wound up with Single-A San Bernardino
because he was having trouble adjusting to his role in the bullpen.
When he tried it earlier this season, Hershiser had a 15.18 ERA in
five relief outings.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser was supposed to start today for the Stampede, but his
start was pushed up a day, making for a nifty safety net in case
Perez was rocked by the A's. Hershiser, who allowed three runs on
six hits in four-plus innings against the Mudville Nine, could've
stepped into Perez's spot in the rotation Wednesday against Arizona
if Perez failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Perez was sensational and should face the left-handed
dominated Diamondbacks, not to mention left-hander Randy Johnson.
Of course, Perez already defeated Atlanta's Greg Maddux earlier
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to (Hershiser), and where he's at right now, he could
handle (pitching in the bullpen),'' Johnson said. ``He could handle
it better.''
</P>
<P>
   But the specter of being sent to the minors is something that
will follow Perez until he's either demoted or he reaches June 25,
after which he can refuse a minor-league assignment based on
service time. That marks the date his agreement with the Dodgers,
in which he temporarily waived his rights to refuse an assignment,
expires.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who enjoys early run support in most of his starts,
didn't get quite the quantity he's used to, but got some
nonetheless when second baseman Mark Grudzielanek hit a one-out
solo homer in the bottom of the first off Oakland starter Tim
Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   The A's have had trouble against left-handers. They entered
batting .224 against lefties, 39 points lower than they do against
right-handers, and the A's did nothing to change that against
Perez.
</P>
<P>
   For a fleeting moment of what is maybe the most insane thought,
Perez didn't allow a hit until Miguel Tejada's two-out double in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   But Perez, after recording the first two outs in the sixth,
experienced his only trouble. He walked Giambi and gave up a bloop
single to Saenz. Ben Grieve tied it 1-1 with a double down the
right field line.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers wasted a glorious chance to break the tie in the
seventh inning. Alex Cora led off with a double and pinch-hitter
Dave Hansen walked. They moved up a base on F.P. Santangelo's
sacrifice bunt and Jeff Tam relieved and struck out Grudzielanek
and got Gary Sheffield to fly out to center field to end the
inning.

JOHNSON STOPS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -- Troy Glaus made it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' third baseman hit a 97-mph fastball from Arizona
Diamondbacks pitcher Randy Johnson 457 feet and into the
second-deck restaurant at Bank One Ballpark Friday night for a
second-inning home run and 1-0 Angels lead.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus' homer was the third longest in the ballpark's brief
history, but they don't award extra runs for distance. It turned
out to be the Angels' only run in a 4-1 loss before 39,468 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson returned to the rotation after missing a start with a
sore shoulder, and that was the only reason he lasted just six
innings. Besides the homer to Glaus, he gave up just two other hits
-- singles by Mo Vaughn and Scott Spiezio -- and improved to 10-1.
His ERA actually went up from 1.41 to 1.42.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe he's had shoulder trouble,'' said Angels
manager Mike Scioscia. ``He didn't show any signs of it. He had
great command. No pitch got away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Brian Cooper was up to the challenge of facing
Johnson, at least for four innings. But the Diamondbacks scored all
four or their runs in the fifth inning against him.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Womack tripled and scored on a single by Jay Bell. Luis
Gonzalez followed with a two-run homer for a 3-1 Diamondbacks'
lead. They added one unearned run in the inning on a throwing error
by Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper (2-2) lasted five innings, gave up the four runs (three
earned) and six hits and got the loss. Pitching against Johnson was
a daunting task, but one Cooper wasn't afraid of.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, it forces you to pick up your concentration
because you know you've got to have your best game out there,'' he
said. ``You have to keep your team in the game no matter what. It's
not like we're going to put up a five-spot in the first inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson started with a bang, striking out the side in the first
inning, including Vaughn on a 98-mph fastball that ended the
inning. He struck out eight in all, which gave him 2,832 in his
career, tying Mickey Lolich for 13th on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second time in 28 games the Angels have been
held to fewer than two runs in a game. They had five hits in all,
and had only three baserunners get into scoring position after
Glaus' homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's Randy Johnson, you know what I mean?'' Vaughn said.
``He's one of the top two pitchers in the game. I remember facing
him in Seattle, and what's different about him now is he's become
more of a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over there he used to rear back and try to throw it by you,
and he would throw it by you. Now he's got a two-seam fastball that
goes in on lefties and away from righties. He's got two different
breaking balls and a 97-mph fastball. He's as much a technician as
he is a power pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks had lost five in a row and their N.L. West lead
over the Dodgers had shrunk to two games. But Johnson put and end
to the slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt fairly sharp, not knowing what to expect when you
haven't pitched for about eight days,'' Johnson said. ``But it was
a great win, obviously, because of the situation we went through.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson came up big in the sixth inning when the Angels put two
runners on with nobody out. But Johnson struck out both Kevin
Stocker and Vaughn, then got Tim Salmon on a line drive to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone asked me who'd I pick between Randy and Pedro
(Martinez),'' Vaughn said. ``Hey, flip a coin. They're both going
to be that effective.''

IT'S ALL ABOUT ARISTOTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Everything went the Indiana Pacers' way Friday in
the Black and Blue Division championship game, advertised as the
second game of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Everything except the two things that matter: Shaquille O'Neal.
And the score, 111-104 for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   What a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out - if we didn't know this already - that nothing
else in this series is going to matter if the Pacers can't stop
O'Neal from scoring.
</P>
<P>
   They tried a different way this time, hacking Shaq and sending
him to the free-throw line for an NBA-record 39 free throws, but
the result was another 40-points-plus night for the battered and
bruised MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played as hard as we could, but tonight I thought Shaq was
better than he was the other night,'' Pacers coach Larry Bird said.
``We're down 2-0, we've lost both games on the road and we've got
to figure out a way to win one.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there a plan C?
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had scored 43 points in Wednesday's opener, the Pacers
had been blown out and they'd vowed that wouldn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't. O'Neal got 40 this time to go with 24 rebounds - they
said he wouldn't score 43! - and the Pacers weren't out of it until
the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   In the opener, he did it with 21-for-31 shooting from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he did it with 18-for-39 shooting from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   Same difference for Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Lakers' history of letting down in Game 2s after
winning Game 1s, this looked like the Pacers' best chance to steal
a road game, something they'll have to do sometime to win the
best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   That chance looked better almost from the start. What went wrong
in the opener was going right this time.
</P>
<P>
   Rik Smits hit his first shot and boldly took shots that missed
on the next two possessions, forcing O'Neal to pay attention to him
as he'd failed to do Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller hit a jumper from the right side on the Pacers'
first possession, drew a foul on the second, and drove for a layup
on the sixth, to put aside any thought he'd repeat his 1-for-16
performance Wednesday _ one of the memorably bad nights in
championship-round history, you name the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad he picked up a cheap foul there that sent him to the
bench,'' Bird said. ``I thought he was in the game, was in the
flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it happened. The break _ make that sprain _ the underdog
Pacers needed.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant nailed a 20-footer to give the Lakers a 22-20 lead
nine minutes into the game and landed on Jalen Rose's foot. Bryant
crumpled to the floor and clutched his left ankle. He hopped to the
bench, out of the game and maybe out of Sunday's game in
Indianapolis as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a golden opportunity game there, with Kobe out,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a heck of a game, the Lakers defending small
leads most of the time, until Los Angeles began to pull away and
Bird went back on his semi-promise not to use the Hack-a-Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   We should have seen it coming when the fan who came to the
Staples Center in a Pacers tuxedo for Game 1 showed up in a
Pacers-yellow construction helmet for Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers fouled O'Neal _ with the ball, away from the ball,
even under the Indiana basket immediately after one change of
possession _ on six consecutive possessions beginning as they
trailed 93-87 at the 3-minute mark.
</P>
<P>
   Bird's stated plan, to take a physical approach to Shaq, was
being carried out in front of him. But it couldn't do anything
about the simple equation that rules these two teams in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are 9-0 when they score 99 points or more. The Pacers
are 0-6 when they give up 98 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers got to the magical 99 in excruciating fashion, a
half-step at a time, with O'Neal sinking one of two free throws on
each of those six trips to the line. Then they kept going.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal found Robert Horry cutting left to right under the basket
for the layup - and subsequent foul shot - that made it 102-96 at
:58.8.
</P>
<P>
   That more or less clinched a 2-0 series lead for the Lakers. And
that assist - O'Neal had four to go with his huge point and rebound
totals - was a last reminder that this series really is about only
one player.
</P>
<P>
   If Indiana can't hold him under 40, nothing else matters.

GET EXCITED ABOUT PEDRO'S CAMPAIGN

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Picked-up pieces while wondering if Al Gore can
produce Shaquille-esque energy in the Staples Center when the
Democratic National Convention comes here in August.
</P>
<P>
   --Is anybody else looking forward to Pedro Martinez back in
Yankee Stadium Tuesday night? Pedro has officially moved into the
Koufax pantheon. It's June and his ERA is 0.95. Don't expect to see
anything like it again.
</P>
<P>
   --After the New Jersey Devils win the Stanley Cup, the Bruins
should bring Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello on board to
succeed Harry Sinden.
</P>
<P>
   --Exactly what got into the men's club at Sports Illustrated
when it produced the soft-core pornographic Anna Kournikova cover
story? OK, she's a beautiful girl (must be the only attractive
19-year-old out there), a coconspirator in her own exploitation,
and an OK tennis player. That gets her 11 pages and 11 photos in
the No. 1 sports weekly in the world? Not to mention a panting
story by the estimable Frank Deford, who should know better than to
be part of such a sensational, sophomoric package? Heavy breathing
over teenage female athletes should be reserved for the middle-aged
white guys of sports talk radio. Pathetic. Wonder what SI will do
with Marion Jones, a true winner?
</P>
<P>
   --The visitor's locker room at the Staples Center looks like it
was designed by Red Auerbach. It's the smallest room built into a
new arena in decades.
</P>
<P>
   --The Red Sox should be ashamed of themselves for their shoddy
treatment of John Valentin. The veteran has given his career and
maybe his left knee to the organization, but they sent him a
contemptuous letter, and threatened to void his contract because he
didn't ask Dan Duquette for a bathroom pass before having major
knee surgery (Valentin did speak with Red Sox physician/part-owner
Arthur Pappas). Control-freak Dan needs to know when to let it go.
This would be one of those times. Boston is the organization that's
been sued by an ex-player for medical malpractice. Valentin went to
a reputable doctor. Why must Duquette conduct business like some
coldblooded IRS auditor?
</P>
<P>
   --You know you're in California when you read that the UCLA
baseball team had 12 players drafted in Monday's big league meat
market.
</P>
<P>
   --Any publication that sent an ``invited'' reporter to interview
Bob Knight should be ashamed of itself. Before the ESPN Roy
Firestone-Digger Phelps farce, Knight spoke with seven print
reporters who had been handpicked by the bullying coach. Globe
readers can be thankful that our college guy, Mark Blaudschun, was
not invited.
</P>
<P>
   --The Pacers and Lakers are the lucky ones for these games in
LA: They don't have to make any decisions about what to wear.
Players wear standard uniform garb while the likes of Salma Hayek &AMP;
Co. try out next year's Oscar outfits.
</P>
<P>
   --Everywhere you go, you hear people talking about the Belmont
Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   _Winthrop's Rick DiPietro, a freshman goalie at BU, might be the
No. 1 pick in the NHL draft at Calgary. The Islanders have the
pick, but have no need for a goaltender and are expected to deal.
The young man has great local roots: His mother, Cheryl, went to
high school with Mike Eruzione, and he's represented by Bobby Orr's
Woolf Associates.
</P>
<P>
   --Pacers guard Mark Jackson is one of the NBA's good guys. When
Indiana last played in Boston, he went out of his way to fulfill
the dying wish of a young patient at the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute. Jackson still stays in touch and the family is forever
grateful.
</P>
<P>
   --Iceman George Gervin coached the guy who attempted the
million-dollar shot at halftime Friday night. We knew there was no
danger of the guy passing.
</P>
<P>
   --Perhaps Ted Kennedy can bring ``Mike McGwire and Sammy
Soo-ser'' to the Convention at Staples.
</P>
<P>
   --Count me among those who have zero interest in who's going to
be joining Al Michaels in the booth for ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   --Rick Carlisle is ready to coach the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   --Jason Varitek has two homers and 15 RBIs. Anybody worried
about that?
</P>
<P>
   --Sam Horn's playing for Butch Hobson with the Nashua Pride?
This we gotta see. Proof that not everybody can play first base,
Big Sam always looked as if he was going to go deep. Then he was
gone.
</P>
<P>
   --Why don't the Patriots just do the obvious and re-sign Bruce
Armstrong?
</P>
<P>
   --Adjusting to a new offensive coordinator isn't Drew Bledsoe's
toughest obstacle this fall. Maura Bledsoe is expecting again,
which means that when the baby is born in November, the Bledsoes
will have three kids under 3.
</P>
<P>
   --The NBA Finals are broadcast to 200 countries and there are 50
international crews on site. ``Some of the countries have no
commercials and run a continuous feed, so they are experts on the
Laker Girls,'' said commissioner David Stern.
</P>
<P>
   --Bill Walton's John Wooden interview will air during Sunday's
telecast of the NBA Finals. Walton teases us by saying that Wooden
``gives his feelings on Bobby Knight.'' Walton on Rick Reilly's
Wooden column in Sports Illustrated: ``I laminated it. I read it
three times a day and that doesn't count my morning and evening
prayers.''

ROSTERS COULD HAVE HELPED CAUSE VS. BRAVES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Braves 6 Red Sox 4
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Who knows if Jose Offerman would have made a
difference in Friday night's 6-4 loss to the Atlanta Braves. Maybe
he wouldn't have even played. He hit .100 against the defending
National League champions last season, and is 0 for 9 lifetime in
Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   But the point that was lost on the Red Sox Friday is that
Offerman could have played. They thought he wasn't eligible to come
off the 15-day disabled list until Saturday. It wasn't until after
the game, when Red Sox spokesman Kevin Shea forwarded a reporter's
inquiry to manager Jimy Williams, that Williams acknowledged
Offerman could have been available Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have told me in the last few minutes that he could have
come off today,'' Williams said after a game in which the Sox
spotted Greg Maddux a 5-1 lead. They knocked Maddux out in a
three-run seventh that started with Brian Daubach's 10th home run,
then went out quietly after Andres Galarraga, poster boy for
inspirational sagas, took fellow Venezuelan Rich Garces deep in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The mixup with Offerman was reminiscent of last season's roster
gaffe involving reliever Tom Gordon, who ran in from the bullpen to
a thunderous ovation from a Fenway Park throng for what he thought
would be his first appearance in three months, then was quickly
ushered out when it was discovered that he had not yet been
activated from the DL.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who received a frantic call in the dugout from general
manager Dan Duquette telling him that Gordon couldn't play, took
the blame for that bureaucratic snafu, and he tried to take the hit
Friday, too, even though roster moves are never made from the
manager's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, in fact, a mistake was made, it was better to have someone
on too long than have something really adverse happen,'' Williams
said. ``That's kind of the way I look at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've made a lot of mistakes in my lifetime. I can own
up to them. If a mistake was made, so be it. We can't move
backward. We have to move forward. If you want to beat me up, that
we waited a day too long, that's up to you folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman hurt his left groin in a game against the Toronto Blue
Jays May 24. Three days later, the Sox were in New York and
reinstated Nomar Garciaparra, who had been out with a strained left
hamstring. A roster spot had to be created to make room for
Garciaparra. It was decided that Offerman would go on the 15-day
disabled list. The Sox made his disabling retroactive to May 25,
under provisions that allow a team to backdate putting a player on
the DL to the day after he last played.
</P>
<P>
   For Offerman, the 15-day period that included the 25th ended
Thursday night, making him eligible to play Friday night. Last
weekend, when the club was in Philadelphia, reporters had raised
the question of whether Offerman could come off Friday or Saturday;
Williams came back the next day and said it was Saturday. During
Friday night's game, Sean McAdam of the Providence Journal raised
the issue again with Shea, which led to Williams's admission
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, neither Offerman nor his agent ever raised a
question about his eligibility. He said he didn't find out about
the error until he was asked by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK,'' Offerman said with a little shrug.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe it wasn't OK, on a night that Williams used two pinch
hitters, three third basemen, two right fielders and made two
double switches.
</P>
<P>
   If Offerman had been activated, pitcher Dan Smith, who was
optioned to Pawtucket after the game, anyway, would have been gone.
Pedro Martinez had saved the bullpen with his magnificent effort
Thursday night, so a 12th pitcher probably wouldn't have been a
factor Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Another hitter might have been able to bail out Sox starter Jeff
Fassero, who came unglued in a three-run Braves uprising in the
fourth inning, which he began by walking the first two batters,
Brian Jordan and Reggie Sanders. Fassero, still fuming over what he
believed was a missed call on a 1-and-2 pitch to Sanders, gave up a
first-pitch RBI double to rookie sensation Rafael Furcal. He was
left sputtering when rookie catcher Fernando Lunar reached down for
a pitch well out of the strike zone and stroked a soft, two-run
single that just cleared the peak of Fassero's cap before drifting
into center field.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who took a 1-0 lead in the third on singles by Lunar
and the Jones boys, Andruw and Chipper, were now comfortably ahead,
4-1. They made it 5-1 in the sixth against reliever Hipolito
Pichardo when Furcal dropped a double in front of Troy O'Leary,
stole third, and scored on Maddux's squeeze bunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (inhaled excessively),'' Fassero said of his outing, which
was curtailed with two outs in the fourth. ``How's that sound?
</P>
<P>
   ``That 1-and-2 pitch to Sanders, a call there and the inning
might have been a much different inning. I got a little frustrated
there. Then Lunar hit a pitch that was 2 inches off the plate and 2
inches off the ground _ it practically fell straight down _ and he
hit it how it was pitched. Soft pitch, soft hit. That's a pitch you
want him to hit on the ground, and somehow he hit it over my
head.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a night for things flying over Red Sox heads. An extra
day for Offerman, who never thought his injury was serious enough
to warrant going on the DL in the first place.

PACERS RUN AFOUL OF SHAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Indiana Pacers played Hack-a-Shaq to the max,
but in the end, Shaquille O'Neal found a new way to win. On the
heels of his 43-point outing in Game 1, Shaq scored 40 more points,
grabbed 24 rebounds, took a playoff-record 39 foul shots, and
contributed a beautiful assist to help seal a 111-104 Game 2
victory over the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers were gaining ground by fouling the LA giant (O'Neal
made only 18 foul shots) when he fired a perfect pass to a
reverse-cutting Robert Horry under the basket in the closing
seconds. Horry made the shot, got fouled, and LA had a 6-point lead
with 58.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was even better tonight than he was on
Wednesday,'' said Indiana coach Larry Bird. ``He's a handful.''
</P>
<P>
   So now the series shifts from the beach to the heartland, from
Jack Nicholson to Jim Nabors, from Hollywood to Hooterville. The
Lakers may play Sunday' Game 3 without Kobe Bryant, who sprained
his ankle in the first quarter and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers put up a better fight Friday night. They worked
harder on defense, put some skin on the floor, and threw a scare
into the Californians. Rik Smits (4 points, two rebounds in 16
minutes) was useless again, but Austin Croshere (24 points) picked
up the slack and the Pacers put O'Neal on the line and dared him to
beat them from 15 feet. Shaq struggled at the stripe, but had
enough to beat the overmatched Hoosiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chastened him mildly for putting up in that situation in the
first half,'' said Laker coach Phil Jackson. ``But he shot his free
throws much better in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   It was tied after one and the Lakers led by 3 at the half.
Bloodless Reggie Miller (21) tied the game with a pair of free
throws with 7:09 left in the third, but Derek Harper (another big
21 points), Glen Rice (21), and O'Neal carried LA to a 73-69 lead
after three.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers were within 2 early in the fourth, but an 8-0 LA run
made it 86-78 with seven minutes left. Indy ran off 6 straight, but
Rice drained a three and Shaq hit a jump hook and it was 91-86.
Shaq went to the line the next six times down the floor and made 1
of 2 each time. It took 48 minutes to play the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the game is that tight and you're 4 or 5 points down,
your best option is to get the ball back,'' said Bird. ``But the
more you put him at the line, the better he gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller admitted, ``I'm not a fan of Hack-a-Shaq, but it almost
worked for us tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird said, ``I don't worry about (television) ratings. I'm
trying to win a ballgame. Whatever it takes. If it takes a
four-hour game, we'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers should have been in good shape when Bryant went down
early. Making a routine jumper with 3:26 left in the first period,
LA's young guard rolled his left ankle when he came down on the
foot of Jalen Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Play continued for two possessions while Bryant stayed down, got
up slowly, then limped around. When time was finally called, Kobe
went to the trainer's room.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays were negative, but Bryant (2 points, four assists) did
not return. He is listed as day-to-day, and the series resumes
Sunday at Indiana. Game 4 is Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Miller made his first shot, an 18-foot jumper in the first
minute. In the wake of Wednesday's 1-for-16 performance, he'd
pledged to keep shooting, and he kept his promise. He went 4 for 5
and had 10 points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   There were six lead changes and six ties in the first two
periods. Indy managed to bother O'Neal under the basket and for a
while Shaq's teammates lost sight of him, much as they did in the
first three quarters of Game 7 vs. Portland.
</P>
<P>
   It was 28-28 after one. Dependable Harper once again bailed out
the home team. Harper made all of his shots, scored 11 in the first
period, then made LA's first 4 points of the second.
</P>
<P>
   Smits continued to be an impossibly invisible 7 feet 4 inches,
but Croshere (8 in the first half) came off the bench and gave Indy
a lift for the second straight game. A bucket by Rose gave the
Pacers a 38-36 lead with 6:40 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal started clanking free throws (5 for 17 in the first two
quarters), but brought fans out of their seats when he one-handed a
Brian Shaw pass and slammed it home as he was fouled.

HACK-A-SHAQ TACTICS SMACK OF DESPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Game 2 of the NBA Finals suits your taste in
pro basketball, you also must like meat loaf ice cream,
long-sleeved swimsuits and Chick Hearn hip-hop records.
</P>
<P>
   The pivotal tableau was large men standing around, watching the
largest man nearly fail at his weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Must ZZZ-TV.
</P>
<P>
   A sport that was at one time all about swooping and swooshing by
elegant athletes was reduced Friday night to three hours of
nail-pounding. ``Tool Time'' without Tim Allen's attempts at humor.
</P>
<P>
   The helplessness consuming the Indiana Pacers regarding
Shaquille O'Neal inevitably decayed into the Hack-a-Shaq routine.
Decayed? More like rotted.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Indiana coach Larry Bird declared his disdain
for the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Desperation overcame taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, when a game's that tight and you get down four or five,
I think it's the opportunity to get the ball back,'' Bird said,
almost apologetically. ``The thing about the game is, we played as
hard as we could, but I just thought Shaq was better than he was
the other night.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Bird was right. O'Neal induced Indiana center Rik Smits
into even quicker foul trouble than in Game 1 and savaged the
Pacers with 40 points, 24 rebounds, four assists and three blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Pacers hung tight most of the way, the Lakers
prevailed 111-104 to go up 2-0. But if this style of game keeps up,
starting Sunday in Indianapolis with Game 3, all participants and
observers will be shipped to the ``Survivors'' series on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Never has such a contest _ thank you, basketball gods _ been
seen before, especially not in the Finals, where the presumption is
two relatively well-matched teams.
</P>
<P>
   Sending O'Neal to the free-throw line 39 times _ breaking by
five a record set 38 years ago by Wilt Chamberlain _ is like
enduring George W. Bush's list of known foreign leaders, or
Microsoft's explanations of why it is not a monopoly. The action is
excruciating, exasperating and embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to argue with the rationale behind the strategy _ as
Bird put it after Game 1, ``The matchups in this series are bad for
us'' _ but that doesn't mean anyone has to be happy with the
results.
</P>
<P>
   The distortion at center produced a final quarter that lasted 48
minutes, and a game that featured 96 free throws _ 26 more than the
playoff record. The acme of freakishness came when O'Neal could
miss nine free throws in the fourth quarter _ he flubbed 21 in the
game _ while playing with foul trouble himself, and the Lakers
could still win going away.
</P>
<P>
   Among the participants, Jalen Rose was at least honest enough to
voice his contempt for the maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's a pretty good theory, if you're four or five
ahead and it's above two minutes,'' said Rose, who led Indiana with
30 points. ``Other than that, I really don't think it's a great
theory. Not only does it give him an opportunity to rest, even a
bad free-throw shooter makes 50 percent. He puts points on the
board, stops the clock and it gives him a rhythm and confidence to
still play the rest of his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you play him straight up and he earns everything, that's
how you get to him, as opposed to giving him free points.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Pacers, they tried that in Game 1, when
O'Neal attempted only six free throws. They lost that one by more
than they lost Game 2, and Friday the Lakers operated without Kobe
Bryant, the precocious star who went out with a sprained ankle
after nine minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Kobe going down, we had a golden opportunity slip through
our fingers,'' said Reggie Miller, the Pacers' leading playoff
scorer who rebounded from his Game 1 horrors with 21 points. ``But
when a guy goes back-to-back 40s, you gotta give him credit.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is denying credit. Aesthetic considerations are of no
importance to O'Neal, who no longer even flinches when the
inevitable cavalcade of slaps comes his way. He has grown sanguine
over the tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's total respect for my game,'' he said, offering a tough
argument. But we will dispute anyway: If he could make some free
throws, there would be no Hack-a-Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that even the greatest players have
vulnerabilities, and playoff basketball strategy is all about
exploiting those weaknesses, there is something depressing about a
career-long failure to master the game's most elemental maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Even Lakers coach Phil Jackson admitted to admonishing O'Neal at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mildly chastised him for putting us in a situation,'' he
said, ``where we should have been maybe 10 or 12 points up, to only
be ahead by three.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah _ if there were no kryptonite, Superman wouldn't be a
good story.
</P>
<P>
   But a three-hour kryptonite festival is not a good story,
either.

   HARTFORD, Conn. _ In New Haven, a state grand jury is
investigating whether two top police detectives concealed evidence
in a 1996 murder case. In Hartford, federal officials have indicted
six current or former police officers accused of forcing
prostitutes to have sex with them. This spring, two officers in New
Milford were convicted of manslaughter in two separate killings.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, more Connecticut law enforcement officers
have been accused or convicted of wrongdoing than at any time in
recent memory. More than a dozen police officers _ in Hartford, New
Haven, New Milford, Madison and Meriden _ as well as several county
sheriffs and their deputies, have been investigated or punished by
state or federal authorities for misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's certainly more than the norm in most states,'' said
Neal Trautman, executive director of the National Institute of
Ethics, which provides training to police departments across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   And though the situation may seem inconsequential to critics of
the police in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, many Connecticut
residents consider it a startling occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a tough year for policing in Connecticut,'' said
the New Haven police chief, Melvin H. Wearing. ``The Police
Department has a cloud over it now.'' Though he was speaking about
his own force, the remark could easily be applied to many other
police departments.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the increase in misconduct complaints are not
clear. But many legal and law enforcement experts say the rise may
reveal more about the greater public scrutiny that the police are
under nowadays than about any real increase in misbehavior by
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could well be that it's a reflection of police departments
becoming professionalized,'' said Steven Duke, a professor of
criminal law at Yale Law School. ``The new leadership in police
departments are becoming more attuned to these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Everett, a clinical professor of law at the University of
Connecticut's School of Law, added: ``What I think is different in
the last couple years is some communities, especially inner-city
communities, have made it known that they expect the authorities to
check things out rather than assume there was no wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent investigation involves the New Haven Police
Department, which has endured several scandals in the last two
years _ even as it has won national awards for innovative programs
and solved the vast majority of its violent-crime cases.
</P>
<P>
   On May 30, Wearing placed his chief of detectives, Capt. Brian
Sullivan, and Detective Edward Kendall on paid suspension while a
Connecticut grand jury explores allegations that the two officers
hid a transcript of a taped interview that the department conducted
while investigating a murder in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The audiotape vanished after the interview, and the only
existing transcript apparently languished in Kendall's desk drawer
for two years, despite repeated requests for help from detectives
in North Haven, where the victim's body was found.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is the latest in a string of embarrassments
for the New Haven police. Last year, two rookie officers were
suspended for having sex with two women in a police substation. In
1998, the FBI looked into accusations that a former city detective,
Vincent Raucci Jr., tried to frame two men on a false murder
charge; the agency will not reveal its findings. The year before
that, the police chief, Nicholas Pastore, resigned after admitting
he had fathered a child with a New Haven prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a few problems, but I look at it as a couple of
things a couple of cops have done,'' said New Haven's mayor, John
DeStefano Jr., in an interview this week. ``But I'm also going to
tell you, this isn't Hartford. There's not a systematic thing going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the police departments in Connecticut, Hartford's appears
wreathed by the most serious and chronic problems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the U.S. attorney in New Haven started a civil rights
inquiry after several Hartford officers were accused of forcing
prostitutes to have sex with them, sometimes at gunpoint. Six
officers have been indicted so far in the continuing investigation,
and four of them have pleaded guilty to violating the prostitutes'
civil rights, said Delcie Thibault, a spokeswoman for Stephen C.
Robinson, the U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, an independent study of the Hartford Police
Department, commissioned by city officials, portrayed a force in
disarray. The report found that most of the 471 officers did not
work weekends when the most calls for help occurred and that
crime-fighting units were so disorganized that one narcotics unit
once descended with force on a major drug suspect only to find that
another squad had gotten there first. The report also found that
cash and property had been stolen from the department's evidence
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no coordination, there was no communication,'' said
Lt. Kevin Borofsky, who credited the external audit with improving
the department. ``Now investigations are coordinated. Everybody's
on the same page. Now you have detectives working Saturday evening
and Sunday evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Myriad other changes _ including having the department approved
by a national police accrediting agency _ are expected to take at
least two more years.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a city-appointed overseer began monitoring the
department to ensure it more closely adheres to a 1973 consent
order, issued by a Federal District Court, to improve overall
police conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the improvements and a 29 percent drop in crime between
1994 and 1998, many community groups still feel the Hartford police
are more interested in protecting their jobs and perks than in
protecting the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no integrity or commitment to the common good at the
top level,'' said Carmen M. Rodriguez, executive director of La
Casa de Puerto Rico, a stalwart critic of city police policies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Connecticut, local police officers continue to come
under unprecedented legal scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a state judge sentenced Scott Smith, a former
patrolman in New Milford, north of Danbury, to six years in prison
for fatally shooting a burglary suspect in the back while the man
lay on his stomach. In April, a jury found another New Milford
officer, William Scribner, criminally liable for killing a woman he
struck with his patrol car during a high-speed pursuit of a
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the police chief in the shoreline town of Madison,
Paul Jakubson, suspended four officers for attending a bachelor
party where a woman performed a sex act. A state police
investigation cleared the officers of any criminal misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, the state police began an investigation into
allegations that a high-ranking police officer in Meriden, a city
between New Haven and Hartford, had threatened a woman with a
knife.
</P>
<P>
   Though many kinds of misconduct are clearly out of line, some
police officials believe that more officers are being brought to
justice because of how they do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the news, it's been a rough year, but it's a
different kind of headline,'' said Chief James J. Strillacci in
West Hartford, who fired Officer J. David Colon in December after
he was accused of beating up a teen-age burglary suspect.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, it was systemic police corruption that made banner
headlines, said Strillacci, the co-chairman of the Connecticut
Police Chiefs Association's legislative committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not what we're dealing with now,'' he said. ``We're
dealing with police officers trying to do their jobs and their
judgment being questioned. This kind of thing wouldn't even be in
the paper a generation ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying there's any worse behavior, or bad behavior, by
police officers,'' he went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's changed is people are more interested in misdeeds by
those in authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Though most police officers do their jobs well, the growing list
of misconduct charges is a clear signal that more training in
ethical issues is required, said Trautman of the Ethics Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethics is the most sought-after topic in police enforcement
now; that was unheard of 10 years ago,'' Trautman said. ``Chiefs
don't get fired for crime rates anymore, they get fired for
scandal.''

GIANTS HAMMER HAPLESS HALAMA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This is just about where the Mariners left off.
</P>
<P>
   When last we saw the Good Ship Mariner in a foreign port, the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays were scoring 11 runs in the eighth inning of
what had been a tie game.
</P>
<P>
   Time and distance apparently have not tempered the Seattle
propensity for seriously dysfunctional play away from the comforts
of Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   One day after getting a reminder from manager Lou Piniella about
the importance of playing well on the road, the Mariners sang the
same mournful dirge, dropping a 9-2 decision to the San Francisco
Giants in Seattle's first-ever game in Pacific Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Mariners to 10-17 on the road, and as if
that was not bad enough, Oakland beat Los Angeles, so the A's moved
1{ games up on Seattle in the tight American League West race.
</P>
<P>
   It's the furthest the Mariners have been out of first place this
season. On May 25, the M's were one game out, but two days after
that, they were back in the lead, and they've remained within half
a game of the lead since. At their peak, the Mariners had a
three-game lead twice late in April.
</P>
<P>
   That all seems a long time ago. The Mariners continue to have
trouble scoring runs. They seem to have trouble playing defense,
too, but ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You can play defense all you want, but you've still got to
score some runs,'' Piniella said, aware that at its current pace,
the offense just isn't bringing home the bacon in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have scored some runs. They just haven't scored
many. And they haven't scored nearly enough. In the past 11 games,
they've scored 48 times, an average of 4.36 runs per game.
Seattle's average for the season is 5.70 runs, so the dropoff is
severe and debilitating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every day we need to come up with one big hit,''
center fielder Mike Cameron said. ``Right now we've got to roll
with the punches, come back out tomorrow and score some runs. What
we need now is a couple of hits and some luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle had little enough of either commodity Friday night,
although given the kind of night starter John Halama had, anything
short of double-figure offense was going to be too little.
</P>
<P>
   The hitters didn't produce, so Halama and the M's went quietly
into the cool mists of the San Francisco night losers again on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Halama lasted just three innings, gave up 10 hits, walked three
and was victimized by two of the three errors committed by a
slipshod defense. The loss was Halama's second in succession after
six consecutive wins, and this one the left-hander found hard to
take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave up a lot of hits, only one double but a lot of hits,''
Halama said. ``Those guys (the Giants) fought off a lot of tough
pitches, then I had to come in with 2-2 and 3-2 pitches, and they
hit them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fought and fought and fought, then they got the hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle had one brief shining moment, that coming in the first
inning when, with two outs, Alex Rodriguez hit his 17th homer, a
savage shot to center that had Giants' starter Kirk Rueter (3-4)
rocking back on his heels.
</P>
<P>
   Rueter recovered. Halama never did, although he was a little
lucky, hard though that may be to believe. He gave up one run in
the first on a Jeff Kent single, but left the bases loaded. Halama
allowed four hits in the second inning, but didn't give up a run
and again left the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   The luck pendulum swung the other way in the third. Not only did
catcher Dan Wilson and third baseman David Bell make errors behind
him, but Halama ran out of ways to dodge the Giants' bullets. The
end result was a four-run, four-hit inning that left the Giants in
command 5-1 and took Halama out of the game after a labored
79-pitch effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like this for Halama the last couple of times out,''
Piniella said. ``Tonight specifically he didn't get the ball down,
and they sprayed hits all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Rueter, meanwhile, had minimal trouble with the Seattle offense.
He got a double play from his defense in the second inning, then
escaped trouble after allowing two two-out hits in the third. At
that point the game was still a game at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Giants' four-run bottom of the third, the heart
seemed to go out of Seattle's offense. Over the course of the next
three innings, the M's got just one hit.
</P>
<P>
   The scouting report the Mariners had on the Giants said that San
Francisco's offense was stoked and was going to be difficult to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scout was right on on that one,'' Piniella said. ``Those
guys on the other side are hitting the ball real good right now.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes one team.

LAKERS SURVIVE INJURY TO KOBE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An ankle turned, a Shaq got hacked, the NBA's
grand musical was drowned by a chorus of whistles and boos, and the
Lakers' control of the championship series was nearly submerged
along the way. The Lakers had their manhood tested, then their
patience, finally their composure.
</P>
<P>
   But they emerged Friday night with everything intact, save for
Kobe Bryant's left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   With Bryant on crutches, the Lakers propped themselves up on a
40-point performance from Shaquille O'Neal and survived a
debilitating attack from the Indiana Pacers for a 111-104 victory
and a 2-0 lead in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Their home-court advantage safe, the Lakers head to Indiana for
the next three games, uncertain about Bryant's status (officially,
day-to-day) but assured they can withstand just about anything now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that we had a lot of things going against us in the
course of the game,'' coach Phil Jackson said. ``The little things.
They got the (3-point) bank shot from (Sam) Perkins, they got a
couple bounces went their way, shots that hit the rim and went in.
Little things were happening and just by staying positive, and we
were fortunate to have Glen Rice step up and hit a 3-pointer at
that time. Players that stepped into the vacuum were real big for
us tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   That giant sucking sound was the Hoover effect created by
Bryant's first-quarter injury. But the loss of the Lakers'
second-leading scorer, top defender and best playmaker only
threatened their championship hopes briefly.
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, an opportunity. And Rice, dormant for much of
the postseason, took advantage, scoring 21 points on 7-of-15
shooting, including 5 of 6 from the arc. Ron Harper added a
season-high 21, going 8 for 12 from the field, mostly on hard
drives to the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great. It was like he had flashbacks of his younger
days,'' said teammate Brian Shaw, who picked up the majority of
Bryant's minutes. ``I think the fact (Harper) knew Kobe wasn't
going to come back and that he wasn't going to be subbed for, he
could kind of freelance a little bit more. And that's his game.''
</P>
<P>
   No lead was safe, and no strategy off-limits as the Pacers
ravenously tore at the Lakers in an attempt to steal home-court
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana got rejuvenated performances from Jalen Rose (30 points)
and Reggie Miller (21 points) and a 24-point boost from Austin
Croshere, but it finally came down to Pacers coach Larry Bird
ordering the Hack-a-Shaq. O'Neal was fouled intentionally six times
in the last 3:08, and made 6 of 12 free throws _ and history.
</P>
<P>
   For the night, O'Neal made 18 of 39 from the foul line, the most
free throws ever attempted in any NBA game, regular-season or
playoff. The previous high was 34 attempts, by Wilt Chamberlain on
Feb. 22, 1962.
</P>
<P>
   That, combined with an 11-of-18 night from the field, and 24
rebounds, gave O'Neal his best back-to-back games of the playoffs.
And left Bird _ who also tried more double-teaming _ befuddled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about the game is we played as hard as we could,''
Bird said, ``but tonight I just thought Shaq was better than he was
the other night. I thought he was dominating, he caused a lot of
problems for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And though he had vowed not to use it, Bird defended the choice
to Hack-a-Shaq _ the tactic made (un)popular by Portland coach Mike
Dunleavy in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know, when a game's that tight and you get down 4 or
5, I think it's the best opportunity to get the ball back,'' Bird
said. ``He was struggling early. The more you put him at the line,
the better he gets.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal scored 17 points in the fourth quarter, going 4 for 4
from the field and 9 for 16 from the line, as the Lakers turned
back every Pacers charge.
</P>
<P>
   But it made for a testy crowd, which loudly booed Bird's
strategy, and an edgy game for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good, though,'' Derek Fisher said. ``I think in the
first game, people didn't really think that was much of a game. ...
There was more of a feeling of 'This is the NBA Finals.' And I
think tonight was a perfect example of what we thought was going to
happen. The Pacers knew that this was a game that in terms of
percentages and what's realistic, that they had to win this
basketball game to really stay in this series.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no shortage of clutch plays from just about every
Laker role player along the way. Rice and Fisher hit big 3-pointers
in the fourth quarter. Robert Horry converted a 3-point play (on a
spiffy pass from O'Neal for a reverse) to extend a shaky lead to
102-96. Rick Fox hit a driving bank shot to make it a 105-98 with
37.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kobe went out, we felt that we had to pick it up,''
O'Neal said. ``So I took it upon myself to get in deep position and
take the high-percentage shots. My teammates were looking for me.
When they continued to double, I was looking for guys like Glen,
Robert, Rick.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they continue to play that well, the dream will be
complete for the team, for the city, for the organization.''

LAZIO SAID TO PICK VETERAN OF FORBES RACE AS MANAGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite first six grafs to reflect confirmation of the
appointment.)  
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep. Rick Lazio has appointed a veteran strategist
for conservative causes to run his campaign for the Senate,
campaign officials said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's choice is Bill Dal Col, 44, a childhood friend from Long
Island who managed Steve Forbes' two unsuccessful bids for the
Republican presidential nomination, campaign officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters following an event in Ulster County late
Friday, Lazio said that Dal Col brought ``the depth of experience,
unrivaled frankly,'' to his Senate campaign, according to The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has national perspective,'' Lazio said. ``He knows New
York. He's got the ideal combination of political skills,
communication skills, organizational skills to help pull the
operation of this campaign effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col, who is expected to join the campaign within a couple of
days, will lead a campaign staff that includes other veterans of
national campaigns, including a political strategist who worked on
Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign. Dal Col did not return
telephone calls to his Virginia office.
</P>
<P>
   Between Forbes' presidential campaigns in 1996 and 2000, Dal Col
was president of Americans for Hope, Growth and Opportunity, a
nonprofit group founded by Forbes that advocates a ban on all
abortions, school choice for parents, and the dismantling of the
IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes took a strong antiabortion stance in his campaign this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has won
the endorsement of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League, has said she will make abortion rights a theme of
her campaign. Lazio has said he favors abortion rights, but opposes
public financing of abortions and a late-term procedure critics
call ``partial birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Political strategists said Dal Col appealed to Lazio in several
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col has the experience of running major campaigns, but is
also political kindred from Suffolk County, which is symbolically
important in a campaign in which Lazio has sought to contrast his
New York roots with Clinton's background. The first lady moved to a
house in Chappaqua five months ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dal Col, who ran unsuccessfully for the state Assembly in 1982,
was a councilman in Babylon, N.Y., in the 1980s. Lazio grew up in
West Islip and lives in Brightwaters, both in Suffolk County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill is a native New Yorker who is a childhood friend of
Lazio's, and they know each other well,'' said Greg Mueller, a
senior adviser to Forbes during his 2000 campaign. ``Lazio doesn't
have time for that `getting to know you.' And Bill knows New York
politics backward, forward and sideways. He's lived in New York and
he knows all the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller described Dal Col as details-oriented, the kind of
person who ``gets under the hood and works on the engine.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lazio released the first television advertisement for his
campaign on Friday. Two other advertisements made by outside groups
have already been shown. The 60-second Lazio advertisement,
``Introduction,'' shows him talking about his upbringing and
political life. It will be broadcast this weekend on stations north
of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also released a new campaign advertisement in which she
mentions her visits to all 62 New York counties, and promises to
promote high-tech jobs and to practice fiscal responsibility by
reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of a campaign manager for Lazio has been widely
anticipated, because his backers feel a need to set a course for a
campaign that began only three weeks ago, when Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani dropped out to seek treatment for prostate cancer. Clinton
has been campaigning for nearly a year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This week, Lazio also named several other people to his staff,
campaign officials said. Eileen Long, the chief of staff to Lt.
Gov. Mary Donohue and the daughter of Michael Long, the chairman of
the Conservative Party, will be political director; Patrick
McCarthy, a communications and legislative aide to Pataki, will be
deputy communications director; and Carlyle Gregory, a longtime
consultant to Lazio, will be a political consultant.

9 HORSES REPORTED DEAD IN STABLE FIRE  

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At least nine horses died Friday night when a fire
broke out in a Brooklyn stable, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Vito Berretta, a Fire Department spokesman, said the roof of
Bergen Beach Stables, a wood-frame building in the Bergen Beach
neighborhood, collapsed during the fire. He said nine horses were
confirmed dead, and at least four others escaped safely. Usually
there are about 25 horses in the stable, but there might have been
fewer on a weekend, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was reported shortly before midnight and extinguished
about 1 a.m., Berretta said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fire was unknown.

PEREZ IMPRESSIVE, BUT DODGERS LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The more the plan seems laid out and ready to be
executed, the better left-hander Carlos Perez performs, and in the
process throwing said plan out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   With right-hander Orel Hershiser pitching 65 miles away in the
minor leagues and lying in wait to rejoin the Dodgers, and perhaps
their starting rotation, Perez went out and had his best outing of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Perez allowed a season-low one run on three hits in seven
innings, only to have Antonio Osuna waste it with his third
straight bad outing. Olmedo Saenz hit a two-run homer in the eighth
off Osuna to lift the Oakland A's to a 3-1 win over the Dodgers at
Dodger Stadium on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame to waste such a great effort by Carlos,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said. ``It was his best performance of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers wasted a glorious chance to break the tie in the
seventh inning. Alex Cora led off with a double and Dave Hansen,
pinch hitting for Perez, walked. They moved up a base on F.P.
Santangelo's sacrifice bunt, but Jeff Tam relieved and struck out
Mark Grudzielanek looking and got Gary Sheffield to fly out to
center field to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a free-swinging guy (Grudzielanek) up there and he
didn't take the bat off his shoulder,'' Santangelo said. ``Draw
your own conclusions. Grudz hacks every at-bat. He's up swinging in
that situation. He's one of the best hitters on our team, if not
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the eighth, Osuna (0-3) walked Jason Giambi with
two outs to set up Saenz's homer. It's a continuation of a horrible
stretch for Osuna. He's allowed five runs, walked eight and hit a
batter in his last three appearances, totaling 3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   And Osuna's demise didn't make Perez feel any better. Perez has
left three of his starts with a lead only to have the bullpen
falter, which is why he wanted to continue pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to keep going,'' said Perez, who's pitched at least
six innings in seven of his last eight starts. ``When Cora got a
double, I was going to get a good pitch and bunt. But he took me
out. He's the manager. He made the decision. There's nothing I can
say about it. I don't know why he took me out. ... I wish I could
go up and pitch the eighth and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Tam (1-2) struck out four in 1 innings of relief for the win and
right-hander Jason Isringhausen pitched the ninth for his 15th
save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, Carlos was pitching such a strong game, I was
going to let him hit,'' Johnson said. ``Cora leads off with the
double, I had to go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez's outing throws a kink, though maybe only temporarily,
into what the Dodgers were thinking of doing. They're still likely
to recall Hershiser for the upcoming series against Arizona, but
instead of joining the starting rotation he'll go to the bullpen,
which he should be better prepared to do this time around.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Hershiser wound up with Single-A San Bernardino
because he was having trouble adjusting to his role in the bullpen.
When he tried it earlier this season, Hershiser had a 15.18 ERA in
four relief outings.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser was supposed to start today for the Stampede, but his
start was pushed up a day, making for a nifty safety net in case
Perez was rocked by the A's. Hershiser, who allowed three runs on
six hits in four-plus innings against the Mudville Nine, could've
stepped into Perez's spot in the rotation Wednesday against Arizona
if Perez failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Perez was sensational and should face the left-handed
dominated Diamondbacks, not to mention left-hander Randy Johnson.
Of course, Perez already defeated Atlanta's Greg Maddux earlier
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to do my job,'' said Perez, who didn't allow a hit
until Miguel Tejada's two-out double in the fifth. ``I still
believe in my team. I'm glad with my outing.''

OTHER LAKERS FILL KOBE VOID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Let's get one thing straight: No one here is
saying the Los Angeles Lakers welcomed the opportunity to play Game
2 of the NBA Finals Friday night at Staples Center without Kobe
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   But there was an opportunity there for the fellows who usually
toil in the shadow of the thought that the Lakers are a two-man
team, or even a one-man team when that one man is The Big Flagrant
Foul, Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   On a night the state of Indiana will rue as an opportunity lost,
it was Glen Rice, Ron Harper and other Lakers who stepped up large
after Bryant went out of the game late in the first quarter with a
sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice made five of six 3-pointers en route to 21 points. Ron
Harper had a season-high 21 points and an array of eight field
goals that came from baseline jumpers and some age-defying drives,
and all that was in addition to six assists and his usual
claustrophobiic defensive play.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry and Brian Shaw added only 11 points between them,
but Horry had six rebounds and four blocks and Shaw seven assists
while eating up 65 minutes of playing time.
</P>
<P>
   While the biggest headlines today will still deal with Bryant's
availability for the rest of the series and another prodigious
night for O'Neal, this was a win seized and insured by the other
fellows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys came into the locker room at halftime, and they all
talked about stepping up,'' Bryant said. ``Harp went back to
Cleveland mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper averaged 20 points a game with the Cavs in his first four
years in the league, before becoming a defensive specialist with
the Bulls. Phil Jackson even joked with Harper before the game,
asking him not to miss any shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow I found some energy. I just came out and did the
things I had to do,'' said Harper, who seemed to unnerve the Pacers
defense with all of his unexpected touches. ``We are a team that is
trying to do something here. When a guy gets hurt, we have guys who
can step up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kobe is out, there are some special things we do,''
Jackson said. ``He likes to penetrate, and Harp picked some of that
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The sight of Rice stepping up shouldn't have surprised anyone,
although Pacers coach Larry Bird said he didn't think Rice would be
as active as he was. In the season's first 15 games, played without
Bryant, Rice averaged 18 points a game, three more than his average
for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people see me as the third option,'' Rice said.
``Without Kobe, there seems to be more things happening for me out
there. When we swing the ball around like we did tonight, it's
going to create open looks for people.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rice is most dangerous when he knows the ball is coming his
way. He's a rhythm shooter (aren't they all?). But Friday, he took
his game to another level by often driving to the basket once he
got the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Now that had to be surprising. ``When Glen gets going, he's very
hard to guard,'' Bryant said. ``And then when he takes it to the
paint, he's even more dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people will remember this game for the 39 free throws
O'Neal shot, a NBA record, and for the Pacers lapsing into the
Hack-a-Shaq strategy that is flawed in general and of no use to the
aesthetics of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq, who finished with 40 points and 24 rebounds, started
missing nine of his first 11 free throws, but he was better than
.500 thereafter. The fourth quarter, which lasted 45 minutes, was
an abomination, with the Pacers committing 16 fouls and Shaq taking
16 free throws (and the Lakers 27).
</P>
<P>
   When the Staples Center music director ordered up Queen's ``We
will rock you,'' one was urged to change the words to ``We will
foul you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to win a game. If it takes four hours, then it
takes four hours,'' Bird said. ``When the game is that tight, and
there's four or five minutes left and it seems your only
opportunity ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq is a handful. Two or three guys can't stop him. When you
have a guy that quick moving in and out, you just can't defend him
very well. We played hard, but Shaq was better. We're not getting
any post points. They're beating us up inside and we're trying to
live on jumps shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaq takes the fouls as a sign of respect you can't stop me, you
can only hope to foul me. He felt that way, too, about the flagrant
foul that was called on him when Travis Best drove the lane and
Shaq knocked the 5-11 guard into Pacoima.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand the rules,'' he said. ``Guys grab me and
throw me to the ground. But when a little guy in a sports car hits
the wall, it's a flagrant foul (on Shaq). I guess they figure I'm
big enough and can take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Kobe to perhaps put Shaq and the Pacer dilemma into
easy and inevitable terms: ``Shaq was Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   There's little reason for the Pacers to look forward to Games3,
4 and (maybe) 5 at home, other than sleeping in their own beds.
They couldn't overcome the Lakers on a night when Kobe was idle,
and Hack-a-Shaq fizzled. The Lakers are supremely confident that
they can take the Pacers' best shot.
</P>
<P>
   And they're not even getting it. Outside of Jalen Rose and
Austin Croshere, the Santa Monica Crossroads High product, everyone
else is having a bad series. Reggie Miller is in a serious funk. He
scored 21 points, but didn't have a field goal in the final
quarter. It looked like Reggie didn't want the ball, which is truly
rare.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, both Miller and Rose disagreed with the Hack-a-Shaq
strategy. If all that isn't a sign that the Lakers' stars _ all of
them, and not just Kobe and Shaq _ are aligned properly, then we're
all looking in the wrong solar system.

<P>
   The last few weeks have been unusually acrid in the Senate, with
rhetorical eye-gouging more typical of the fractious House of
Representatives than the stately Senate. The low point came on May
17, when Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and Tom
Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, lobbed verbal
volleys at each other in an angry, arm-waving screaming match on
the Senate floor, largely over the right of the Democratic minority
to offer its legislative priorities as amendments to unrelated
bills. Legislative gridlock ensued.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate returned last week from a 10-day recess, both
leaders seemed a tad chastened by their outburst. Like a married
couple after a bad fight, Lott and Daschle began patching things
up, trading olive branches in the form of legislative wish lists
for the remaining days before the August recess.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Senate approved a major campaign finance
measure last week (though it rejected a bill to overhaul the
nation's managed care system). Nonetheless, both sides concede that
the truce is shaky, and that the next partisan breakdown could be
just around the corner. Let's eavesdrop on the spitting match that
launched a thousand insults.
</P>
<P>
   By ERIC SCHMITT
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) It all started after Republicans and
Democrats passed a pair of dueling symbolic votes on gun safety.
Republicans at first tried to block their rivals' resolution, but
relented after Democrats complained that Lott was stifling debate,
the mother's milk of senatorial life. The senator begged to differ.
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   There were a number of things said earlier today on which I just
bit my lip and took it because I thought, for the greater good of
the chamber, we should get an agreement and move forward. . . . I
also feel personally maligned ((dramatic pause for emphasis)) and I
do not appreciate it. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) At this point, Lott's voice rises in anger.
His face is taut and he starts waving his left arm toward Daschle,
who is standing a few feet to his left. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I do not think we have any God-given rights in this institution.
We all have certain rights, and I am going to work to protect those
rights. . . . I am getting really tired of people questioning my
commitment to the Senate and to the opportunity for debates. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I tell you, what I am trying to do is find a way for the Senate
to do its work. These charges that are leveled against me are
nonsense. . . . People talk about that civility has broken down,
and there is acrimony. That is ridiculous. I think we have a very
good relationship here. . . . What it is really all about is
getting the work of the Senate done, dealing with real bills and
real issues, not playing games. . . .
</P>
<P>
   As far as order and comity, I support that. I am going to do
everything I can to continue to support that. But I think for us to
have basically one, two, three, four days tied up having debate on
gun amendments instead of having debate on Kosovo and the military
construction appropriations bill is not the way we should be
operating. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Lott holds his folded speech in his hand,
sounding mortally wounded. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I have to go on the record saying I do believe I have been
maligned unfairly. I have bent over backward to try to give notice
when we were going to call up a bill and to have cooperation with
the Democratic leadership to make sure senators had a chance to
make their case.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Lott's final salvo drips with sarcasm. (END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   But to come in here and think we have to have a right to offer
non-germane amendments to every appropriations bill that comes
through, and then criticize us for not getting our work done _ Oh,
boy, that is really smart, really smart.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we demand our rights to offer our issues. By the way, why
aren't you guys getting those bills done? I do not believe the
American people are being fooled by all of this.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Having said his piece, Lott yields to
Daschle, who begins calmly, smiling. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Let me say the majority leader was able to get some things off
his chest. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I will tell you this. The way the Senate is being run is wrong.
No majority leader in history has attempted to constrain Senate
debate as aggressively as Senator Lott has chosen to do. . . . That
is his right. He has chosen the way he runs the Senate. I think he
is doing that for what many believe is a laudatory reason. He is
trying to protect his members so they don't have to vote on tough
issues. . . . But no majority leader has ever gone to the extent
that he has. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The usually placid Daschle starts chopping
the air for emphasis, and his voice rises in anger. (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Why do we want to have a debate on amendments? Because that is
the only ability for the minority to express itself. . . . The
majority leader has phrased it very interestingly. He said: I don't
want all these amendments to cause trouble. The more they cause
trouble, the more in jeopardy the bills will be. . . . Over and
over and over and over again, we are told that is the way it is
going to be.
</P>
<P>
   One of our colleagues the other day said it is like the frog
sitting in a pot of water who doesn't notice that the water keeps
getting hotter and ultimately the frog boils to death. Well, the
water continues to heat, and we are slowly boiling to death,
procedurally. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I hope, when we are in the majority, we understand the rights of
the minority. I will admonish my colleagues to do that. But this is
getting to be more and more a second House of Representatives. This
is getting to be more and more a gagged body. This has nothing to
do with the traditions of the Senate that I admired when I became a
senator. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The senator then delivers an ultimatum.
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   We have drawn the line. We are not going to be conducting
business as we have in the last several months. That is over. That
is behind us. We can do it the Senate way, or we are not going to
do it at all.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Daschle stops. Lott, looking down at his
lectern, exasperated, lashes back. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   If that is the way it is going to be, then that is the way it is
going to be. . . . I am not going to be threatened and intimidated
by the minority in trying to get our work done. If you want to go
through this approach, if you want to shut down everything, then
everybody loses in the process.
</P>
<P>
   We can cooperate and we can get these bills done. . . . But on
both sides, we have senators who want to offer things that will
cause mischief and delay or kill a bill.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Lott quickly shifts from a stern lecturing
voice to a scold. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I have tried to avoid having an acrimonious relationship. Maybe
it is unavoidable in this election year, but I think that would be
a shame for the American people because, after all, that is about
whom we should be thinking. . . .
</P>
<P>
   But if we are going to hold our breath, turn red in the face and
threaten, then that is the way it will be. But everybody needs to
understand that in that kind of relationship nobody wins; everybody
loses.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Daschle, noticeably calmer, slips on his
glasses and wraps things up with a flourish. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Let me just say no one wants to stomp their feet and get red in
the face _ certainly not me. That is not my style. If it has
happened, it is only because the frustration level continues to
mount. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I am not trying to get excited here. But let me just say as
softly and sincerely as I can: That is not cooperation. That is a
Senate version of dictatorship that I think is unacceptable.

His face is taut and he starts waving his left arm toward Daschle,
who is standing a few feet to his left. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I do not think we have any God-given rights in this institution.
We all have certain rights, and I am going to work to protect those
rights. . . . I am getting really tired of people questioning my
commitment to the Senate and to the opportunity for debates. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I tell you, what I am trying to do is find a way for the Senate
to do its work. These charges that are leveled against me are
nonsense. . . . People talk about that civility has broken down,
and there is acrimony. That is ridiculous. I think we have a very
good relationship here. . . . What it is really all about is
getting the work of the Senate done, dealing with real bills and
real issues, not playing games. . . .
</P>
<P>
   As far as order and comity, I support that. I am going to do
everything I can to continue to support that. But I think for us to
have basically one, two, three, four days tied up having debate on
gun amendments instead of having debate on Kosovo and the military
construction appropriations bill is not the way we should be
operating. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Lott holds his folded speech in his hand,
sounding mortally wounded. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I have to go on the record saying I do believe I have been
maligned unfairly. I have bent over backward to try to give notice
when we were going to call up a bill and to have cooperation with
the Democratic leadership to make sure senators had a chance to
make their case.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Lott's final salvo drips with sarcasm. (END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   But to come in here and think we have to have a right to offer
non-germane amendments to every appropriations bill that comes
through, and then criticize us for not getting our work done _ Oh,
boy, that is really smart, really smart.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we demand our rights to offer our issues. By the way, why
aren't you guys getting those bills done? I do not believe the
American people are being fooled by all of this.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Having said his piece, Lott yields to
Daschle, who begins calmly, smiling. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Let me say the majority leader was able to get some things off
his chest. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I will tell you this. The way the Senate is being run is wrong.
No majority leader in history has attempted to constrain Senate
debate as aggressively as Senator Lott has chosen to do. . . . That
is his right. He has chosen the way he runs the Senate. I think he
is doing that for what many believe is a laudatory reason. He is
trying to protect his members so they don't have to vote on tough
issues. . . . But no majority leader has ever gone to the extent
that he has. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The usually placid Daschle starts chopping
the air for emphasis, and his voice rises in anger. (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Why do we want to have a debate on amendments? Because that is
the only ability for the minority to express itself. . . . The
majority leader has phrased it very interestingly. He said: I don't
want all these amendments to cause trouble. The more they cause
trouble, the more in jeopardy the bills will be. . . . Over and
over and over and over again, we are told that is the way it is
going to be.
</P>
<P>
   One of our colleagues the other day said it is like the frog
sitting in a pot of water who doesn't notice that the water keeps
getting hotter and ultimately the frog boils to death. Well, the
water continues to heat, and we are slowly boiling to death,
procedurally. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I hope, when we are in the majority, we understand the rights of
the minority. I will admonish my colleagues to do that. But this is
getting to be more and more a second House of Representatives. This
is getting to be more and more a gagged body. This has nothing to
do with the traditions of the Senate that I admired when I became a
senator. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The senator then delivers an ultimatum.
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   We have drawn the line. We are not going to be conducting
business as we have in the last several months. That is over. That
is behind us. We can do it the Senate way, or we are not going to
do it at all.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Daschle stops. Lott, looking down at his
lectern, exasperated, lashes back. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   If that is the way it is going to be, then that is the way it is
going to be. . . . I am not going to be threatened and intimidated
by the minority in trying to get our work done. If you want to go
through this approach, if you want to shut down everything, then
everybody loses in the process.
</P>
<P>
   We can cooperate and we can get these bills done. . . . But on
both sides, we have senators who want to offer things that will
cause mischief and delay or kill a bill.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Lott quickly shifts from a stern lecturing
voice to a scold. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I have tried to avoid having an acrimonious relationship. Maybe
it is unavoidable in this election year, but I think that would be
a shame for the American people because, after all, that is about
whom we should be thinking. . . .
</P>
<P>
   But if we are going to hold our breath, turn red in the face and
threaten, then that is the way it will be. But everybody needs to
understand that in that kind of relationship nobody wins; everybody
loses.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Daschle, noticeably calmer, slips on his
glasses and wraps things up with a flourish. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Let me just say no one wants to stomp their feet and get red in
the face _ certainly not me. That is not my style. If it has
happened, it is only because the frustration level continues to
mount. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I am not trying to get excited here. But let me just say as
softly and sincerely as I can: That is not cooperation. That is a
Senate version of dictatorship that I think is unacceptable.

   WASHINGTON _ Name recognition was never cheap, but this year it
has become more expensive than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Spending at a clip of $300,000 a day, an unknown Wall Street
multimillionaire introduced himself this spring to the voters of
New Jersey. And last week, after investing a record $35 million
(all of it his own money), Jon Corzine won the Democratic primary
for the seat being vacated by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, another
multimillionaire who used his personal fortune as a launching pad
to the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's victory over former Gov. Jim Florio is the most recent
reminder that in America these days, candidates must spend enormous
sums _ either their own, or money they have collected _ if they
hope to have even a remote chance to be elected to Congress or the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   It is nearly impossible for candidates to win armed only with
ideas but little or no money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds corny, but you have to scratch your head and
wonder how would Abraham Lincoln or Harry Truman have functioned in
today's money-takes-all environment,'' asked Charles Lewis,
executive director of the Center for Public Integrity. ``Americans
have two choices _ we can either elect rich, bored
multimillionaires or plastic figures, with perpetual smiles on
their faces who are bought and paid for by special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. who is
worth an estimated $400 million, shattered all spending records for
a Senate primary. He spent $141.50 for each of his 247,351 votes,
an amount that experts say is extraordinarily high. His opponent,
Florio, spent a meager (by comparison) $2.5 million, or $13.89 a
vote. Florio repeatedly accused Corzine of trying to ``buy the
election'' by spending ``obscene'' sums. But Corzine defended his
expenditures as necessary for a political novice running against a
household name like Florio's.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional campaign's largest expense is media commercials.
Because New Jersey has no widely watched television stations of its
own, candidates are forced to advertise on stations in New York
City, the nation's most expensive media market, and Philadelphia,
the nation's fourth most expensive market.
</P>
<P>
   To put Corzine's $35 million war chest in context, he spent
nearly as much in his primary bid as the  &UR; combined total &LR;  spent in
1998 by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and the challenger who unseated him,
Charles Schumer. At the time, it was the most expensive Senate race
in New York history, though the record will most likely be broken
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Corzine's jaw-dropping spending spree should not come as
much of a surprise in a year when Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has
already spent a record $82 million to win the Republican
presidential nomination and experts estimate that a record $3
billion will be spent on the 2000 presidential and congressional
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious why the regular person doesn't even bother to
run,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21 and former
president of Common Cause, who helped shape the post-Watergate laws
that govern today's campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gulf between winning well-financed candidates and their
underfinanced opponents just continues to grow,'' Wertheimer said.
``And that gulf greatly narrows the pool of individuals in this
country who are prepared to become candidates. Any potential
candidate is faced with the huge costs of campaigns, the big
advantage your incumbent opponent starts out with in terms of
surplus funds and the fact that the only place you can turn to is
personal wealth or donors who want something in return.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 94 incumbents in the House of Representatives ran
unopposed, the highest number in 40 years. An additional 114
incumbents ran against challengers who had raised less than
$25,000, a study by Common Cause found. For all practical purposes,
nearly half of the House races in 1998 involved incumbents who ran
unopposed or with no threat of losing. In Florida, 18 of the 23
House incumbents seeking re-election ran unopposed, including 12
Republicans and six Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   This year, political strategists say only three dozen highly
contested House races are likely, or for less than 10 percent of
the 435 seats. The experts attribute the few competitive races to
the extraordinary advantage that the current campaign finance
system gives to incumbents, who can raise money with relative ease.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves only self-financed candidates with the ability to
get in the game. Candidates who spend millions of their own money
lose more often than they win.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Michael Huffington poured nearly $30 million _ almost
all of it his own money _ into his unsuccessful bid to defeat
Dianne Feinstein for a U.S. Senate seat in California. And Al
Checchi, a California airline executive, set the record for any
statewide primary when he spent $38 million of his fortune in his
failed gubernatorial bid in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely do candidates who are outspent by wide margins win. But
in a House race on New York's Long Island in 1992, Rick Lazio
unseated incumbent Rep. Thomas J. Downey, even though Lazio was
outspent by a 5-to-1 margin. Downey was hurt _ and Lazio was helped
_ by Downey's overdrafts at the House bank.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to judge if Corzine's victory was attributable
more to his $35 million investment or New Jersey voters' disgust
with Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase as governor in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In the general election, Corzine will go against Bob Franks, a
four-term Republican congressman from Union County. In his victory
speech last week, Franks borrowed a line of Florio's to begin his
campaign against Corzine: ``Good evening, New Jersey, I'm Bob
Franks, the candidate with experience that money can't buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, for his part, will continue to add to his spending
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center
for Responsive Politics, ``when you've broken the record for the
most spending ever and there's still five months to go until
November, you've left the stratosphere and entered the
ionosphere.''

   Gore Fires First in Soft-Money Offensive
</P>
<P>
   The subject was helping people afford prescription drugs. But
the object was getting Vice President Al Gore a promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is taking them on,'' the announcer declared,
``fighting for a Medicare prescription drug benefit for seniors
like Bob Darthez.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Darthez, a 74-year-old Medicare recipient, were the
star players in the first national commercial of the general
election, a 30-second spot by the Democratic National Committee
that ran this weekend in 15 states, including Michigan, Illinois,
Pennsylvania and Ohio, all considered especially decisive this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the advertising offensive that runs until the
conventions in late July and August will cost them at least $25
million. Some of that will be paid with soft money, the
unrestricted donations that corporations, individuals and unions
can make to the parties.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 14 e-mail message, Gore had challenged Gov. George W.
Bush to a bilateral ban on the use of soft money to pay for issue
commercials. So Republicans were only too happy to point out that
the vice president was the first to go back on the offer. But Gore
asserted that he could not be bound by a proposal that Bush had
rejected. (The exchange occurred just as the Senate was approving a
campaign finance reform measure, imposing financial disclosure
requirements on tax-exempt special interest groups that raise and
spend money secretly on political activities.)
</P>
<P>
   At week's end, the Republicans were preparing to unveil their
own ``party-building'' ads on behalf of Bush, to run in all the
states in which Gore and Darthez are appearing.
</P>
<P>
   For all the rancor over campaign spending, however, Republicans
were making plans for a national party convention in Philadelphia
that is to feature a lot more celebration than denigration. The
convention's traditional ``attack'' night, reserved for giving the
rival candidate a pasting, will be replaced with unending hurrahs
for the party's standard-bearer, Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each night will have a positive discussion of Governor Bush's
proposals,'' said Karen P. Hughes, Bush's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, one long feel-good commercial.
</P>

<P>
   High-Priced Humble Pie &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton moved from Portugal to Germany to Russia
to Ukraine on his European tour, he tried to dispel the notion of
the United States as a global bully. In Aachen, Germany, he said
that if it hadn't been for Europe, ``there never would have been an
America in the first place.'' In Moscow, he promised that the
United States would never dictate to Russia how it should behave.
</P>
<P>
   But he has learned the hard way that Europeans don't like it
when America fails to lead on critical issues _ as it failed, for
example, early in the Bosnia war. So even as Clinton laced his
oratory with humility, he was also telling his audiences precisely
what America wanted them to do _ in trade, in defense, in nuclear
security and, in the cases of Russia and Ukraine, in political and
economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one thing Americans were telling others to do was to
underwrite most of the cost of the major arms control achievement
of the Clinton trip: an agreement for the United States and Russia
to each dispose of 34 metric tons of their surplus weapons-grade
plutonium. Only a small fraction of the $5.75 billion cost has been
raised and unless other countries contribute, the agreement will
not be implemented.

   AT&AMP;T Backs Off Increase in Phone Rates
</P>
<P>
   Temporarily giving in to pressure from consumer groups and
embarrassed regulators, AT&AMP;T put off a planned increase in phone
rates for millions of consumers who subscribe to its basic rate
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement followed the disclosure that some rates would
go up, even though earlier in the month AT&AMP;T and the Federal
Communications Commission had promised that the nation's largest
long-distance carrier would pass on savings from a reduction in the
access rates that the company pays to local telephone companies.

   Curbs on Bug Spray
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners, exterminators and hardware stores scrambled to read
the fine print on bug-spray labels after the Environmental
Protection Agency announced that chlorpyrifos, one of the most
popular ingredients in household insecticides, would be banned for
home, lawn and garden use.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA found that chlorpyrifos, also known by the trade names
Dursban and Lorsban, caused brain damage in newborn rats and an
unacceptable rate of ailments in children. Manufacturers agreed to
stop making the chemical for uses outside farms by the end of the
year, and agreed to curtail its use on grapes, apples and tomatoes.

   Gore Fires First in Soft-Money Offensive
</P>
<P>
   The subject was helping people afford prescription drugs. But
the object was getting Vice President Al Gore a promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is taking them on,'' the announcer declared,
``fighting for a Medicare prescription drug benefit for seniors
like Bob Darthez.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Darthez, a 74-year-old Medicare recipient, were the
star players in the first national commercial of the general
election, a 30-second spot by the Democratic National Committee
that ran this weekend in 15 states, including Michigan, Illinois,
Pennsylvania and Ohio, all considered especially decisive this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the advertising offensive that runs until the
conventions in late July and August will cost them at least $25
million. Some of that will be paid with soft money, the
unrestricted donations that corporations, individuals and unions
can make to the parties.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 14 e-mail message, Gore had challenged Gov. George W.
Bush to a bilateral ban on the use of soft money to pay for issue
commercials. So Republicans were only too happy to point out that
the vice president was the first to go back on the offer. But Gore
asserted that he could not be bound by a proposal that Bush had
rejected. (The exchange occurred just as the Senate was approving a
campaign finance reform measure, imposing financial disclosure
requirements on tax-exempt special interest groups that raise and
spend money secretly on political activities.)
</P>
<P>
   At week's end, the Republicans were preparing to unveil their
own ``party-building'' ads on behalf of Bush, to run in all the
states in which Gore and Darthez are appearing.
</P>
<P>
   For all the rancor over campaign spending, however, Republicans
were making plans for a national party convention in Philadelphia
that is to feature a lot more celebration than denigration. The
convention's traditional ``attack'' night, reserved for giving the
rival candidate a pasting, will be replaced with unending hurrahs
for the party's standard-bearer, Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each night will have a positive discussion of Governor Bush's
proposals,'' said Karen P. Hughes, Bush's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, one long feel-good commercial.

   High-Priced Humble Pie &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton moved from Portugal to Germany to Russia
to Ukraine on his European tour, he tried to dispel the notion of
the United States as a global bully. In Aachen, Germany, he said
that if it hadn't been for Europe, ``there never would have been an
America in the first place.'' In Moscow, he promised that the
United States would never dictate to Russia how it should behave.
</P>
<P>
   But he has learned the hard way that Europeans don't like it
when America fails to lead on critical issues _ as it failed, for
example, early in the Bosnia war. So even as Clinton laced his
oratory with humility, he was also telling his audiences precisely
what America wanted them to do _ in trade, in defense, in nuclear
security and, in the cases of Russia and Ukraine, in political and
economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one thing Americans were telling others to do was to
underwrite most of the cost of the major arms control achievement
of the Clinton trip: an agreement for the United States and Russia
to each dispose of 34 metric tons of their surplus weapons-grade
plutonium. Only a small fraction of the $5.75 billion cost has been
raised and unless other countries contribute, the agreement will
not be implemented.

   AT&AMP;T Backs Off Increase in Phone Rates
</P>
<P>
   Temporarily giving in to pressure from consumer groups and
embarrassed regulators, AT&AMP;T put off a planned increase in phone
rates for millions of consumers who subscribe to its basic rate
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement followed the disclosure that some rates would
go up, even though earlier in the month AT&AMP;T and the Federal
Communications Commission had promised that the nation's largest
long-distance carrier would pass on savings from a reduction in the
access rates that the company pays to local telephone companies.

   Curbs on Bug Spray
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners, exterminators and hardware stores scrambled to read
the fine print on bug-spray labels after the Environmental
Protection Agency announced that chlorpyrifos, one of the most
popular ingredients in household insecticides, would be banned for
home, lawn and garden use.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA found that chlorpyrifos, also known by the trade names
Dursban and Lorsban, caused brain damage in newborn rats and an
unacceptable rate of ailments in children. Manufacturers agreed to
stop making the chemical for uses outside farms by the end of the
year, and agreed to curtail its use on grapes, apples and tomatoes.

   Congo Death Toll
</P>
<P>
   A leading refugee agency said two years of warfare in eastern
Congo have caused the deaths of more than 1.7 million people. Many
of them died from hunger and malaria after fleeing the fighting,
according to the agency, the International Rescue Committee. The
survey, conducted in April and May, put the death toll in a
five-province area at 18 million people.

   Perot May Not Run
</P>
<P>
   In his quest for the Reform Party's presidential nomination, Pat
Buchanan got a major lift when a spokesman for Ross Perot, the
party's founder and two-time nominee, said Perot had all but
decided not to seek the nomination this year.
</P>
<P>
   That's bad news for Buchanan's opponents, who fear he will
impose his conservative social views on a party that has taken no
official position on such issues. John Hagelin of the Natural Law
Party, which favors across-the-board government reform, is
preparing to fight Buchanan for the nomination.

   Hurdle for Abortion Pill
</P>
<P>
   The French abortion pill's long and convoluted journey to the
United States took another turn, with the news that the Food and
Drug Administration is considering tight restrictions on the drug,
RU-486, including a requirement that only doctors who perform
surgical abortions prescribe it.
</P>
<P>
   Though preliminary, the plan outraged abortion rights advocates,
who say it would defeat the purpose of the pill: to provide easy
access to abortion in the privacy of the doctor's office.

   Lewis Charges Dropped
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Atlanta dismissed murder charges against Ray
Lewis, the Baltimore Ravens' all-pro linebacker. Instead, Lewis
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of obstruction of justice _
the result of his misleading statements to the police _ and
accepted a sentence of 12 months of probation.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 25, had been charged, along with two friends, in the
stabbing deaths of two men during a street brawl outside a
nightclub on the night of the Super Bowl in Atlanta in January. The
trial of the co-defendants is continuing.

   Discrimination on Wall Street
</P>
<P>
   Even Wall Street traders who make $1 million a year can be
victims of sex discrimination in the workplace, the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission declared after taking up a
complaint against Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Paving the way for lawsuits, the commission said the firm had
discriminated against women who worked in its institutional stocks
division and had retaliated against a trader, Allison K.
Schieffelin, for complaining publicly. The firm denied the charges.

   Support for a Cosmic Theory
</P>
<P>
   The terrain in Earth's corner of the cosmos has become a lot
clearer. At a meeting of the American Astronomical Society,
scientists described measurements of the distances to 100,000
galaxies, all lying within a few billion light years of Earth and
its galaxy, the Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
   The galaxies revealed colossal structures the scientists likened
to cosmic continents. Cosmologists were pleased to see that, just
as their theories of cosmic origins predicted, the survey found
these continents to have a maximum size _ a limit they call ``the
end of greatness.''

   Ending a Royal Chill
</P>
<P>
   The curtsy and the garden party chat took only a moment, but
they ended two decades of enforced silence between Queen Elizabeth
II and Camilla Parker Bowles, mistress to Prince Charles. By
agreeing to attend a formal luncheon at her 51-year-old son's
country estate with full knowledge of just which 52-year-old
divorced woman would be by his side, the monarch signaled her
acceptance of the relationship that the heir to the throne had long
sought.

   Laser Shoots Down Missile
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, when politics thrust laser-based missile defenses
into the spotlight, the technology was clearly not up to the job.
Now it has caught up a bit: A laser designed to protect Israel's
northern border blew up a small rocket in flight during a test at
the Army's White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Supporters said
the success showed that a national missile defense was no longer
unthinkable.

   Shorter Lives for Americans
</P>
<P>
   By most demographic estimates, an American born in the last year
or two should live, on average, to nearly 77. But the World Health
Organization, using a new calculation, has lowered the figure for
``healthy life expectancy'' to 70 because of the risks faced by
Americans, particularly men _ smoking and violence are high on the
list.

<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, June 11:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   PUTIN-EUROPE (Moscow) _ President Vladimir Putin had barely said
farewell to President Clinton this week before the Russian leader
and his top aides fanned out across Europe to campaign against the
American plan for a national missile defense. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ENGLAND-SOCCER-THUGS (London) _ It was the English who first
formalized rules for the sport called ``the beautiful game,'' but
England is less known these days for the gracefulness its athletes
show on the soccer field than for the ugliness its rabid supporters
cause off it. As a reflection of what a serious national matter
soccer hooliganism has become for England, the responsibility for
combating it has been assigned to the top-level intelligence agency
that was created in 1992 to combat organized crime, international
drug dealing, money laundering, immigration fraud and
counterfeiting. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   FIJI-SCENE (Nadi, Fiji) _ On approximately 299 and two-thirds of
its 300 islands, there are no indications that Fiji is in turmoil,
with rebels occupying Parliament and holding three dozen hostages
who include the elected prime minister, much of his Cabinet and the
daughter of the country's president. As Brad Ammann, a 29-year-old
honeymooner from Hermosa Beach, Calif., put it: ``The only sign
there's a coup going on is that there's nobody around.'' By Sam
Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-FOX (Mexico City) _ To his opponents Vicente Fox, who is
mounting the most serious challenge to Mexico's governing party in
a presidential election in 70 years, is a political chameleon who
talks out of both sides of his mouth. To his supporters, he is a
clever strategist who has built strength well beyond his small
rightist party by defying ideological labels. Whatever the case, it
is clear that by pairing conservative credentials with a
center-left position on a range of issues Fox has succeeded in
attracting supporters from across the political landscape. By Sam
Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-AIDS (Johannesburg, South Africa) _ Endowed with a
constitution that has been called an international model and beset
by an AIDS crisis that is among the worst in the world, South
Africa finds itself trying to reconcile the two in the face of a
challenge here to the longstanding practice of disqualifying gay
men from giving blood. By Henri E. Cauvin.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-WOMEN (Undated) _ Five years after a watershed conference
held in Beijing articulated and affirmed what more than 180 nations
could agree were the universal rights of women, a week-long
follow-up meeting ended Saturday at the United Nations with no
significant victories for opponents who have spent the last five
years trying to reverse those gains. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   OBIT-ASSAD (Undated) _ Syrian President Hafez Assad died
Saturday, a Lebanese doctor with close ties to the Assad family
says. (Summary from wires.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   RACE-TV-DRAMA (Baltimore) _ Who Gets to Tell a Black Story?:
When David Simon proposed to HBO a television series based on his
book, ``The Corner,'' about black inner-city drug addicts, he was
not thinking much about the fact that he was white. But as the
project began to take shape, the issues of race loomed ever larger.
HBO was not about to make a series about black drug addicts created
by, as one HBO executive put it later, ``a bunch of white guys.''
Charles S. Dutton, who had grown up in the city, spent his early
years on its streets and had his own tale of redemption, was chosen
to direct all six episodes. But, as he said, there would not be one
moment when he would forget that ``it's a white writer and a white
producer and it's HBO and a black director.'' By Janny Scott.
</P>
<P>
   MASS-HEALTH-REFERENDUM (Boston) _ With one final petition drive
this weekend, a coalition of physicians, nurses, senior citizens'
groups, labor unions and others are expected to gather the last
several thousand signatures they need to put before Massachusetts
voters what experts call the most sweeping health-care referendum
on any state's ballot this fall. The referendum would require the
Legislature to find a way to provide health insurance coverage for
all by mid-2002 in a state where more than 600,000 people lack it.
It would also introduce a super-powerful ``patient's bill of
rights.'' And it would put a temporary ban on the conversion of
nonprofit hospitals to for-profit. By Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-DEATHROW-LAWYER (Houston) _ On death row at the Terrell
unit of the Texas state prison in Livingston, inmates and death
penalty lawyers refer sardonically to a place they call the Mock
Wing. This metaphorical prison enclave has housed at least a dozen
death row inmates, some already executed, who shared the same
lawyer, Ronald G. Mock. One of Mock's clients, Gary Graham, 36, is
scheduled to die by lethal injection after a 19-year court battle.
In addition to the innocence claim, what makes Graham's case
particularly compelling is that his new lawyers are portraying it
as a textbook example of how bad lawyering sends poor people to
death row. By Sara Rimer and Raymond Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   YESHIVAS-EXPAND (Baltimore) _ Inside Ner Israel Rabbinical
College, the study hall reverberates with the voices of hundreds of
young Orthodox men, debating one-on-one, across tables stacked high
with books of Jewish law and tradition. What is happening here is
part of a growing trend within Orthodox Judaism's most rigorously
traditional sector. The number of collegiate and graduate students
pursuing religious studies in these all-male institutions ``has
probably almost doubled'' since 1980, to about 18,000 nationwide,
writes William B. Helmreich in ``The World of the Yeshiva.'' By
Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP-PAL (Undated) _ On Aug. 27, 1998, Brian L. Buckley, a Los
Angeles lawyer, received an e-mail message from a New York literary
agent, Lucianne Goldberg. Her one-sentence message to him said,
``Someone very important wants to know who you are.'' The important
someone turned out to be Linda Tripp. It turned out that Tripp had
been reading and finding inspiration in Buckley's observations
about the Lewinsky scandal on a conservative, anti-Clinton Internet
site, FreeRepublic.com. In the ensuing months, Buckley and Tripp
began a friendship that blossomed from e-mail messages to telephone
calls. ``She and I are pals by now,'' said Buckley. By Jill
Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   GAY-TEACHER (Newton, Mass.) _ A first-grade teacher who told his
students that he is gay has provoked a debate among parents and
educators here about how soon is too soon to talk about sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-ADS (Undated) _ Responding rapidly to a 15-state
advertising campaign by the Democrats, the Republican Party
unveiled its first national commercial, a spot detailing Gov.
George W. Bush's proposals for overhauling Social Security that
will begin running Monday in 17 states, from New England to the
Pacific Northwest. The swiftness with which the Republican National
Committee is taking to the airwaves is a marked departure from four
years ago, when the Democratic Party began running issue
advertisements on behalf of President Clinton weeks before the
cash-strapped Republicans could start their commercials for their
presidential candidate, Bob Dole. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-HOUSE-FUNDS (Washington) _ Democrats have a financial
advantage in the contest for control of the House of
Representatives. That's right, Democrats. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ High-level attention for state
House seat; Nashville billboards bring smiles to GOP; Congressman
changes ways after a defeat; A spot for LaRouche? No way, party

   His bloody, unappetizing lip notwithstanding, Rep. Rick Lazio's
entry into New York's U.S. Senate race generated a basketful of
valentines in newspapers and magazines describing his pleasing
suburban patina as a big political asset. Not too many articles
said the same thing about New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the
unadulterated '50s guy whom Lazio replaced as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The opponent of these Senate candidates past and present,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, was acclaimed last year in Esquire magazine
for her ``sexy'' mouth _ sexy being an adjective that is normally
problematic for female politicians.
</P>
<P>
   All of which raises some familiar but entertaining questions:
What is the role of good looks in politics? Can a candidate be too
attractive? Too unattractive? What constitutes good looks? Would
some unsightly U.S. presidents of the past, like the 350-pound
William Howard Taft, who installed a massive bathtub in the White
House, be elected today? Does hair help?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hair helps,'' agreed former Gov. Hugh Carey of New York, who
dyed his own.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of experts was consulted on these questions: Michael
Beschloss, presidential historian; David Garth, political
consultant; Mario Cuomo, former governor; Ed Koch, former mayor;
Geraldine Ferraro, former vice presidential candidate; Zenia Mucha,
Gov. George Pataki's chief political aide; Edmund Morris,
presidential biographer; Mark Penn, pollster for the Clintons;
David Granger, editor in chief of Esquire; and Patrick McCarthy,
chairman and editorial director of W and Women's Wear Daily among
others.
</P>
<P>
   They all agreed that bland good looks help in politics, and that
men as much as women are damaged by the ``dumb blond syndrome,''
particularly when questions arise about a candidate's intellectual
heft. As an exasperated Marilyn Quayle said in 1981, shortly after
her husband, Dan, was elected to the Senate, but some years before
he became vice president and misspelled potato: ``There were those
on the campaign trail who would say, `I'm not going to vote for him
because he's running on his looks.' Well, what's he supposed to do
_ put a bag over his face?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, everything changed in U.S. politics after the 1960
Kennedy-Nixon debates and the predominance of television, when
politicians had to at least not physically repel voters. ``These
days, if you're hideous, it does hurt you in politics,'' Beschloss
said. ``A hundred years ago, that wasn't so much the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians wonder whether Grover Cleveland, who was not quite as
fat as Taft but was still deemed unappealing, would have become
president if he had had to appear on ``Meet the Press.'' Even
Abraham Lincoln, whose charisma and presence were unforgettable,
was widely considered ugly and said so himself.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, the biographer of Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan,
said he doubted that Roosevelt would do well on television because
of his ``very high, harsh voice'' and ``gnashing white teeth.'' But
Reagan, he said, had a ``physical beauty'' that was ``a large part
of his power.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, America's standards have changed. How many
people know today that Warren Harding was considered a hunk? Women
of his time certainly thought so. (After Harding died, his
ex-mistress wrote a book describing their lovemaking in a coat
closet of the Oval Office.)
</P>
<P>
   In the present day, Steve Forbes may be one former presidential
candidate who longs for the era of radio. In videotapes of focus
groups that his aides provided last year, a dozen potential voters
could be seen kibitzing around a kitchen table in Iowa about
Forbes' television commercials _ and sometimes suggesting that he
might want to avoid close-ups. ``This is a very superficial
comment, and I hesitate to make it,'' one man said sheepishly.
``But he's not the most attractive or presidential-looking
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Although John F. Kennedy is widely acknowledged to have set the
gold standard in presidential attractiveness, beauty is often in
the eye of the partisan. Republicans like Mucha say that Lazio's
wholesome good looks reflect his youth, energy and enthusiasm _ in
short, a description of a fine senator. But Democrats use words
like ``cute,'' ``boyish'' or ``Little League parent'' to describe
him, implying that Lazio might be a good senator when he grows up.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, a Democrat, also took issue with Lazio's youthful
demeanor, particularly his fall during a Memorial Day parade, which
injured his lip. ``I would like to sit him down and say, `Calm
down,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Attractiveness in women is more complicated. A luscious look is
definitely not good; none of the experts could name any babes
elected except for Jeanine Pirro, the Westchester County, N.Y.,
district attorney who looks great in short skirts.
</P>
<P>
   It is also quite possible to be too rich and too beautiful. In
Garth's view, Bess Myerson, a former Miss America, was hurt by both
her looks and elegant style when she ran for the U.S. Senate in New
York in 1980. ``I think it's tougher for women,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in political trends for women, the chief attribute
is to appear sensibly attractive and mature like Christie Whitman,
Elizabeth Dole and Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy of W gives Clinton especially high marks. ``I'm not
sure who's helping her,'' he said, ``but somebody really good is
helping her.'' McCarthy complimented Clinton for settling on a
look, dark pantsuits, and one hairstyle. The result is that people
have stopped talking about her hair _ a goal of any woman in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy also felt very strongly that a sexy look is
``disastrous'' for politicians because ``it indicates that he or
she has things on the mind other than producing great
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Granger of Esquire felt differently, at least about Clinton. In
his eyes she has considerable sex appeal, which he considers a
positive. ``It's a combination of power and intelligence and the
willingness to wield those weapons unabashedly,'' he said. Still,
it is a sexist axiom of the early 21st century that powerful women,
whether senators or CEO', still don't take on sex appeal as often
as men _ Henry Kissinger in his prime is Exhibit A.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuomo, who frequently joked about how an ugly guy got
elected governor, disagrees with this view. ``I spent 12 years as
governor,'' he said, ``and never felt I had suddenly become
overwhelmingly tempting to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the final consensus of the experts was, naturally, that
looks never matter as much in politics as positions on the issues
or the hard work of campaigning. As Penn summed it up: ``Boring
guys always do better in the end.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is an argument to be made that modern
politics and science fiction have a great deal in common, from
unusual life forms to freaky and largely inexplicable phenomena.
But they are perhaps most similar in this regard: Both exhibit a
peculiar fascination with time travel.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you probably think you are watching the
presidential race of 2000. Wrong. It is really 1988, or at least
that is where many political scientists and Democratic strategists
will transport you. They cite the familiar dynamic of a vice
president (the elder George Bush then, Al Gore now) who belonged to
a successful administration and whose apparent disadvantage against
a heavily promoted governor (Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts then,
George W. Bush of Texas now) turned out to be temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps it is 1960, as other political scientists and
Republican strategists would have you believe. The vice president
(Richard M. Nixon then, Gore now) cannot trade on his
administration's high regard in the face of an upbeat, arguably
more charismatic challenger (John F. Kennedy then, Bush now), who
ultimately prevails.
</P>
<P>
   Any takers for 1992? That was when the administration in power
was challenged and eventually defeated by an intermittently folksy
southerner (Bill Clinton then, Bush now), who was attacked as both
a foreign policy know-nothing and the chief executive of a state
(Arkansas then, Texas now) with abysmally low national ratings on
several important issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pick any year,'' conceded Allan J. Lichtman, chairman of the
history department at American University, ``and you're going to
find some similarities.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what a plethora of prognosticators are doing, to the
point where the first presidential election of a new millennium is
being presented as deja vu all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, as Lichtman theorized, it is because the 2000
presidential election hasn't proved terribly interesting so far.
The economy is peachy, we're not at war and the two principal
candidates have overlapping pedigrees (sons of famous politicians,
graduates of prep school and the Ivy League).
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the very difficulty of predicting the outcome makes
rummaging through the past for a vision of the future more
seductive.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, the practice is rampant. At a briefing for
reporters in Austin, Texas, last week, Bush's advisers variously
mentioned 1960, 1968, 1980 and 1988 as providing omens favorable to
their candidate. One of the advisers dwelled for a bit on 1980,
when challenger Ronald Reagan defeated President Jimmy Carter. By
this example, a Republican governor tarred by opponents as risky
and extremist defeated a nationally known quantity who was regarded
as perhaps a little dull and pious.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, the Bush campaign's chief strategist, has been known
to derive inspiration from as far back as 1896, when William
McKinley, the Republican governor of Ohio, united a divided party
and reached out to new groups of voters. McKinley was reaching out
to immigrants; Bush is making his appeal to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Martin P. Wattenberg, a political scientist at the University of
California at Irvine, is not buying it. ``It's definitely not
1896,'' he said, ``because that was a realignment election.
Although, if Bush does win big, then I guess it could be 1896.''
Then again, he added, ``1988 sounds pretty good to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But it does not sound good to Henry F. Graff, a retired
professor of history at Columbia University who has written
extensively about the American presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say 1960, when you had a vice president running
against an upstart,'' said Graff, who played down 1988 for several
reasons. Dukakis' period of ascendance in polls, he noted, was
briefer than Bush's has been, and it came when he was less familiar
to voters than Bush is now.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the scholars who do not look for any one year but
rather devise a timeless recipe _ a teaspoon of economic growth, a
soupcon of the current president's approval rating, a dash of
voters' appetite for change _ that explains and predicts the
outcome of every election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more informative,'' said Alan Abramowitz, a
political scientist at Emory University whose mathematical model
augurs a victory by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, would violate the example of 1960, but it would
confirm the lessons of 1988, and maybe even 1908 and 1928, when the
departing president's designated successor _ in each case,
admittedly, someone other than the vice president _ succeeded him.
</P>
<P>
   Graff acknowledged that it is all just a guessing game, with no
year exactly like any other, for an exceedingly simple reason:
``History does not repeat itself.''
</P>
<P>
   His scientific proof? ``These candidates running around now, in
their dress-down clothing, don't look like anything in the history
books.''

<P>
   If anybody has borne the brunt of the changes in Eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union since the fall of communism, it has
been women. While the picture varies wildly from the relatively
developed countries of central Europe to the huge, impoverished
swaths of the Balkans, Russia and central Asia, women have not
benefited from any economic gains as men have. At the same time,
they appear to have disproportionately shouldered the stresses
brought by a total change of lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Health care and child care have all but collapsed in many
places. In some, fewer girls are finishing high school than 10
years ago. Between 1985 and 1997, a recently released U.N. study
found, the transition to a market economy meant that the number of
working women fell by 40 percent in Hungary, 21 percent in Russia
and 24 to 31 percent in the Baltic states. Of course, men have lost
jobs, too, and they often sink into apathy and alcoholism, women
say. Women who might have hoped for a clerical or professional job
under communism find themselves forced into menial work _
frequently in the unprotected realm of the black economy _ to make
ends meet while caring for children and keeping their family
together. Some, indeed, are forced into prostitution, often after
being trafficked abroad on the pretense that they will work as a
maid or waitress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women take the role of savior _ they try to save themselves,
their family,'' said Olga Gerasymyuk, the host of a popular
television program on social affairs in Ukraine. Women's magazines
there promote what may seem to the West an idiosyncratic message of
empowerment: ``They teach them to save the gentle spirit of their
husbands, who are at a loss,'' Gerasymyuk said.
</P>
<P>
   Zina Mounla, who coordinates programs across the former Soviet
bloc for the U.N. Development Fund for Women, said that statistics
are hard to come by on how poorly women are doing compared with men
in this shifting environment.
</P>
<P>
   One area in which east European women have clearly regressed is
in political representation. Under communism, quotas ensured that
one-third of the seats in the often nominal parliaments went to
women. ``Even now,'' said Gulmira Asanbayeva, an activist from
Kyrgyzstan who promotes women's leadership, ``we remember the names
of famous women from the Soviet period,'' women who had the kind of
political sway now exercised almost exclusively by men.
</P>
<P>
   Asanbayeva, 22, was one of the 10,000 women estimated to have
attended a conference in New York last week titled Beijing Plus
Five, which examined the worldwide status of women five years after
a giant gathering in Beijing that was attended by, among others,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who inspired heated debate in the United
States over the wisdom of a first lady visiting China. In hundreds
of meetings, formally and informally, women discussed the gains
made toward equality and set goals for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Although Asanbayeva and several other eastern Europeans spoke
out on women's causes, there was little indication that they would
succeed at home any time soon. Lenka Simerska, a 24-year-old
working with the Gender Studies Center in Prague, said she feels
far removed from the stresses of poverty described by women from
the Balkans or the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In the Czech Republic, she said, men were frustrated by the
deadening hand of Communism for so long that they took over
everything after its fall in 1989. As a result, educated women
seeking a good job often fall prey to chauvinist prejudices about
leaving their jobs to have children (paid maternity leave in the
Czech Republic lasts up to three years) or taking time off to rear
them; above all they lack the mechanisms for righting perceived
wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's consciousness and solidarity are not great,'' Simerska
said, predicting change only when ``young women will slowly get
angry, and something will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For some women and girls, particularly the poor and
undereducated, notions of power are unimaginable. Indeed the poorer
and more uneducated the women are, the more likely it is that they
will become involved in prostitution. Irene Freudenschuss-Reichl,
Austria's delegate to Beijing Plus Five, estimated that half a
million women from central and Eastern Europe are shipped abroad
each year as part of the worldwide trafficking in prostitutes. A
recent American study shows that an increasing share of the 45,000
to 50,000 such women traveling to the United States each year come
from the former Soviet bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Selma Gasi, 20, an activist with the Women to Women group in
Bosnia, tells a particularly chilling tale of pimps, accompanied by
older women, scouring the war-devastated villages, ostensibly for
sitters or housemaids, and taking girls as young as 14 to
strip-dancing bars where they become prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mounla said this is not unique to the Balkans; it is seen in
Ukraine and Russia, where pimps have been known to take teen-agers
from orphanages that release them at age 16. Some women know they
are going to work as prostitutes, she said, but that doesn't mean
they should forfeit all their rights.
</P>
<P>
   Yasmina Dimiskovska, of the Union of Women in Macedonia, said
Russian and Ukrainian women are trafficked through her country to
Italy, or their passports seized locally and they are sent to
strip-dancing bars. Again, statistics are hard to come by, but 40
women came from Ukraine last month alone, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can talk to them, go to the police,'' Dimiskovska said. But
``there is no shelter willing to help'' women who lack official
identity papers. If they are shipped home, she added, they risk
repercussions from the criminals who first sent them abroad. ``It's
a circle which can't be stopped,'' she said. ``I think they cannot
do anything.''

   WASHINGTON _ George Shultz said it. James Baker said it. So did
Warren Christopher and Madeleine Albright. When it comes to making
peace in the Middle East, four successive secretaries of state all
sounded the same theme: Americans cannot want peace more than the
parties themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the United States must be both available and
aloof, appearing as a willing partner but not an over-eager suitor.
In fact, in late 1993, less than a year into the Clinton
administration, Christopher set modest goals, saying that making
peace was going to take ``a lot of time and patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and patience are the two things President Clinton no longer
has. And now, with only seven and a half months left as president,
he even may want peace more than the parties themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident in Clinton's announcement, after meeting with
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel in Lisbon 10 days ago, that
peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians was ``within view
now.'' He said the two sides would restart negotiations in
Washington this week and his administration dangled the possibility
of a three-way Camp David-style summit in which Clinton himself
would take part. The sense of urgency Clinton expressed was
reminiscent of the pleading that the late King Hussein of Jordan
was famous for, using every new political wrinkle and change on the
ground to say that that was the last chance for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and Middle East experts talk now of the
need to seize the moment created by a new reality: Israel's
withdrawal from Lebanon two weeks ago, which Clinton said imposes a
much greater sense of urgency on the parties to resolve the very
substantial differences that remain between them: the size and
shape of a Palestinian state, the future of Jerusalem and the fate
of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only certain moments in history when all the parties
are available, when they see that a negotiated deal is in their
interests and they don't believe they have better options,'' said
Thomas R. Smerling, Washington director of the Israel Policy Forum,
a research institute that focuses on the peace process. ``This is
one of those times.''
</P>
<P>
   But moments and deadlines come and go, and urgency is one of the
most easily manipulated commodities in the Middle East. It has been
used to derail progress toward peace. Witness all the years wasted
because of Palestinian terrorist attacks and Israeli retaliation,
troop movements and street violence. In that atmosphere,
concessions became impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But urgency can, if invoked with skill, be used to push the
region toward peace as well. The argument is that every opportunity
is fleeting in the Middle East, where attitudes can shift with
remarkable speed, so that when a moment is ripe for conciliation,
it must be seized.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having run out of time for the more familiar formula of
patience, Clinton is left with the appeal of urgency, in effect
trying to turn his biggest liability _ his lame-duck status _ into
an asset.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the moment is urgent for him. And certainly urgency
is felt by Barak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the newspaper Haaretz last month, Barak
spoke of ``a golden opportunity'' for Israel to make peace, not
only with the Palestinians, but also with the Syrians and the
Lebanese. ``Do we await the future passively with our eyes shut,''
he asked, ``or do we take an active stance vis-a-vis the reality
and try to modify it to our advantage?''
</P>
<P>
   As for Arafat, he has no good alternative. Unilaterally
declaring an independent Palestinian state, as he has threatened to
do, would deprive him of the aid and good will he has received from
the rest of the world since he set out to make peace in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Both men know that if they don't get a deal this year it may be
a long time before a similar opportunity comes. Clinton offers a
carefully built reputation as an honest broker that neither of the
presumptive presidential nominees, Vice President Al Gore and Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, enjoy. Over the years, Gore has taken an
uncritical pro-Israeli stance; Bush is a blank slate when it comes
to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rushed nature of the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon
has stirred up Israeli and Palestinian politics in ways that may
prove damaging to prospects for a quick deal. Barak is fighting off
a rebellion by conservative coalition allies that could produce new
elections. And the frenzied meetings of long-divided families at
the now-accessible Lebanese border could create a new dynamic for
the extremely sensitive issue of what happens to the many
Palestinian refugees who would remain outside a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton's pleas for urgency notwithstanding, the
lame-duck year of any administration tends to limit its
accomplishments in diplomacy. The last president to be finishing
out a second term was Ronald Reagan; in 1988, Shultz launched a
peace initiative after the Palestinians began the uprising known as
the intifadeh, but the effort went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for any U.S. negotiator, Middle East peacemaking requires
both staying power and an unswerving belief in the impossible.
``There is a good chance to come to an agreement,'' said Henry
Kissinger, who as secretary of state spent seven straight weeks
shuttling between Damascus and Jerusalem after the 1973 war. ``Both
sides have run out of options and both sides are at the limit of
their concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what advice he would give Clinton, Kissinger said, ``I
would tell him to stay calm and be available as a facilitator. And
I would tell him not to be more interested than the parties
themselves.''

TEXAS LAWYER'S DEATH ROW RECORD A CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: List of Mock's clients who have been executed or are on death
row follows story.) 
 By SARA RIMER and RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ On death row at the Terrell unit of the Texas state
prison in Livingston, an hour's drive north of here, inmates and
death penalty lawyers refer sardonically to a place they call the
Mock Wing. This metaphorical prison enclave has housed at least a
dozen death row inmates, some already executed, others awaiting
their final punishment, who shared the same lawyer, Ronald G. Mock.
</P>
<P>
   Mock, who was appointed by Harris County judges to represent
indigent defendants in capital cases, says he believes he has had
more clients sentenced to death than any lawyer in the country. One
of those clients, Robert Anthony Carter, was executed on May 31. On
June 22, another of Mock's clients, Gary Graham, 36, is scheduled
to die by lethal injection after a 19-year court battle.
</P>
<P>
   In large part because Graham's conviction turned on a single
eyewitness who saw him only fleetingly and at night, his new
lawyers are insisting that he is innocent and are pressing for a
postponement of his execution and for a new trial. In earlier
pleadings, they also raised questions about Mock's competency as
trial counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's is the latest high-profile death penalty case to focus
attention on Gov. George W. Bush and how the death penalty is
administered in his state. With their appeals exhausted, Graham's
lawyers are asking the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to
recommend that Bush grant Graham some form of clemency. Last week,
Bush granted a 30-day reprieve to another condemned prisoner, Ricky
Nolen McGinn. It was only the second time during his tenure that he
has stepped in to stop an execution.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the innocence claim, what makes Graham's case
particularly compelling is that his new lawyers, and other critics
of the death penalty, are portraying it as a textbook example of
how bad lawyering sends poor people to death row here and in other
states across the country. Mock, who boasted in an interview this
week that he had flunked criminal law at Texas Southern
University's Thurgood Marshall School of Law, called no witnesses
during the guilt phase of Graham's trial, which lasted two days. He
did not challenge the testimony of the single eyewitness who sealed
Graham's guilty verdict, although other witnesses could have
provided conflicting testimony. He called only two witnesses during
the penalty phase, when his job was to persuade the jury to spare
his client's life.
</P>
<P>
   Mock, who had only three years of legal experience when he took
on Graham's defense, acknowledged in the interview that he did
almost no investigation of the case. He knew in his gut, he said,
that none of the witnesses could help his client. Mock's
investigator, Mervyn West, as well as his co-counsel, Chester L.
Thornton, both say Mock had made it clear that he assumed Graham
was guilty, an assertion Mock disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton said Graham's fate had haunted him for 19 years. It was
his first and last capital case. ``I have serious questions whether
we presented a fair and adequate defense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mock said that five of his clients on death row have petitions
pending in court that accuse him of ineffectiveness of counsel. The
Texas Bar Association has reprimanded him several times for
professional misconduct. ``I have a permanent parking spot at the
grievance committee,'' Mock said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Mock, who drives a Rolls-Royce and a
Harley-Davidson, was one of the top-earning court-appointed lawyers
on death cases here, making by his estimation $120,000 to $130,000
a year. Mock said he stopped handling capital cases 10 years ago
because there was not enough money in them.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason Mock got so much work is that there was
plenty to go around. Harris County, where he practices, tries more
capital cases than any other county in the state. The county, which
includes Houston, has 148 people, including Graham, on death row.
Since executions resumed here in 1976, Harris County has put 62
people to death, making it the jurisdiction with the third-highest
number of executions in the country. Only the state of Texas itself
and the state of Virginia have had more.
</P>
<P>
   Like most counties in Texas, Harris County does not have a
public defender system. Thus judges, who are elected, appoint
lawyers for the indigent, and while standards have improved
considerably, when Graham and many other death row inmates were
being tried in the 1980s there were no guidelines for
court-appointed lawyers. Defense lawyers and former judges say that
many judges routinely appointed lawyers who moved cases quickly,
and that there was pressure on lawyers to contribute to the judges'
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cronyism was rampant,'' said Jay Burnett, who presided over
capital cases as a district judge in Houston for 14 years and
crusaded for the higher standards that are now in place in Harris
County, including certification and training procedures for
lawyers. But back when Mock was handling the Graham case in 1981,
Burnett said, ``They were appointing people who had no business
doing capital cases.''
</P>
<P>
   With his easy manner and jokes, Mock became a favorite of a
handful of Harris County judges, some of whom were impressed by the
strong rapport he established with clients. Another reason judges
appointed Mock, Thornton and other lawyers said, was that Mock is
black, and with few African-American lawyers practicing criminal
defense law in Houston in the 1980s, judges were interested in
promoting what diversity they could.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Trevathan, who was the judge in the Graham case and is
now in private practice, said, ``I always thought Ron Mock was a
good lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   But a review of Mock's legal career here shows that he was
jailed during jury selection in one capital murder trial for
failing to file court papers in another case on time for a
condemned client's appeal. A federal judge who later reviewed the
case during which Mock was jailed wrote that his confidence in the
verdict was ``completely undermined'' because of Mock's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Several clients filed complaints against Mock, with one claiming
that he smelled alcohol on Mock's breath during their discussions.
Mock at one time owned 11 bars, including Buster's Drinkery, a
popular downtown hangout for judges and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drank a lot of whiskey,'' Mock said, talking in his office
in Houston, where the walls are decorated with portraits of the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. ``I drank whiskey
with judges. I drank whiskey in the best bars. But it never
affected my ability. It never affected my performance.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The performance of appointed lawyers in capital cases has become
a subject of national concern. Texas has 468 condemned prisoners,
the second-largest death row population in the country (California
has the largest), and Bush has vigorously defended the fairness and
professionalism of his state's judicial system. He insists that not
one of the 131 people executed during his tenure was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined a request to be interviewed about the Graham case.
His spokesman, Dan Bartlett, said: ``Governor Bush takes every
death penalty case very seriously. The governor's office conducts
an exhaustive and lengthy review process of each death penalty
case. Having said that, we believe it is inappropriate for the
governor or his staff to grant an interview in the middle of this
review process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Graham case has put a spotlight on the way Texas appoints
lawyers to handle death penalty cases and the woeful performance of
scores of local lawyers, two of whom slept through parts of several
trials and others of whom have presented few if any arguments on
behalf of their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't indict Ronnie,'' said Thornton, who rarely practices
law these days and runs a small business exporting medical
equipment. ``I indict the system that creates Ronnie, and lawyers
like him. Judges appoint lawyers who play along with the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers and judges say there are now some highly skilled
court-appointed lawyers on capital cases in Harris County.
</P>
<P>
   Roe Wilson, the Harris County assistant district attorney who is
handling the Graham case, said: ``I think Ron did a competent job.
By law you are not guaranteed a perfect or excellent counsel.
You're guaranteed competent counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking from a holding cell on death row in Livingston on
Wednesday, Graham said the fact that Mock was also a black man had
been reassuring. ``I tended to trust him more,'' Graham said. ``I
felt like he would stand up and fight the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, a high school dropout who grew up poor with a mother in
and out of mental hospitals, was charged in May 1981 with fatally
shooting Bobby Lambert, 53, during an attempted nighttime robbery
in the parking lot of a Safeway supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was arrested after a weeklong crime rampage that followed
the murder of Lambert, and he subsequently pleaded guilty to 10
aggravated robberies during which he terrorized his victims by
pointing guns at them and threatened to kill them. He shot two of
the victims; one of the men later lost a leg as a result. Rape
charges against Graham were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his arrest, a Harris County judge appointed Mock
as the lead lawyer in Graham's capital case. Thornton, who knew
Graham and had represented him on some juvenile offenses, was
appointed his co-counsel.
</P>
<P>
   West, a former police officer, was brought in as the
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   While defense investigators in capital cases routinely spend
months searching for any shred of evidence that might save their
client's life, West said in an interview this week that he wrapped
up his work on the Graham case in less than a week. ``I had a
couple of quick talks with eyewitnesses and went over the police
report,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mock said Graham was unable to tell him where he had been on the
night of the murder. ``His position was that he was on a drug and
alcohol binge, and didn't remember where he was,'' Mock said.
During the trial, two witnesses went to the courtroom to tell Mock
that they wanted to testify that they were with Graham the night of
the murder. Mock said this week that he was too busy to talk to
them, but that he knew they could not have helped his client. This
contradicts an earlier affidavit, used by the state to deny Graham
a new trial, in which Mock denied knowing of these witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   At least two witnesses who might have helped Graham were named
in the police report. Sherian Etuk, a child protective services
worker for the state, and Ronald Hubbard, a postal worker, had been
working at the Safeway at the time of the murder, and both said
they saw the killer.
</P>
<P>
   Etuk and Hubbard, whose affidavits are included in Graham's
clemency petition, both said in interviews this week that Graham
was not the man they saw. Graham is just under 5 foot 10. Both
Hubbard and Etuk said that the man they saw was under 5 foot 5.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, the assistant district attorney, said Etuk and Hubbard
were sincere but mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   Mock said this week that he did not bother to interview the
other witnesses because if he had put them on the stand, it would
have allowed the prosecution to tell the jury about Graham's other
crimes. But Wilson said that Mock was wrong about the law, that
such testimony would not have given the prosecution that opening.
</P>
<P>
   No forensics evidence connected Graham to the murder, and the
police report contained ballistics evidence showing that the
.22-caliber revolver found on Graham when he was arrested could not
have been the weapon that killed Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   The case came down to one witness, Bernadine Skillern, a former
school secretary who has never wavered in her identification of
Graham over the years. ``She was stronger than an acre of garlic,''
Mock said this week, repeating an assertion he has made many times.
He did not attack Skillern's identification before the jury, and in
his closing arguments he said she deserved a standing ovation for
her bravery in testifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put on no defense,'' said Jack B. Zimmermann, who is
working with Richard H. Burr on Graham's case before the board of
pardons and parole. ``If he didn't attack the mistaken
identification, there was nothing for the jury to do but come back
with a finding of guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court warned in a 1967 case against ``the
vagaries of eyewitness identification,'' arguing that ``the annals
of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken
identification.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Mock had known of the eyewitnesses and the ballistics
report, legal technicalities prevented the lawyers who followed him
from getting a hearing on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Graham's case lies on the fault line of the Texas death
penalty system,'' Burr said. ``He had abysmal trial counsel, who
failed to present stark evidence of his innocence based on
exonerating eyewitnesses and forensics evidence. Thereafter, when
this evidence was discovered, the courts all decided that this
evidence was presented too late to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   With the execution of his former client approaching, Mock said
he had no regrets about his work on the Graham case. ``There's
nothing I could have done that would have changed the result,'' he
said.

<P>
   In ``Bobos in Paradise,'' his acute if sometimes cutesy new book
about the merger of America's bourgeoisie and its Bohemians (which
he merges into ``Bobos''), David Brooks looks back now and then to
the 1950s, the golden age of the liberal science of sociology.
</P>
<P>
   In those years, journalists like William H. Whyte Jr. (``The
Organization Man,'' 1956) and sociologists like David Riesman and
his colleagues Nathan Glazer and Reuel Denney (``The Lonely
Crowd,'' 1950), were lamenting the plunge of the middle class into
corporation-dominated conformity.
</P>
<P>
   A half-century later, Brooks, though mocking the tastes and
pretensions of today's upper middle class, confesses to being
generally satisfied with its success in combining acquisitiveness,
social consciousness and easygoing tolerance into a genial
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   They are anti-establishment establishmentarians. Sociological
journalism, which at its best provides snapshots of the big
picture, does not have a great reputation for prophecy, and the
writers of the 1950s could not foresee the transformation of the
economy and the creation of a far wealthier set of men and women
whose loyalty is less to their company than to the perks it can
deliver. (Whyte reported in 1956 that only ``the venturesome few
buy stocks.'') Their admonitions about America's burgeoning
consumer society are strikingly different from Brooks' amused
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Did the best-selling sociologists get everything wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Whyte was troubled by the postwar appeal of corporate power and
authority, with its assumption that the interests of the companies
where most Americans made their living coincided with morality. The
key word was ``belongingness,'' which Whyte saw as a lure and a
snare that threatened everyone's independence. He warned that the
apparent beneficence of corporate life masked a basic conflict
between the individual and society: ``The group is a tyrant; so
also is it a friend, and it is both at once.''
</P>
<P>
   On the popular subject of consumerism, with the nation awash in
cash after the scarcities of the war years, Whyte discerned that
``it is the group that determines when a luxury becomes a
necessity.'' Who could foresee the amounts of money the Bobos would
have to throw around and the ways, which Brooks describes so
humorously, that marketeers would devise to relieve them of it?
</P>
<P>
   But Whyte's basic point, that most people with spare income
don't know what they ``need'' until the commercial tastemakers tell
them, is also evident in Brooks' up-to-date analysis. And it is how
they spend that largely defines their class.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is too sharp a reporter to miss the way his Bobos go
about their socially inspired duties to consume. He even offers
rules for Bobo buying: bathrooms and kitchens, however oversized
and overequipped, are more virtuous than a wide-screen television
set; gardening tools, however overpriced and underused, are more
virtuous than jewelry. The adroit Bobo avoids vulgarly conspicuous
consumption and practices ``one-downmanship'' in the form of very
expensive simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying difference between Brooks and Whyte is
ideological. While Whyte inveighed, ``We must fight the
Organization!'' Brooks is comfortable with what he sees, at worst,
as harmless excess. It's a generational and political divide. The
1950s sociologists, mostly left-leaning, drew on America's
experience with the Depression and the New Deal; they were
suspicious of corporate power in all its forms. Brooks, a senior
editor at the conservative Weekly Standard, apparently learned his
sociology at the lap of Irving Kristol and other neoconservative
champions of the market economy.
</P>
<P>
   That would also account for the way he shrugs off the famous
assertion of ``The Lonely Crowd'' that the nation's move from the
age of production to the age of consumption was marked by the
emergence of ``other-directed'' types, mostly white-collar folks
who conform to the expectations of their peers and their betters.
``The other-directed person,'' Riesman wrote, ``is in a sense at
home everywhere and nowhere, capable of a tepid if sometimes
superficial intimacy with and response to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   When Riesman, no humorist, addressed Bohemianism, he saw it as
just another sort of other-directedness, made up of people who are
``often zealously tuned in to the signals of a group that finds the
meaning of life, quite unproblematically, in an illusion of
attacking an allegedly dominant and punishing majority of Babbitts
and Kwakiutl chiefs.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have been writing about the 1960s. Brooks sees the
co-option of Bohemia into the bourgeoisie as preferable to having
rowdy demonstrators break windows and stall traffic. And the
other-directedness that Riesman described as a threat to personal
autonomy receives Brooks' embrace for the Bobos' contribution to
community and social cohesion; he likes their centrist political
inclinations and the value they put on consensus and civility. It's
a sort of 5-C club.
</P>
<P>
   So he would never thunder about the organization man, as Whyte
did: ``It is wretched, dispiriting advice to hold before him that
ideally there need be no conflict between him and society. There
always is; there always must be.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bobos find their way into Paradise, the presumed shackles of
the 1950s have become designer accessories.

BRITAIN IN AFRICA: COLONIALISM'S LEGACY BECOMES A BURDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 (NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For international clients' use by

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In recent weeks, Britons have been treated to two
conflicting, almost puzzling, sets of images. In Sierra Leone, an
African leader pleads with British troops to stay on, after they
arrive there to protect the capital from rebel forces who had
kidnapped hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers. Across the continent in
Zimbabwe, another African president reviles just about everything
that smacks of the British and tells them to be gone.
</P>
<P>
   Binding the two images is Britain's colonial past and, with it,
a message that has some resonance for the United States in its own
new imperial age: Once power is extended, it creates a stubborn,
messy and enduring legacy. And even when influence recedes, the
tangle of obligation, expectation and resentment survives.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's left after you've gone is a very deep imprint,'' said
Dr. David Anderson, chairman of the Center for African Studies at
the School for Oriental and African Studies here. ``And it dictates
cultural links, investment flows. All these things have substantive
meaning in the way things are done.''
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances that motivated Presidents Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
of Sierra Leone and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe could hardly have
been more different, and neither could Britain's responses.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, a chaotic assemblage of rebel and
pro-government forces has turned the nation into a patchwork of
armed fiefs competing, essentially, for the country's diamond
riches. A U.N. mission to achieve and preserve a peace had
collapsed, leaving a dangerous vacuum. This threatened to propel
the war-weary nation into further mayhem _ mayhem that had already
caught the world's eye through the singular cruelty of rebels who
hacked off the limbs of innocents.
</P>
<P>
   But Britain's sense of post-colonial obligation went further.
Its gunboat diplomacy in Sierra Leone also reflected a broader
readiness by Prime Minister Tony Blair's government to pursue the
same ethical _ if somewhat selective _ crusade as had led it to
promote last year's NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe the fight is different: After 20 unchallenged years
in power, Mugabe is facing elections this month that he is afraid
of losing. And he has seized on the emotional issue of racial
discrimination left over from colonial days _ in this case, unfair
patterns of land distribution _ as a pretext to order a campaign of
bloody intimidation of his principal opponents. These include white
farmers and workers on the farmers' land. Hundreds of white-owned
farms have been occupied by so-called veterans of Zimbabwe's
liberation war in the 1970, and at least 25 people have died.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Mugabe is assailing the very legacy that Britons
feel links them to the land. And Britain's choices are
circumscribed, illuminating both the ambiguities of its colonial
history and the limits on its modern influence.
</P>
<P>
   While Sierra Leone was established in 1787 as a coastal
settlement for freed black slaves, white British settlers were
encouraged to migrate to Rhodesia _ as Zimbabwe was then known _ in
the late 19th and early 20th century, simply seizing vast tracts of
land from the indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
   When British officials started to protest Mugabe's behavior,
that inescapable history clouded the moral issue and gave Mugabe
the ammunition to defy the onetime colonial ruler. The collision
left Britain's standing in Zimbabwe at its lowest in decades, even
as its star rose ever higher in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   So what drives a small nation with shrunken influence to project
its influence with such Victorian zeal?
</P>
<P>
   While Britain's initial intervention in Sierra Leone was
depicted as a mission to rescue British passport-holders, it was
quickly seen here by a broad swath of the populace as something
more: an opportunity to unravel chaos that has at least some roots
in earlier British initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, by contrast, the presence of some 15,000 white
Zimbabweans entitled to British citizenship revived a far more
ambiguous legacy. Successive British governments may have voiced
support for the aspirations of Zimbabwe's black majority, but, on
the right wing of British politics, there remains an insistence
that Britain should look after its so-called kith-and-kin in Africa
_ a view that invariably leads Zimbabweans, and some Britons, to
argue that British policy is racially biased.
</P>
<P>
   The deeper reality in both Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone is that
colonialism does not have an easy cut-off point, or a simple
close-of-sale date. When the flags are furled, the colonial power
maintains a vast array of commercial and other involvements.
</P>
<P>
   Just as colonialism itself was propelled by the economics of
Europe's industrial revolution with its need for raw materials and
markets, so the post-colonial era has been driven by Lord
Palmerston's 19th-century dictum that nations do not have eternal
allies, but they do have eternal interests.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, for instance, by insisting that this month's
elections be free and fair and by offering increased financial aid
for land redistribution, Britain is signaling its broader interest
in the stability of a region that encompasses vast British
investment, particularly in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the same self-interest also creates a web of
commitment and expectation, as Americans know well from their nexus
of relationships from Latin America to the Middle East, from the
rim of Asia to the heart of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's military intervention in Sierra Leone, moreover, has
led to the same worries as dogged U.S. forces in Vietnam, Beirut
and Somalia : Once committed, troops may well have to stand their
ground at the risk of unwelcome casualties _ or contemplate
withdrawal in humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Britain has given clear notice that its 600 combat
troops in Sierra Leone will be withdrawn by mid-June. But, already,
the potential for bloody chaos has obliged Britain to station 200
military advisers there when the combat troops leave _ an eerie
echo of the beginnings of U.S. embroilment in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea of mission creep is inevitable,'' Anderson
said. ``It isn't a problem as long as you draw a line in the
sand.'' But those lines in the sand, of course, are what the
players of the post-colonial era have found so elusive.

BRITAIN IN AFRICA: COLONIALISM'S LEGACY BECOMES A BURDEN

<P>
   LONDON _ In recent weeks, Britons have been treated to two
conflicting, almost puzzling, sets of images. In Sierra Leone, an
African leader pleads with British troops to stay on, after they
arrive there to protect the capital from rebel forces who had
kidnapped hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers. Across the continent in
Zimbabwe, another African president reviles just about everything
that smacks of the British and tells them to be gone.
</P>
<P>
   Binding the two images is Britain's colonial past and, with it,
a message that has some resonance for the United States in its own
new imperial age: Once power is extended, it creates a stubborn,
messy and enduring legacy. And even when influence recedes, the
tangle of obligation, expectation and resentment survives.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's left after you've gone is a very deep imprint,'' said
Dr. David Anderson, chairman of the Center for African Studies at
the School for Oriental and African Studies here. ``And it dictates
cultural links, investment flows. All these things have substantive
meaning in the way things are done.''
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances that motivated Presidents Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
of Sierra Leone and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe could hardly have
been more different, and neither could Britain's responses.
</P>

FROM HOLLYWOOD TO HOOSIERVILLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Tonight in story refers to June 11.) 
By STEVE CARNEY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ One hosts the Academy Awards, the other the
World Pork Expo. So what else do you want to know about Los Angeles
and Indianapolis?
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Game 3 of the National Basketball Association's
Championship Series sends the L.A. Lakers to the home court of the
Indiana Pacers, the Conseco Field House in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime meets Miller Time.
</P>
<P>
   The game travels from Tinseltown to the Circle City, from La-La
Land to India-no-place, from the land of face lifts to the land of
forklifts. The distinction between the two towns is as clear as the
difference between guys who want their girlfriends corn-fed or
lipo-sucked.
</P>
<P>
   The songs about each area also tell the tale. Randy Newman's ``I
Love L.A.'' speaks for itself. Then there's the 1970 top-five hit
about a fleeing felon, ``Indiana Wants Me,'' with the refrain,
``Indiana wants me. Lord I can't go back there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the people out here would laugh. We're not California
here, by golly. This is common-sense Indiana,'' said Virginia
Terpening, director of the Indiana Medical History Museum, outside
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually have restaurants and places that stay open past
nine o'clock. It's definitely not on the fast track, but you won't
be bored to tears, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Terpening's museum, a converted turn-of-the-century insane
asylum, is on the list of ``fun and funky things to do'' from the
city's Convention &AMP; Visitors Association, and features displays of
1890s surgical equipment and autopsy tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an odd and bizarre place. That's the good news. You're
not going to see this in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Hoosier City is best known for the annual
Indianapolis 500. Dozens of cars race at speeds that often top 200
miles per hour, turning left around a closed track for 500 miles,
essentially going nowhere fast. In L.A., drivers also get nowhere,
but spend hours sitting in gridlock doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about rush-hour traffic here. Midwesterners are
clueless about what rush-hour traffic is,'' Terpening said. ``You
get 10 people on the highway and that's a glut.''
</P>
<P>
   L.A., on the other hand, is best known for Hollywood, and all
the glitz and glamour that hang off it like a belly-baring Versace
gown.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hoosier state has contributed greatly to Hollywood _
after all, three of the top-grossing movies of all time are about a
man named Indiana Jones. And then there was the story of tiny Milan
High School winning the 1954 state basketball championship, which
became the 1986 movie ``Hoosiers.''
</P>
<P>
   The supposedly unhip state produced those icons of cool _ wry,
sly and hipper-than-thou _ David Letterman, Steve McQueen and James
Dean. Hoosiers all.
</P>
<P>
   And Michael Jackson made the trip west from Gary, Ind., to
Neverland.
</P>
<P>
   What has Southern California given Indiana? Reggie Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Museum of Indianapolis is the world's largest,
both in holdings and attendance. L.A., on the other hand, is home
to the largest population of actors and models ``under 30,'' and is
the world leader in delayed adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County, if it were its own country, would have the
world's 16th-largest economy. In addition, it produces more teen
slasher films than any nation on the globe, and is the world's only
known source of Pamela Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to basketball, folks in Indianapolis say
they're the true believers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoosiers love basketball. It's the Midwest's heritage. It's
much more than entertainment,'' said Linton Calvert, 52, co-owner
of the Indianapolis landmark Fountain Square.
</P>
<P>
   At Staples Center it's a toss-up who the fans are more
interested in seeing _ Shaq or Jack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at who goes to the games _ all the movie stars. They
show 'em on TV,'' Calvert said. ``If we went out there we couldn't
get nosebleed seats.
</P>
<P>
   Even native son David Letterman blamed the glitz factor for the
Pacers' poor Game 1 showing, in which, he said, ``they played like
little girls.'' ``Here's the problem,'' Letterman said on his show
Thursday. ``The Indiana Pacers _ they're farm boys. They're not
used to the bright lights and the big city. When you're out there
in Los Angeles _ Tinseltown _ it's hard to play `S.B.' _ Superstar
Basketball. You're nervous because the lovely Dyan Cannon is
sitting courtside. You're overwhelmed by her beauty. You're a dumb
farm kid! That's the problem.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But, Angelenos may protest, L.A. has its own basketball pedigree
_ what about John Wooden and his incredible string of 10 NCAA
championships at UCLA? Just nevermind that he was born near
Indianapolis, and was a three-time All-American guard playing for
Purdue (in West Lafayette, Ind.).
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Los Angeles has more going on simply because of its
sheer size. Los Angeles County has nearly twice as many people _ 9
million to 5 million _ as the state of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost don't want to get too big,'' Terpening said. ``We're
not opposed to being a well-kept secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvert's Fountain Square, a restored 1920s entertainment plaza,
includes the Atomic Bowl duckpin bowling alley. The game, sort of a
scale-model version of tenpin bowling, is most popular in the East,
Calvert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. does not have duckpin bowling, I assure you.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the restaurants recommended by the Indianapolis Convention
&AMP; Visitors Association is Acapulco Joe's Mexican Foods, where at
noon every day a Kate Smith recording of ``God Bless America'' is
played. No mention of whether the specials include the Proposition
187 Palapas.
</P>
<P>
   Or there's the Slippery Noodle Inn, a blues bar that is the
state's oldest, and was a favorite hangout of public enemy John
Dillinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of downtowns, especially in the Midwest, roll up the
sidewalks at night. That doesn't happen in downtown Indianapolis.
It has a very active nightlife and it's a very clean, very safe
downtown,'' said Ted Bulthaup, president of the Indianapolis
Restaurant Association.
</P>
<P>
   That said, he considers Los Angeles one of his favorite cities
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy the climate and just the whole atmosphere out there,''
he said. ``There's a lot more excitement, a nice ocean. I rent a
convertible and just tool around.''
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis might seem like it's moving at a different pace.
Could be because they don't observe daylight-saving time.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the year Indianapolis is three hours ahead of L.A.;
right now, it's only two. Stranger still, the whole state doesn't
follow along, Terpening said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, it confuses even the natives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you call Evansville, you always have to say, 'What time
is it there?' &UR;  &LR; '' Terpening said.
</P>
<P>
   But both Indianapolis and Los Angeles have their homages to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Bar &AMP; Filmworks, in downtown Indianapolis, is a
combination bar/restaurant/movie theater, and is owned by Bulthaup.
In a converted 1868 warehouse, it features a bar that replicates
Rick's Cafe from Casablanca, a yellow brick road entryway and
$500,000 in vintage movie posters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lot of good places to see movies in L.A.,'' he said.
``But you don't have a theater like this out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And L.A. has its Indiana Plumbing Supply, with stores throughout
the city. The company started on Indiana Street in Los Angeles in
1942, but is now in the process of changing its name to The
Plumbers Warehouse, said Sharon Van Valkenburg, corporate
administration manager.
</P>
<P>
   No word on whether the name change is a show of support for the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   And how many playoff games will Van Valkenburg be attending?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stand the sport,'' she said, preferring instead
``fast-pitch softball or baseball. It's pretty sad. Everybody here
likes it but me.''

TECH WORKER SHORTAGE PROMPTS DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HILLBURG  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is speeding toward approval of a law that
could open the door to thousands of foreign high-tech workers and
also deliver hundreds of thousands of resident aliens from
immigration limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Three bills have been introduced in the House and Senate that
would greatly increase the number of special H1-B visas granted to
foreigners for jobs that ostensibly cannot be filled by Americans.
The measures, which differ in content, are backed by the computer
industry, which has cited a severe shortage of domestic talent.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the number of visas also enjoys strong support in
Congress, which sees the move as crucial to sustaining the nation's
high tech-driven economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Latino leaders, including the National Council
of La Raza and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, want to add
provisions to H1-B legislation that would grant amnesty to up to
900,000 people, including an estimated 360,000 Californians, who
were shut out of previous immigration reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of fairness,'' said Rep. Lucille
Roybal-Allard, D-Los Angeles, who chairs the Hispanic Caucus. ``If
we're going to bring in several thousand foreign workers, we also
need to assist those who've been here for years in limbo.''
</P>
<P>
   The amnesty proposal, first aired in May, is supported by
President Clinton and many Democratic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   It is reluctantly backed by many Republicans who see no link
between the two efforts but who nonetheless do not want to be
perceived as anti-Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, including activists who favor tighter immigration
controls and crackdowns on undocumented aliens, say the H1-B visa
proposal will hurt American workers. They are also opposed to any
amnesty plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major mistake,'' said Glenn Spencer of Sherman Oaks,
president of Voice of Citizens Together and an advocate of strict
immigration controls. ``We need to invest all the billions these
companies are making into training our own people for these jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service is authorized to
issue only 115,000 H1-B visas per year. They are valid for up to
six years. This year American companies, which must apply for the
visas on behalf of their foreign employees, used up the 2000 quota
by March 1.
</P>
<P>
   A bill co-sponsored by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, would raise the limit to 297,500 over three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, has offered a bill that calls for
unlimited visas, but mandates that all holders earn at least
$40,000 per year and be proficient in English.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. David Dreier, R-Covina, and Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, have
submitted a measure that would increase the number of visas by
362,500 over three years and double the application fee from $500
to $1,000. The fee increase would be used to train U.S. workers for
high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech employers say they have an estimated 270,000 vacancies
and no Americans to fill them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The problem promises to get worse, according to the
International Technology Association of America, a lobbying group
for more than 11,000 companies. It recently forecast the creation
of an additional 1.6 &UR;  &LR; million jobs by next summer, half of which
would require an infusion of foreign talent.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp., said Southland employers, including aerospace
giants, are also scrambling for workers. But he said the region's
pool of talent and its colleges are helping to fill the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it's true that a lot of people can't easily transition
to a new field, we still have a lot of skilled people here in areas
like engineering,'' Kyser said. ``And, as some of these dot-coms
melt down and disappear, we'll see talent returning to the job
market.''
</P>
<P>
   An April 28 Congressional Research Office report cast some doubt
on the need for more foreign workers. Linda Levine, a domestic
policy specialist, wrote that ``available data makes it difficult
to determine whether an information technology labor shortage
exists and, if so, whether those workers are any scarcer than
workers in some other occupations.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortages in less-wired fields are giving a boost to the amnesty
effort. Legislation has been introduced by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.,
to help the Nevada casino industry, which employs a large number of
immigrants from Mexico and Central America, many of whom now face
the threat of eventual deportation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The new amnesty proposal would cover people barred from the
program approved by Congress in 1986. It gave residency rights to
undocumented aliens who had been in the United States on or before
Jan. 1, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service later denied
thousands of immigrants' claims, ruling in many cases that aliens
who had left the United States for short vacations or business
trips had forfeited their amnesty rights. Thousands of resident
aliens and their advocates are still appealing those decisions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The proposal would also grant amnesty to Central Americans who
were left out of another program approved by Congress in 1997. It
gave residency rights to Nicaraguans and Cubans, who fled regimes
hostile to the United States, but excluded most Salvadorans,
Hondurans, Guatemalans and Haitians, who fled nations that were
U.S. allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to take care of these long-standing problems,'' said
Joel Najar, policy analyst for the National Council of La Raza, the
nation's largest Latino civil rights organization. ``Granting legal
status to these people will also be good for the economy. They will
have a full chance to make their contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about opening the floodgates,'' said Roybal-Allard,
whose Hispanic Caucus colleagues include Reps. Xavier Becerra,
D-Los Angeles; Matthew Martinez, D-Alhambra; Joe Baca, D-Rialto;
and Loretta Sanchez, D-Garden Grove. ``We just want to give this
limited group of people the chance to legalize their status.''
</P>
<P>
   Roybal-Allard also stressed that there is no link between the
proposal she backs and a plan announced by the AFL-CIO. The
nation's largest labor organization has called for an amnesty for
all undocumented aliens and an end to sanctions for the employers
who hire them.
</P>
<P>
   The growing clout of Latino voters might also help Congress tie
the H1-B visa plan to an immigrant amnesty. Both Republicans and
Democrats are courting the electorate's fastest-growing group in
battles for Congress and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's biggest Latino populations are centered in
voter-rich states, including California (9.9 million Latinos as of
1997), Texas (5.7 million), New York (2.6 million), Florida (2.1
million) and Illinois (1.2 million).
</P>
<P>
   La Raza and other groups have also been staging energetic drives
to increase registration and turnout.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau's most recent statistics on Latino voting
compare data from the 1994 and 1996 national elections. In 1994,
5.8 million Latinos, or 31 percent of the 17.5 million Latinos
nationwide age 18 and over, were registered to vote. Of that
number, 3.5 million, or 20 percent, cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, Latino voter registration nationwide had risen to 6.6
million, or 36 percent, while the number who voted hit 4.9 million,
or 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, 1.4 million California Latinos age 18 and up, or 24.9
percent of a total of 5.7 million, were registered and 1.2 million,
or 21 percent, voted. In 1996, the numbers increased to 1.6 million
or 29 percent registered, and 1.3 million or 22.6 percent actually
voting.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has exhibited caution in its quest to please both
high-tech companies and Latinos while avoiding confrontation with
opponents of widened immigration.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the titles given this year's spate of bills do not
include the words ``alien'' or ``immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreier's measure is called the ``Helping to Improve Technology
Education and Achievement Act of 2000.'' Feinstein's bill goes by
the title ``American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act.'' And
Texas Rep. Smith calls his proposal the ``Technology Worker
Temporary Relief Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the titles of the bills, critics denounce giving
more visas and amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all greed. The high-tech companies are just looking for
cheap labor, like the companies that hire illegals,'' said Evelyn
Miller of Irvine, a member of the California Coalition for
Immigration Reform. The group co-sponsored the controversial
Proposition 187 in 1994 to prohibit many public services for
undocumented immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies should hire and train Americans who are coming
off welfare and can't find a job,'' added Miller. As to the amnesty
plan, she said, ``these people will never stop there. We'll have a
third amnesty and a fourth. It will never end.''

RANGERS TRY TO LIMIT HABITAT DAMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIK NELSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So you want to load up the minivan, go to the
Santa Monica Mountains and let the kids run free, collecting a few
bouquets of wildflowers and maybe even a jar of tadpoles to show to
Junior's third-grade teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Now picture yourself in federal court, calculating the amount of
money it will cost to repair the ecosystem your progeny have
violated.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. park rangers who patrol the Santa Monica Mountains National
Recreation Area aren't planning to throw the book at anyone but
professional poachers. But they are alarmed by their almost daily
encounters with visitors trotting off with flowers, frogs and
snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Park Ranger Jim Richardson recently encountered a family
collecting tadpoles from Medea Creek in Paramount Ranch. He
diplomatically reined them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to contact those folks and take a few minutes to
educate them, and help them release those tadpoles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Looming over the ranch area, bought by the National Park Service
in 1980 and still used by film companies, is a large hill whose
green foliage is punctuated by off-white stalks protruding from
star-shaped clusters of large, triangular leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Known as chalk dudleyas, the plants are prized for their looks.
But park visitors often find it hard to simply appreciate their
beauty protruding from cliff faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys actually came out with specially constructed poles with
baskets on the ends'' to take the plants, said John Tiszler, a
plant ecologist for the recreation area.
</P>
<P>
   That incident occurred in Topanga State Park, noted Suzanne
Goode, a resource biologist with the state Department of Parks and
Recreation who keeps track of wildlife in several state parks in
the Santa Monica Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In the mountains' federal park areas, the penalty for picking up
a snake or any other animal is a maximum fine of $500 and a
mandatory appearance before a federal judge downtown. Pilfering
plants or possessing trapping equipment such as a hooked ``snake
stick'' can net a citation and a $50 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials have filed charges against several poachers,
including one who was caught last winter with a snake stick made
from a golf club. The case has not yet gone to trial.
</P>
<P>
   While poachers are clearly aware of what they are doing, like
the man who was reported sorting plastic garbage bags full of seeds
at his campsite at Leo Carrillo State Park
</P>
<P>
   for an established seed company, Goode believes the bulk of the
problem is less clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will frequently pick flowers or collect rocks or pretty
leaves or mushrooms,'' Goode said. ``These are all probably the
innocent type of collectors, and they are also probably ignorant of
the effect that they're having on resources where they're
collecting.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Goode said, ``when they pick a flower, they don't
really realize that they're preventing that plant from
reproducing.'' Picking flowers this year ``means there will be
fewer flowers next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of such prolific picking is difficult to gauge. In
some areas, such as tide pools, biologists have established that
the hand of man, or boys and girls, have harmed the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go out with buckets, even in school groups where a
teacher is in charge,'' and pluck various crustaceans and fish from
the water, Goode said, adding that even picking them up for a
better look can be harmful. ``Some organisms are attached to the
rocks, and if they're not put right back in the same location in
the same orientation, they may not get attached again, or they may
be more susceptible to being eaten by predators.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers who catch teachers in the act won't march them off in
irons before horrified kindergartners, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would happen would be that Mrs. Crabapple would be
informed that this is not a good activity, that this is not good
for the natural resources. They would appeal to her higher moral
sense,'' Goode explained.
</P>
<P>
   To say nothing of the teacher's sense of embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   For parents who have trouble convincing children about not
taking bits of the parkland's fragile web of life, there is always
the legal argument.

SMALL ISLANDS, BIG TROUBLE: LOOKING FOR PARADISE? KEEP LOOKING

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Lt. Joe Cable and Bloody Mary knew the score.
Not even a South Pacific paradise like the fictional one created by
Rodgers and Hammerstein is spared the ugly things in life like
racial intolerance and war.
</P>
<P>
   Coups have now shaken Fiji and the Solomon Islands, catapulting
those small ocean nations into the world's attention momentarily
and exposing ethnic tensions and economic rivalries festering under
the sun, somehow out of place in such a perfect setting.
</P>
<P>
   Or are they?
</P>
<P>
   Small island nations, truth to tell, often have big problems.
They are almost inevitably short of resources on land, and even
when that is not so there is usually just one commodity to sell,
putting them at the mercy of volatile global markets.
</P>
<P>
   All have the sea, of course, but their traditional fishing
waters are invaded by the trawlers of industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   And those sleepy lagoons on the tourist brochures are rarely
photographed after a punishing typhoon has torn down the palm trees
and swept small villages and outriggers into the angry sea. In the
mid-1980s, development in the Solomons was set back a decade by
just one storm.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the catastrophes are almost beyond imagining. Think of
those people moved away from Pacific atolls that became bulls'-eyes
for atomic tests in the heyday of the nuclear age. Or of people now
forced to watch generations of family graves being claimed by waves
that lap higher up the beach each year because of global warming, a
phenomenon only big nations have the power to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   In the Indian Ocean nation of Maldives, for those vacationers
who take time to look, the biggest construction projects on view
near the capital, Male, are the piles of giant concrete jacks that
form a seawall, the last defense against annihilation if seas
continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, the problem is not too much water but too
little. Some of the most sought-after tourist islands are popular
precisely because they don't get enough rain. The Antiguan writer
Jamaica Kincaid addresses the reader bluntly to make the point in
``A Small Place'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1988):
</P>
<P>
   ``Since you are a tourist, the thought of what it might be like
for someone who had to live day in, day out in a place that suffers
constantly from drought, and so has to watch carefully every drop
of fresh water used (while at the same time surrounded by a sea and
an ocean _ the Caribbean Sea on one side, the Atlantic Ocean on the
other), must never cross your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   History, too, has been unkind. Islands were snapped up in a day
by colonial powers, whose plantation owners and merchants then
rearranged the population. They shipped workers, or slaves, from
one part of the world to another and, in the process, set in train
the ethnic competitions that would one day blow up in places like
Fiji _ or Trinidad, where native people had to move over and share
space with not only indentured workers from India but also African
slaves.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Sri Lanka, the glorious Serendip of antiquity,
blame Britain for favoring Tamils over Sinhalese a century ago,
setting the scene for the lethal ethnic divisions now tearing apart
one of the most beautiful islands on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial powers sometimes stick around and make trouble for a
long time, say diplomats from the Comoro Islands. They blame France
for fostering divisions in the Indian Ocean archipelago that
together should form a nation. One island, Anjouan, left the group
in 1997 and another, Grand Comore, flirted with secession in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And although the United States had no historical relationship
with Grenada, U.S. troops stormed ashore in 1983 after the
Grenadans were judged to have fallen too deeply into the orbit of
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Island nations have searched for ways to enhance their clout,
collectively. Last fall, they merited a special General Assembly
session at the United Nations to air their fears. An
``environmental vulnerability index'' is in the works, intended to
give them a recognizable way to demonstrate their frailty.
</P>
<P>
   Federations are usually not an answer to their weakness, since
distances between islands are great and cultures can differ
irreconcilably when they are separated by water.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the insular jealousies and rivalries that scuttled the
dream of forming a Federation of the West Indies among the
English-speaking Caribbean islands when they were emerging from
Britain's colonialism three decades ago. Or of the example of
Indonesia _ 13,000 islands put together by Dutch colonialists and
forced to stay together by two Indonesian strongmen, Sukarno and
Suharto. When hapless Sulawesi and Sumatra tried to break free half
a century ago, they were bombed into submission not by the Dutch
but by the new Indonesian government. Centrifugal forces persist in
Indonesia to this day.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Singapore, arguably the most successful of
small _ extremely small _ island nations, but one with considerable
potential for trouble, since its population is divided among the
majority Chinese population and strong Malay and Tamil minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore, under its founder, Lee Kuan Yew, put considerable
energy into making sure nothing awful could possibly happen _ and
then wove a philosophy around it. Political and ethnic dissent were
systematically suppressed in the name of unity.
</P>
<P>
   Kishore Mahbubani, Singapore's ambassador to the United Nations
and the chairman of a forum of small nations represented there,
uses appropriately nautical terms to explain why little nations
can't afford the luxury of unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of it as crossing an ocean in a canoe or on an
aircraft carrier,'' he said. The people on the aircraft carrier, he
said, can jump around, even play football and the boat doesn't
rock. In a canoe, all the passengers have to paddle in unison
facing the same direction or there will be disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key point,'' he said, ``is that in a small state your
margin for error is smaller.''

   RACE-TV-DRAMA (Baltimore) _ Who Gets to Tell a Black Story?:
When David Simon proposed to HBO a television series based on his
book, ``The Corner,'' about black inner-city drug addicts, he was
not thinking much about the fact that he was white. But as the
project began to take shape, the issues of race loomed ever larger.
HBO was not about to make a series about black drug addicts created
by, as one HBO executive put it later, ``a bunch of white guys.''
Charles S. Dutton, who had grown up in the city, spent his early
years on its streets and had his own tale of redemption, was chosen
to direct all six episodes. But, as he said, there would not be one
moment when he would forget that ``it's a white writer and a white
producer and it's HBO and a black director.'' By Janny Scott. This
is the fourth article in the series ``How Race Is Lived in
America.''

   MASS-HEALTH-REFERENDUM (Boston) _ With one final petition drive
this weekend, a coalition of physicians, nurses, senior citizens'
groups, labor unions and others are expected to gather the last
several thousand signatures they need to put before Massachusetts
voters what experts call the most sweeping health-care referendum
on any state's ballot this fall. The referendum would require the
Legislature to find a way to provide health insurance coverage for
all by mid-2002 in a state where more than 600,000 people lack it.
It would also introduce a super-powerful ``patient's bill of
rights.'' And it would put a temporary ban on the conversion of
nonprofit hospitals to for-profit. By Carey Goldberg.

   TEXAS-DEATHROW-LAWYER (Houston) _ On death row at the Terrell
unit of the Texas state prison in Livingston, inmates and death
penalty lawyers refer sardonically to a place they call the Mock
Wing. This metaphorical prison enclave has housed at least a dozen
death row inmates, some already executed, who shared the same
lawyer, Ronald G. Mock. One of Mock's clients, Gary Graham, 36, is
scheduled to die by lethal injection after a 19-year court battle.
What makes Graham's case particularly compelling is that his new
lawyers are portraying it as a textbook example of how bad
lawyering sends poor people to death row. By Sara Rimer and Raymond
Bonner.

clever strategist who has built strength well beyond his small
rightist party by defying ideological labels. Whatever the case, it
is clear that by pairing conservative credentials with a
center-left position on a range of issues Fox has succeeded in
attracting supporters from across the political landscape. By Sam

   For more than a hundred years, thirsty consumers who didn't even
know her name have recognized Psyche the nymph as the symbol of
White Rock soda. Now, however, slumping sales and a younger target
audience have prompted White Rock to give its fragile,
bare-breasted bottle girl a bolder look. The company is favoring a
Psyche depicted only in outline with a few deft brush strokes, and
who is neither crouched on a rock nor gazing into a pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been a great logo, but she really does look
old-fashioned,'' said Laurence Bodkin, White Rock's vice president
for marketing. ``We want to be thought of as a vibrant company for
the new century.''
</P>
<P>
   Psyche is not the only ad icon getting a face lift. Quaker Oats
earlier this year unveiled an all-adult version of its memorable
1972 ``Mikey'' television spot for Life cereal. ``Many of us who
once identified with little Mikey are all grown up and can now
relate to the all new adult cast,'' said Todd Magazine, vice
president for marketing of Quaker's Ready-to-Eat Cereals division.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these updatings come as other famous embodiments of consumer
products _ the Jolly Green Giant, Mr. Whipple and Charlie the Tuna
among them _ are being dusted off and presented, largely unchanged,
to a new generation of buyers. On the cable television station TV
Land, vintage commercials featuring such instantly identifiable
personae as Mr. Clean, Hawaiian Punch's Punchy, the young Mikey and
Clara ``Where's the Beef?'' Peller from Wendy's have become
programming staples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Characters in general went out of style for quite a long
time,'' said Thomas Hine, author of ``The Total Package: The
Evolution and Secret Meanings of Boxes, Bottles, Cans, and Tubes''
(Little, Brown, 1995). ``Obviously a lot of companies are now aware
that they have a kind of cultural heritage that they can cash in
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that heritage, the question arises: When should an
established ad icon be altered to breathe new life into it?
</P>
<P>
   Never, some experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``These characters are more beloved than family members,'' said
Barbara Lippert, ad critic for Adweek magazine. ``I was on an Oprah
show about this subject, and Mr. Whipple ((the actor Dick Wilson))
came out with a pack of toilet paper. People went wild. He was like
Moses carrying the tablets.''
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree. ``If icons are not kept contemporary, they
become recessive,'' said Bob Kuperman, president and CEO of the
advertising agency TBWA Chiat/Day, whose creations include the
Energizer Bunny and the Taco Bell chihuahua. ``Museums are filled
with icons that have not been kept up to date,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a company has no real choice but to go with the public
flow. Quaker's Aunt Jemima eventually lost her bandanna so that she
less closely resembled a stereotypical mammy. When the Michelin Man
was born at the turn of the century, automobile tires were thin and
narrow, but as they bulked up, so did Monsieur Michelin, lest he
become unrecognizable.
</P>
<P>
   But morphing can be a risky business. Take Elsie, Borden's
bovine trademark, who was once cited by Advertising Age as one of
the top 10 icons of all time. In 1993 she was transmogrified: She
spoke, walked on her hind legs, wore pants and owned a dairy store.
The campaign was a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt Elsie could relate more to the working woman of the
day in a human environment,'' explained Jim Montel, vice president
for marketing at American Dairy Brands, Borden's parent company.
``But it didn't move the product. Consumers did not have any
affection for her as a human.''
</P>
<P>
   If change must come to an icon, gradualism tends to work best.
Betty Crocker, for example, is so popular an image that she
routinely receives marriage proposals. But, said Pam Becker, a
spokeswoman for General Mills, ``Our whole goal is to connect Betty
Crocker with consumers out there, and for that reason we have to
change the portrait periodically.''
</P>
<P>
   Crocker has been nipped and tucked seven times since her
original 1936 appearance, most recently four years ago. Although
her features and hairdo have become less dowdy, and she has traded
in her house dress for a business suit, she has always been a
self-possessed lady in red, thus assuring continuity and
familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach is to keep a character more or less intact
while putting it in an unexpected, attention-grabbing context.
``I've seen print ads for Speedy the Alka-Seltzer tablet wearing
sunglasses and a Hawaiian shirt,'' said Warren Dotz, co-author with
Jim Morton of ``What A Character! 20th Century American Advertising
Icons'' (Chronicle, 1996). ``A lot of characters are modernized by
putting them on in-line skates.''
</P>
<P>
   That path, however, can lead to madness. In 1996, McDonald's
plunked its spokesclown, Ronald McDonald, into a variety of
grown-up settings _ golf courses, discos, bars _ to promote its new
Arch Deluxe sandwich. ``They had him doing some pretty bad
things,'' a McDonald's executive told Salon magazine. ``It was a
dark moment. A complete, soup-to-nuts fiasco.''

<P>
   So judgment day has come at last. Almost since it began in
October 1998, the antitrust trial against Microsoft has gone badly
for the world's biggest software company. After Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson ruled that the company was an ``abusive
monopolist'' in April, his decision to accept the proposal by the
Department of Justice to break up the company was to be expected.
This is not the end of the case, but it is, perhaps, the beginning
of the end. And given not only the ``guilty'' verdict but also the
history of the case, Microsoft's obstinate refusal to accept that
it might have done anything wrong is, at the very least, bad
tactics. &QL;

   This year around 100 Americans will be poisoned, hanged, gassed,
shot or electrocuted. In a country where some 17,000 people a year
are murdered, this would not seem exceptional. But the killer in
these 100 cases will be the state. To those outside America, the
country's love of executions is surprising _ surprising to find
such a tolerant place in the same camp as China, Iran, Saudi Arabia
and Congo (the only four countries to execute more people);
surprising to find such a religious place addicted to a habit that
most religious leaders abhor; surprising, too, to find the crucible
of liberty decried in so many international reports on human
rights. &QL;

self-regulated and beyond the reach of governments or big business.
It is a nice idea. Sadly, the Internet is neither as different nor
as ``naturally'' free as wired Utopians claim. The sheer
pervasiveness of the Internet makes it impossible for even the
best-intentioned of regulators to keep out. The real question,
alas, is not whether to regulate the Internet, but how. &QL;

perception of the man who, against stiff competition, has emerged
as the most widely loathed man in America. Web sites are out of
control on the subject, one even suggesting that ``if (Rocker)
played a position, it would probably be Third Reich.'' All this
seems way over the top. Sure, his remarks and behavior are
deplorable, but isn't there a hypocritical double-standard at work
here? Rocker's public disgrace as America's poster-child of
political incorrectness contrasts starkly with the kid-glove

Andrew Goodman, two white New Yorkers who had travelled to
Mississippi to help register black voters, and a fellow volunteer,
James Chaney, an 18-year-old black man from Mississippi, were
executed by Ku Klux Klansmen and buried in an earthen dam. At the
time, the state of Mississippi refused to hear the case. Now, a
generation later, with many of the defendants still living, the
state of Mississippi is taking a second look at the case. Indeed,
all across the South, racially-motivated murder cases of the past
30 years are being reopened by a defiant group of young lawyers and
prosecutors, determined to discover the ugly truth before time
erodes the evidence or puts the suspects beyond the reach of
justice. &QL;

the police. The amulet may not always work, but for most Moroccans,
Mohammed VI has spiritual status. It was simplier in his father's
day. Politically, the kingdom was run as a medieval state with a
feudal hierarchy. But King Mohammed has set himself the challenge
of creating a modern state while maintaining the feudal veneer. Can
he make the change? After ten months on the throne, the signals are
still mixed. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Financial crises invariably have unexpected
after-effects. One such is FirstPlus Financial, a lender based in
Dallas, Texas. On June 2, as part of a bankruptcy settlement, it
announced the sale to Countryside, a Californian bank, of its
remaining portfolio of $4.3 billion-worth of mortgages. The deal
signals the demise of what was until recently one of America's
fastest-growing financial institutions. This is the latest in a
string of similar failures over recent months, all linked to a
dramatic contraction in the securitized-mortgage market. &QL;

   SEOUL _ Computer clubs have been sprouting all over South Korea
recently, catering to a nation of fanatical online game-players.
And now they're discovered the stock market, as well. An exotic
hobby among the rich only a year ago, online trading has quickly
become a national passion. From their homes, their offices, and
their mobile phones, amateur share traders have turned South Korea
into the most developed market in the world for online share
trading. &QL;

   LUANDA _ By most people's standards Angola is not a very
appealing place. But at present every right-thinking oil executive
wants to do business there. Which is why competition will be
frantic in the bidding that is about to open for shares in the
latest Angolan oil-exploration concession to come up for grabs:
Block 34. In fact, the auction of Block 34 marks the end of a
feeding frenzy that has gripped the Angolan oil industry in recent
years. Once is has been allocated, no new concessions are expected
to be offered for some time. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Today it is well known that in roughly half of the
20 percent or so of couples who cannot conceive, the cause is male
infertility. A study in this month's issue of ``Human
Reproduction'' offers a genetic explanation for some of these
cases. But it is an explanation that raises disturbing ethical
questions about the use of some assisted-reproduction techniques.
If the cause of a father's infertility lies in faulty DNA-repair
genes, the resulting child could also be infertile _ and might be
at increased risk of cancer. Couples who resort to modern
technology to overcome infertility could thus be passing an
unwelcome legacy on to their offspring. &QL;

<P>
   So judgment day has come at last. Almost since it began in
October 1998, the antitrust trial against Microsoft has gone badly
for the world's biggest software company. After Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson ruled that the company was an ``abusive
monopolist'' in April, his decision to accept the proposal by the
Department of Justice to break up the company was to be expected.
This is not the end of the case, but it is, perhaps, the beginning
of the end. And given not only the ``guilty'' verdict but also the
history of the case, Microsoft's obstinate refusal to accept that
it might have done anything wrong is, at the very least, bad
tactics. &QL;

   This year around 100 Americans will be poisoned, hanged, gassed,
shot or electrocuted. In a country where some 17,000 people a year
are murdered, this would not seem exceptional. But the killer in
these 100 cases will be the state. To those outside America, the
country's love of executions is surprising _ surprising to find
such a tolerant place in the same camp as China, Iran, Saudi Arabia
and Congo (the only four countries to execute more people);
surprising to find such a religious place addicted to a habit that
most religious leaders abhor; surprising, too, to find the crucible
of liberty decried in so many international reports on human
rights. &QL;

   After more than 50 years of hostilities, a first handshake makes
history. But whether next week's meeting between South Korea's Kim
Dae Jung and North Korea's Kim Jong II will also make Asia a safer
place is harder to fathom. These two Cold-War siblings, one
democratic and thriving, the other communist-cum-feudal and
failing, have plenty to disagree about. Hope for progress, but
don't expect miracles from the summit. &QL;

   Is it any wonder that ``hands off the Internet'' is the rallying
cry of starry-eyed libertarians? Here is this amazingly useful
thing, built from the bottom up by idealists, largely
self-regulated and beyond the reach of governments or big business.
It is a nice idea. Sadly, the Internet is neither as different nor
as ``naturally'' free as wired Utopians claim. The sheer
pervasiveness of the Internet makes it impossible for even the
best-intentioned of regulators to keep out. The real question,
alas, is not whether to regulate the Internet, but how. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ OK, John Roc`KKK'er is a bigot. John Rocker is an
oaf. John Rocker is a fool. That's the almost universal public
perception of the man who, against stiff competition, has emerged
as the most widely loathed man in America. Web sites are out of
control on the subject, one even suggesting that ``if (Rocker)
played a position, it would probably be Third Reich.'' All this
seems way over the top. Sure, his remarks and behavior are
deplorable, but isn't there a hypocritical double-standard at work
here? Rocker's public disgrace as America's poster-child of
political incorrectness contrasts starkly with the kid-glove
treatment accorded his violent or even criminal colleagues. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ On the night of June 21, 1964, Michael Schwerner and
Andrew Goodman, two white New Yorkers who had travelled to
Mississippi to help register black voters, and a fellow volunteer,
James Chaney, an 18-year-old black man from Mississippi, were
executed by Ku Klux Klansmen and buried in an earthen dam. At the
time, the state of Mississippi refused to hear the case. Now, a
generation later, with many of the defendants still living, the
state of Mississippi is taking a second look at the case. Indeed,
all across the South, racially-motivated murder cases of the past
30 years are being reopened by a defiant group of young lawyers and
prosecutors, determined to discover the ugly truth before time
erodes the evidence or puts the suspects beyond the reach of
justice. &QL;

Mohammed VI has spiritual status. It was simplier in his father's
day. Politically, the kingdom was run as a medieval state with a
feudal hierarchy. But King Mohammed has set himself the challenge
of creating a modern state while maintaining the feudal veneer. Can
he make the change? After ten months on the throne, the signals are
still mixed. &QL;

   OLIGOPOLY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Microsoft aside, one legacy of
the Clinton administration will be that it encouraged one of the
greatest periods of industrial concentration in U.S. history,
affecting old and new sectors ranging from oil and the
pharmaceuticals to telephones, broadcasters and the Internet. The
deals, a byproduct of deregulation in the 1990s and the application
of Reagan-era antitrust guidelines, have put back together large
pieces of the old AT&AMP;T and Standard Oil trust. Moreover, Congress,
prodded by Clinton, repealed the Depression-era law that had split
the banking and securities industries, leading to predictions that
ultimately there will be broad consolidation on Wall Street. By
Stephen Labaton. (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   ISLAND-NATIONS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Coups have shaken Fiji and the
Solomon Islands, catapulting those small ocean nations into world
attention momentarily and exposing the ethnic tensions and economic
rivalries festering under the sun, somehow out of place in such a
perfect setting. Or are they? Small island nations, truth to tell,
often have very big problems. They are almost inevitably short of
resources on land, and even when that is not so there is usually
just one commodity to sell, putting them at the mercy of volatile
global markets. And they are vulnerable to typhoons and other
natural hazards. By Barbara Crossette. (Moved in the `i' category)

<P>
   CAMPAIGNS-COMPARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ You probably think you are
watching the presidential race of 2000. Wrong: it is really 1988,
or at least that is where many political scientists and strategists
will transport you. They cite the familiar dynamic of a vice
president who belonged to a successful administration and whose
apparent disadvantage against a heavily promoted governor turned
out to be temporary. Or perhaps it is 1960. The vice president
cannot trade on his administration's high regard in the face of an
upbeat, more charismatic challenger who ultimately prevails.
Analogies can also be drawn with 1992, 1980, 1968 and even 1896. By
Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   MIDDLECLASS-CULTURE-REVIEW (Undated) _ In ``Bobos in Paradise,''
his new book about the merger of America's bourgeoisie and its
Bohemians (which he merges into ``Bobos''), David Brooks looks back
now and then to the 1950s, the golden age of the liberal science of
sociology. In those years, writers lamented the plunge of the
middle class into corporation-dominated conformity. A half-century
later, Brooks, though mocking the tastes and pretensions of today's
upper middle class, confesses to being generally satisfied with its
success in combining acquisitiveness, social consciousness and
easygoing tolerance into a genial life style. They are
anti-establishment establishmentarians. By Walter Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS-APPEARANCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ What is the role of good
looks in politics? Can a candidate be too attractive? Can a
candidate be too unattractive? What constitutes good looks? Would
some unsightly American presidents of the past, like the 350-pound
William Howard Taft, be elected today? Does hair help? Some experts
on politics and the presidency offer their views. By Elisabeth
Bumiller.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS-MONEY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Jon Corzine's victory in
New Jersey's Democratic U.S. Senate primary is just the most recent
reminder that candidates must nowadays spend enormous sums of money
_ either their own, or money they have collected _ if they hope to
have even a remote chance to be elected to the Congress or elected
president. It is nearly impossible for candidates armed only with
ideas but little or no money to win. One wonders: Could Abraham
Lincoln have defeated Corzine? By Don Van Natta.
</P>
<P>
   AD-CHARACTERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Although some longtime
advertising characters are being updated, other famous embodiments
of consumer products _ the Jolly Green Giant, Mr. Whipple, Mr.
Clean, Charlie the Tuna, Hawaiian Punch's Punchy and Clara
``Where's the Beef?'' Peller _ are being dusted off and presented,
largely unchanged, to a new generation of buyers. Advertising
experts debate the pros and cons of reintroducing and/or updating
ad characters from years past. By Thomas Vinciguerra.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE-ARGUE-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ On May 17, Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott and Minority Leader Tom Daschle lobbed verbal
vollies at each other in an angry, arm-waving screaming match on
the Senate floor. Some excerpts.

<P>
   BRITAIN-AFRICA-REVIEW (London) _ In Sierra Leone, a leader
pleads with British troops to stay on. In Zimbabwe, another leader
reviles just about everything that smacks of the British and tells
them to be gone. Binding the two images is Britain's colonial past
and, with it, a message that has some resonance for the United
States in its own new imperial age: Once power is extended, it
creates a stubborn, messy and enduring legacy. And even when
influence recedes, the tangle of obligation, expectation and
resentment linking erstwhile ruler to erstwhile ruled survives. By
Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-U.S.-REVIEW (Washington) _ Secretaries of State George
Shultz, James Baker, Warren Christopher and Madeleine Albright have
all said it: in making peace in the Middle East, Americans cannot
want peace more than the parties themselves. In other words, the
United States must be both available and aloof, appearing as a
willing partner but not an over-eager suitor. But time and patience
are the two things President Clinton no longer has. With only seven
months left as president, he even may want peace more than the
parties themselves. By Elaine Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   EASTEUROPE-WOMEN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Women have borne the brunt
of the changes that have overtaken the lands of eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union since the fall of communism. While the
picture varies vastly from the developed countries of central
Europe to huge, impoverished swaths from the Balkans to central
Asia, women have enjoyed less of the fruits of any economic
improvement than their male counterparts and simultaneously
shouldered almost all of the stresses brought by a total change of
lifestyle. By Alison Smale.

   WASHINGTON _ A nice irony of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's
decision last week is that he rejected the suggestion of smashing
the world's most powerful software company into a bunch of ``Baby
Bills,'' and instead proposed to split Microsoft into two behemoths
that would dominate their respective markets.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a major legacy of the Clinton administration will be
that it encouraged one of the greatest periods of industrial
concentration in American history, affecting old and new sectors
ranging from oil and pharmaceuticals, to telecommunications,
broadcasting and the Internet. Call it the Age of Oligopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate mergers have grown so frequent and so large, said
Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, that
``there's not a week that goes by that we're not called upon to
review a big merger that has significant implications for the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seven Sisters oil companies have shrunk to five (or even
fewer if you consider the joint marketing and production agreements
between them); the seven Baby Bells are now four; and American and
foreign car producers, once great rivals, are now intertwined to
the point where it is difficult to figure out who actually
manufactures the Mercedes, Chrysler, Nissan or Volvo next to you at
a traffic light.
</P>
<P>
   As last week's headlines made clear, no corner of the economy
seems untouched. Executives from the parent company of American
Airlines were in talks about possible mergers with Delta or
Northwest, prompted by United Airlines' decision to acquire USAir.
The Federal Communications Commission approved AT&AMP;T's acquisition
of MediaOne, troubling consumer advocates by clearing the way for
the emergence of a company that will control about a third of the
cable television market, large television programming units, and
the biggest high-speed Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a new round of packaged food mergers, set off after
Unilever, the maker of Lipton Tea, Ragu tomato sauces and Breyers
ice cream, offered $20 billion to buy Bestfoods, producer of Skippy
peanut butter, Mueller's pastas and Thomas' English muffins.
</P>
<P>
   While there are undoubted economic benefits to consolidation _
cheaper goods, more uniform quality and better distribution _
economics and antitrust theory cannot measure the fundamental
changes in the character and quality of life that comes with size.
For example, economic analysis won't tell how to deal with, say,
the merger of banks and insurance companies and the potential
privacy threats that result when one company holds both your
medical and financial records.
</P>
<P>
   The gospel that bigness is not necessarily badness has been
preached on both sides of the political aisle for about 20 years.
During the 12 years of the Reagan and Bush administrations, an era
widely remembered for frenzied merger activity and devotion to a
laissez-faire regulatory approach, there were 44,518 mergers and
acquisitions in the United States, with a combined value of $2.17
trillion, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. By
contrast, the seven-and-a-half years of the Clinton administration
have witnessed 71,811 corporate deals valued at $6.66 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in perhaps the most dynamic economy in at least a
generation or more,'' Pitofsky said. ``There are many firms trying
to adjust to new economic circumstances and global competition,
striving to find new efficiencies. That's all fine with us. It's
the relatively few mergers that present problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, however, the days of Small Is Beautiful, the title of
E.F. Schumacher's 1960s paean to smallness of economic scale, now
seem a quaint relic of an earlier age.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go back to a Jeffersonian world or a literal Brandeis
concern about human-sized institutions because we'd pay a terrible
efficiency price in terms of technological innovation and global
competitiveness,'' said Harvey J. Goldschmid, an antitrust expert
at Columbia Law School. ``The trick is take account of the modern
needs for efficiency but still use antitrust to give us workably
competitive markets.''
</P>
<P>
   When is a marketplace sufficiently competitive in the minds of
regulators?
</P>
<P>
   ``Antitrust authorities don't worry about consolidation per se,
they only worry about it when it gets to the tipping point,'' said
Robert Litan, a former antitrust official in the Justice Department
and now director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution.
That point, in many cases, is reached when a market is effectively
controlled by just one or two players, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some notable instances when the Clinton
administration has blocked or restructured mergers that would have
passed unscathed under the Republicans. Still, more than 95 percent
of the cases reviewed have encountered no resistance from federal
antitrust officials.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, only a handful of critics and lawmakers have raised
concerns about the increasing size of corporations and
concentration of markets, though some are questioning whether
antitrust law is able to factor in the noneconomic costs of all the
dealmaking.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the FCC, for instance, approved AT&AMP;T's merger with
MediaOne, only one of the commissioners expressed any significant
concern about the declining number of media voices that will result
from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the FCC's approval means that five companies will
control 40 of the 59 viable cable networks, the commissioner,
Gloria Tristani, wrote, ``It's time for the FCC to realize that we
are not dealing with bottled water or sneakers, but with the
dissemination of news and information _ the lifeblood of our
democratic way of life. In the last few years, the number of
entitles that control what people watch on television has dwindled
to alarming levels. With this decision, the FCC has failed yet
again to stem this crisis and ensure a robust marketplace of
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Crispin Miller, director of the Project on Media Ownership
and a professor of media studies at New York University, said
current antitrust tools fail to recognize what is actually lost by
all the mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger of media concentration lies not in the risk of
prices getting higher, which is what antitrust measures,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real danger is much subtler. You're talking about the
disappearance of alternative views. You're talking about an
exponential increase in conflicts of interest. You're talking about
fewer interests having greater market power. You're talking about
the rise of trivial programming. These are consequences that are
extremely troubling, that worry most Americans, but that don't
attract any kind of sustained political or judicial attention
because they are not simply economically quantifiable.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, the march to oligopoly seems irreversible.
Microsoft, if broken up into separate operating-systems and
applications companies, will hardly be high-tech start-ups in a
garage. They will cover the world with their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology will not go backwards and the integration of
markets will not go backwards and the growth of the global
shareholder, putting more and more countries and companies under
the microscope of investor scrutiny will not go backwards,'' said
Daniel Yergin, whose book, ``The Commanding Heights,'' is about the
changing balance between governments and international markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the same forces that have helped propel growth could slow it
down, if not reverse it. Globalization has been financed largely by
the world's investors, particularly institutions like pension and
retirement funds, which relentlessly seek higher returns for their
money. This has put enormous pressure on companies to find new
markets and produce ever stronger quarterly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   An economic downturn could cause investors to pull their money
out of stocks, and lead governments to erect barriers to free
trade. This would make it harder and less profitable for
multinationals to sell their products around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the world shouldn't hold its breath waiting for
businesses to shrink. There is just too much commercial logic on
the side of size. The real job ahead is for governments and
individuals to learn how to benefit from and to some extent control
the vast corporations the age has spawned.

trillion, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. By
contrast, the seven-and-a-half years of the Clinton administration
have witnessed 71,811 corporate deals valued at $6.66 trillion.

   ``We live in perhaps the most dynamic economy in at least a
generation or more,'' Pitofsky said. ``There are many firms trying
to adjust to new economic circumstances and global competition,
striving to find new efficiencies. That's all fine with us. It's
the relatively few mergers that present problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, however, the days of Small Is Beautiful, the title of
E.F. Schumacher's 1960s paean to smallness of economic scale, now
seem a quaint relic of an earlier age.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go back to a Jeffersonian world or a literal Brandeis
concern about human-sized institutions because we'd pay a terrible
efficiency price in terms of technological innovation and global
competitiveness,'' said Harvey J. Goldschmid, an antitrust expert
at Columbia Law School. ``The trick is take account of the modern
needs for efficiency but still use antitrust to give us workably
competitive markets.''
</P>
<P>
   When is a marketplace sufficiently competitive in the minds of
regulators?
</P>
<P>
   ``Antitrust authorities don't worry about consolidation per se,
they only worry about it when it gets to the tipping point,'' said
Robert Litan, a former antitrust official in the Justice Department
and now director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution.
That point, in many cases, is reached when a market is effectively
controlled by just one or two players, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some notable instances when the Clinton
administration has blocked or restructured mergers that would have
passed unscathed under the Republicans. Still, more than 95 percent
of the cases reviewed have encountered no resistance from federal
antitrust officials.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, only a handful of critics and lawmakers have raised
concerns about the increasing size of corporations and
concentration of markets, though some are questioning whether
antitrust law is able to factor in the noneconomic costs of all the
dealmaking.
</P>
<P>

</P>

</P>
<P>
   When the FCC, for instance, approved AT&AMP;T's merger with
MediaOne, only one of the commissioners expressed any significant
concern about the declining number of media voices that will result
from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the FCC's approval means that five companies will
control 40 of the 59 viable cable networks, the commissioner,
Gloria Tristani, wrote, ``It's time for the FCC to realize that we
are not dealing with bottled water or sneakers, but with the
dissemination of news and information _ the lifeblood of our
democratic way of life. In the last few years, the number of
entitles that control what people watch on television has dwindled
to alarming levels. With this decision, the FCC has failed yet
again to stem this crisis and ensure a robust marketplace of
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Crispin Miller, director of the Project on Media Ownership
and a professor of media studies at New York University, said
current antitrust tools fail to recognize what is actually lost by
all the mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger of media concentration lies not in the risk of
prices getting higher, which is what antitrust measures,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real danger is much subtler. You're talking about the
disappearance of alternative views. You're talking about an
exponential increase in conflicts of interest. You're talking about
fewer interests having greater market power. You're talking about
the rise of trivial programming. These are consequences that are
extremely troubling, that worry most Americans, but that don't
attract any kind of sustained political or judicial attention
because they are not simply economically quantifiable.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, the march to oligopoly seems irreversible.
Microsoft, if broken up into separate operating-systems and
applications companies, will hardly be high-tech start-ups in a
garage. They will cover the world with their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology will not go backwards and the integration of
markets will not go backwards and the growth of the global
shareholder, putting more and more countries and companies under
the microscope of investor scrutiny will not go backwards,'' said
Daniel Yergin, whose book, ``The Commanding Heights,'' is about the
changing balance between governments and international markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the same forces that have helped propel growth could slow it
down, if not reverse it. Globalization has been financed largely by
the world's investors, particularly institutions like pension and
retirement funds, which relentlessly seek higher returns for their
money. This has put enormous pressure on companies to find new
markets and produce ever stronger quarterly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   An economic downturn could cause investors to pull their money
out of stocks, and lead governments to erect barriers to free
trade. This would make it harder and less profitable for
multinationals to sell their products around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the world shouldn't hold its breath waiting for
businesses to shrink. There is just too much commercial logic on
the side of size. The real job ahead is for governments and
individuals to learn how to benefit from and to some extent control
the vast corporations the age has spawned.

<P>
   LONDON _ It was the English who first formalized rules for the
sport called ``the beautiful game,'' but the country is less known
these days for the gracefulness its athletes show on the soccer
field than for the ugliness its rabid supporters cause off it.
</P>
<P>
   When the country's national team begins its participation Monday
in a biennial Europewide competition being held this year in
Belgium and the Netherlands, a team of crack English police
officers will be taking up their positions in front of computer
screens at the National Crime Intelligence Service here to monitor
the moves of the thousands of English fans who have followed their
heroes across the Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The English soccer players enter the Euro 2000 tournament with
the worst record of any of the 16 teams that qualified. The English
police start the contest with the best reputation for handling
rampaging soccer thugs because they have had so much experience at
it.
</P>
<P>
   As a reflection of what a serious national matter soccer
hooliganism has become for England, the responsibility for
combating it has been assigned to the top-level intelligence agency
that was created in 1992 to combat organized crime, international
drug dealing, money laundering, immigration fraud and
counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
   While English athletic authorities are eager to shed the rioting
fan reputation to enhance the country's effort to become the host
of the 2006 World Cup, the concern goes far beyond sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect of football hooliganism is to shame the nation
every time it happens,'' said Mark Steels, the intelligence
service's chief spokesman. ``It does about as much damage to
England's image as any other form of international activity. After
a while, people abroad start thinking that if English fans are like
that, that's what all the English are like.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the favored slang word for the men who shave their heads,
paint their faces in team colors, strip down to their ample waists,
drink far too much and beat up opposing fans, foreigners all the
better, Steels said, ``Our reputation has been badly sullied by
this bunch of yobs.''
</P>
<P>
   A glass case in the room where the special intelligence squad
works displays the tools of the soccer hooligan trade: retractable
blades hidden in belt buckles, lighters and pens, brass knuckles,
iron bars, spray cans of immobilizing gas and stubby carpentry
knives used for inflicting cheek-length facial slashes. On a
bulletin board are a collection of calling cards the thugs leave
with people they have bloodied. The Silver Cod Squad's reads, ``Now
is a time to convalesce, for you've been done by the SCS.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware that the public shares their desire to rein in the army of
soccer toughs, the police have posted ``England needs you''
advertisements asking people to phone a number known as the
``hooligan hot line'' with information about rabble-rousers.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreaks abroad are happening at a time when at home the
soccer match violence of the 1970s and 1980s has subsided.
Principal stadiums have been rebuilt with all standing-room
terraces removed, family-friendly regulations and drinking
restrictions have been put in place, stewards are positioned at
entrances and security cameras have been installed to permit visual
checks of every seat. Opposing fans sit apart from one another
during the game and are steered away from one another as they exit
the parks by mounted police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Belgians in particular know the cost of English fans on a tear.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, violence by backers of Liverpool at the Heysel stadium
in Brussels caused a crowd stampede that killed 39 supporters of
the opposing Italian team and led to a five-year ban on English
clubs playing on the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   Last month English and Turkish fans rioted in the main square of
Copenhagen, just weeks after they had convulsed downtown Istanbul
where two supporters of Leeds United were stabbed to death. The
Dutch police are wary of new vengeful clashes since Turkey plays
Italy on Sunday in Arnhem, just 50 miles from Eindhoven, where
England plays Portugal on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a get-tough strategy, the Dutch police say they intend to
dispel their reputation for being Europe's most laid back force,
and Belgian officials say their officers will be able to detain
people on minimum suspicion. Jeu Springers, president of the Dutch
football federation, said, ``I don't know what the English
supporters intend to do and we know their reputation, but if
they're coming with the intention of destroying our cities, we have
a zero tolerance policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Alain Courtois, a director of the tournament, said at a Brussels
press conference, ``We know some people are coming here to cause
trouble, but they have to know they can be arrested based on the
feeling of the policeman and can be held for 12 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Eindhoven have announced that only half-strength
beer will be on sale in areas where fans will be gathering for
England's opening match. In Charleroi, the small Belgian town that
is the scene for the game next Saturday that law enforcement people
fear most _ England vs. Germany _ the garage of a 19th-century
gendarmerie near the stadium has been converted into a detention
center with steel bars and cellblocks capable of holding a total of
1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   German fans rioted in France during the World Cup two years ago
and left a policeman permanently maimed, and Berlin has responded
by passing a law that has enabled authorities to bar 2,700
identified hooligans from leaving the country. The English police
sought a similar law, but the government did not produce it.
</P>
<P>
   The English authorities are able to hold back 99 troublemakers
who have so-called international travel bans, but it cannot bar
travel by 416 others who have only national bans. Instead the
police have furnished the Dutch and Belgian police with photos and
information about them and 500 other potential rioters and have
sent men called ``football intelligence officers'' from England
over to the sites of games.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans, the Dutch and the Turks all have belligerent fans
and histories of melees, but Steels, of England's intelligence
service, is impatient with people here who argue that the English
are not to blame for much of the violence that occurs when they go
abroad. ``Yes, it's always somebody else's fault,'' he said
wearily.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll say the police were too tough or the police were too
soft, the stadium was the wrong shape, the Turks provoked us, we
found ourselves at the wrong end of the pitch, they don't have a
proper lager, they don't speak English in `them' countries, you
can't get a cab at 4 in the morning, nobody told us this was the
red-light district, they didn't serve Theakstons bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are people supposed to react to seeing their wonderful
historic cities laid waste?'' he went on. ``People in Germany
certainly know about drinking beer, but that doesn't mean they're
used to people who start doing it at 12 noon and are still standing
up eight hours later, their guts all sunburned, singing patriotic
songs after doing nothing but laying about and drinking all day.''

GAY TEACHER'S DISCLOSURE SPURS A DEBATE  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTON, Mass. _ A first-grade teacher who told his students that
he was gay has provoked a debate among parents and educators here
about how soon is too soon to talk about sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, David Gaita, who has worked at Burr Elementary
School in this suburb of Boston for five years, apparently did not
plan to ``come out'' to his students on May 17, when he was
teaching about biographies. But when students asked about his
family and whom he lived with, he is said to have told his class
that if he had a partner, ``someone you love the way your mom and
dad love each other,'' it would be a man.
</P>
<P>
   The out-of-curriculum lesson led some parents to question
whether Gaita should have told his students he was gay without
first informing parents. At a Parent-Teacher Organization meeting
late last month, some parents said they thought it was their place
to teach _ or not teach _ their children about homosexuality. Brian
Camenker, director of a conservative parents' group and the father
of a Burr student, told The Boston Globe that ``a child's
psychology isn't put together for any of this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Young, the Newton public schools superintendent, said he
supported the way Gaita answered the students' questions. Gaita has
declined to comment publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the teacher at that point said, `I'm married and have two
kids,' no one would have blinked an eye,'' Young said, adding that
``there should not be a double standard for heterosexual and
homosexual teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor David Cohen of Newton said he would have been pleased to
have Gaita as the teacher of his own children. ``It's quite clear
he handled the situation with sensitivity and discretion,'' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the class, Gaita sent a letter to his students' parents
explaining what had happened. But as accounts of the incident began
to spread, Cynthia Bencal, the principal, sent a note to all
parents on May 22 explaining the context of Gaita's statement. It
read in part: ``One student asked him if he liked being gay and he
said that that was a hard question to answer. He said that he was
proud of who he was and that he knew he was a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Swift, whose children attend the Burr school, said she was
unperturbed when she asked her daughter how her class went that day
and heard: ``Good. Mr. Gaita told us he was gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift sympathized with parents who want to control what their
children learn, but, from what they see on television to what they
hear on the playground, ``there are many things we can't shelter
our kids from,'' she said. ``I'm grateful that my child can learn
about this in a natural, relaxed manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of educators in explaining homosexuality has been under
scrutiny here recently. On May 19, the state education commissioner
fired an HIV and AIDS education coordinator who conducted a teen
talk on ``queer sex'' as part of a gay and lesbian conference at
Tufts University. The commission called the discussion prurient and
not for the high school students who attended.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Glennon, who heads a lesbian and gay civil rights
committee for the Massachusetts Teachers Association, said Gaita
was not the first first-grade teacher to have told his class he was
gay, and in this context, it was more a lesson in relationships
than in sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a first-grade teacher and you talk about your
husband or your wife, you're not talking about sex either,''
Glennon said. ``You're talking about your family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless people are willing to be out _ just be who they are _
then we send the message to students that all families are supposed
to look a certain way,'' Glennon said.

PUTIN SEEKS ALLIES IN QUEST TO COUNTER U.S. MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Vladimir Putin had barely said farewell to
President Clinton last week before the Russian leader and top aides
fanned out across Europe to campaign against American plans for a
national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   On whirlwind trips to Brussels and Rome, the Russians sought to
persuade the Europeans that a blend of diplomacy, vigilance and
Russian technology would be a better way to cope with the emerging
missile threat.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Kremlin announced that Putin would undertake a
diplomatic mission to North Korea, the very ``rogue nation''
Washington has cited to justify its plan.
</P>
<P>
   Given Russia's economic weakness, the new Russian president is
not looking for a confrontation with the United States. But neither
is he very pliable.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it seems as if Putin, the former KGB agent who spent the
waning days of the Cold War in East Germany, is trying to split the
Europeans from the Americans. It is a classic Kremlin tactic,
wielded with a heavy hand in Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Putin is more gentle, insisting only that Russia is a
fellow European power and as such more concerned with preserving
the framework of arms control than what many Europeans see as the
go-it-alone Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a public relations war over missile defense and all's
fair in PR wars,'' a Clinton administration official said of the
new Russian stand. ``Some of it has been sophisticated. Some has
been crude. But we have really seen an activist Russian foreign
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had been accustomed to dealing with
Boris Yeltsin, a sickly leader who nonetheless had a rapport with
leaders like President Clinton and former German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl. But while Putin's relations with Western leaders are more
correct than close, he has engaged in a surprising burst of
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election two months ago, Putin has visited Britain,
Italy, Belarus, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Over the next
six weeks, he is headed to Spain, Germany, Moldova, Tajikistan,
China, North Korea and Japan, where he will attend the summit of
the major industrialized nations, and possibly to South Korea.
Visits to the United States, India and Brunei, the site of an Asian
summit, are also planned for the rest of the year _ but so far not
to France, which has been fiercely critical of Russia's war in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   A principal goal of the globe-trotting Russian leader is to lure
Western investment, an important element of his plan to strengthen
his nation's economy and restore Russia as a world power. He also
is looking for relief from his nation's mammoth debts, which is a
major purpose of his upcoming German trip.
</P>
<P>
   Countering the Clinton administration's missile defense plan and
its insistence that the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty be
amended to accommodate it, however, is clearly a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians understand that the first phase of the American
plan would have little effect on their nuclear forces. But they
fear it would lay the basis for still grander plans, which would
give the United States a strategic advantage. Having failed to
persuade Washington to abandon its push to build a nationwide
antimissile system, the Kremlin is doing the next best thing: It is
working on America's allies.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, for example, fear that the American plan to place
100 interceptors in Alaska and to build a battle-management radar
system would undermine the framework of arms control accords and
ignite an arms race. They are also not entirely convinced that
there is a new missile threat, and they are keenly aware that the
Clinton administration missile defense plan is not designed to
protect them.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian diplomacy has been designed to exploit all of these
fears. At a meeting on Friday at NATO headquarters, Marshal Igor
Sergeyev, the Russian defense minister, presented a Russian
alternative, which he dubbed a plan for ``European, nonstrategic
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The not-so-subtle message is that Russia, unlike the United
States, has a plan that not only protects the European continent
from an evolving missile threat, but would be consistent with the
ABM treaty, which is widely seen as the bulwark of arms control as
pursued to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Russian policy is trying to use the European
skepticism for its own purposes,'' said Karl Kaiser, a German
foreign policy analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is also calculating that the Europeans view their Russian
neighbor as more of a potential partner than the Americans. By
casting himself as a philosophical ally, Putin is also trying to
win friends and secure funds from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of just saying `no' and saying that we do not see a
threat, Putin is proposing a way to address it,'' said Aleksei
Arbatov, a defense expert and deputy in the Russian parliament. ``I
think it is a very smart policy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, the Kremlin's approach is far less
confrontational than the Soviet Union's campaign in the 1980s
against NATO's decision to deploy medium-range missiles to counter
the Soviet SS-20s. American officials say, however, that when
Putin's proposals are examined carefully there is less convergence
than meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the case with Putin's strategy on missile
defense.
</P>
<P>
   At the NATO meetings on Friday, Marshal Sergeyev presented a
seven-step plan so vague in outline that it appeared more of a
debating point than a blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   Under his proposal, NATO nations and Russia would first evaluate
the missile threat and develop a joint European and Russian defense
that would use theater anti-missile systems. These are systems that
are designed to intercept shorter-range missiles, not long-range
ballistic missiles, and as such are allowed under the terms of the
ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have suggested nonetheless that these systems might
have some use against the emerging missile threat. Marshal Sergeyev
did not say, however, whether the theater defense would be used to
blow up missiles on their way up or to intercept warheads on their
way down. Nor did he provide any detailed account of how the
defense system would work.
</P>
<P>
   American officials assert that the Russian approach is neither
technically feasible nor, if fully carried out, consistent with the
ABM accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage we know very little about what, if anything, the
Russians have in mind at a detailed technical level,'' Walter B.
Slocombe, the U.S. undersecretary of defense, said after the NATO
session. Defense Secretary William Cohen and his aides will have a
chance to investigate further at meetings in Moscow this week.
</P>
<P>
   While the Europeans harbor doubts about the American missile
defense scheme, they are unlikely to rally around the Russian plan.
Western European nations are reluctant to spend their limited
military funds on missile defense, regardless of whether the
technology originates in the United States or Russia. There were
few questions from European diplomats about the details of the
Russian scheme at the NATO meeting, Western officials say, because
the Europeans are not interested in developing anti-missile
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, however, is not counting only on the Europeans. He is
also likely to encourage opposition to the American missile defense
plan during his visit to Beijing. The Chinese are already strongly
opposed to Washington's plan, and Putin is expected to encourage
them to remain firm. The goal is to create the impression that it
is not just Russia that is upset with the American missile defense
plans but China and Europe, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is also expected to use his visit to North Korea, the
first ever by a Russian president, to cast doubt on the rationale
for the American missile defense plan. The Russian leader will
likely use the trip to portray North Korea as a rational government
that is emerging from its isolation and to try to debunk the
American notion that North Korea is an irrational ``rogue'' state
that is likely to hurl a missile at the West at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   After the flurry of Russian moves last week, Putin called
President Clinton on Friday to express his appreciation for a
workmanlike summit and to state his commitment to deeper arms cuts.
American officials said Putin's tone was polite but doubted it
heralded a breakthrough on the missile defense issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin might say `no' at first but it would eventually mean
`yes,' '' a Clinton administration official said. ``Putin says
`yes' when he means `no.' He says I agree with you and then
elaborates. And after you examine his elaboration you discover
there is almost no agreement there.''

   TEN-FRENCH-OPEN (Paris) _ Francoise Durr leaned forward and gave
Mary Pierce a kiss on each cheek, then held her tight and patted
her back. Durr, who won this French Open title in 1967, had been
waiting with increasing impatience for 33 years for another
Frenchwoman to win the tennis tournament that matters most in
France. Saturday, her vigil came to an end as Pierce proved too
strong physically and mentally for Conchita Martinez, winning the

COUP TALK EMPTIES BEACHES AND FIJI'S CASH REGISTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NADI, Fiji _ On approximately 299 and two-thirds of its 300
islands, there are no indications that Fiji is in turmoil, with
rebels occupying Parliament and holding three dozen hostages who
include the elected prime minister, much of his Cabinet, and the
daughter of the country's president.
</P>
<P>
   As Brad Ammann, a 29-year-old honeymooner from Hermosa Beach,
Calif., put it: ``The only sign there's a coup going on is that
there's nobody around.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is very quiet here in the main tourist city. But if
that is good news for the few visitors still enjoying these South
Sea islands, it is also an economic disaster in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's primary industry is tourism, but with hotels and resorts
at less than 10 percent of capacity, thousands of Fijians have been
laid off or put on sharply reduced hours. The second-biggest
industry is sugar cultivation, but with the European Union taking
steps to boycott Fijian sugar, and farmers refusing to harvest cane
to protest the attempted coup, Fiji Sugar Corp. also has said it
may soon lay off 3,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The third big source of jobs is garment manufacturing, which has
boomed since the mid-1990s when Australia granted preferential
tariff treatment to Fijian-made clothes. But with Australian trade
unions declining to handle any cargo to or from Fiji during the
hostage crisis, that industry has quickly sagged too.
</P>
<P>
   Schools and many small stores are also closed. Soni Kanta, the
manager of Ashiyara, a nearly deserted Indian restaurant in the
capital city, Suva, said the other evening that the armed rebels
``are not thinking of ordinary Fijians at all.'' She made an angry
gesture in the direction of the parliamentary complex. ``This is
simply hurting everybody in the country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fijians are enormously graceful people, and many seem to have a
remarkable ability to joke about their plight or say they have
faith that all will be for the best. Still, individual tales of woe
abound.
</P>
<P>
   One such story is that of Muhammad Ali Nasir, who emerged from
his home the other day to give aid to a foreign visitor who had
inadvertently lodged his rental car in a ditch while giving wide
berth to an oncoming truck full of goats on a seaside road in Nadi.
</P>
<P>
   Nasir has been a wood carver for 35 of his 49 years, and he has
a little shop in one of the resorts here. ``The hotel is
first-class, there is no doubt,'' Nasir said. ``And I am, if I may
modestly say, a world-classy wood carver. But right now there is
nobody to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   So he is in danger of not being able to afford the rent anymore,
explained Nasir, a Muslim whose grandparents, like those of many
Fijians of Indian descent, were brought to Fiji as indentured
laborers in the sugar trade in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Nasir's economic distress soon made the foreigner's
car-in-a-ditch problem pale in comparison, and the latter was soon
solved anyway with the help of a friendly neighbor of Nasir who
happened to own a tractor.
</P>
<P>
   Over a cup of tea in a neighbor's home, Nasir was philosophical:
The crisis would soon end, he hoped, and he could then resume
selling his carvings _ everything from salad bowls to replicas of
coconut palms swaying in the trade winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tourists will return,'' he said _ a mantra often repeated
here.
</P>
<P>
   There are still tourists. But with the United States and other
nations having advised citizens to defer ``nonessential travel'' to
Fiji during the standoff, they are here in only a fraction of their
normal numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Those that have come include travel-hardened young backpackers,
imperturbable retirees, and a group of Americans who made Nadi a
port of call the other evening during a South Seas yachting trip
from Palos Verdes, Calif., to New Zealand and back. (``Say,
whatever happened to Microsoft?'' asked one sailor, who said he had
been on the high seas for months and lost track of the government's
antitrust battle with the software giant.)
</P>
<P>
   Many others explained, as did Ammann and his bride, that they
lacked the travel insurance needed to reschedule a Fijian vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it when I heard there was a coup going on
in Fiji,'' said Ammann, a 29-year-old contractor. ``I thought: What
in the heck do Fijians have to be so upset about?'' (The rebels who
seized Parliament are nationalistic indigenous Fijians agitated
about the rise of Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, the first
ethnic Indian ever to hold that post. Indigenous Fijians make up
about 51 percent of the population of 812,000; ethnic Indians,
about 44 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   The Ammanns, married last month, decided to go ahead with their
two-and-a-half-week honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   Ammann concluded that the struggle was a ``local and political
thing, something between Fijians'' that would be unlikely to visit
violence upon foreigners.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Lorren, 27, an interior designer, said: ``We'd planned
this for so long. You only get one shot at a honeymoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling around the islands, the Ammanns had Fiji virtually to
themselves. On the island of Natadola, they checked into a
dozen-room resort, only to find they were indeed the sole guests.
</P>
<P>
   It conjures up an image of Arcadia for a honeymoon couple, of
course, to be alone on a South Pacific island.
</P>
<P>
   But as they walked about the resort, the two looked at each
other and Brad Ammann recalled remarking: ``This feels a little too
weird. This is really creepy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorren Ammann said: ``I'm so glad you said that. Let's get out
of here.''
</P>
<P>
   So the couple high-tailed it to a hotel resort in Nadi, which,
while uncrowded, does at least have a few people around.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shangri-La Fijian, on the island of Yanuca, occupancy is
down to 8 percent of capacity, and 7,500 room nights have been
canceled in the last three weeks, a loss of about $1.2 million for
the 436-room resort, said Wolf-Dieter Flecker, the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the resort told people who called to inquire about
conditions, Flecker said: ``We tell them Shangri-La is fully
operational, and it's up to them to choose whether to come.''
</P>
<P>
   In much of the country, there is no immediate sense of danger,
but the U.S. Department of State describes the whole situation as
``highly volatile,'' capable of turning ugly at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   David Hausmann, 19, a visitor from London, who was ``taking sort
of a gap here'' between high school and college, said such warnings
had added an undercurrent of tense excitement to his travels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what might happen. There is this sense of
things sort of being on the edge,'' said Hausmann, who was
wandering around the world with a backpack. ``There could be a
civil war. I really doubt it, though.''
</P>
<P>
   So do most Fijians, though they fret constantly these days about
what the current situation will do to their nation's image. Fiji is
one of several South Pacific nations that compete to market
themselves as the ultimate tropical paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the western part of the nation, which has the biggest
resorts and best beaches, as well as most of the sugar and Fiji's
biggest gold mine, and where race relations are often described as
better than in eastern Fiji, some village chiefs and others have
even proposed breaking off to form a separate country.
</P>
<P>
   That is an idea that has spread alarm in many quarters, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unity of the Fijian people has never been more important
than at this stage of our national development,'' Radike
Qereqeretabua, a top tourism official in Fiji, told reporters. ``A
secession of the western provinces will only break up the Fijian
people even further, to the detriment of the country as a whole,
and should not be a serious option.''

PIERCE BEATS MARTINEZ FOR FRENCH OPEN TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Francoise Durr leaned forward and gave Mary Pierce a
kiss on each cheek, then held her tight and patted her back.
</P>
<P>
   Durr, who won the French Open title in 1967, had been waiting
with increasing impatience for 33 years for another Frenchwoman to
win the tennis tournament that matters most in France. Saturday,
her vigil came to an end as Pierce proved too strong physically and
mentally for Conchita Martinez, winning the title by 6-2, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce had often been shaky on big occasions in the past and
often at odds with the Parisians who have sat and watched her in
recent years. But she had a much smoother ride this year,
demonstrating a more complete grasp of the game than when she last
reached the final here in 1994 and earning the support, if not
quite the adoration, of the French crowd, which cheered her warmly
but not wildly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would never win this tournament,'' the 25-year-old
Pierce said in French, fighting her way through tears in her
victory speech. ``It was my dream to win it and now it has come
true, and it's great for it to happen in front of all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Pierce's second Grand Slam singles title; she also won
the 1995 Australian Open, and it restored her to a place of
prominence in the game that she had lost in recent years with the
arrival of younger rivals like Martina Hingis, Lindsay Davenport
and the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a much better feeling than when I won in Australia in
1995,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She is a much better player, as well. Taught by her American
father, Jim, to swing with remarkable force from the baseline,
Pierce has long been able to slug a tennis ball with world-class
power, but in recent years, with the help of her former coach,
Michael de Jongh, and her current coach, her younger brother David,
she has improved her footwork, her volleys, her serve, her
consistency and her grasp of tactics.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of her boyfriend, Cleveland Indians second baseman
Roberto Alomar, and a deeper religious faith, she has also managed
to calm her nerves under duress. She now smiles more often than
groans when her huge shots go awry.
</P>
<P>
   In the semifinals here, when she beat Hingis, the No. 1 seed,
she lost the second set after squandering a match point and then
roared back to win in three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at all sure she would have been able to keep her
composure after losing that match point in previous years,'' said
Durr, who once coached Pierce as captain of the French Federation
Cup team. ``She has come a long way with her tennis, and I'm quite
delighted for her.''
</P>
<P>
   The sixth-seeded Pierce took control of the match in a hurry,
pressuring Martinez hard in her opening service game, which the
Spaniard managed to hold, and then winning five consecutive games
as her superior baseline power and Martinez's clearly tense mood
made for little suspense. The fifth-seeded Martinez, often dour on
court, credited a happier attitude with her run to this year's
final, but as she hit ball after ball ineffectively or hit them far
too short for her own benefit (Pierce makes a quick meal of short
balls), there was no trace of delight on her face.
</P>
<P>
   After just 27 minutes, she trailed by 1-5 and the crowd was
chanting ``Marie, Marie,'' but in her next service game she began
to loosen up and to begin putting her varied spins to more
effective use. She would hold to 5-2, saving three set points along
the way, and though Pierce would close out the opening set with
authority in the next game, the match would be a much more
intriguing and hotly contested encounter the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the second set and then
took a 30-0 lead on her serve in the third game, but Pierce won the
next point with a very well-disguised backhand drop shot winner _
the sort of shot she was incapable of hitting in 1994 _ and then
managed to break the Spaniard after a struggle with a fine backhand
that forced an error.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce would break Martinez's serve again, this time at love, in
the fifth game as Martinez finished off with a double fault. But
just as it appeared that Pierce, up a break and with a 3-2 lead,
would begin to impose her will, she played a poor game. Martinez
broke back to make it 3-3. It would not be until Martinez served in
the 11th game that the match would turn for good. Pierce, doing her
best to stay aggressive despite the moment, pushed forward with
regularity and would end up breaking Martinez's serve with an
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   All that remained was for Pierce to stretch again on the final
changeover _ she suffered no effects of the cramps that she
experienced against Hingis in the semifinals _ and serve the most
important game of her career. It would not be easy. On her first
match point at 40-30, she dumped a forehand in the net after a long
rally. On her second, she hit a nervous backhand wide.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez returned the favor on the next point and this time
Pierce would find the solution: a powerful first serve up the
middle that Martinez scraped with her forehand into the net. Both
Pierce's arms shot in the air as she wheeled to face her brother
David and her French mother, Yannick. And appropriately for a woman
who was born in Canada, has lived most of her life in the United
States and has represented France since her teens, she gave her
victory speech in French and English.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things have gone on these last few years,'' she told
the crowd, holding back tears. ``I think I will never, never forget
this day.''
</P>
<P>
   In the men's final Sunday, Magnus Norman, trying to emerge from
the shadow of Swedish Grand Slam champions Bjorn Borg, Mats
Wilander and Stefan Edberg, will meet Gustavo Kuerten, the gangly
Brazilian, who won the French Open in 1997.

PRESIDENT ASSAD OF SYRIA, KEY FIGURE IN MIDEAST, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  (With OBIT-ASSAD)  
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, a standard-bearer
of Arab nationalism and anti-Zionist fervor who ruled his country
with an iron hand for three decades, died Saturday. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Although Assad had long been in ill health, his sudden death,
described in early reports as a heart attack, casts a cloud of
uncertainty over the dynamics of peace and conflict in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had hoped to turn over the reins of power to his
34-year-old son, Bashar, and a crucial step toward that transition
was to have taken place next Saturday, during a rare political
convention of the Syrian Baath party. Reports from Damascus hours
after the death suggested that the transition would take place,
with the Syrian parliament amending the Constitution to allow it to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear how firm a grip the younger Assad may have in
Syria, meaning potential exists for a tense and destabilizing
transition at a crucial time in the relationship between Syria and
Lebanon and between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Although Assad took a resolutely hard line toward Israel, many
Western diplomats believed that he was the linchpin to any lasting
peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian television made an official announcement only after the
news had circulated internationally first. It showed members of the
Syrian parliament standing for a moment of silence, many of them
crying and holding their heads in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had survived several assassination attempts and at least
one heart attack. Despite his gaunt appearance and his infrequent
travels abroad, many in Syria had wondered if talk of his imminent
demise was not exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Bashar Assad was believed to be overseeing an
anti-corruption drive that had led to the resignation of several
prominent officials and the suicide of a former top official
accused of embezzlement. Bashar Assad was also engaged in a power
struggle behind the scenes with his uncle, Rifaat Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak spent many months
sending messages to Assad until, finally, Israel and Syria made an
aborted attempt at peace negotiations. After Israel withdrew its
troops from Lebanon last month, tentative questions about renewing
the effort were voiced by both sides. But Barak said he wondered if
Assad's heart would ever be in it.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, he issued this statement: ``Israel understands
the sorrow of the Syrian nation. Israel has worked in the past to
reach peace with Syria, and will continue to do so in the future,
with any leader.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, P.J. Crowley, the national security spokesman at
the White House, said the administration learned the news from
Syrian television. ``We think that the Syrian government has
committed itself to the path of peace, and we hope that will
continue even with the passing of President Assad,'' he said.

VOTER INITIATIVES SEEK TO OVERHAUL HEALTH INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Ariz., Ark., Okla., Mont., Ore., Md.)   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They were gently spoken and kind-eyed in their white
coats, but make no mistake: The handful of doctors and nurses
gathering signatures outside the Massachusetts Statehouse see
themselves as part of a popular health-care insurgency, and some
medical powers are taking them seriously enough to spend millions
of dollars trying to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   With one final petition drive this weekend, a coalition of
doctors, nurses, senior citizens groups, labor unions and others is
expected to collect the last several thousand signatures they need
to place before Massachusetts voters what experts call the most
sweeping health-care referendum on any state's ballot this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to tap into widespread discontent with inaction by
Congress and the Statehouse, the referendum would require the
Legislature to find a way to provide health-insurance coverage for
all by mid-2002 in a state where more than 600,000 people lack it.
</P>
<P>
   It would also introduce a patient's bill of rights that would
guarantee patients the freedom to choose their doctors and
guarantee doctors the freedom to choose the right treatment for
their patients. And it would put a temporary ban on the conversion
of nonprofit hospitals to for-profit.
</P>
<P>
   Similar white-coat rebellions are in the works elsewhere:
Campaigners in Washington state, too, are close to getting a
measure calling for universal health care onto the state ballot for
this fall, which would make this the first campaign season in which
more than one state had a universal-care initiative on the ballot,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In a handful of other states _ Arizona, Arkansas, Oklahoma and
Montana _ campaigns backing narrower health-care proposals, like
requiring tobacco settlement money to go toward health, are using
ballot initiatives as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening is an enormous backlash by the public,''
said Dr. Bernard Lown, a Nobel prize laureate and a leader of the
Massachusetts initiative drive.
</P>
<P>
   A push to overhaul the health-care system, he said, ``has to
come from below, from the state level; you're closer to the people,
you're closer to their pain, and they're more readily mobilized.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other campaigners say they believe a convergence of
several factors is at work in their favor. They point to the
swelling numbers of uninsured people, the trouble that many
patients have paying for their prescription drugs, the spiraling
costs of medical care and the widespread complaints from doctors
and nurses that new constraints are keeping them from offering the
best care to their patients.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition appears readily mobilized as well.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the Coalition for Health Care, which is
running the ballot campaign, is already opposed by the Committee
for Affordable Health Care Choices, which unites business
associations, managed-care organizations and other insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just getting into campaign readiness,'' said Richard C.
Lord, its spokesman and president of the state's biggest business
association. ``But it's probably going to take millions of dollars,
because if you want to get your message across to the voters, you
need to advertise, and that's very expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   His group's message, he said, will include the points that the
initiative could destroy the networks that are the very basis of
managed care, and could throw the health-care system into chaos by
the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also argues that the initiative is overly vague in
that it calls for universal health care but does not specify how it
is to be paid for. Several commissions in recent years have been
stymied by the question of who would pay that bill, Lord noted.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative's backers counter that the vagueness was
intentional, because it allowed the formation of a coalition that
included those who favor a Canadian-style single-payer system,
those who favor a Hawaiian-style requirement that employers provide
health insurance, and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been specifying the funding mechanisms forever,
and they've been losing,'' said John O'Connor, the campaign's
co-chairman and a veteran campaigner for environmental causes. ``We
want to keep the majority of voters together on the concept that
everybody has to be covered by a date certain,'' July 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by polls and the signature-gathering outside the
Statehouse on Friday, support is indeed broad for the general idea
of universal coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A few passers-by withheld judgment, but several signed with
alacrity. ``I'm definitely for universal health care,'' said Shuang
Wang, a 21-year-old intern at the Statehouse, ``though I don't know
where the money is going to come from.'' Another signer, Tom
McCarron, a lobbyist on transportation issues, said, ``I just think
it's vitally important that people be covered for health care. The
cost of it is just out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposals for universal coverage have been made repeatedly in
recent years around the United States, since well before the
Clinton administration tried to overhaul the country's health-care
system in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In liberal Massachusetts, a universal health-care proposal was
even enacted into law in the late 1980s, though the Statehouse went
from Democratic to Republican and the economy from flush to
hard-up, and the measure was repealed before it took effect.
</P>
<P>
   Usually measures calling for universal health care and other
sweeping changes have been defeated, said Diane Lardie, national
coordinator of UHCAN, the Universal Health Care Action Network, a
national group based in Cleveland. They have come up in more than
20 states, beginning in Ohio in 1989, Lardie said, but usually they
either failed to make it onto the ballot or died in a legislative
committee or on the floor of one house or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the difficulties with something like a health-care
issue is that health care is so complex that people are scared,''
she said, ``and they're willing to say, `Don't do anything,' as
opposed to `Change it for the better,' because they're afraid it
won't be for the better.''

   The Massachusetts and Washington state, initiatives are
important bellwethers to gauge whether public opinion has indeed
shifted, Lardie said. Maryland, too, is ``ahead of the pack,'' she
said. There a political push for universal health care is under
way, though it involves no referendum this year.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon, as well, is a spot to watch. Campaigners there had
planned a referendum on a health-care overhaul this season, they
said, but postponed it, in part because action is under way on the
legislative front. Also, Gov. John Kitzhaber of Oregon, a doctor,
called for universal health-care insurance for all Oregonians
earlier this year, saying he hoped to work out a proposal for the
2001 Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, other political avenues are being pursued.
State Sen. Richard T. Moore, the Senate chairman of the
Legislature's joint committee on health care, said he was confident
that legislators would pass their own patient's bill of rights
within the next month or so, one that would include the possibility
of external review for patients denied care by their managed-care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, a commission appointed by the governor to
examine health-care financing, quality and safety is to begin
meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
   He is concerned, Moore said, that the ballot initiative ``really
goes too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harris A. Berman, the chief executive of Tufts Health Plan
in Boston, also opposes the initiative, arguing that it can be
expected to raise the price of health care significantly by taking
away HMOs' ability to control costs. To him, the very existence of
the initiative, which tries to ``use oversimplification to solve a
very complex problem,'' is counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a health-care system hurting as badly as Massachusetts',''
Berman said, ``with every hospital and just about every health plan
losing money and home health-care operations going out of business,
to spend millions of dollars that should be used on health care on
this fight is just a travesty.''
</P>
<P>
   But campaigners say they will soldier on, regardless of
criticism and possible legislative action, convinced that universal
health care would save money by improving access to preventive care
and thus avoiding expensive emergency-room visits. And, he said, it
is also the morally correct path.
</P>
<P>
   John Kenneth Galbraith, the economist, has lent his name to the
campaign and said he was supporting the initiative because he
joined ``with all sensible people in not wanting to see anyone die
because they can't afford the requisite medical treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had grave doubts about whether health care ``can be a
business enterprise, where one saves money by cutting back care.''

COMMENTARY: FREUD WAS WAY WRONG 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picking up where we left off ...
</P>
<P>
   In those far away, long ago days of feminism, there was talk
about equal pay for equal work. Now there's talk about ``girl
money.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine, in her early 30s, says she hears the term
bandied about the New York dating scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find most disturbing about the 1950s-ification and
retrogression of women's lives is that it has seeped into corporate
and social culture, where it can do real damage,'' she says.
``Otherwise intelligent men, who know women still earn less than
men as a rule, say things like: `I'll get the check. You only have
girl money.'''
</P>
<P>
   My friend also notes that at three wedding showers she went to
this year, the presents were always very '50s _ soup ladles and
aprons were unwrapped with see-through nighties and push-up
brassieres.
</P>
<P>
   So, are we evolving backward?
</P>
<P>
   In The New York Observer this week, Nina Burleigh writes about
how depressing it is to see former ``national nymphet'' Jane Fonda,
former Yale Law School superstar Hillary Rodham and former Miami TV
news anchor Donna Hanover all scrambling to recreate careers and
patch up dignity, after their men took up ``with younger or more
pliant females.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Feminism wasn't supposed to mean brokenhearted women in middle
age,'' Burleigh says. Of Jane, Hillary and Donna, she asks:
``Couldn't they conduct themselves with a little more spite and
spirit?''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that we've made some evolutionary miscalculations.
</P>
<P>
   We started out, in the '70s, wanting to ape men. Dress like
them, in navy blue suits and floppy ties and sensible shoes. Joust
for that big office and those big stressful jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But once we got far enough along to see that we could achieve
male status and power, we recoiled at the idea of doing it on male
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Why be rats on a treadmill, butting heads constantly, drinking
too much, having heart attacks and falling into affairs with office
playthings?
</P>
<P>
   Women are not not going backward. We're moving ahead, at home
and at work _ in any combination of the two. We're just moving in
less predictable and programmatic ways. We can be rescued or choose
not to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't replicate men _ and who would want to?'' says Natalie
Angier, who writes about biology for The New York Times and in her
book, ``Woman: An Intimate Geography.''
</P>
<P>
   Women, she says, are in a new phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Female primates have two goals,'' she explains. ``They want
control over their reproduction and access to resources.''
Unfortunately, male primates have the same two goals; they want
control over female reproduction too.
</P>
<P>
   We have a conflict of gender interest, so it turns out to be
counterproductive for women to imitate men.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, right up through Hillary Rodham, the best route
to status and children was through a powerful husband. ``But now,
because men often don't stick around, the husband route no longer
looks as good to women,'' Angier says.
</P>
<P>
   Freud believed that men had something that women wanted. But it
wasn't what he thought.
</P>
<P>
   Women don't want to be men _ except in the way men often grow
more attractive and powerful as they age and are so easily able to
start fresh, in their 50s and 60s and even older, with younger
women.
</P>
<P>
   Angier suggests that someday women in their 20s will be freed
from a biological deadline by routinely freezing eggs for use at
any time.
</P>
<P>
   Women's liberation now means being liberated from stereotypes
about what women want. Consider this: Hollywood, which is always
rediscovering the obvious, is shocked that female moviegoers prefer
Russell Crowe in ``Gladiator'' and Martin Lawrence in ``Big Momma's
House'' to chick flicks like the Natalie Portman-Ashley Judd movie
``Where the Heart Is'' or Kim Basinger's ``I Dreamed of Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Girls have always gone for the cute guys slaying the dragon, or
in the case of ``Gladiator,'' the tiger. And they always will.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sherak of 20th Century Fox told USA Today that women must
have liked ``Big Momma'' because the Fox marketing execs
brilliantly created ads to appeal to them. While Martin Lawrence in
a dress was holding a gun in the outdoor ads, the newspaper ads
tried to lure women by switching to Lawrence in a dress holding a
rolling pin.
</P>
<P>
   It's pathetic that they think that is why women went to see the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, women like guns.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Dr. Freud.

COMMENTARY: THE LAST REFUGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered a breakup of
Microsoft along the lines proposed by the Justice Department. In so
doing, he in effect dismissed concerns about the economic impact of
such a breakup, and accepted the claim by Justice that splitting up
Microsoft would accelerate innovation.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, technology guru Nicholas Negroponte, speaking
in London, bitterly attacked Britain's recent auction of licenses
for next-generation mobile telecommunications. Although selling the
licenses to the highest bidders has enriched her majesty's Treasury
by $35 billion, he argued that they should instead have been given
to firms that would do best in ``stimulating innovation,
stimulating the economy, stimulating the whole telecommunications
process.'' And last week the French decided not to emulate
Britain's auction, instead allocating licenses in a ``beauty
contest'' (their phrase!) based on ``merit.''
</P>
<P>
   What do these stories have in common? In each case conventional
economic analysis of costs and benefits has been brushed aside, in
favor of guesses about the effects of policy on technological
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Microsoft decision, textbook economics says
that a breakup of the kind now ordered, aside from disrupting the
firm itself, will actually exacerbate the problem of monopoly
power, raising prices and increasing market distortions. But
Justice has argued _ and convinced Judge Jackson _ that these
conventional costs are outweighed by what it expects to be
increased incentives to innovate.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of telecom licenses, textbook economics says that
the way to ensure efficient use of a scarce resource is to sell
rights to that resource to the highest bidders. But Negroponte and
the French government have argued instead that governments should
try to judge on other criteria who will do the most good with those
rights, even if this involves an implicit multibillion-dollar
handout of taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   Now in both cases the opponents of conventional economic
reasoning might be right. But on the other hand they might be
utterly wrong _ that is, instead of offsetting the well-understood
conventional costs of their proposals with unconventional benefits,
they may be compounding them with unconventional costs. The truth
is that we don't know very much about what promotes innovation, and
even some of what we think we know may not be true. For example,
advocates of the breakup of Microsoft like to point to the breakup
of AT&AMP;T, which everyone thinks was purely positive in its effects
on innovation. It's a bad parallel in many ways, but still it is
interesting to notice that next-generation telecommunications is
not yet a hot issue in the United States, because thanks to the
fragmentation of our cellular system we are lagging well behind
Europe and Japan in mobile phone technology. And that fragmentation
is in part a legacy of the AT&AMP;T breakup.
</P>
<P>
   My point is not that it is wrong to consider the impact of
policy on innovation; it is that because the determinants of
innovation are not well understood, clever advocates can invoke
technological progress as an all-purpose justification for whatever
policy they favor. In times past the case against Microsoft might
have been overtly populist, with Rooseveltian tirades against
``malefactors of great wealth.'' But these days we're supposed to
approve of entrepreneurs who get rich. So even though much of the
real animus against Microsoft involves fear of its power and wealth
_ remember the T-shirts showing Bill Gates as a ``Star Trek'' Borg,
with the caption ``Resistance is futile. Prepare to be
assimilated'' _ the official argument for breakup claims that
splitting Microsoft will be good for technology.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone knows that France's ``beauty contest'' will, not
incidentally, give an advantage to French companies over other
European firms that would have been able and willing to pay more.
In times past the French would have openly admitted their
preference for ``national champions,'' but in these days of
European unity such language would be diplomatically incorrect. So
officially this policy, too, is all about promoting technology.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the promise of technological benefits has become the
universal policy justification. Does a proposal seem to cost
taxpayers billions or raise prices to consumers? Never mind _ it
will promote innovation! And maybe it will; or maybe in the 21st
century, technology, not patriotism, has become the last refuge of
a scoundrel.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Summery heat and humidity will linger over much of the East.
Sinking air currents under the center of an expansive high-pressure
system from the interior Southeast to the central Atlantic Ocean
will suppress clouds and showers. Meanwhile, a corridor of moisture
along the western flank of the high will promote thundershowers
from eastern Texas to the central Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A wavering front from the Great Lakes to New England, separating
the hot air from much cooler air in Canada, will be the focus for
clouds and showers. A cool rain will fall in northern New England
while afternoon thunderstorms erupt on the warm side of the front
from the northern Ohio Valley to the interior Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, ample sunshine will prevail in most areas, however
showers will brush the Northwest coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Born too Soon
</P>
<P>
   The first Atlantic tropical depression of 2000 formed near the
Yucatan peninsula late Wednesday. A day later it had weakened into
a cluster of tropical showers. During the past few days, a tropical
disturbance in the central Atlantic showed no signs of
strengthening as it battled vigorous high-level winds. In the next
six months, as winds aloft relax, forecasters will track over 100
clusters of thunderstorms roaming the tropical Atlantic. On
average, 10 clusters become tropical storms with winds over 39 mph
and six become hurricanes packing winds over 74 mph.

Syrian President Hafez Assad was known as a riddle, but a

Now, following his death Saturday, the goal of reaching a
Syrian-Israeli peace _ perhaps the last major deal needed for a
regional peace _ looks more elusive. A look at what his death means
for the region and American interests there. (Kaplow, Cox News

GOP RESPONDS QUICKLY TO DEMOCRATS' ISSUE AD ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Responding rapidly to a 15-state advertising campaign by the
Democrats, the Republican Party on Saturday unveiled its first
national commercial, a television spot detailing Gov. George W.
Bush's proposals for overhauling Social Security. It will begin
running Monday in 17 states, from New England to the Pacific
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The swiftness with which the Republican National Committee is
taking to the airwaves is a marked departure from four years ago,
when the Democratic Party began running issue advertisements on
behalf of President Clinton weeks before the cash-strapped
Republicans could start commercials for their presidential nominee,
Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats say this first volley of spots
establishes the pace for a highly expensive parry-and-thrust on the
air that is likely to continue virtually uninterrupted until
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican commercial is being paid for with a mixture of
hard money, raised under federal limits, and soft money, the
unrestricted contributions made to political parties by
corporations, unions and wealthy individuals. The Democrats' spot,
which went up on Thursday to advertise Vice President Al Gore's
support for expanding Medicare benefits to cover prescription
drugs, is being paid for in the same manner.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread use of soft money in political advertising itself
became an issue in recent weeks, as Bush and Gore each tried to
portray the other as unwilling to stop employing the money in their
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have estimated that their initial advertising
campaign, to run until the conventions this summer, will cost $25
million or more. Republican officials declined to put a price tag
on their advertising offensive, saying only that they are prepared
to match whatever the Democrats spend. On the first weekend alone,
the Democrats spent an estimated $1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Democrats' half-minute spot, the Republican
commercial runs 60 seconds, and it takes on a far riskier and more
complicated issue. It is one that Bush and Gore have sparred over
in recent weeks: how to ensure the federal retirement-benefits
system does not go bankrupt as vast numbers of aging baby boomers
move ever closer to eligibility for retirement checks.
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial, produced by Alex Castellanos, a veteran
Republican media consultant, an announcer explains Bush's approach:
``The Bush plan guarantees everyone at or near retirement every
dollar of their benefits. You paid into it, it's your money and it
will be there for you. And the Bush plan gives younger workers a
choice to invest a small part of their Social Security in sound
investments they control, for higher returns.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That last declaration derives from a speech on May 15 by Bush,
in which he proposed a partial privatization of Social Security
that would fundamentally change the system by allowing workers to
invest some of their payroll taxes on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Gore immediately denounced the proposal as dangerous, contending
that taxpayers would be vulnerable to losing their retirement
savings in fraudulent and foolhardy investments.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican strategists close to Bush acknowledged the
Republican National Committee spot addressed a much more
politically treacherous issue than the one the Democrats chose for
their first commercial for Gore. That, they said, was part of the
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as much a spot about leadership as it is about Social
Security,'' asserted a Bush adviser, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``What people like most is someone who seems to have the
courage to do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials, however, said they thought there was a lot
in the spot that would work against Bush. It begins, they point
out, with the announcer noting that ``our nation is at peace and
more prosperous than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Andrew, national chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, said, ``I'm going to be quoting the first sentence of
the ad between now and the election.'' He added that Democrats
would assert that the Bush plan could force cuts in retirement
benefits and lead to an increase in the retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are going to run the spot in all 15 states in
which the Democrats' commercial is being broadcast. Among those are
several electoral vote-rich states that some strategists believe
may determine the winner of the general election, including
Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The other states where the parties' commercials will be running
are Georgia, Florida, Washington, Oregon, Iowa, Kentucky,
Louisiana, New Mexico, Missouri and Wisconsin and Maryland. The
Republicans added two states, Arkansas and Maine.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS HAVE MONEY EDGE ON REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats have a financial advantage in the contest
for control of the House of Representatives. That's right,
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Republicans took control of the House in 1994, they
have out-raised the Democrats. Contributors pay for access and
influence, and they would much rather get to members of the
majority party, especially subcommittee and committee leaders. When
the Republicans took over those posts in 1995, business and trade
groups no longer needed to give to Democrats, and Republican fund
raising soared.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of the Republican advantage was a more effective
fund-raising operation, maintaining a base of small donors who were
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   This year, neither factor seems to matter very much, as
Democrats have greatly improved fund-raising efforts and
contributors hedge their bets. They know it will take a net gain of
only six Democratic seats to install Democrats in House positions
of power, so they are giving to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when the Federal Election Commission released data
for the 15 months that ended March 31, it showed that the House
Democratic campaign committee had substantially more money in the
bank than did its Republican counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reported
$15,082,503 in soft money, the unregulated contributions from
business, labor and rich people that these days are chiefly used
for television advertisements attacking the other party's
candidates. The National Republican Congressional Committee had
$9,818,178.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to hard money, the regulated contributions from
individuals and political action committees, Democrats held a
narrower advantage. They had $9,308,266 in the bank, while
Republicans had $8,449,372.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats held another advantage, though it was not so obvious,
in the fund raising of individual House candidates in crucial
races.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC report said that the median receipts of Republicans
seeking open seats _ those for which no one has the advantage of
incumbency _ were $165,775. For Democrats, the figure was only
$75,820.
</P>
<P>
   But those figures were misleading. They represented multiple
candidates in places like Houston, where the contest for the seat
of retiring Rep. Bill Archer drew a big, well-heeled Republican
field, six of whom raised more than $195,000, and where one forlorn
Democrat with no chance of being elected raised a total of $7,911.
</P>
<P>
   When The New York Times examined 24 districts widely believed to
be winnable by either party, comparing only one candidate from each
party (the nominee or, if none had been chosen, the leading
fund-raiser), the advantage was with the Democrats. Their median
receipt was $655,849, compared with $539,893 for the Republicans.
And the Democratic candidates reported median cash on hand of
$433,892, while the Republicans showed $325,907.
</P>
<P>
   When the focus was narrowed to the 11 open seats on that list of
two dozen, the Democratic cash advantage grew. The Democrats' bank
accounts held a median total of $395,911 to $237,067 for the
Republicans'.
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that the Democrats are going to take control
of the House. But it means that one traditional Republican
advantage is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesmen for the two campaign committees were oddly in sync
in their comments. John Del Cecato of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee said the numbers showed that ``there will not be
a single Democrat who loses a House race this year due to a lack of
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Jim Wilkinson said that in ``any race in
America that matters, both sides, the Democrats and the
Republicans, are going to have all the money they ever want.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a redistricting cycle of 10 years, only a small
number of seats are really in play. The weak incumbents have
already either lost or retired. So that means the parties _ and
outside groups like labor and business _ can concentrate their
attention, and their money.
</P>
<P>
   As Wilkinson said, ``We're going to have 20 to 30 mini-New
Hampshires.'' In those contested House districts, he said, ``Your
phones are going to be ringing, your mailbox is going to be
stuffed, your TV will have constant commercials, and strangers are
going to be knocking on your door.''

TRIPP MEETS INTERNET PALS FROM CONSERVATIVE WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Aug. 27, 1998, Brian L. Buckley, a Los Angeles lawyer,
received an e-mail message from someone he did not know, a New York
literary agent, Lucianne Goldberg. Her one-sentence message to him
said, ``Someone very important wants to know who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   That someone turned out to be Linda Tripp, whose tape-recorded
conversations with Monica Lewinsky set off the investigation that
led to the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that Tripp had been reading and finding
inspiration in Buckley's observations about the Lewinsky scandal on
a conservative, anti-Clinton Internet site, FreeRepublic.com.
Buckley frequently posted his legal insights on the Lewinsky case
using the screen name Clarity.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing months, Clarity and Tripp began a friendship that
blossomed from e-mail messages to telephone calls. In the
electronic age, friendships between public figures and private
citizens, who meet by chance on the Internet, are becoming more
common.
</P>
<P>
   ``She and I are pals by now,'' said Buckley, who said he is also
a lawyer for FreeRepublic and directs an affiliated research group.
He said he became an informal adviser to Tripp as she battled
criminal charges filed against her by the state of Maryland for
taping her conversations with Lewinsky without Lewinsky's
knowledge. The prosecutor dropped the charges in May, saying he
would not pursue them because a judge had suppressed crucial
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley did not meet Tripp in person until June 3, at a
FreeRepublic tribute dinner for Tripp in Charleston, S.C. Buckley,
45, e-mailed a photograph of himself to Tripp so that she would
recognize him. He said he was almost overcome by unexpected emotion
and had to ``catch my breath,'' as Tripp made her entrance at a
buffet dinner of fried chicken and barbecue, where about 60
supporters gave her a standing ovation and waved a homemade banner
emblazoned ``Linda Tripp. Hero. Patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   In her speech, Tripp said that the electronic postings of
Clarity and other FreeRepublic supporters had been a source of
comfort to her. As a way of thanking supporters, Tripp said, she
chose the conference sponsored by the Southeastern chapter of
FreeRepublic for her first public speech after the dismissal of the
state charges.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp spoke for more than an hour, appearing nervous at times.
The guests, who paid $50 to attend, were told that they could not
tape her remarks or take her photograph. Tripp said she was not
used to speaking in public and hoped she would make it through her
talk ``without fainting.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Tripp provided a glimpse of what her life
has been like since she became a starring player in the
investigation of Clinton. Tripp described how she went from being
addicted to cable news shows to depending almost solely on Internet
sites like FreeRepublic for news.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say I crave fame, but I spend all my time trying to hide
from the media,'' she said. After news of the Lewinsky scandal
broke in January 1998 and journalists camped out in Tripp's
driveway, Tripp said, ``I was living in a bunker with sheets over
the windows,'' a virtual prisoner in her own home. In her speech,
she said she found herself compulsively watching the 24-hour cable
news shows about the investigation and proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so addicted to the TV coverage that I almost never
slept,'' Tripp said. Often, she said, she found herself shaking her
head in disagreement with the televised commentary. By the summer
of 1998, she said, her head was shaking so much that she worried
she might have a neurological problem. She stopped watching network
or cable news for good.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Tripp said, she began getting all her news from
FreeRepublic.com, the Web site frequented by Lucianne Goldberg, who
was Tripp's confidante. It was devoid of the ``derogatory slams on
my appearance'' and ``vile things, too vile to repeat,'' which
Tripp said she found so hurtful in the mainstream news media. The
friendlier commentary from Clarity and other FreeRepublic
contributors encouraged Tripp to believe that her support ``was
more widespread'' than she had thought.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, whose legal specialty is intellectual property, said he
often posted his legal analysis of the Lewinsky matter, but was
surprised when he first heard from Goldberg. He wrote her back a
detailed e-mail message explaining his background, which included
undergraduate work at Dartmouth, and law school at William and
Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the ordeal that Linda endured over time,'' Buckley said,
``if you were in that position, you would relish a place on the
Internet where you could put your feet up and relax and get some
news.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp told the dinner guests: ``I've rejected many other higher
profile speaking engagements. I am not a public person.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tripp is not fading away so quietly. She has filed a civil
lawsuit against the Clinton White House and the Pentagon claiming
they breached the Privacy Act in releasing information from her
employment file. ``We'll be subpoenaing every national name in the
White House,'' she promised.
</P>
<P>
   Clarity, meanwhile, is giving her some informal legal advice.

U.N. CONFERENCE ON WOMEN PRESERVES BEIJING RIGHTS DOCUMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five years after a watershed conference in Beijing articulated
what more than 180 nations agreed were universal rights of women, a
weeklong follow-up meeting ended Saturday at the United Nations
with no significant victories for opponents who have tried to
reverse those gains.
</P>
<P>
   An all-night session Friday into Saturday, capping a week of
heated arguments, preserved a variety of women's rights including
the most contentious, that ``women have the right to decide freely
and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality'' and should
be able to do so without ``coercion, discrimination and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, this can mean something as basic as choosing a
spouse or avoiding customs of genital mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy that the dire predictions that there would be a
rollback have proved false,'' said Angela King, the U.N. official
in charge of women's advancement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were determined to get a strong document that did not in
any way diminish the gains women had achieved in Beijing,'' she
said. ``We were also determined to go beyond Beijing, and we did,
despite the efforts of countries that made the process such an
arduous one.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some Western and international women's groups failed to
expand definitions in the Beijing document to include more explicit
homosexual rights, broad definitions of ``family'' and more clearly
stated support for safe and readily available abortions, other
issues were advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Delegations from 180 nations, urged by representatives of about
1,200 nongovernmental organizations, took strong stands on the
trafficking of women and girls, who are sold or lured across
borders by the sex trade or for domestic or industrial work that
often amounts to wage slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates also agreed on on principles that call for punishment
of domestic violence, including marital rape, which some
delegations had argued was essentially a private matter not
recognized as a crime in many nations. There were also calls to
outlaw the killings of women whose families claim have shamed them,
so-called ``honor'' crimes that have drawn attention to countries
like Jordan and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials and women's rights advocates say that this is the
first time an international document has characterized these
activities as crimes. Although the final agreement of the
conference does not have the force of law anywhere, it may be used
by women as a statement of international norms when trying to
change the laws of nations.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting's final declaration also demanded more attention to
the HIV-AIDS epidemic, which in the five years since the Fourth
World Conference on Women in Beijing has begun to infect many more
women, especially in Africa. There, women's organizations say, the
sexual rights of women are a matter of life and death, when
traditions within extended families or clans may force girls and
women into sexual arrangements they cannot avoid with men whom they
may know to be infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   As is almost inevitably the case when sensitive social issues
are exposed to international debate, battle lines were drawn
between conservative countries, largely Islamic or Roman Catholic,
and more secular nations, though there was no fixed geographical
pattern. Poland and Nicaragua, for example, have often been
reticent on certain women's rights, although Europe and Latin
America in general take a much more liberal stand, even on
contraception and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Among Islamic nations, delegates said, Algeria, Iran, Libya,
Pakistan and Sudan were most reluctant to advance women's rights.
The opposition lobby got strong support from the Vatican, which
attends such conferences based on its territorial possessions in
Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Among the organizations that expressed disappointment Saturday
about results from the conference were the Center for Women's
Global Leadership at Rutgers University, and the Women's
Environment and Development Organization in New York. They issued a
statement regretting the failure to agree to a stronger document.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Diamantopoulou, a Greek politician who is now the European
Union's commissioner for employment and social affairs, said she
was not concerned that the conference did not push too hard on the
limits of what the majority of national governments or societies
could accept. She warned of the danger of provoking a backlash
against women's groups in many countries if they returned with a
declaration that could be interpreted as a call to upset the social
order. ``When they go home, they want to be waving the document,
not apologizing for it,'' she said.

POLITICAL NEWS AND NOTES

   High-Level Attention For State House Seat
</P>
<P>
   Why should President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore suddenly
take interest in a special election in an obscure state legislative
district in Pennsylvania?
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday, Clinton will be heard on radio spots and in
phone-bank messages urging voters in the Scranton-area district to
support the Democratic candidate, Jim Wansacz. Then on Tuesday,
Gore is scheduled to campaign for Wansacz.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be politically skunked, the Republican candidate, Tom
Parry, has called on the state's popular governor, Tom Ridge, for
help. Ridge will also campaign in the Scranton area on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for all this sudden high-level attention on state
House District 114 _ and the attention won't end with the race in
the 114th _ is redistricting, a sleeper issue in Election 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the 2000 Census is completed, legislatures around the
country, including the Pennsylvania Legislature, will begin using
the new numbers to redraw state and federal legislative districts.
A rough rule holds that the political party that controls both the
governor's office and the legislature in a state can redraw
district lines so that one of every five districts tilts in its
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans control both the governor's office and the
Legislature in Pennsylvania. But their hold on the 203-member
Pennsylvania House is wispy thin _ 102 Republicans, 100 Democrats _
and the seat in the 114th is up for grabs on June 20 because the
incumbent resigned after being convicted of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, $250,000 would finance a good run for a seat in
the Pennsylvania House. This year, Wansacz and Parry each expect to
spend double that.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville Billboards Bring Smiles to GOP
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Vice President Al Gore moved his campaign
headquarters from Washington to downtown Nashville in search of an
outside-the-Beltway image, anti-Gore advertisements began showing
up on billboards near the new digs. Many were paid for by the
Republican National Committee, and the committee's chairman, Jim
Nicholson, said he hoped Gore and his aides found them so annoying
that ``their teeth hurt, like scratching nails on a blackboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical advertisement: A picture of Gore embracing President
Clinton, with a Gore quote underneath from the impeachment days:
``One of our greatest presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the advertisements set the Gore camp's teeth on edge is
but a guess. But this much is clear:
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Gore headquarters was moved again, to a suburban
mall where nary a billboard is in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Needed more office space, Gore aides explained.
</P>
<P>
   Needed more space between the office and the billboards,
Republican officials gloated.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Changes Ways After a Defeat
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. Matthew G. Martinez, a Democrat from California's San
Gabriel Valley, announced this year that he would seek a 10th term,
he anticipated, as always, that his biggest fight would be in the
primary. His Congressional District, the 31st, is heavily
Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   What Martinez did not anticipate was that his leading supporters
in past primaries, the state Democratic Party and the Los Angeles
County Federation of Labor, would abandon him and side with state
Sen. Hilda Solis, maintaining that she was more in tune with the
district's voters and their needs.
</P>
<P>
   He lost, beaten better than 2-to-1, the only incumbent in the
country to suffer that political ignominy so far this year. Come
the fall, Solis faces no Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   In defeat, Martinez seems to be a changed politician.
</P>
<P>
   Before the March 7 primary, he was known as a faithful,
party-line legislator who voted with his Democratic colleagues more
than 90 percent of the time on crucial issues. But since the
primary, according to an analysis of his votes by The Los Angeles
Times, he has stuck with the Democrats on party-line issues only
about 20 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Why, given that the Democrats, if they hold ranks on a crucial
issue, need only a handful of Republican defectors to carry the
day?
</P>
<P>
   He's not saying.
</P>
<P>
   A Spot for LaRouche? No Way, Party Says
</P>
<P>
   Like Rodney Dangerfield, Lyndon LaRouche says he don't get no
respect.
</P>
<P>
   Or delegates to the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   LaRouche is running for president. Again. He says he is a
Democrat, perhaps the only one who can save the nation, and maybe
the world, from an economic and social implosion.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic Party says he is a convicted felon (mail
fraud involving fund raising) with political beliefs that are
``explicitly racist and anti-Semitic.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, LaRouche continues to campaign as a Democrat and,
in states where election officials permit his name on the ballot,
he draws some votes, sometimes thousands of votes. In last month's
Democratic primary in Arkansas, for example, he got more than
53,000 votes, or 22 percent of the total cast. The other candidate
on the ticket, Vice President Al Gore, got 194,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   So does LaRouche get to go to the Democratic National Convention
in Los Angeles with 22 percent of Arkansas' 48 convention
delegates? Or with delegates from any other state?
</P>
<P>
   No way, says the Democratic National Committee. If he shows up,
committee officials say, he will be barred from the convention and,
they add, courts have ruled several times that such exclusion is
legal.
</P>
<P>
   LaRouche denies he is a racist or an anti-Semite. As for his
fraud conviction, he says he went to prison and paid his debt to
society. His big vote in Arkansas, he argues, proved his viability
as a candidate. ``In Arkansas,'' he says, ``reality struck.''
</P>
<P>
   As Sen. Tim Hutchinson, the chairman of the Bush campaign in
Arkansas, sees it, the reality is that 53,000 Democrats ``couldn't
stomach Al Gore'' so they voted for a candidate ``not famous for
being somebody you can support.''

   MICROSOFT-FUTURE _ WASHINGTON _ Far from breaking up as a
federal court has ordered, Microsoft is preparing to roll out
``Next Generation Window Services'' that would make the company
more integrated and far-reaching than ever. The plan calls for
tight integration of the computer operating system and a Web
browser that would let people use a number of devices _ including
PCs, handheld computers and Web-enabled telephones _ to access
application programs and data stored on Internet servers. The plan,
often called a blueprint for Microsoft's future, seems incompatible
with the antitrust regulators' vision. (Glass, Cox News Service).

   TECH-CONGRESS _ WASHINGTON _ Many of the most powerful
executives in the U.S. tech industry spent much of last week on
Capitol Hill, telling Congress what they need to extend their
string of innovation and economic success. But because of
old-fashioned political wrangling, three of the industry's top
priorities _ digital signatures, an Internet tax moratorium and
more H-1B visas _ are stuck in Congress with uncertain prospects of
early action. (Geewax, Cox News Service).

   LEOFRANK-LIST _ ATLANTA _ Mary Phagan Kean was attending a
Leadership Cobb meeting a few years ago when a man introduced
himself with a startling admission. His grandfather, he told her,
was one of the vigilantes who ``took care of Leo Frank.'' Kean, a
46-year-old special education administrator, is the great niece of
Mary Phagan, the pretty, pink-bowed factory girl whose 1913 murder
precipitated one of the most infamous chapters in Georgia history.
Her employer, Frank, a wiry, nervous young man from Brooklyn, was
convicted of the crime and then lynched near Marietta, not far from
the site of the Big Chicken. People confided in Kean. She recorded
what she heard and kept a roster of the men who believed they were
avenging her great aunt. She sealed her latest version of the list
in an envelope and printed ``To be opened at my demise'' across the
front. ``I can't show this to you,'' she says. ``Too many people
would be hurt.'' But it's too late now. One of her working lists
has been posted on the Internet against her wishes. For the first
time, one of the oldest, darkest secrets of the South _ the names
of the people who lynched Leo Frank _ is beginning to see the light
of day. (Auchmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 87.

   SOUTH-DROUGHT _ Recent trips down two of Georgia's major rivers
show first-hand the effects of the drought. On a canoe trip down a
three-mile stretch of the Flint River, water levels are so low that
participants have to get out and drag their boats half the way.
Meanwhile, along the Chattahoochee River, boaters must put in at
Newnan because water levels are so low upstream. We report on these
and other environmental effects of the drought. (Seabrook, Atlanta

   EDDIE-EAGLE _ WASHINGTON _ Some call him ``Joe Camel with

recent controversy surrounding the NRA's cartoon mascot, who has

riddle that was strong enough to keep his commitments. Now,
following his death Saturday, the goal of reaching a Syrian-Israeli

housing and a tutor who try to prepare them to enter school at a
level appropriate to their ages. Both their parents died of AIDS
leaving the children to fend for themselves. Additionally,
88-year-old grandmother Lina Smoke who is raising the children of
her dead children has moved into a small wooden house ? leaving

   MEXICO-VOTEBUY _ SAN PEDRO EL ALTO, Mexico _ Maria del Carmen
Peralta has little more than corn and beans to feed five children.
Her family has no bathroom and they sleep in a hut that's a virtual
ice box at night in this cold mountain region of Mexico state.
Peralta's life has been so harsh she wants to finally vote for an
opposition candidate in Mexico's July 2 presidential election. But
she's frightened that her vote might cost her the $45 a month
supplement she receives from Progresa, a federal welfare program
here. Although it is illegal, Peralta's welfare coordinator
confirms that she has been under pressure to instruct Progresa
recipients to vote for Mexico's ruling party on July 2 _ or suffer
the consequences. Other impoverished Mazahua Indians in this rugged
rural area have similar stories. All over Mexico, allegations of
vote-buying and pressure tactics are mounting as election day

   KOSOVO-TENSIONS _ MITROVICA, Kosovo _ In this town, the lives of
Albanian Kosovars have returned to normal while Serb families
huddle in fear for their lives. Welcome to Kosovo, one year after
the 50,000-strong NATO-led peacekeeping force rolled into the
province and ended a campaign by Serb and Yugoslav authorities to
wipe out its Albanian majority and ethnically cleanse a whole
people. Twelve months into the peacekeeping mission, the basic
rhythms of life have returned here. But few people are naive enough
to say NATO's chief aim _ establishing a multi-ethnic society _ has
been achieved. At the same time, few officials are brave enough to
say this failure threatens the peacekeepers' mission or the
region's future stability. (Coker, Cox News Service). EDs: MOVED

   KOSOVO-REBELS _ DOBROSIN, Yugoslavia _ The sun glared down on
the clay-baked courtyard as a mother and father in their Sunday
best, fidgeting and nervously chatting with two armed guards,
waited for the Albanian rebel leader to appear. The parents were
searching for their 17-year-old son who had run away from home.
They heard that he and two friends had come here to Dobrosin, a
village located in the demilitarized zone between Kosovo and
Serbia, to sign up with an illegal branch of the Kosovo Liberation
Army. Indeed, they found him here. According to U.S. military
intelligence, the one-story adobe compound where they waited
anxiously for him to be returned to him is home for as many as 150
battle-ready Albanian fighters. The rebels inject great uncertainty
into the uneasy peace that exists in the Balkans a year after the
carnage in Kosovo. (Coker, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS. MOVED

   Bureau chie point. Foxworthy is more in his element telling
jokes and cutting up in front of a bunch of country music
enthusiasts. His blue-collar humor about NASCAR drivers and growing
old doesn't appeal to everyone. However, as Hughes points out,
enough people can relate to it because it's ``Americana and it's
not blue.''
</P>
<P>
   The TNN Music Awards is country music's only fan-voted awards
show. Awards will be handed out in 12 categories based on fan votes
cast in Country Weekly, by 900 numbers and on the Internet. Faith
Hill (''Breathe'') leads with eight nominations, followed by George
Strait (''Always Never The Same'') with six and Tim McGraw (''A
Place in the Sun'') with five. Hill, McGraw, Strait, Alan Jackson
and Shania Twain were nominated for Entertainer of the Year.
Jackson was also nominated for Male Artist of the Year, Album of
the Year and The Impact Award.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what would a music awards show be without performances?
Clint Black, Lisa Hartman Black, The Wilkinsons and Faith Hill are
among those scheduled to perform. Hopefully the producers will put
the sultry Hill next to wind-blowing machine like VH1 did for Divas
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the formal Country Music Awards, the TNN Music Awards is
more of a free-wheeling affair. It's the Golden Globes of country
music awards, while the CMA is more like the stuffy Oscar ceremony.
``This is all about the fans,'' Hughes explains. ``There's an
informality about the show, an excitement about the show and a
spontaneity. With no bad feeling towards the CMA, but our show is
different. And it's supposed to be different.''

A CHALLENGER IN MEXICO PITCHES TENT IN TWO CAMPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ To his opponents Vicente Fox, who is mounting the
most serious challenge to Mexico's governing party in a
presidential election in 70 years, is a political chameleon who
talks out of both sides of his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   To his supporters, he is a clever strategist who has built
strength well beyond his small rightist party by defying
ideological labels.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, it is clear that by pairing strong
conservative credentials with a center-left position on a range of
issues Fox has succeeded in attracting supporters from across the
political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   He has received backing from conservative landowners and
executives, and also managed to wrest support from Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, the three-time leftist candidate who is running a distant
third in the July 2 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, however, Fox has wandered frequently into
inconsistencies that have allowed his main rival, Francisco
Labastida of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, to
portray him as a slippery politician.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for instance, Fox acknowledged on a trip to New York
that he favored privatizing the state-owned oil monopoly, Pemex,
which is an icon of Mexican nationalism. In recent weeks,
Labastida's commercials have portrayed those comments as
treasonous. In response, Fox surrounded himself in one recent
campaign ceremony with former communists and socialists who now
back his candidacy and pledged never to privatize Pemex.
</P>
<P>
   In using issues against Fox, his adversaries have in some cases
distorted his position. At other times, Fox has paid a price for
speaking too glibly, as when he said in 1997 that he could solve
the Chiapas conflict ``in 15 minutes.'' And sometimes he has waded
into trouble by sharply changing the tone, if not the substance, of
his statements before different audiences.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This spring, for example, Fox attended a bankers' convention in
Acapulco and, four days later, a congress of small entrepreneurs.
Fox praised the bankers for keeping their institutions afloat in
the turmoil that followed the 1994 peso devaluation. He mentioned,
briefly, that financiers who committed fraud during the $90 billion
taxpayer-financed bank bailout that followed the crisis ``must be
brought to justice,'' but did not dwell on that uncomfortable
topic. The bankers reacted with roaring applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox told us what we wanted to hear,'' said Roberto Gonzalez,
one bank president.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fox met with the small entrepreneurs, who loathe the
bankers because, even though taxpayer funds rescued the banks after
the 1994 crisis, they have refused to extend new loans to thousands
of small businesses sliding into bankruptcy for lack of credit.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the entrepreneurs voiced their resentments to
Fox, who joined right in, lashing the bankers' inefficiency and
this time detailing at length his plans for prosecuting those
suspected of fraud. Labastida and Cardenas called him a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``One day he says south and the next day he says north,''
Labastida said in a recent interview aboard his campaign jet. ``One
day he tells the bankers they're guilty of nothing, and later he
tells the industrialists he'll put the bankers in jail. He's a
question mark in boots!''
</P>
<P>
   Fox wears boots to remind voters of his upbringing on an arid
ranch in Guanajuato in central Mexico. In the 1920s, the armies of
the postrevolutionary government waged a violent campaign in the
region to suppress the Catholic Church, defended by peasant
insurgents, the Cristeros. By some estimates, 250,000 Mexicans died
in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has invited comparisons between the Cristeros' struggle and
his own crusade to defeat the governing party, ending campaign
rallies with a Cristeros war cry: ``If I advance, follow me! If I
stop, push me! If I retreat, kill me!''
</P>
<P>
   Fox was educated by Jesuits before embarking on a business
career that included five years as president of Coca-Cola's Mexican
unit.
</P>
<P>
   When he entered politics with a 1988 run for Congress, he joined
the National Action Party, known as the PAN. Founded in 1939 by
Catholic professionals and shopkeepers opposed to President Lazaro
Cardenas, Cuauhtemoc's father, whom they considered a socialist,
the party was for half a century Mexico's only permanent opposition
party. That made it a natural vehicle for Fox, but he had a
complaint: the party had won few elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years, the PAN was led by great theoreticians, but
they didn't think about how to take power,'' Fox wrote in a
campaign autobiography. ``They lacked hunger for victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, in contrast, showed a fierce will to win. After what many
Mexicans considered to be a fraudulent victory by the governing
party in the 1988 presidential balloting, he and other opposition
congressmen tried, physically, to retrieve disputed ballots from
the basement of the congress building where they were stored.
Soldiers, rifles raised, barred their way, but his gutsy stand won
him admirers.
</P>
<P>
   He turned his first run for Guanajuato governor in 1991 into a
crusade against governing party corruption. After a disputed
election that Fox called fraudulent, he led weeks of street
protests but was eventually denied the governorship. Running again
four years later, he won easily. He installed conservative
businessmen and landowners from the National Action Party in many
posts, but also appointed a member of the governing party as state
auditor.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of the 1990s, Fox pursued a cordial dialogue
with a changing group of leftist intellectuals, often at the Mexico
City home of Jorge Castaneda, the author whose Rolodex is filled
with former guerrillas and socialists of various stripes from
across Latin America. Roberto Mangabeira Unger, a Harvard
University professor who is a Brazilian political theorist,
recalled meeting Fox in 1996. ``I'm always on the lookout for
insurrectionists,'' Unger said. ``And my intuition told me, here's
the man.''
</P>
<P>
   In the post-Cold War world, he said, being a leftist means
encouraging grass-roots participation in democracies and seeking
better access to credit, technology and markets for small
producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox is willing to embrace these ideas,'' he said. ``He's not
tied to the old orthodoxies, he's seeking a different way for
Mexico. And by this standard he's much more of a leftist than
Cardenas or Labastida.''
</P>
<P>
   One view Fox adopted during this dialogue was that Mexico must
raise, not lower, tax revenues, which are far below those in
developed countries, a position at odds with the PAN's longtime
call for a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Fox's main economic thrust, however, has been a call to increase
Mexico's growth rate to 7 percent through deregulation and by
encouraging foreign investment. Labastida, in a statement titled
``Inconsistencies of Fox's Economic Proposals,'' called the
suggestion ``unsustainable.'' Jonathan Heath, an independent Mexico
City economist, disagreed. ``Seven percent growth is an ambitious
goal, but not impossible,'' Heath said. ``I've looked over his
economic proposals, and frankly I don't see the inconsistencies.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Recent zigzags in his posture toward the Catholic Church have
hurt Fox. He celebrated his formal nomination as the National
Action Party's candidate at a rally last fall by holding aloft an
image of the Virgin of Guadalupe. The gesture irritated millions of
Protestants and other anticlerical Mexicans, and he quickly
apologized.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, newspapers published a letter from Fox to the
bishops in which he pledged to lift restrictions on religious
activity that are a holdover from Mexico's anticlerical past, and
also to promote ``respect for life'' from conception to death. Fox
has many times expressed his opposition to abortion, which is
illegal in Mexico, but this pledge aroused fears that, if elected,
he might seek to make anti-abortion laws even more restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   In the ceremony last month where he reversed course on the
privatization of Pemex, he sought to reassure feminists and
leftists who fear the church by pledging ``never to use the power
of the state to impose lifestyles or religious beliefs.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Marta Lamas, a prominent feminist, was not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust what he says,'' Lamas said. ``I hate the PRI,
but my fear of Fox is so great that I'll heave a sigh of relief if
the PRI wins.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But portrayals of Fox as a macho boor do not fit him either.
After defeating Malu Micher, a feminist candidate who ran against
him for governor in 1995, he worked with her to devise programs in
Guanajuato to benefit rural women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vicente is a special case,'' Micher said recently. ``He views
parties and all the formalities of politics as a bother. He doesn't
fit within the framework of the traditional politician.''

SOUTH AFRICA IN QUANDARY: SHOULD GAYS DONATE BLOOD? 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Endowed with a Constitution that
has been called an international model and beset by an AIDS crisis
that is among the worst in the world, South Africa finds itself
trying to reconcile the two in the face of a challenge to its
practice of disqualifying gay men from giving blood.
</P>
<P>
   The South African Human Rights Commission has concluded that
under the country's liberal, 4-year-old Constitution, men who have
sex with other men cannot for that reason alone be disqualified as
blood donors, as they are here and in most countries, including the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's blood banks have so far refused to abide by the
commission's opinion, and the two sides are searching for a
compromise. But if they cannot find some common ground, the matter
could end up in court, pitting the constitutional freedoms that
many here died struggling for against the epidemic that so many
here are now dying from.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, which has a population estimated at about 44
million, the rate of new infections is among the highest on the
continent, and the spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is
perhaps the most serious threat to the country's future.
</P>
<P>
   A safe blood supply is essential to containing the crisis, and
for the people who run the blood banks that responsibility can mean
hard decisions and hurt feelings. Understanding as they say they
are of the pain their policies can cause, they make no apologies
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to maintain the safety of the blood supply, and
worldwide there are certain risk factors that would compromise that
safety,'' said Anthon Heyns, medical director of the South African
Blood Transfusion Service, which is based here and is the largest
of the country's six blood banks, supplying about 60 percent of the
nation's blood.
</P>
<P>
   One of those risk factors is male-to-male sex, according to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the blood supply
in the United States and helps set the standards used in much of
the world. Others include using intravenous drugs, having sex with
prostitutes and traveling in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the risk factors, however, have drawn the kind of
impassioned criticism that has periodically surfaced toward the ban
on men who have had sex with other men.
</P>
<P>
   For activists, the case will be an important test of the
Constitution, which is unequivocal in its protection of the civil
rights of gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an infringement on gay men's rights, and what's the worth
of the Constitution if people's rights are not being protected,''
said Carrie Shelver, director of the National Coalition for Gay and
Lesbian Equality, an umbrella organization of about 50 groups
around the country. ``It's really based on stereotypes, and the
stereotype is that gay men are promiscuous.''
</P>
<P>
   The case here began almost a year ago after a gay man filed a
complaint with the Human Rights Commission alleging discrimination
on the part of the Cape Town blood bank that rejected him because
he said he had sex with another man at least once in the previous
five years.
</P>
<P>
   After studying the matter for several months, the commission
handed down its opinion earlier this year, saying blood banks could
not exclude men who have sex with other men from giving blood. Such
men, the commission said, are no more of a risk to a safe blood
supply than any number of other groups for whom there are no such
restrictions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think the Human Rights Commission is spot on,'' said Udo
Schuklenk, the director of the bioethics program at the University
of the Witwatersrand here and the co-editor of the magazine
Bioethics. ``The problem is, you're discriminating against people.
Equal risk is being treated unequally.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuklenk says the questions asked of prospective donors need to
be more specific about their sexual practices _ for instance,
whether the sex was unprotected by a condom _ in order to discern
the risk to the blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the current restrictions say that even that is not
enough. ``We cast a wide safety net, and inevitably with a safety
net you are going to unfortunately pull in people who would
otherwise be safe donors,'' said Dr. Arthur Bird, medical director
of the Western Province Blood Transfusion Service in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has said that it would like to see a study done
on the prevalence of HIV among gay men here to see if South Africa
is indeed justified in following the guidelines laid down by public
health authorities in the United States and other countries where
the infection patterns have shown marked difference.

HAFEZ ASSAD, WHO TURNED SYRIA INTO A MIDDLE EAST POWER, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also filed in category ``a'')  
 (See also: ASSAD-DEATH)  
 (EDS: An abridged version, OBIT-ASSAD-ABRIDGED, is also being
filed.)  
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hafez Assad, the air force officer who ruled Syria for nearly
three decades, transforming a Middle East backwater into an
introverted regional power that endured as the center of unbending
Arab hostility toward Israel, died Saturday in Damascus. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, a survivor of several assassination attempts and at least
one heart attack, died of a heart attack, according to medical
officials quoted by Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Arab autocrats who became stock players in the
perpetual drama of negotiating Middle East peace, none was more
courted, or more aloof, than the Syrian leader. No lasting peace
could hold without him, but none could be negotiated with him
either. A treaty remained elusive largely because of his role in
demanding back every inch of Syrian territory.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Assad's longevity in office rested on a rigid
intolerance of dissent, most starkly illustrated by the slaying of
thousands of residents of Hama in February 1982 to end a swelling
Islamic insurgency. His was a suspicious police state, barring
modern instruments like the fax or the Internet that might somehow
become tools to undermine his government.
</P>
<P>
   Assad rarely traveled, even within Syria, and as he aged his
public appearances were limited to religious ceremonies on major
holidays. But his withdrawn life was also devoid of the lavish
trappings common to other Arab rulers. His home and office, where
he often worked 18-hour days, consisted of two modest villas that
faced each other in a residential neighborhood in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   The stream of American presidents, secretaries of state and
other officials who crossed his doorstep over the years, hoping to
keep the latest peace effort from foundering there, emerged with a
grudging respect for Assad. He was at once courteous and
calculating, professorial and persistent, unleashing flashes of
self-deprecating humor during marathon negotiating sessions. The
length of the sessions were as legendary as they were
nerve-racking.
</P>
<P>
   When Henry Kissinger arrived in 1973, becoming the first
American secretary of state to visit Syria in 20 years, their
initial meeting lasted 6{ hours. The press, uninitiated in the ways
of the Assad, wondered aloud if Kissinger had been kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``His tactic was to open with a statement of the most extreme
position to test what the traffic would bear,'' Kissinger wrote in
``Years of Upheaval,'' the volume of his memoirs published in 1982.
``He might then allow himself to be driven back to the attainable,
fighting a dogged rear guard action that made clear that
concessions could be exacted only at a heavy price, and that
discouraged excessive expectations of them. (His negotiating style
was in this respect not so different from the Israelis', much as
both of them would hate the comparison.)''
</P>
<P>
   Assad was most renowned for lecturing foreigners, even American
presidents, about the unfair colonial fragmentation of the Middle
East. In case anyone missed the point, his reception hall was
dominated by a large painting depicting the Arab armies under
Saladin defeating the Crusaders during the battle of Hittin in
1187, a not-so-subtle reminder that he considered present
circumstances temporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in his bitterness toward Israel, he retained a certain
wry humor about their conflicting views, and he seemed to derive
great patience from his obvious sense of history,'' President Jimmy
Carter wrote in ``The Blood of Abraham,'' a 1985 study of the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Syria was a young nation adrift before Assad's rule. The
government had been a revolving door swung repeatedly by coups
after independence from France in 1946, resulting in little
development and a population weary of chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodless power grab he staged in November 1970 brought
stability and the first modern construction of roads, schools and
hospitals. Assad followed the Soviet model of a single-party police
state, constructing a network of 15 competing intelligence agencies
that mostly spied on his own people.
</P>
<P>
   It was in regional politics, however, that Assad most sought to
create a legacy, remaking Syria into a power among the Arabs rather
than a political football. He was inspired by the Arab nationalism
preached by President Gamal Abdul Nasser of Egypt, and like many of
his generation, he sought to inherit Nasser's role as the voice of
Arab unity.
</P>
<P>
   But Assad, more than most, experienced the bitter chasm between
the vaunted oratory of unity and the constant scheming and back
stabbing that marked actual relations among the Arab states in
watershed events like the wars against Israel. He often told
negotiators that he would face assassination if he negotiated a
separate peace on terms unfavorable to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expects us to raise banners of happiness and pleasure
with such a clandestine agreement held behind our backs,'' he said
in an American television interview in October 1993, right after
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, lead by Yasser
Arafat, announced a peace agreement worked out in secret under
Norwegian auspices. ``The Arabs are one people. If I were to sign
an agreement similar to that signed by Arafat, I would have faced
great problems. You all know that there are Arab leaders who paid
with their lives as the price for such separate behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad's roots in an isolated, impoverished religious minority
made him an unlikely candidate to become leader of Syria. But for a
man who spent his lifetime railing against the legacy of Western
colonization, its waning years brought unprecedented change to
sleepy villages like his.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad was the ninth of 11 children, born on Oct. 6, 1930,
to minor notables in the village of Qurdaha, in the Ansariya
Mountains, which rise sharply from the Mediterranean coast. (The
adopted family name, sometimes transliterated Asad, means lion.)
The mountains made for a secure home for his ethnic group, the
Alawite sect, a tiny branch of the Shiite school of Islam and a
sect often branded as heretical by the Sunni Muslim majority that
dominated Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain tribes had been all but ignored during the 400
years that the Ottoman Empire controlled Syria, left to their
subsistence farming in villages consisting of small stone hovels.
Patrick Seale, in his 1988 biography, ``Asad of Syria: The Struggle
for the Middle East,'' said that at the time of Assad's birth,
Qurdaha consisted of about 100 houses at the end of a dirt track.
It had neither mosque, nor shop, nor cafe. His father and two wives
lived in a two-room, flat-roofed stone house.
</P>
<P>
   The Arabs had expected independence in exchange for their
rebellion against Ottoman rule during World War I, but in a secret
1916 pact known as the Sykes-Picot agreement, the British and
French divided the Levant. Their action is still vividly remembered
in Syria, and a long commentary on the betrayal of the Sykes-Picot
accord was a perennial favorite of Assad's lectures to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The French, seeing the Alawite clans as potential allies in the
old divide-and-rule method of colonial government, introduced
schools to their villages. Assad's father was determined that his
younger children would excel, securing places for them in school
and challenging them to learn long poems in classical Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, Assad became the first member of his family to be sent
down to Latakia, on the coast, to start his secondary education. He
was soon caught up in the debates among Communists, Arab
nationalists and Islamic fundamentalists, which intensified as
Syria gained independence in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Assad joined the new Arab Baath Socialist Party, which preached
that a secular, socialist state encompassing all the Arabs would
revive their past glory and undermine Western dominance. When he
was elected to head his high school's student affairs committee, he
used the position to try to foment nationwide student protests
against other parties and the government.
</P>
<P>
   Assad told Seale, his biographer, that he addressed his student
meetings in verse, reciting one such speech from memory: ''There is
Damascus drinking the blood of its sons! Oh, Guardians of Glory,
where are the righteous rulers? The dogs have risen to the fount of
life!''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he finished high school in 1951, at the age of 20,
his interest in politics was cemented even as he embarked on an air
force career. Fees for military school were abolished with
independence, so he enrolled in the new Air Force College in
Aleppo. The Alawites, like the underprivileged throughout the
Middle East, used the military to gain an education and then to
supplant the elite that scorned them.
</P>
<P>
   His years in Aleppo, from 1952 to 1955, when he graduated as a
lieutenant, coincided with Nasser's rise in Egypt. In 1958 Syria's
government rushed to join Egypt in the United Arab Republic,
imagining that the idea would prove so seductive that all Arab
governments would either join or be swept aside. The union
collapsed in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Assad missed most of the first year of the union, having been
sent to the Soviet Union to learn how to fly the MiG-15s and
MiG-17s being delivered to Syria. Soon after he returned, his
squadron was transferred to Egypt. He and a fellow group of
officers, dismayed by the degree to which Syrians had been
marginalized, formed a secret committee to plot to take control in
Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   The years after the union brought turmoil. The highly
politicized officer corps jockeyed for control of the country, with
each faction taking power thinning the ranks of its rivals through
execution or exile. By the time the Arab-Israeli war erupted in
June 1967, Syrian military officers were ill-prepared to do battle.
</P>
<P>
   Assad was minister of defense during that war, having gained
that position in February 1966 when the group of officers he helped
found in Cairo seized power in a violent putsch. He was 35, serving
in his first Syrian government, the most extreme the country had
yet known. It was repressive at home, seeking to topple the old
Sunni Muslim elite, and radical abroad, funneling aid to
Palestinian guerrillas to attack Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The 1967 war, over in a week, was as much a military as a mental
blow to the Arabs. All their exaggerated oratory about the
bankruptcy of the Zionist cause proved fruitless, and the Arabs
suffered the embarrassment of losing the eastern sector of
Jerusalem, the Sinai peninsula and the Golan Heights in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Assad came to power after another debacle, in September 1970,
when Palestinian guerrillas in Jordan sought to topple King
Hussein. Syria sent tanks over the border to support the
guerrillas, then retreated under Jordanian air attacks, and Hussein
kept his throne. Assad used the disarray to stage a bloodless coup
called ``the corrective movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad ruled through the Baath Party, using its secular ideology
as the cover for bringing the Alawite minority into key positions.
Eventually the commanders of the special forces, intelligence, the
armored corps and key divisions were all Alawites, a remarkable
achievement for a group that used to produce the servant class.
</P>
<P>
   His first priority as president was trying to erase the stain of
the 1967 defeat. In that he had a ready ally in President Anwar
Sadat of Egypt. The two profited from the superpower competition
between the United States and the Soviet Union, with Moscow pouring
billions of dollars of weaponry into both their arsenals and
stationing thousands of advisers in both countries.
</P>
<P>
   They struck on Oct. 6, 1973, with the Egyptian forces crossing
the Suez Canal and the Syrians advancing into the Golan Heights.
The Israelis, while monitoring the troop buildup along their
borders in the days preceding the attack, were caught unaware,
seeing the huge mobilization as more bluster than threat.
</P>
<P>
   For days it seemed the survival of Israel was at stake, but it
gradually gained the advantage. The Egyptians had basically
captured the eastern shore of the Suez Canal and dug in, their two
top generals at loggerheads over how much of the army could advance
into the Sinai. Assad believed bitterly that Sadat had betrayed
him. He thought Sadat had crossed the canal and then deliberately
stopped, seeking a limited victory that would both restore the
image of the Egyptian army and more important, attract American
patronage. By the time a shaky cease-fire took hold at the end of
October, it was clear the Arabs had again been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The United States attempted to build a comprehensive peace
settlement, Kissinger shuttling between Arab capitals and Israel.
He was the first of many American officials to have their hopes
dashed by the Syrian leader, discovering at the end of lengthy
negotiations about a peace conference that Syria had no intention
of taking part.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Assad felt the Americans got the upper hand because the
talks paved the way for Egypt to forge a separate peace. The
cease-fire negotiated then on the Golan did stick, however, and it
became Israel's quietest border despite the upheaval that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The flare-up of 1973 was barely extinguished when the next
crisis erupted, in Lebanon. Its civil war pitted the Lebanese
Christians, whose power was enshrined in the constitution despite
their shrinking population, against the Palestine Liberation
Organization and more economically deprived communities like the
Shiites and the Druze. As the army and government fractured along
sectarian lines, the Christian defeat by the more numerous Muslim
factions seemed a foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Although Assad acknowledged that Syria and Lebanon were
sovereign nations, Syrians had long viewed Lebanon as a natural
part of their country that had been unfairly severed by colonial
meddling. Assad intervened with his army to preserve the status
quo.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said his defense of the Christian minority reflected his
own insecurity that majority rule in Lebanon might inspire attempts
to unseat his Alawite minority. The intervention in Lebanon, though
sanctioned by the Arab League, also gave Assad a chance to try to
reassert control over the PLO. He had long been at odds with
Arafat, even jailing him briefly in Damascus in 1966 for trying to
dilute Syrian influence over the Palestinian movement.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lebanese chaos gave an opening to a deadlier conflict,
providing Syria and Israel the space to fight another war. The
Syrians stood by at first during the 1982 Israeli invasion of
Lebanon, accepting Israel's assurances that it planned only to push
Palestinian guerrillas away from its border.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis really had their sights on Beirut and the
Palestinian command in Lebanon, knowing Assad would probably not be
able to avoid fighting because his army was already heavily engaged
in guaranteeing calm. The Syrian Air Force performed poorly, losing
79 MiGs, plus tanks and missile batteries.
</P>
<P>
   But Assad retained his influence over his neighbor. In September
1982, Syria was apparently the hand behind the assassination of the
Lebanese leader Bashir Gemayel, which effectively aborted the
attempt to negotiate a separate peace between Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Assad nonetheless put renewed emphasis on his doctrine of
``strategic parity'' with Israel. He believed that the Arabs would
always be hindered unless they could use military aid from the
Soviet Union and its Communist satellites to build a credible force
to face the high-tech weaponry that flowed to Israel from the
United States. The Soviet Union poured an estimated $2 billion into
the Syrian arsenal after the war, including about 160 fighter
aircraft and 800 T-72 tanks.
</P>
<P>
   As the proxy war in Lebanon had been simmering, a more
threatening rebellion was brewing at home.
</P>
<P>
   The first hint of the impending attempt to overthrow Baath Party
rule came in June 1979, when the Muslim Brotherhood massacred 50
Alawite cadets in the dining room of the military academy in
Aleppo.
</P>
<P>
   Then in June 1980 extremists lobbed at least two grenades at the
Syrian leader. Assad kicked one grenade away while a bodyguard
flung himself on the second, losing his life. In revenge, the
military unit controlled by Assad's headstrong younger brother,
Rifaat, descended on a desert prison near Palmyra and gunned down
at least 250 religious dissidents in their cells.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim extremists next rose up in 1982 in Hama. They killed
Baath Party officials and broadcast appeals from the mosques for a
nationwide insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuing the rebels, the Syrian military leveled half the
city, killing at least 10,000 residents. The carnage brought
widespread condemnation in the West, but it was the kind of act
that ensured Assad's utter control. When the choice came down to
spilling blood or preserving his hold on power, there was really no
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't be apologetic,'' recalled an American diplomat.
``Assad would justify it entirely by saying it was the necessary
price to end years and years of Muslim Brotherhood terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   His alliance with Iran after the 1979 Islamic revolution there
brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to power was based on similar
calculus. Although Iran's attempts to export its revolution quickly
made it anathema in the Middle East, Assad cared little that the
Damascus-Tehran accord provoked his fellow Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the Iranians were at war with Iraq, long Syria's
competitor for supremacy in the larger Arab world. For another,
Iran was willing to arm and train the increasingly radical Shiite
militias in southern Lebanon who engaged Israel's occupying army in
guerrilla warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Syria could use the guerrillas to pressure Israel while at the
same time denying responsibility. Instead Assad could blame the
violence, or acts like the kidnapping of Western hostages, on the
anarchy of Lebanon that Syria's 30,000-strong troops were
ostensibly trying to suppress.
</P>
<P>
   Syria was also linked to brutal attacks carried out by notorious
terrorist groups like the Abu Nidal organization, whose targets
included Israelis and Jews, Syrian dissidents, Jordanian diplomats
and pro-Arafat Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's ability to distance himself from the worst violence
collapsed in 1986, when a man attempting to blow up an El Al
airliner leaving London was given refuge in the Syrian Embassy
before turning himself in. Britain broke relations and other
Western nations temporarily withdrew their ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which had been identified by Washington as a sponsor of
terrorism since 1979, became firmly entrenched on that roster.
Though Assad's government was not linked to directly supporting
terrorism after about 1986, it continued to give safe haven to the
political leadership of the most radical Palestinian organizations.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the Soviet Union after 1989, Assad realized
that he could no longer harvest military or economic aid in the
Kremlin, and he began looking for the means to forge closer ties
with the West.
</P>
<P>
   For that, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 proved a godsend,
with Syria joining the Gulf War coalition pieced together by the
United States. Only a few thousand Syrian troops were deployed, but
the presence of soldiers from such a staunch Arab nationalist
country carried heavy symbolic weight.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The momentum from the war coalition carried into another
American effort to build an Arab-Israeli peace treaty, and Syria
for the first time set aside its refusal to sit face to face with
the Israeli negotiators. Assad personally conducted the talks about
Syrian participation.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty in negotiating with Syria was underscored under
the Clinton administration, when Secretary of State Warren
Christopher began shuttling around the Middle East trying to build
on the agreement that the Israelis and Palestinians worked out
themselves in Oslo. Assad was appalled that Arafat had become yet
another Arab leader making a separate peace with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   However with broad if nebulous assurances from the Israeli
government of Yitzhak Rabin that a full withdrawal from the Golan
Heights could be negotiated, Assad too indicated that Syria was
willing to talk peace. Christopher made more than 20 trips to
Damascus, and President Clinton met with the Syrian leader twice in
1994, once in Geneva and once in Damascus, becoming the first
American president to visit since Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to revive the peace effort with Syria late last year
collapsed this spring after Clinton had another failed meeting with
Assad in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the absence of clashes on the Golan Heights after the
1974 disengagement accord, the peace talks between Syria and Israel
ultimately foundered on their mutual suspicions. The Israelis had
no plans to withdraw to the 1967 lines, which would put Syria in
control of a chunk of the shoreline of Lake Tiberias, their main
water source.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Assad apparently felt he could not make peace
without regaining every inch of lost territory and he resisted
Israeli attempts to tie peace to a complete normalization of
relations with free trade and open borders. Assad feared that
Israel, having fought the Arabs to a stalemate, wanted to dominate
them economically.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Syria in the 1990s, Assad was consolidating his position
and preparing for his eldest son, Basil, an army officer and an
equestrian champion, to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   In a December 1991 plebiscite on a fourth, seven-year term as
president, Assad got 99.9 percent of the vote. As one Syrian writer
noted wryly to a foreign reporter, ``Even if Allah had run, he
wouldn't have done as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assad's dynastic plans were threatened when Basil died in an
automobile accident in 1994. Then, Assad picked his next son in
line, Bashar, who had been training in London to be an eye surgeon,
as his heir apparent. Bashar was made a lieutenant colonel, given a
top military post and referred to publicly as ``the hope'' of
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize his own line for succession, Assad in February 1998
stripped his brother Rifaat of the largely ceremonial title of vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1983, when Assad was hospitalized with a heart attack,
Rifaat had tried to use his control of the military to assume
power. As the president recuperated, Rifaat proved reluctant to
back down and brought the country to the brink of civil war. Assad
checked his brother, who spent the years from 1984 to 1992 in
exile.
</P>
<P>
   Assad is survived by four of his five children.
</P>
<P>
   Although he set up the dynastic guidelines so his son would
succeed him, it is unclear whether the second generation has the
clout needed to control the competing security and intelligence
agencies. Assad was the lone Syrian who had sufficient influence to
make peace with Israel and to make it stick, but he never found the
formula for getting the Golan back.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State James Baker in his 1995 memoir ``The Politics
of Diplomacy'' quoted Assad as saying: ``The land is important. It
connotes dignity and honor. A man is not chosen to go to paradise
unless he can do so in a dignified way.''

MEDICAL INTERNS' LONG HOURS PROMPT FIRST CRACKDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The authorities who evaluate medical education
have, for the first time, begun to crack down on doctor-training
programs that force interns and residents to work exceedingly long
hours.
</P>
<P>
   More than 29 percent of training programs in surgery and
internal medicine were cited for violations of work-hour standards
last year, according to the private group that evaluates and
accredits medical education.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, after years of debate, some experts now say that
sleep-deprived doctors are more likely than other physicians to
make mistakes, threatening patients' safety. Medical errors are
attracting increasing attention, and the government is
contemplating new steps to strengthen how they are reported and
corrected.
</P>
<P>
   The new data on work-hour violations came from the Accreditation
Council for Graduate Medical Education, the body that sets
standards for the training of doctors and measures compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in training often work 36-hour shifts and 100-hour
weeks, and experts in the field say that New York is the only state
with a law limiting such work hours.
</P>
<P>
   The council has never before disclosed the number of violations.
But Dr. David C. Leach, executive director of the council, said:
``There has been an increase in the frequency with which this issue
provokes a citation. That reflects an increase in the number of
programs that are in violation of the standard for work hours.''
</P>
<P>
   The council said it reviewed 69 training programs in general
surgery last year and cited 25 of them, or 36 percent, for
violating its standards on permissible work hours. Reviewers found
similar violations at seven of the 13 programs in pediatric
surgery, 54 percent; 28 of the 92 programs in internal medicine, 30
percent; and 20 of the 69 programs in orthopedic surgery, 29
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The council did not identify the teaching hospitals with
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Requirements vary from one specialty to another, but reviewers
found frequent violations of three standards in particular. The
standards state that residents must have off at least one day out
of every seven, should not be on duty in the hospital more often
than every third night and should not have to work more than a
specified number of hours _ say, 80 hours a week, averaged over a
one-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rachel R. Marcus, a 32-year-old fellow in cardiovascular
medicine at Stanford University, fondly remembers her years in
training at a major teaching hospital in Boston, but said: ``I was
chronically fatigued, so tired I felt as if I was operating in a
daze sometimes. You go into medicine for idealistic reasons, but by
the end of a grueling internship, you see each patient you admit to
the hospital as a barrier to getting sleep. That's a horrible way
to interact with people.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus said residents' lack of sleep could affect their
decision-making ability. ``I remember one night in the hospital
when I told a nurse something that was wrong, the exact opposite of
what I should have said about giving antibiotics to a patient,''
she recalled. ``Seconds later, when I was more awake, I realized my
error, but I still wonder what might have happened if I'd gone back
to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   If a teaching hospital does not correct its violations, it can
face serious penalties. A training program may lose its
accreditation. If that happens, the hospital will lose some of its
Medicare money, and residents will shun the program because they
cannot be certified as specialists unless they graduate from an
accredited training program.
</P>
<P>
   No training program has lost its accreditation exclusively
because of work-hour violations.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to restrict work hours comes as Congress is
considering legislation to reduce medical errors and as labor
unions are intensifying their efforts to enlist doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Strict compliance with the work-hour standards could increase
costs for teaching hospitals, which often rely on young doctors as
a source of low-cost labor. Leach said that budget constraints had
forced some teaching hospitals to cut back ``support staff,''
including the people who draw blood and transport patients. Some
hospitals use residents to perform such tasks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's said that the health care system is broken and has cracks
in it, and that residents live in those cracks,'' Leach said.
``They are the glue that holds the system together. They get things
done even though the system is dysfunctional.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For a decade, New York state has had a law that limits most
interns and residents to 24-hour shifts and 80-hour work weeks. But
in 1998, the state Health Department found widespread violations.
Since then, the state has inspected 35 teaching hospitals and fined
26 of them for allowing residents to work hours that far exceed the
limits set by state law.
</P>
<P>
   Without explicitly resisting the work-hour limits, many surgeons
have expressed skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George F. Sheldon, a former president of the American
College of Surgeons who is chairman of the surgery department at
the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, said: ``A surgeon
has a fiduciary responsibility to care for a patient before, during
and after an operation. You can't punch a clock and say, `My time
is up.' We believe in continuity of care. That is not always
consistent with working a fixed number of hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marvin R. Dunn, who coordinates the council's review of
residency programs, agreed. ``Continuity of care by the same
physician is very important, especially in surgery,'' Dunn said.
``Errors are made when patients are handed over from the care of
one physician to another.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. William C. Dement of Stanford University, a pioneer in
the study of sleep, said his research and observations strongly
suggested that ``sleep deprivation contributes to medical errors,''
and that ``with more hours of sleep, doctors make fewer errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark L. Levy, executive director of the Committee of Interns and
Residents, a labor union with 10,000 members, said that teaching
hospitals and medical societies had for years opposed limits on
residents' work hours. Medical educators are beginning to enforce
such limits, he said, because they want to prevent unions from
gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching hospitals and accrediting agencies are trying to
clean up their act,'' Levy said. ``They are becoming more
systematic in enforcing work standards. They are finally
acknowledging that work hours are excessive. They are doing this,
in part, to reduce the appeal of and need for unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard B. Reiling, who supervises the surgical residency
program at Kettering Medical Center in Ohio, said it was
inappropriate to set rigid limits on doctors' work hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age,'' Reiling said, ``a lot of residents want
the time off not because they're tired, but because they want to
moonlight to make extra money to pay off their monumental loans.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonlighting _ clinical activity outside an educational program
_ is not counted in determining how many hours a doctor has worked.
But Dunn, of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
Education, said the organization was considering a change in policy
to require that such work be counted.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Down a narrow lane near the western outskirts of
this city, wood-framed country houses and arching trees impart a
rural feel, giving no hint that nearby is a place where a special
kind of intellectual intensity rules the day.
</P>
<P>
   But past a park, the functional, beige buildings of Ner Israel
Rabbinical College come into view, where the study hall
reverberates with the voices of hundreds of young Orthodox Jewish
men, debating one-on-one, across tables stacked high with books of
Jewish law and tradition. It is an activity that occupies students
here morning, afternoon and evening, Sundays through Fridays,
before the start of the Jewish sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is not how much ground you cover,'' explained Isaac
Greenberg, 21, a pile of well-thumbed texts at his elbow, ``but how
you understand it and how you incorporate it in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a scene was a staple of Eastern European Jewish life a
century ago, when yeshivas _ traditional academies for the study of
Judaism's authoritative texts _ flourished. But rather than merely
reflecting the past, what is happening here is part of a growing
trend within Orthodox Judaism's most rigorously traditional sector.
</P>
<P>
   The number of collegiate and graduate students pursuing
religious studies in these all-male institutions ``has probably
almost doubled'' since 1980, to about 18,000 nationwide, writes
William Helmreich in a new edition of his book, ``The World of the
Yeshiva,'' from Ktav Publishing House, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Helmreich, who teaches sociology at City College of New York and
the City University Graduate Center, said in an interview that the
growth is primarily because of a high birthrate among the adherents
of Orthodox Judaism, and greater economic prosperity that allows
them to provide more financial support to these institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews account for about 7 percent of the nation's 5.5
million Jews, but within that area of Judaism, a shift has been
occurring. As yeshiva enrollments have grown, so too has the
religious influence of the right wing _ at the expense of
Orthodoxy's once-dominant modern wing, which holds that Jews can be
fully observant and highly involved in wider American society.
</P>
<P>
   While modern Orthodox young people have become doctors, lawyers
and other white-collar professionals, sociologists like Helmreich
say, the right wing has been turning out a high number of rabbis
and religious school teachers, who in turn help shape the religious
lives of many in Orthodoxy's next generation.
</P>
<P>
   At Ner Israel, many people see growth around them.
</P>
<P>
   Yaakov Feinstein, 26, of New York City, a student of Talmudic
law, said he has seen the college add a dormitory and faculty
housing during the past dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more than Ner Israel, I think the total community
is growing,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the college, he said, ``We're really here to be
God-fearing Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Ner Israel was founded in Baltimore in 1933 by Rabbi Jacob
Ruderman, a Lithuanian immigrant, who began with 15 students. Now,
800 boys and young men attend the high school, collegiate and
graduate programs. The college's enrollment has grown by 50 percent
since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Among yeshivas, Ner Israel is unusual in that it has always
allowed students access to secular, professional education. The
college is accredited by the state of Maryland and has agreements
with public and private universities at which its students can
major in law, business and other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The roster of recent alumni includes bankers, accountants and
psychologists _ as well as rabbis and religious school teachers,
who college officials say make up 50 percent of graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Ner Israel's mission statement makes clear that its priority is
religious studies. Students pursuing secular degrees are asked to
limit their work to nights or summer. The college's purpose, the
statement says, is to preserve ``a rarified environment'' for
dedication to ``intense Torah study.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of that study is chavrusa, students working in
pairs, each young man selecting a partner based on intellectual and
social compatibility. In the daily debate over religious texts lies
educational growth, college officials say.
</P>
<P>
   How long do they spend in this kind of study? ``I'd say you've
got to figure eight hours a day, at least on average,'' said Rabbi
Ezra Neuberger, dean of the graduate school. ``The more diligent
would be a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the hill from the academic buildings is a residential area
called Yeshiva Lane, where modestly dressed women with head
coverings supervise flocks of children outside the six-bedroom town
houses and three-bedroom apartments, built for faculty and graduate
students.
</P>
<P>
   The sight suggests a self-contained community, but the college
has built ties to Orthodox Jews worldwide. Since the revolution in
Iran two decades ago, it has taken in Iranian Jewish refugees.
Nearly 50 study here now, said one of their rabbis, who asked not
to be named out of concern for relatives in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But there are others from overseas, too. ``There are a lot of
South Americans here, a lot of Europeans, a lot of Australians,''
said Rafael Mael, 20, of Baltimore. ``I've roomed with people from
Chile and Panama.''
</P>
<P>
   A person who has helped foster ties to Latin American
communities is Moshe Filler, 34, who came from Mexico City and
enrolled in Ner Israel to study as a teacher some years ago. Now he
runs programs that bring young Latin American Jews to study for the
summer on campus, while maintaining the college's links with Jewish
communities in Bolivia, Costa Rica, Peru and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become like a center for all these communities,''
Filler said.
</P>
<P>
   His job involves considerable travel. ``Last week I was in
Chile,'' he said. ``Today, I go to Guatemala.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuition at Ner Israel is $9,000 a year, but only a minority of
students pay full cost. The college considers its applicants first,
then finds out if those it accepts can pay, said Rabbi Herman N.
Neuberger, the president. ``We feel we do make a contribution to
the spiritual life of America through training of our young men,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many students have come here from Orthodox day schools. But some
have taken a different route.
</P>
<P>
   Among the latter is Gil Neuman, 31, who arrived last October
after two years' study in Israel. Before that, he worked in
Hollywood, producing and writing films.
</P>
<P>
   But his life changed one Friday evening when he attended a
Sabbath dinner at the home of a Ner Israel graduate, where, he
said, he was deeply impressed with the religious lives of those he
met.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had a sense of purpose and a sense of meaning that
nobody has in today's world,'' Neuman said.

RACIAL BIAS FOUND IN SIX MORE CAPITAL CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TEXAS-DEATHROW-LAWYER) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Less than a week after the U.S. Supreme Court vacated
the death sentence of a Texas inmate because of racially biased
testimony in his case, the state attorney general announced that
six other convicted killers are likely to have their death
sentences overturned for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   A two-month investigation by Attorney General John Cornyn
focused on capital cases involving Walter Quijano, a clinical
psychologist who has often served as an expert witness for
prosecutors across Texas in sentencing hearings. On Tuesday, the
Supreme Court unanimously vacated the death sentence of a convicted
murderer, Victor Saldano, because Quijano had testified that race
could be considered a factor in determining whether Saldano should
receive the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Cornyn announced that Quijano had provided similar,
racially charged expert testimony in six other cases of inmates now
on death row. Cornyn's staff has notified defense lawyers
representing the six inmates that his office will not object if
they seek to overturn the death sentences based on Quijano's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Texas want and deserve a system that affords the
same fairness to everyone,'' Cornyn said in a statement released
via e-mail late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This new development does not mean that these inmates will be
set free. In fact, Cornyn asked the Supreme Court to vacate
Saldano's death sentence so that he could hold a new sentencing
hearing ``in which race is not considered.'' Under Texas law, a
jury must consider whether a defendant could be ``a continuing
threat to society'' when deciding the death penalty. In the case of
Saldano, who is an Argentine national, Quijano advised jurors that
the defendant could be considered more dangerous based on the fact
that Hispanics were ``over-represented'' in prisons.
</P>
<P>
   In his review, Cornyn found eight capital cases involving
Quijano but only six involved racially charged testimony. Cornyn
also said his staff had reviewed the files of the 218 inmates
executed in Texas since 1982 and found that none of those
executions were based on ``this kind of testimony by Dr. Quijano.''
His statement did not say whether other experts might have provided
such testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The six death row inmates whose sentences will likely be
overturned are convicted murderers: John Alba, Carl Henry Blue,
Eugene Alvin Broxton, Duane Buck, Gustavo Julian Garcia and Michael
Dean Gonzales.

 &HT;    A murder, a lynching, a mystery
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mary Phagan Kean was attending a Leadership Cobb
meeting a few years ago when a man introduced himself with a
startling admission. His grandfather, he told her, was one of the
vigilantes who ``took care of Leo Frank.''
</P>
<P>
   He wanted her to know because Kean, a 46-year-old special
education administrator, is the great-niece of Mary Phagan, the
blue-eyed, pink-ribboned factory girl whose 1913 murder
precipitated one of the most infamous chapters in Georgia history.
Her employer, Frank, a wiry, nervous young man from Brooklyn, was
convicted of the crime and then lynched near Marietta, after the
governor commuted his death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   People confided in Kean. Once, at a Size 5-7-9 shop in a local
mall, a salesgirl recognized her name and volunteered that one of
her kin had helped string up Frank. Kean recorded what she heard
and kept a roster of the men who believed they were avenging her
great-aunt. She sealed her latest version of the list in an
envelope and printed across the front, with a teacher's neat
penmanship, ``To be opened at my demise.''
</P>
<P>
   Kean pulls the envelope out of a loose-leaf binder and lays it
on a table in her home. ``I can't show this to you,'' she says.
``Too many people would be hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's too late now. One of her working lists has been posted
on the Internet against her wishes. For the first time, one of the
oldest, darkest secrets of the South _ the names of the people who
lynched Leo Frank _ is beginning to see the light of day.
</P>
<P>
   MEMORIES KEPT ALIVE
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost 85 years since Frank was hanged, but the
passions unleashed that long-ago morning in Marietta have not been
forgotten. Two plays inspired by the case are opening here this
summer. On Tuesday, Atlanta native Alfred Uhry's musical ``Parade''
will begin a week-long run at the Fox Theatre. On Aug. 16, the
anniversary of Frank's abduction, ``The Lynching of Leo Frank''
will be staged on the very square where Cobb County's movers and
shakers plotted to break him out of prison and execute him.
</P>
<P>
   Retellings of this tale are nothing new, of course. Perhaps 20
books, movies and plays have covered the ground in every decade
since Phagan and Frank were murdered. In all of them, the lynchers
have remained a faceless, nameless mob. The victims, on the other
hand, are vivid.
</P>
<P>
   All these decades later, pilgrims still visit the Phagan grave
in Marietta's Confederate cemetery and tarry at the inscription
that assures her soul that ``many an aching heart in Georgia beats
for you.'' Some of them stuffed animals, a display strangely
reminiscent of the toys hung from a dogwood tree a few blocks away
at the grave of another murdered child, JonBenet Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, there's a different sort of tribute. A plaque on a
nondescript professional building marks the spot where Frank was
lynched. The inscription is as stark as Phagan's is lyrical:
``Wrongly accused. Falsely convicted. Wantonly murdered.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Steven Lebow, of the nearby Temple Kol Emeth, had the
bronze tablet placed on the 80th anniversary of the lynching. It
was the first time anyone in Marietta had memorialized Frank, who
was Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``That lynching is treated like the original sin in Cobb
County,'' Lebow says. ``It's like something out of a William
Faulkner novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Marietta was definitely a more Faulknerian place in 1915. It was
a country town of about 6,000 centered on a classic Southern
courthouse square that filled with farmers' horse-drawn wagons on
Saturday afternoons. The county's largest employer was the Brumby
rocking chair factory. Atlanta, 20 miles down red-clay roads, felt
much farther away than it does today.
</P>
<P>
   It was an era of vigilantism. Twenty-two people _ all but one of
them black _ were lynched in Georgia in 1915. One of them died the
same day as Frank; 63-year-old John Riggins was hanged near
Bainbridge for allegedly assaulting a white tobacco planter's wife.
The story rated three paragraphs on an inside page of The Atlanta
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Frank's lynching got a three-line banner headline across the
front. His story was utterly unique. Here was a white man, an Ivy
League-educated Yankee, convicted of murdering a pretty gentile
girl with Marietta roots, all on the testimony of a black janitor
who said his boss man had come on to her at the pencil factory.
Sex, race, religion, class, sectionalism _ in one swoop, the case
exposed the raw nerves quivering below the surface of the New
South. Once Frank was sentenced to die, his fate became a national
cause celebre, on one side galvanizing the newly formed
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, on the other helping to
inspire the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   For all its larger repercussions, however, the Frank story
continues to fascinate historians and playwrights for one very
human reason: It began and ended with murder mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lynching is one of the great unsolved crimes of the 20th
century,'' says Steve Oney, a Los Angeles writer who has been
working on a book about the case for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the details are known from contemporary and historical
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1915, after Gov. John M. Slaton commuted
Frank's death penalty to life in prison, a group of Cobb civic
leaders calling themselves the Knights of Mary Phagan met secretly
to plot the lynching. What drove them to action, Oney says, wasn't
blind anti-Semitism. It was their belief that Slaton had pulled a
fast one; one of the partners in his Atlanta law firm was Luther Z.
Rosser, Frank's lead defense counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Oney draws an analogy: ``Imagine how people would have felt if
O.J. Simpson had been found guilty and the governor of California
commuted his sentence and, oh, by the way, he practiced law with
Johnnie Cochran.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after the commutation, the Knights launched an
attempt to abduct Frank but had to abort it because someone talked.
A few days later, an inmate attacked Frank with a butcher knife,
slitting his throat and almost killing him. The lynchers bided
their time as he healed.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, late on the afternoon of Aug. 16, a Monday, eight cars
left Marietta one by one for the state prison farm in
Milledgeville. The commandos arrived shortly before midnight, cut
the telephone wires, severed the gas lines of the prison cars and
overpowered the guards. They woke Frank, handcuffed him and drove
him through the night to his execution.
</P>
<P>
   The sun was beginning to rise as the party approached Marietta.
They had planned to hang Frank in the town square or at Phagan's
grave. Now they decided they'd better get it done before daylight,
so they pulled off into an oak grove on a farm belonging to a
former Cobb sheriff. They wanted to know whether Frank had any last
requests. He removed his wedding ring and asked that it be returned
to his wife of five years, Lucille, a member of one of Atlanta's
most prominent Jewish families, the Seligs. He was allowed to write
her a note, Oney says, but the lynchers destroyed it because it was
in German and they couldn't be sure he wasn't pointing a finger at
them.
</P>
<P>
   A little after 7 a.m., one of the men kicked a table out from
under Frank. His body dangled 4 feet above the ground, blood
spreading from the reopened knife wound, and he slowly strangled to
death.
</P>
<P>
   When word of the lynching reached Marietta, people rushed to the
scene and snapped photos of the corpse and snipped pieces of the
rope for souvenirs. One roadhouse in Smyrna for years displayed a
scrap of what it claimed was the nightshirt Frank had been wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the crowd wanted to mutilate the corpse. One man ground
his heel into the face. Thanks to a judge who talked down the mob,
Frank's body was spirited to Atlanta before any further desecration
and shipped home to New York. He was buried under a headstone that
bears the Latin engraving semper idem _ ``always the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The state prison commission conducted an investigation. Cobb
County held two inquests. But no suspects were named, no charges
brought. Marietta had closed ranks. The Knights of Mary Phagan had
taken a vow of silence.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, not all of them would take their secret to the
grave.
</P>
<P>
   THE SECRET LISTS
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kinney is sitting in a back booth at the Cupboard, a
meat-and-three restaurant in an old house near the square in
Marietta. The columnist has covered his native Cobb County for
almost half a century with the Marietta Daily Journal. As he pokes
his fork into a mound of sweet potato souffle, he considers the
touchy question of why, after all these years, Frank's lynchers
have never been named.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a community embarrassment, that's why,'' he says. ``My
mother always said not to talk about it because it was a black eye
for Marietta. So we didn't talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But some people did _ people in a position to know. Whether they
were proud of their involvement or stricken by guilty consciences,
some of the lynchers (the last one of whom died a quarter of a
century ago) wrote things down or told their recollections to
family and friends. One account, from the inner circle of the
conspiracy, ended up in Kinney's possession.
</P>
<P>
   As a young reporter, Kinney wanted to know everything about the
Frank case. He spent days in the Fulton County courthouse reading
the trial transcripts (which have since disappeared) and decided
that, like the jurors, he would have voted to convict.
</P>
<P>
   Then, almost 30 years ago, he got a call from a good friend, a
local judge. One of the last lynchers had suffered a heart attack
some years before. Feeling pangs of mortality, he had summoned the
judge and made a deathbed statement of what he knew about the Frank
killing. The judge had a list of people who had planned and carried
it out. He was getting old now and wanted to entrust the
information to his newspaper pal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to do with it,'' Kinney remembers. ``It's
like wanting to know something, and once you know it, you're sorry.
It's been a burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, a procession of students, historians and
journalists have tramped into Kinney's office and tried to wheedle
a peek at the list. He guards it like a last will and testament.
While he has hinted at some of the names in talks before civic
groups, he has disclosed little. He certainly hasn't spilled the
beans in the Marietta paper, not when he sees the grandsons and
great nieces of lynchers on a weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Kinney sees one of the descendants in the mirror every morning.
An uncle of his, a barber named Cicero Dobbs, was almost certainly
a member of the group that plotted Frank's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he was involved,'' Kinney says. ``Everyone
says he was.''
</P>
<P>
   There are others with lists. Kean has hers. Oney obtained one
from a woman who had taken dictation from her father, one of the
lynchers, during the '40s. Tim Cole, a sports marketer who grew up
in Cobb County, got a list from a person who got it from one of the
lynchers. He passed it along to Rabbi Lebow, whose synagogue he
attends with his Jewish wife.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, none of the list-keepers has tried to publicize
the information _ not even the rabbi responsible for the plaque
memorializing Frank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just put it in a file,'' Lebow says. ``I know some nice and
kind people here who are related to members of the lynch mob. I
didn't want to hurt them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Cox, director of the Marietta Museum of History, saw
firsthand how damaging anything connected to the lynching could be
when he gave an interview to a reporter a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story kind of implied that someone had been involved, and
I knew good and well he hadn't been,'' Cox says. ``Well, his widow
called and said it was news to her. She was upset. She said she
hadn't been sleeping very well just thinking about it. This is
still very sensitive with the older people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox has his own list, based in part on oral histories he has
conducted. He figures the whole sordid story will all come out
sooner or later _ probably when Oney's book is published _ and he
almost welcomes that day, as if a ball and chain will finally have
been unfastened from Marietta's psyche. He just doesn't want to be
the one who does it. He has to live here.
</P>
<P>
   This year an Atlantan saved Marietta the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   NAMES MADE PUBLIC
</P>
<P>
   The list that finally came out is one Mary Phagan Kean made as a
young woman when she started gathering information for a memoir she
finished in 1987. She disclosed no names in her book. But she did
share her intelligence with Tom Watson Brown, a garrulous lawyer
and great grandson of Tom Watson, the politician-turned-publisher
who did so much to inflame feelings against Frank in his
newspapers. Brown forwarded a copy of the list to a friend at Emory
University, who placed it in the Leo Frank file in the general
library's special collections. That's where Stephen Goldfarb saw
it; he thought he'd discovered the Holy Grail.
</P>
<P>
   Goldfarb, an information line researcher at the Atlanta-Fulton
Public Library, holds a doctorate in history and has written about
the Frank case for several years. After doing some biographical
spade work to identify the names, he approached several
publications in New York and Atlanta about printing his analysis.
They all declined for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Weary of the project, he decided to post the information online
at www.leofranklynchers.com. He did it, he says, not in a spirit of
vengeance, but because it was a piece of lost history that might
lead to more pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't blame the children of Germany for the Holocaust,''
Goldfarb says. ``How can we blame the people of Marietta who are
two generations removed for this lynching? You don't chose your
ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   The list shows about two dozen people, some identified only by
surname, a few with notations suggesting that they planned the
operation, actually participated in the lynching or, in one case,
might have knotted the hangman's noose.
</P>
<P>
   Kean, who admits the document is hers, says it was an embryonic
effort marred by several mistakes. She was ticked off at Goldfarb
for putting it on the Internet. To avoid any future indiscretions,
she vows to shred her current list _ the one marked ``To be opened
at my demise.''
</P>
<P>
   Even allowing for some inaccuracies, the Web site supports what
has always been said about the Frank lynching: that the leading
citizens of Cobb County conceived and sanctioned it. The list
includes judges, lawyers, bankers, a former House speaker, a former
governor and some of the county's oldest names _ Brumby, Clay,
Dorsey, Morris, Sessions _ several of whom have Marietta streets
named for them. Most of them probably weren't at the hanging, but
they set it in motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing was organized from the courthouse on down,'' says
Cox, of the Marietta history museum, who reviewed the list and
confirmed many of the names.
</P>
<P>
   But the treachery wasn't confined to Cobb. The Frank lynching
was not, as many think, a moral stain that Marietta bears
exclusively. Oney, whose book is scheduled to be published by
Pantheon next year, promises to detail a much broader conspiracy, a
stain that leeches across the Chattahoochee River and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is a lot bigger than that list,'' he says. ``The
lynching was planned and carried out in Marietta, true. But there
were accomplices in Atlanta and Milledgeville. Powerful people in
the state government had to sign off. It wasn't just Cobb County
that lynched Leo Frank.''
</P>
<P>
   A PAINFUL PAST
</P>
<P>
   Mary Phagan Kean is not the only woman linked by blood and
anguish to the Frank drama. In Wyckoff, N.J., Catherine Smithline,
Frank's 53-year-old great niece, has been following the
reverberations of the case for years. She believes she is the first
member of the Frank family to speak to the Atlanta media in many
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Phagans, the Franks didn't talk much about the painful
events of the past. Smithline didn't hear the story until she was
in high school. Her mother, the daughter of Frank's sister, didn't
find out about it until she was on a date in the late '30s and saw
a Lana Turner movie loosely based on the saga, ``They Won't
Forget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that's about your uncle,'' her boyfriend said. She
had always been told that her Uncle Leo died of pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the William Breman Jewish Heritage Museum in
Atlanta contacted Smithline to see whether the Frank family had any
artifacts it might donate. Archivist Sandra Berman wanted to show
Frank as a human being, not just a bug-eyed suspect in a courtroom
or a manacled corpse suspended from a limb. Smithline and her
family gave the museum dozens of photos, letters and personal
effects, including the tiny leather shoes Leo wore as a baby.
</P>
<P>
   Smithline has not been to the museum. ``It's very difficult for
me to set foot in Georgia,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But she has visited the state. Once, while her husband was in
town on business, she spent hours at the Atlanta History Center
reading about the case. She had no desire to go to Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   When she heard about the Web site, Smithline at first didn't
care to go there either. But she soon gave in to curiosity and
called it up on her computer screen and read the names of the
people who took it upon themselves to decide her great uncle's
fate. They meant little to her. She felt nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too late to do any good anyway,'' she says. ``They don't
prosecute people posthumously.''

EDITORIAL: A GIFT TO THE WEALTHIEST 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, June 11:
</P>
<P>
   Seldom have so many voted for a gargantuan tax cut for so few.
The House voted overwhelmingly Friday, 279-136, to repeal the
federal estate tax _ a tax so focused on the rich that it hits only
about 2 percent of all estates. Sponsors claimed to be acting on
behalf of families who inherit a family farm or business only to
find that they are forced to sell the property to pay the ``death
tax.''
</P>
<P>
   But among the estates that are now subject to taxation, only
about 3 percent are farms or family businesses, and there are
better ways to get relief to them.
</P>
<P>
   Estate taxes are not imposed on inheritances under $675,000, and
that exemption will rise to $1 million by 2006, or $2 million for
couples with some planning. The very rich pay almost all of the
tax. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
liberal research group, about half of the tax is paid by the
wealthiest one-thousandth of the people who die. The code already
provides a variety of special allowances for family farms and
businesses, including an exemption of $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Abolishing the estate tax would have severe consequences. When
fully phased in, the bill would cost about $50 billion a year.
Repeal would also threaten the nation's finest universities and
museums. Wealthy families no longer facing estate taxes might well
decide to leave more money to their families, and less to charity.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats offered a more-than-reasonable alternative. Their
plan would cut the estate tax rates by 20 percent, a gesture to the
political pressures, and raise the exclusion for couples owning
family farms and businesses to $4 million to better help the
supposed targets of this legislation. Yet the House swatted the
alternative aside, demonstrating that a large majority of members
were less concerned with rescuing family farms and businesses than
with enriching their wealthiest supporters.

HAFEZ ASSAD, WHO TURNED SYRIA INTO A MIDDLE EAST POWER, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also filed in category ``i'')  
 (See also: ASSAD-DEATH)  
 (EDS: An abridged version, OBIT-ASSAD-ABRIDGED, is also being
filed.)  
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hafez Assad, the air force officer who ruled Syria for nearly
three decades, transforming a Middle East backwater into an
introverted regional power that endured as the center of unbending
Arab hostility toward Israel, died Saturday in Damascus. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, a survivor of several assassination attempts and at least
one heart attack, died of a heart attack, according to medical
officials quoted by Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Arab autocrats who became stock players in the
perpetual drama of negotiating Middle East peace, none was more
courted, or more aloof, than the Syrian leader. No lasting peace
could hold without him, but none could be negotiated with him
either. A treaty remained elusive largely because of his role in
demanding back every inch of Syrian territory.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Assad's longevity in office rested on a rigid
intolerance of dissent, most starkly illustrated by the slaying of
thousands of residents of Hama in February 1982 to end a swelling
Islamic insurgency. His was a suspicious police state, barring
modern instruments like the fax or the Internet that might somehow
become tools to undermine his government.
</P>
<P>
   Assad rarely traveled, even within Syria, and as he aged his
public appearances were limited to religious ceremonies on major
holidays. But his withdrawn life was also devoid of the lavish
trappings common to other Arab rulers. His home and office, where
he often worked 18-hour days, consisted of two modest villas that
faced each other in a residential neighborhood in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   The stream of American presidents, secretaries of state and
other officials who crossed his doorstep over the years, hoping to
keep the latest peace effort from foundering there, emerged with a
grudging respect for Assad. He was at once courteous and
calculating, professorial and persistent, unleashing flashes of
self-deprecating humor during marathon negotiating sessions. The
length of the sessions were as legendary as they were
nerve-racking.
</P>
<P>
   When Henry Kissinger arrived in 1973, becoming the first
American secretary of state to visit Syria in 20 years, their
initial meeting lasted 6{ hours. The press, uninitiated in the ways
of the Assad, wondered aloud if Kissinger had been kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``His tactic was to open with a statement of the most extreme
position to test what the traffic would bear,'' Kissinger wrote in
``Years of Upheaval,'' the volume of his memoirs published in 1982.
``He might then allow himself to be driven back to the attainable,
fighting a dogged rear guard action that made clear that
concessions could be exacted only at a heavy price, and that
discouraged excessive expectations of them. (His negotiating style
was in this respect not so different from the Israelis', much as
both of them would hate the comparison.)''
</P>
<P>
   Assad was most renowned for lecturing foreigners, even American
presidents, about the unfair colonial fragmentation of the Middle
East. In case anyone missed the point, his reception hall was
dominated by a large painting depicting the Arab armies under
Saladin defeating the Crusaders during the battle of Hittin in
1187, a not-so-subtle reminder that he considered present
circumstances temporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in his bitterness toward Israel, he retained a certain
wry humor about their conflicting views, and he seemed to derive
great patience from his obvious sense of history,'' President Jimmy
Carter wrote in ``The Blood of Abraham,'' a 1985 study of the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Syria was a young nation adrift before Assad's rule. The
government had been a revolving door swung repeatedly by coups
after independence from France in 1946, resulting in little
development and a population weary of chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodless power grab he staged in November 1970 brought
stability and the first modern construction of roads, schools and
hospitals. Assad followed the Soviet model of a single-party police
state, constructing a network of 15 competing intelligence agencies
that mostly spied on his own people.
</P>
<P>
   It was in regional politics, however, that Assad most sought to
create a legacy, remaking Syria into a power among the Arabs rather
than a political football. He was inspired by the Arab nationalism
preached by President Gamal Abdul Nasser of Egypt, and like many of
his generation, he sought to inherit Nasser's role as the voice of
Arab unity.
</P>
<P>
   But Assad, more than most, experienced the bitter chasm between
the vaunted oratory of unity and the constant scheming and back
stabbing that marked actual relations among the Arab states in
watershed events like the wars against Israel. He often told
negotiators that he would face assassination if he negotiated a
separate peace on terms unfavorable to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expects us to raise banners of happiness and pleasure
with such a clandestine agreement held behind our backs,'' he said
in an American television interview in October 1993, right after
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, lead by Yasser
Arafat, announced a peace agreement worked out in secret under
Norwegian auspices. ``The Arabs are one people. If I were to sign
an agreement similar to that signed by Arafat, I would have faced
great problems. You all know that there are Arab leaders who paid
with their lives as the price for such separate behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad's roots in an isolated, impoverished religious minority
made him an unlikely candidate to become leader of Syria. But for a
man who spent his lifetime railing against the legacy of Western
colonization, its waning years brought unprecedented change to
sleepy villages like his.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad was the ninth of 11 children, born on Oct. 6, 1930,
to minor notables in the village of Qurdaha, in the Ansariya
Mountains, which rise sharply from the Mediterranean coast. (The
adopted family name, sometimes transliterated Asad, means lion.)
The mountains made for a secure home for his ethnic group, the
Alawite sect, a tiny branch of the Shiite school of Islam and a
sect often branded as heretical by the Sunni Muslim majority that
dominated Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain tribes had been all but ignored during the 400
years that the Ottoman Empire controlled Syria, left to their
subsistence farming in villages consisting of small stone hovels.
Patrick Seale, in his 1988 biography, ``Asad of Syria: The Struggle
for the Middle East,'' said that at the time of Assad's birth,
Qurdaha consisted of about 100 houses at the end of a dirt track.
It had neither mosque, nor shop, nor cafe. His father and two wives
lived in a two-room, flat-roofed stone house.
</P>
<P>
   The Arabs had expected independence in exchange for their
rebellion against Ottoman rule during World War I, but in a secret
1916 pact known as the Sykes-Picot agreement, the British and
French divided the Levant. Their action is still vividly remembered
in Syria, and a long commentary on the betrayal of the Sykes-Picot
accord was a perennial favorite of Assad's lectures to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The French, seeing the Alawite clans as potential allies in the
old divide-and-rule method of colonial government, introduced
schools to their villages. Assad's father was determined that his
younger children would excel, securing places for them in school
and challenging them to learn long poems in classical Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, Assad became the first member of his family to be sent
down to Latakia, on the coast, to start his secondary education. He
was soon caught up in the debates among Communists, Arab
nationalists and Islamic fundamentalists, which intensified as
Syria gained independence in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Assad joined the new Arab Baath Socialist Party, which preached
that a secular, socialist state encompassing all the Arabs would
revive their past glory and undermine Western dominance. When he
was elected to head his high school's student affairs committee, he
used the position to try to foment nationwide student protests
against other parties and the government.
</P>
<P>
   Assad told Seale, his biographer, that he addressed his student
meetings in verse, reciting one such speech from memory: ''There is
Damascus drinking the blood of its sons! Oh, Guardians of Glory,
where are the righteous rulers? The dogs have risen to the fount of
life!''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he finished high school in 1951, at the age of 20,
his interest in politics was cemented even as he embarked on an air
force career. Fees for military school were abolished with
independence, so he enrolled in the new Air Force College in
Aleppo. The Alawites, like the underprivileged throughout the
Middle East, used the military to gain an education and then to
supplant the elite that scorned them.
</P>
<P>
   His years in Aleppo, from 1952 to 1955, when he graduated as a
lieutenant, coincided with Nasser's rise in Egypt. In 1958 Syria's
government rushed to join Egypt in the United Arab Republic,
imagining that the idea would prove so seductive that all Arab
governments would either join or be swept aside. The union
collapsed in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Assad missed most of the first year of the union, having been
sent to the Soviet Union to learn how to fly the MiG-15s and
MiG-17s being delivered to Syria. Soon after he returned, his
squadron was transferred to Egypt. He and a fellow group of
officers, dismayed by the degree to which Syrians had been
marginalized, formed a secret committee to plot to take control in
Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   The years after the union brought turmoil. The highly
politicized officer corps jockeyed for control of the country, with
each faction taking power thinning the ranks of its rivals through
execution or exile. By the time the Arab-Israeli war erupted in
June 1967, Syrian military officers were ill-prepared to do battle.
</P>
<P>
   Assad was minister of defense during that war, having gained
that position in February 1966 when the group of officers he helped
found in Cairo seized power in a violent putsch. He was 35, serving
in his first Syrian government, the most extreme the country had
yet known. It was repressive at home, seeking to topple the old
Sunni Muslim elite, and radical abroad, funneling aid to
Palestinian guerrillas to attack Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The 1967 war, over in a week, was as much a military as a mental
blow to the Arabs. All their exaggerated oratory about the
bankruptcy of the Zionist cause proved fruitless, and the Arabs
suffered the embarrassment of losing the eastern sector of
Jerusalem, the Sinai peninsula and the Golan Heights in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Assad came to power after another debacle, in September 1970,
when Palestinian guerrillas in Jordan sought to topple King
Hussein. Syria sent tanks over the border to support the
guerrillas, then retreated under Jordanian air attacks, and Hussein
kept his throne. Assad used the disarray to stage a bloodless coup
called ``the corrective movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad ruled through the Baath Party, using its secular ideology
as the cover for bringing the Alawite minority into key positions.
Eventually the commanders of the special forces, intelligence, the
armored corps and key divisions were all Alawites, a remarkable
achievement for a group that used to produce the servant class.
</P>
<P>
   His first priority as president was trying to erase the stain of
the 1967 defeat. In that he had a ready ally in President Anwar
Sadat of Egypt. The two profited from the superpower competition
between the United States and the Soviet Union, with Moscow pouring
billions of dollars of weaponry into both their arsenals and
stationing thousands of advisers in both countries.
</P>
<P>
   They struck on Oct. 6, 1973, with the Egyptian forces crossing
the Suez Canal and the Syrians advancing into the Golan Heights.
The Israelis, while monitoring the troop buildup along their
borders in the days preceding the attack, were caught unaware,
seeing the huge mobilization as more bluster than threat.
</P>
<P>
   For days it seemed the survival of Israel was at stake, but it
gradually gained the advantage. The Egyptians had basically
captured the eastern shore of the Suez Canal and dug in, their two
top generals at loggerheads over how much of the army could advance
into the Sinai. Assad believed bitterly that Sadat had betrayed
him. He thought Sadat had crossed the canal and then deliberately
stopped, seeking a limited victory that would both restore the
image of the Egyptian army and more important, attract American
patronage. By the time a shaky cease-fire took hold at the end of
October, it was clear the Arabs had again been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The United States attempted to build a comprehensive peace
settlement, Kissinger shuttling between Arab capitals and Israel.
He was the first of many American officials to have their hopes
dashed by the Syrian leader, discovering at the end of lengthy
negotiations about a peace conference that Syria had no intention
of taking part.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Assad felt the Americans got the upper hand because the
talks paved the way for Egypt to forge a separate peace. The
cease-fire negotiated then on the Golan did stick, however, and it
became Israel's quietest border despite the upheaval that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The flare-up of 1973 was barely extinguished when the next
crisis erupted, in Lebanon. Its civil war pitted the Lebanese
Christians, whose power was enshrined in the constitution despite
their shrinking population, against the Palestine Liberation
Organization and more economically deprived communities like the
Shiites and the Druze. As the army and government fractured along
sectarian lines, the Christian defeat by the more numerous Muslim
factions seemed a foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Although Assad acknowledged that Syria and Lebanon were
sovereign nations, Syrians had long viewed Lebanon as a natural
part of their country that had been unfairly severed by colonial
meddling. Assad intervened with his army to preserve the status
quo.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said his defense of the Christian minority reflected his
own insecurity that majority rule in Lebanon might inspire attempts
to unseat his Alawite minority. The intervention in Lebanon, though
sanctioned by the Arab League, also gave Assad a chance to try to
reassert control over the PLO. He had long been at odds with
Arafat, even jailing him briefly in Damascus in 1966 for trying to
dilute Syrian influence over the Palestinian movement.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lebanese chaos gave an opening to a deadlier conflict,
providing Syria and Israel the space to fight another war. The
Syrians stood by at first during the 1982 Israeli invasion of
Lebanon, accepting Israel's assurances that it planned only to push
Palestinian guerrillas away from its border.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis really had their sights on Beirut and the
Palestinian command in Lebanon, knowing Assad would probably not be
able to avoid fighting because his army was already heavily engaged
in guaranteeing calm. The Syrian Air Force performed poorly, losing
79 MiGs, plus tanks and missile batteries.
</P>
<P>
   But Assad retained his influence over his neighbor. In September
1982, Syria was apparently the hand behind the assassination of the
Lebanese leader Bashir Gemayel, which effectively aborted the
attempt to negotiate a separate peace between Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Assad nonetheless put renewed emphasis on his doctrine of
``strategic parity'' with Israel. He believed that the Arabs would
always be hindered unless they could use military aid from the
Soviet Union and its Communist satellites to build a credible force
to face the high-tech weaponry that flowed to Israel from the
United States. The Soviet Union poured an estimated $2 billion into
the Syrian arsenal after the war, including about 160 fighter
aircraft and 800 T-72 tanks.
</P>
<P>
   As the proxy war in Lebanon had been simmering, a more
threatening rebellion was brewing at home.
</P>
<P>
   The first hint of the impending attempt to overthrow Baath Party
rule came in June 1979, when the Muslim Brotherhood massacred 50
Alawite cadets in the dining room of the military academy in
Aleppo.
</P>
<P>
   Then in June 1980 extremists lobbed at least two grenades at the
Syrian leader. Assad kicked one grenade away while a bodyguard
flung himself on the second, losing his life. In revenge, the
military unit controlled by Assad's headstrong younger brother,
Rifaat, descended on a desert prison near Palmyra and gunned down
at least 250 religious dissidents in their cells.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim extremists next rose up in 1982 in Hama. They killed
Baath Party officials and broadcast appeals from the mosques for a
nationwide insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuing the rebels, the Syrian military leveled half the
city, killing at least 10,000 residents. The carnage brought
widespread condemnation in the West, but it was the kind of act
that ensured Assad's utter control. When the choice came down to
spilling blood or preserving his hold on power, there was really no
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't be apologetic,'' recalled an American diplomat.
``Assad would justify it entirely by saying it was the necessary
price to end years and years of Muslim Brotherhood terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   His alliance with Iran after the 1979 Islamic revolution there
brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to power was based on similar
calculus. Although Iran's attempts to export its revolution quickly
made it anathema in the Middle East, Assad cared little that the
Damascus-Tehran accord provoked his fellow Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the Iranians were at war with Iraq, long Syria's
competitor for supremacy in the larger Arab world. For another,
Iran was willing to arm and train the increasingly radical Shiite
militias in southern Lebanon who engaged Israel's occupying army in
guerrilla warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Syria could use the guerrillas to pressure Israel while at the
same time denying responsibility. Instead Assad could blame the
violence, or acts like the kidnapping of Western hostages, on the
anarchy of Lebanon that Syria's 30,000-strong troops were
ostensibly trying to suppress.
</P>
<P>
   Syria was also linked to brutal attacks carried out by notorious
terrorist groups like the Abu Nidal organization, whose targets
included Israelis and Jews, Syrian dissidents, Jordanian diplomats
and pro-Arafat Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's ability to distance himself from the worst violence
collapsed in 1986, when a man attempting to blow up an El Al
airliner leaving London was given refuge in the Syrian Embassy
before turning himself in. Britain broke relations and other
Western nations temporarily withdrew their ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which had been identified by Washington as a sponsor of
terrorism since 1979, became firmly entrenched on that roster.
Though Assad's government was not linked to directly supporting
terrorism after about 1986, it continued to give safe haven to the
political leadership of the most radical Palestinian organizations.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the Soviet Union after 1989, Assad realized
that he could no longer harvest military or economic aid in the
Kremlin, and he began looking for the means to forge closer ties
with the West.
</P>
<P>
   For that, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 proved a godsend,
with Syria joining the Gulf War coalition pieced together by the
United States. Only a few thousand Syrian troops were deployed, but
the presence of soldiers from such a staunch Arab nationalist
country carried heavy symbolic weight.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The momentum from the war coalition carried into another
American effort to build an Arab-Israeli peace treaty, and Syria
for the first time set aside its refusal to sit face to face with
the Israeli negotiators. Assad personally conducted the talks about
Syrian participation.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty in negotiating with Syria was underscored under
the Clinton administration, when Secretary of State Warren
Christopher began shuttling around the Middle East trying to build
on the agreement that the Israelis and Palestinians worked out
themselves in Oslo. Assad was appalled that Arafat had become yet
another Arab leader making a separate peace with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   However with broad if nebulous assurances from the Israeli
government of Yitzhak Rabin that a full withdrawal from the Golan
Heights could be negotiated, Assad too indicated that Syria was
willing to talk peace. Christopher made more than 20 trips to
Damascus, and President Clinton met with the Syrian leader twice in
1994, once in Geneva and once in Damascus, becoming the first
American president to visit since Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to revive the peace effort with Syria late last year
collapsed this spring after Clinton had another failed meeting with
Assad in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the absence of clashes on the Golan Heights after the
1974 disengagement accord, the peace talks between Syria and Israel
ultimately foundered on their mutual suspicions. The Israelis had
no plans to withdraw to the 1967 lines, which would put Syria in
control of a chunk of the shoreline of Lake Tiberias, their main
water source.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Assad apparently felt he could not make peace
without regaining every inch of lost territory and he resisted
Israeli attempts to tie peace to a complete normalization of
relations with free trade and open borders. Assad feared that
Israel, having fought the Arabs to a stalemate, wanted to dominate
them economically.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Syria in the 1990s, Assad was consolidating his position
and preparing for his eldest son, Basil, an army officer and an
equestrian champion, to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   In a December 1991 plebiscite on a fourth, seven-year term as
president, Assad got 99.9 percent of the vote. As one Syrian writer
noted wryly to a foreign reporter, ``Even if Allah had run, he
wouldn't have done as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assad's dynastic plans were threatened when Basil died in an
automobile accident in 1994. Then, Assad picked his next son in
line, Bashar, who had been training in London to be an eye surgeon,
as his heir apparent. Bashar was made a lieutenant colonel, given a
top military post and referred to publicly as ``the hope'' of
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize his own line for succession, Assad in February 1998
stripped his brother Rifaat of the largely ceremonial title of vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1983, when Assad was hospitalized with a heart attack,
Rifaat had tried to use his control of the military to assume
power. As the president recuperated, Rifaat proved reluctant to
back down and brought the country to the brink of civil war. Assad
checked his brother, who spent the years from 1984 to 1992 in
exile.
</P>
<P>
   Assad is survived by four of his five children.
</P>
<P>
   Although he set up the dynastic guidelines so his son would
succeed him, it is unclear whether the second generation has the
clout needed to control the competing security and intelligence
agencies. Assad was the lone Syrian who had sufficient influence to
make peace with Israel and to make it stick, but he never found the
formula for getting the Golan back.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State James Baker in his 1995 memoir ``The Politics
of Diplomacy'' quoted Assad as saying: ``The land is important. It
connotes dignity and honor. A man is not chosen to go to paradise
unless he can do so in a dignified way.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE LATEST REINVENTION OF AL GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (also see related article, CAMPAIGNS-COMPARE-REVIEW)  
 By STEVEN R. WEISMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the risk of self-parody, Al Gore is trying once again this
month to break out of a slump by reintroducing himself to voters.
He isn't changing his clothes this time, but he is avoiding
personal attacks and unveiling big policy ideas connected in some
way to life stories.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore still seems unable to exploit his obvious advantages as
a partner in an administration with policies that most Americans
support.
</P>
<P>
   Why, the candidate must wonder, can Gov. George W. Bush
reposition himself as a moderate with such ease while his own
reinventions draw ridicule?
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be that there have been so many of them. But the
dominant theory is that Gore simply does not connect with people.
He is seen as too stiff, too eager to please, too caught up in
policy gobbledygook to excite voters.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides prefer, for obvious reasons, another explanation.
They believe that most of Gore's problems stem from the inherent
difficulties of being vice president. If so, they say, Gore may not
be able to make serious headway in reversing his fortunes until the
Democratic convention, when he assumes command of the party,
selects a vice presidential nominee and delivers an acceptance
speech.
</P>
<P>
   It is a self-serving theory, but history provides some basis for
it. In studying past election cycles, the Gore campaign has found
that at this time of year, sitting vice presidents like George Bush
in 1988, Hubert Humphrey in 1968 and Richard Nixon in 1960 were all
behind in the polls. So were presidents who had acceded as vice
presidents to the White House, like Harry Truman in 1948 and Gerald
Ford in 1976. The problem is that, of all these, only Truman and
Bush went on to win in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign likes to think of the Bush campaign in 1988 as
a model. Gore aims to raise doubts about the qualifications of his
less experienced opponent the way the elder Bush did about Gov.
Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts. But the more apt comparison may
actually be 1960. Indeed, the author Richard Reeves, who is writing
a book about Nixon, likens Gore's situation now to the one that
Nixon found himself in against John Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   In that year, Reeves points out, Nixon was the experienced
Washington hand with a great reputation as a debater and infighter,
running against an opponent widely dismissed as a charming
lightweight. There were also a lot of ``new Nixons'' foreshadowing
the ``new Gores'' of today. Many political experts back then said
that all Kennedy had to do was deliver a credible performance at
the debates, and he would be deemed a winner. Some even contend to
this day that Nixon won the debates on points, while Kennedy won on
style, changing politics forever, possibly to Gore's disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's narrow loss to Kennedy has been attributed to many
things, including possible skulduggery in the voting in Chicago.
But one factor may have also been Nixon's proud refusal to have
President Dwight Eisenhower campaign for him except in the final
rounds, when Nixon surged in the polls and almost caught up with
Kennedy. Ike had a low opinion of Nixon, according to various
memoirs, but still wanted him to win. He was said to have been
puzzled and irritated by the Nixon campaign's attitude. ``All we
want out of Ike,'' a Nixon adviser told Theodore H. White during
the campaign, ``is for him to handle Khrushchev at the U.N. and not
let things blow up there. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's problem is that he may need President Clinton to help
him, at least in the states where Clinton is most popular, without
turning off voters in other states and making the vice president
feel diminished just as he is trying to stand on his own.
</P>
<P>
   From Eisenhower to Lyndon Johnson to Ronald Reagan, there is a
rich history of presidents having deeply mixed feelings about
seeing their chosen vice presidents succeed them. Clinton
apparently has no such ambivalence, although by some accounts he
has been critical of Gore's stump style and his campaign team.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the theory of the burden of the vice presidency
is valid, Gore's reinventions show that he has yet to communicate _
and perhaps settle on _ a riveting narrative for himself. It must
be said that Bush, while he is campaigning more smoothly right now,
has not exactly pulled the sword from the stone yet either. We are
still waiting for the moment when a successful candidate fashions a
reason for running and grows as a result of a series of ordeals.
</P>
<P>
   From Ronald Reagan's ``Shining City on the Hill'' to Bill
Clinton's ``Man From Hope,'' truly successful politicians have a
knack for sculpting a sense of destiny for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Heroic or not, Gore has done well in those moments when he
appeared to be facing long odds. His campaign in the primary had
its excesses, but he came across as a tough combatant and drew
strength from that image. The challenge facing Gore now may
paradoxically help him reach that image again.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, he faces not only a contest against Bush, but
also, after a lifetime in public life, a battle to define himself
in the eyes of the nation he wants to lead.

THE ONES WHO GOT AWAY FROM THE METS AND YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Carl Everett is not playing at Yankee Stadium this
weekend. Neither is J.T. Snow, Eric Milton, Tony Armas Jr., Preston
Wilson, Quilvio Veras, Fernando Vina or Jeromy Burnitz. Al Leiter
is, but only after taking a circuitous route to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Leiter, those players and many others are playing not
for the Yankees or the Mets this weekend but for other teams in
other interleague series. They began their professional baseball
lives in the Yankees' or Mets' minor league system, but they have
been moved elsewhere, many before getting a chance to play for the
Yankees or the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this team of players the Yankees raised but did not
keep: first basemen Fred McGriff (Devil Rays) and Snow (Giants);
second basemen Andy Fox (Marlins) and Kevin Jordan (Phillies);
shortstop Cristian Guzman (Twins); third basemen Mike Lowell
(Marlins) and Russ Davis (Giants); outfielders Everett (Red Sox),
Gerald Williams (Devil Rays) and Ruben Rivera (Padres); catchers
Brad Ausmus (Tigers) and Brian Johnson (Royals); and pitchers
Leiter, Milton (Twins), Armas (Expos), Sterling Hitchcock (Padres)
and Hideki Irabu (Expos).
</P>
<P>
   Among players the Mets have spawned and disgorged are a pair of
starting second basemen, Vina (Cardinals) and Veras (Braves); two
closers, Rick Aguilera (Cubs) and Jason Isringhausen (Athletics); a
pretty good outfield of Jeromy Burnitz (Brewers), Preston Wilson
(Marlins) and Terrence Long (Athletics); and a first baseman, Brian
Daubach, who will be at Yankee Stadium Monday with Everett when the
Red Sox arrive for a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's story is well known, especially the part about his
dislike for the Yankees, who drafted him in the first round of the
1990 draft and then left him exposed for Florida to take in the
1992 expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the organization who was there said the word to
leave Everett unprotected came from Joseph Molloy, then the
Yankees' managing partner and George Steinbrenner's son-in-law.
Molloy is no longer either, and Everett may be the American League
most valuable player this season.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach left the Mets' organization as a minor league free agent
in 1996 and signed with the Marlins, for whom he played in 1998
before they released him. The Marlins did not keep Everett long
either. He played 16 games for them in 1994 before they traded him
to the Mets for Veras, who had spent five years with Mets minor
league teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets signed Veras as an amateur free agent six months before
they drafted Vina in June 1990. They traded Vina to Milwaukee in
1994, a month after they traded Veras to the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets made trades 10 years apart that created closers for
other teams. In 1989, they included Aguilera in a package they sent
to Minnesota for Frank Viola, and last year they traded
Isringhausen to Oakland for Billy Taylor. Aguilera has earned 292
saves with the Twins and the Chicago Cubs; Isringhausen is off to
an effective start with the Athletics with 14 saves.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets made another trade with Oakland last year, acquiring
Kenny Rogers, and one of the players in the deal, Long, has become
the A's center fielder. But the Mets have traded no young player
who has developed and produced more than Burnitz, who hit 98 home
runs in three seasons for the Brewers after they acquired him from
Cleveland, which got him from the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has been productive with the Marlins, who obtained him
from the Mets in the Mike Piazza deal. Piazza's presence prompted
the Mets to trade Todd Hundley, a home-grown catcher, to Los
Angeles, where he has been joined by the former Mets shortstop
Kevin Elster.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees lost two catchers in drafts _ Brad Ausmus to
Colorado in the 1992 expansion draft and Brian Johnson to San Diego
in the 1991 minor league draft. Both have since moved to other
teams. Alberto Castillo was a catcher in the Mets' system for 12
years before he left as a free agent in 1998. He is now with
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Not all players become starters after leaving the Mets or
Yankees. The Yankees had three players who have become steady
part-time players _ Jordan with the Phillies, Lyle Mouton with the
Brewers and Turner Ward now with Arizona. The Mets had, among
others, Aaron Ledesma (Rockies), Butch Huskey (Twins) and Gregg
Jefferies (Tigers).
</P>
<P>
   Of more recent vintage, the Yankees traded four players to
Minnesota for Chuck Knoblauch, and three of them start for the
Twins: Milton, their No. 2 starting pitcher; Guzman, their
shortstop; and Brian Buchanan, who was recently promoted from the
minors to play right field.
</P>
<P>
   Armas, whom the Yankees traded to the Red Sox so they could have
Mike Stanley for the last six weeks of the 1997 season, recently
joined Montreal's starting rotation. After nine years in the
minors, all with the Yankees, Bubba Carpenter became a major league
rookie with Colorado last month and has hit three home runs in 27
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   According to an annual study done by Tracy Ringolsby of The
Rocky Mountain News in Denver, the Yankees and the Mets last year
were among the top five teams in the number of players from their
systems playing in the majors for other teams: Montreal 40, Los
Angeles 39, Mets 38, and Yankees and Toronto 36 each.

   WASHINGTON _ George Shultz said it. James Baker said it. So did
Warren Christopher and Madeleine Albright. When it comes to making
peace in the Middle East, four successive secretaries of state all
sounded the same theme: Americans cannot want peace more than the
parties themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the United States must be both available and
aloof, appearing as a willing partner but not an over-eager suitor.
In fact, in late 1993, less than a year into the Clinton
administration, Christopher set modest goals, saying that making
peace was going to take ``a lot of time and patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and patience are the two things President Clinton no longer
has. And now, with only seven and a half months left as president,
he even may want peace more than the parties themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident in Clinton's announcement, after meeting with
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel in Lisbon 10 days ago, that
peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians was ``within view
now.'' He said the two sides would restart negotiations in
Washington this week and his administration dangled the possibility
of a three-way Camp David-style summit in which Clinton himself
would take part. The sense of urgency Clinton expressed was
reminiscent of the pleading that the late King Hussein of Jordan
was famous for, using every new political wrinkle and change on the
ground to say that that was the last chance for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and Middle East experts talk now of the
need to seize the moment created by a new reality: Israel's
withdrawal from Lebanon two weeks ago, which Clinton said imposes a
much greater sense of urgency on the parties to resolve the very
substantial differences that remain between them: the size and
shape of a Palestinian state, the future of Jerusalem and the fate
of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only certain moments in history when all the parties
are available, when they see that a negotiated deal is in their
interests and they don't believe they have better options,'' said
Thomas R. Smerling, Washington director of the Israel Policy Forum,
a research institute that focuses on the peace process. ``This is
one of those times.''
</P>
<P>
   But moments and deadlines come and go, and complicating matters
now is the death Saturday of Syria's president, Hafez Assad. Still,
urgency is one of the most easily manipulated commodities in the
Middle East. It has been used to derail progress toward peace.
Witness all the years wasted because of Palestinian terrorist
attacks and Israeli retaliation, troop movements and street
violence. In that atmosphere, concessions became impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But urgency can, if invoked with skill, be used to push the
region toward peace as well. The argument is that every opportunity
is fleeting in the Middle East, where attitudes can shift with
remarkable speed, so that when a moment is ripe for conciliation,
it must be seized.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having run out of time for the more familiar formula of
patience, Clinton is left with the appeal of urgency, in effect
trying to turn his biggest liability _ his lame-duck status _ into
an asset.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the moment is urgent for him. And certainly urgency
is felt by Barak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the newspaper Haaretz last month, Barak
spoke of ``a golden opportunity'' for Israel to make peace, not
only with the Palestinians, but also with the Syrians and the
Lebanese. ``Do we await the future passively with our eyes shut,''
he asked, ``or do we take an active stance vis-a-vis the reality
and try to modify it to our advantage?''
</P>
<P>
   As for Arafat, he has no good alternative. Unilaterally
declaring an independent Palestinian state, as he has threatened to
do, would deprive him of the aid and good will he has received from
the rest of the world since he set out to make peace in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Both men know that if they don't get a deal this year it may be
a long time before a similar opportunity comes. Clinton offers a
carefully built reputation as an honest broker that neither of the
presumptive presidential nominees, Vice President Al Gore and Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, enjoy. Over the years, Gore has taken an
uncritical pro-Israeli stance; Bush is a blank slate when it comes
to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rushed nature of the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon
has stirred up Israeli and Palestinian politics in ways that may
prove damaging to prospects for a quick deal. Barak is fighting off
a rebellion by conservative coalition allies that could produce new
elections. And the frenzied meetings of long-divided families at
the now-accessible Lebanese border could create a new dynamic for
the extremely sensitive issue of what happens to the many
Palestinian refugees who would remain outside a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton's pleas for urgency notwithstanding, the
lame-duck year of any administration tends to limit its
accomplishments in diplomacy. The last president to be finishing
out a second term was Ronald Reagan; in 1988, Shultz launched a
peace initiative after the Palestinians began the uprising known as
the intifadeh, but the effort went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for any U.S. negotiator, Middle East peacemaking requires
both staying power and an unswerving belief in the impossible.
``There is a good chance to come to an agreement,'' said Henry
Kissinger, who as secretary of state spent seven straight weeks
shuttling between Damascus and Jerusalem after the 1973 war. ``Both
sides have run out of options and both sides are at the limit of
their concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what advice he would give Clinton, Kissinger said, ``I
would tell him to stay calm and be available as a facilitator. And
I would tell him not to be more interested than the parties
themselves.''

   WASHINGTON _ George Shultz said it. James Baker said it. So did
Warren Christopher and Madeleine Albright. When it comes to making
peace in the Middle East, four successive secretaries of state all
sounded the same theme: Americans cannot want peace more than the
parties themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the United States must be both available and
aloof, appearing as a willing partner but not an over-eager suitor.
In fact, in late 1993, less than a year into the Clinton
administration, Christopher set modest goals, saying that making
peace was going to take ``a lot of time and patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and patience are the two things President Clinton no longer

 &HT;    Georgia faces severe drought conditions
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOMASTON, Ga. _ For the umpteenth time, Beth Brown heard the
awful rasping sound. The bottom of her fiberglass kayak, which
needs only a few inches of water to float, was grounded once again
on a rock in the Flint River.
</P>
<P>
   And once more, she had to get out of her boat and laboriously
pull it until she could find enough water to refloat it. ``I'm
looking for any sign of a few inches of water running in chutes
between the rocks so that I can get downriver,'' said Brown, an
information specialist with the Department of Natural Resources who
set out on the river with two other DNR workers last week. ``I'm
not finding a lot of those places.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, there would be several feet of water rushing over and
around the rocks, far more than enough to float kayaks and canoes.
But when Brown and her colleagues ventured down a 3-mile stretch of
the Flint near Thomaston, they found water levels only a few inches
deep in many spots.
</P>
<P>
   In what is shaping up to be one of Georgia's worst droughts on
record, streams and rivers all over the state are in similar
straits. Environmental and health experts say the impact on
wildlife, agriculture, businesses and public health could be dire.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every day that it doesn't rain, new record low flows are
being set in stretches of the Flint, Altamaha, Little, Ocmulgee,
Oconee, Ohoopee, St. Marys and Chattahoochee rivers and their
tributaries.
</P>
<P>
   Some streams have no flow at all. ``Several streams in South
Georgia, which normally have a trickle of water even during a
drought, are now completely dry,'' said Mike Gennings, fisheries
chief for the DNR.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has been in a drought for more than two years, leaving
some areas with rainfall deficits of more than 40 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The record low stream flows are bringing into sharp focus major
concerns that have long worried biologists, environmental
authorities and policy-makers _ but do not get much attention when
rainfall is adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists, for instance, worry that the drought could be the
final blow for some endangered species _ including several types of
freshwater mussels, salamanders and fish. These species already
have been drifting toward extinction because of pollution, dams
that impede water flow and massive water withdrawals from streams
for drinking and industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fish and wildlife populations have faced stress from
droughts for thousands of years and have survived,'' Gennings said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem now, he said, is the combination of severe drought
on top of other stresses caused by humans. ``We are going to have
to give very serious thought to the amount of water we're taking
out of these rivers,'' Gennings said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Flint, for instance, authorities say the drought has
caused striped bass to disappear from the upper part of the river,
and now the fish is struggling for survival in the lower portion
because of extreme low water.
</P>
<P>
   To survive Georgia's hot summers, the bass, which can weight up
to 60 pounds and measure more than 3 feet long, congregate around
cool springs known as ``blue holes.'' Fed by aquifers, most of the
springs flow into the Flint River bottom. However, the flow in one
spring has already dropped to a trickle and officials are concerned
that others will dry up as farmers in southwest Georgia pump more
water from the aquifers this summer to keep their crops alive.
</P>
<P>
   Other species also are suffering. Gennings pointed out that
anglers this year are catching only about half the fish they caught
last year in the Altamaha River in South Georgia because of drought
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   A particular concern of environmental authorities is the
scalding water discharged from Georgia Power Co.'s coal-buring
power plants. The plants draw cooling water from the Chattahoochee
and other rivers and discharge hot water back into the streams.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power is facing a $55,000 state fine for a massive fish
kill in a 22-mile stretch of the Chattahoochee last August because
of hot water discharged from the company's Plant Yates near Newnan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fish kill was due mostly to low flows in the river,'' said
Georgia Power spokesman Tal Wright. He said there was not enough
water in the river at the time to assimilate the heated water and
prevent the fish from being killed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with flows running as low or lower than last year, the
worry is that there may be more major fish kills. But Georgia Power
officials say they must dump the hot water into the river for the
plant to operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation that has got us very nervous,'' says Sally
Bethea, director of the Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, who boated
down the the river this past week to look at the low flow
conditions downstream from Plant Yates.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said Georgia Power also is concerned that water levels
could fall so low that the plants' water intake pipes will not be
able to draw in adequate amounts of cooling water. That could
seriously hamper the operations of the plants, which will be
running full tilt this summer to keep air conditioners humming in
the face of what's expected to be higher-than-normal temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental authorities and public health officials have
another big worry: plummeting flows in rivers and streams mean
there may not be enough water to adequately dilute wastes
discharged into the waterways. That could make water pollution a
much greater problem this summer, say officials with the
Environmental Protection Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking that dischargers (including sewage treatment
plants) be vigilant and do the best job they possibly can treating
wastes before discharging them into the streams,'' EPD director
Harold Reheis said last week during a specially called drought
managment meeting in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Newell of the state's Southwest Public Health District
in Albany warned that higher levels of pollution could be a public
health threat. ``The drought is just as big a threat to us as a
tornado or hurricane,'' he said.

 &HT;    Mime gives voice to language of the heart
 &HT;    by Lori Cumpston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Silent Sam has special meaning for
Deniese Kohles.
</P>
<P>
   The mime character is modeled after a homeless man who once
saved her life.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Kohles was driving from her Orchard Mesa home to visit her
sister who lived on the Redlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the Redlands cutoff on River Road,'' explains Kohles.
``There was a homeless man standing on the railroad tracks waving
his arms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I locked my doors because I was afraid of him. When I stopped
to lock my doors, a car came flying over the tracks on two wheels
almost rolling over and going underneath the viaduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The homeless man saved Kohles' life.
</P>
<P>
   When she turned around to thank him, he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Overcome by emotion, she sat in her car and cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried really hard to find this man and I couldn't,'' says
Kohles. ``I thought about respect and how a silent clown could
teach someone in a very quiet and emotional way to respect all
walks of life.''
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Silent Sam was born.
</P>
<P>
   CLOWNING RUNS IN THE FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   Kohles is a descendent of Emmett Kelly, the circus clown famous
for his portrayal of the lovable hobo Weary Willie born out of a
cartoon character he once drew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emmett Kelly was my dad's cousin,'' says the 40-something
mother of three.
</P>
<P>
   After the near-death experience, Kohles established Mesa County
Mimes, a group of individuals interested in the performance art of
mime.
</P>
<P>
   Mime is the expression of feelings through gestures rather than
words.
</P>
<P>
   She began incorporating the Silent Sam character into skits
written by kids in her mime class.
</P>
<P>
   One such skit showed Silent Sam taking the last bed in a rescue
mission as another family is turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hoarding cookies from his meals and putting them in his
pocket,'' says Kohles. ``He tapped on the window and told the
family to come in and he snuck them into his bed and gave them what
was in his pocket and walked back out and laid on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The child in the bed knocked on the window and said, `Thank
you,' and the mom told him to lay down and Silent Sam went back to
where he was and fell asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Kohles wrote to the Emmett Kelly Foundation asking for
permission to copyright the Silent Sam character.
</P>
<P>
   She was granted permission and now holds copyrights on what she
calls ``silent clowning'' and ``classical mime,'' body language
choreographed to music, which is different than traditional mime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody else in the United States has it,'' says Kohles. ``I
had to take an oath and swear to it ... if I get caught with my
face paint on and I am talking, there is a $500 fine.''
</P>
<P>
   MIME HAS 2,000-YEAR HISTORY
</P>
<P>
   Mime originated in China more than 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The geisha used to be male ... that is who the first mimes
were. They entertained by telling stories,'' says Kohles.
</P>
<P>
   The gender and role of the geisha have changed. Geishas are
Japanese women trained in the arts and conversation to serve as
hired companions to men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their faces are painted white to draw attention to purity,''
adds Kohles.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, mime was as much a part of vaudeville as
juggling, clowning, magic, music and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Chaplin got his start on the vaudeville stage, later
going on to star in his own silent pictures.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more famous mimes of all time is Marcel Marceau, who
was inspired by Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harry Langdon and the
popular pair Laurel and Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, Marceau created ``Bip'' the clown, who in his striped
pullover and battered, deflowered opera hat, became his alter ego.
Marceau's routines include classic works like the cage, walking
against the wind and the mask maker.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the simple colors of black and white is so the
mime can become anything, Kohles said.
</P>
<P>
   France deviated from the traditional black garb, adding striped
shirts and red suspenders to be different.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has long poked fun at the stark-faced clowns.
</P>
<P>
   Take the 1995 movie, ``Die Hard: With a Vengeance,'' starring
Bruce Willis, Jeremy Irons and Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The following dialogue was exchanged:
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you trying to hit these people?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No ... well, maybe that mime.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, mimes scare people.
</P>
<P>
   ``People put the face of the unknown with fear,'' says Kohles.
``Something has scared them, whether it be Halloween or whatever,
and they've put all that reality in the face of the mime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people who will walk all the way around to avoid you
because of the stereotyping of mimes. When the opera was in town,
my job was to remove people from the table. I sat on the lap of one
guy during rehearsal without my face paint on and he was eating it
up. I came in during my dress rehearsal and did the exact same
thing and he freaked. He was absolutely frozen because he was
afraid of mimes.''
</P>
<P>
   KOHLES TEACHES WITH EMOTION
</P>
<P>
   Kohles is working to change the stigma associated with mimes.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, she started Artistic Combinations which offers
classes in mime.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to learning mime is in your heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not hard at all, but you have to really want to try it,''
says Kohles. ``We spend hours looking in the mirror trying to get
the facial expressions right. I will even tie their shoelaces
together if they are partners so they are in rhythm with the same
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Six-year old Kaleigh Nitz admits she took the mime class because
she likes art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the teachers, too,'' she says, ``and the movements.''
</P>
<P>
   For David Skaff, the hardest part about mime is not talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes its pretty hard,'' admits the 12-year old who
aspires to be a forest ranger or an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Arch and Edie Chaney attended the class with their 7-year old
granddaughter, Nikyia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for her,'' says Edie. ``It's going to be something
later on that she will remember.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned an appreciation of quietness,'' adds Arch.
</P>
<P>
   Students from Kohles mime class, including Arch and Edie,
presented a final performance last month. Dressed in black outfits
with white greasepaint on their faces and white gloves, they mimed
to songs including ``God Bless The U.S.A.,'' ``Son of Man,''
``Let's Talk About Love'' and ``Everything I Do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we see tears in your eyes, that means we've done our job,''
Kohles told the audience before the performance. ``If we see you
laugh, that means we've done our job. I think you will learn
something from these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohles, a former art teacher for School District 51, believes
that if you teach with emotion, the kids will learn with emotion
and carry it with them.
</P>
<P>
   She focuses equal attention on art history as well as mime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make them study Red Skelton because when he first started
out his self-esteem was really low and that's why he was a cutup,''
says Kohles. ``The stronger he got the more miming he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohles recalls one performance at Two Rivers Convention Center
during Christmas when a man she didn't know came up to her after
the performance and shook her hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not recognize this man,'' says Kohles. ``It was Red
Skelton.''

non-Hodgkins lymphoma 10 years ago but is healthy now.

   NEW YORK _ Imagine that skull with its fierce angles and
sniper's eyes rising from the mists of the great Northwest and
returning to us, again giving courage to those who have lost heart,
again chilling the souls of those who would dare challenge the
Blue. Call him Captain Dad, Mark Messiah, the Frozen Chosen, but as
the grandstand Beast knows, only he can justify its cry, ``We want
cup!''
</P>
<P>
   I am breathless at my own insanity. Who cares about hockey? The
New Jersey Devils can win the Stanley Cup, and the radio nutkins
will still argue whether the New York Knicks are better or worse
with Patrick Ewing. But this isn't about hockey. This isn't about
The Big Man or The Franchise Player or even about The Team Leader
or The Role Model. This is about New York's last legendary hero
since Mickey Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Messier has never been a manufactured commodity; he is too
weird looking, too unexpected, too committed to his game. You
believe him when he says he has avoided long-term emotional
attachments to keep his edge.
</P>
<P>
   There seem to be dark, secret folds in his life. One imagines
him capable of the unspeakable, and then keeping his mouth shut
about it. When he giggles _ and he does _ it is easy to believe he
is receiving a joke from a parallel universe. And he is smart,
direct, a grown-up.
</P>
<P>
   If the New York Rangers do not bring him back for next season,
follow my lead and ignore hockey forever. Send acceptances only to
thelipsite(AT)aol.com.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of watching the Rangers, we will read books not
recommended by Phil Jackson. The first should be Seamus Heaney's
new translation of Beowulf. We know whom it is really about, a
``man whose name was known for courage resolute in his helmet,'' a
man whose world was ``honour-bound and blood-stained,'' who came
from his native land pitying ``the plight you suffer in this
legendary hall.'' You can figure out who were ``the reavers from
hell,'' the opposing hockey players disguised as Grendel and
Grendel's Mother that Messier slew in exchange for a great deal of
money and power.
</P>
<P>
   Like Beowulf, Messier had come across a border from his native
country where he had won battles but never quite achieved the fame
his vanity demanded. But he had honed his steel at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edmonton was the psychological boot camp,'' he told me a year
after the Rangers won the Stanley Cup. ``Endless seminars on how to
find your superconscious, the zone. It sounds like insanity. Except
how do you explain those nights when I'm so focused that I fly,
never feel my legs, no pain, see everything, score three goals?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 18 when I joined the team; we were all young together.
The Islanders were our role models and then we beat them. It was a
wonderful time, but it was a relationship that had run its course.
I needed to leave Edmonton.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, Edmonton has come to New York and beckons to him to
return. Messier is pushing 40, like Beowulf in honored twilight,
waiting for one more monster to slay. Messier's hockey father, Glen
Sather, who led Edmonton to five Stanley Cups in the 1980s (he had
Wayne Gretzky for four of them), was named the Rangers' president
and general manager last week.
</P>
<P>
   The myth expands: The heart of that 1994 Ranger championship
team _ goalie Mike Richter, defenseman Brian Leetch and Adam
Graves, the wing who guarded Messier's back in Edmonton as well as
New York _ is still in place, pining for leadership.
</P>
<P>
   And there is more. After the cup year, when the mad coach who
had driven them, Mike Keenan, left ugly, Messier took over the team
from a weak coach. Messier took a dislike to Petr Nedved, a
brilliant young Czech center, one of the many European finesse
players then coming into the league. They were disdained by the
Canadian hard cases as soft ``snow blowers'' who would pull up in a
spray of ice rather than risk collision. Messier ran him off the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved is now back, the premier center. Can you imagine these
two finding common ice, bonding?
</P>
<P>
   If this doesn't rouse your blood, it may be our fault after all.
We have confused stars and heroes, pumped up that brown Barney,
Shaquille O'Neal, and proclaimed him the future face of sport.
</P>
<P>
   We have railed at John Rocker for expressing opinions we
tolerate from the drive-time schlock jocks who invite journalists
on their air. It seemed fitting that Rocker was ``sent down'' (to
the minors or the reavers from hell) after he verbally threatened
the reporter who had originally given him his megaphone. If only
Messier also had the time to start a men's therapy group and
include Rocker and Bob Knight, clueless or hanging tough, but still
working.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, Captain Dad's Vancouver contract expires. We need our
centered center with his rage to win. Who else could say,
unselfconsciously: ``When you put on the sweater, everything should
become crystal clear. You know what you have to do for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   And, like Beowulf, he will kill that last dragon and then expire
from his wounds. Captain Dad will also get a hero's send-off
because, as Heaney writes of Beowulf, ``He was the man most
gracious and fair-minded, kindest to his people and keenest to win
fame.''

TEST FOR PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS MAY BE READY FOR OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Summer Olympics are still three months away, but in
Australia and France a race with potentially huge implications for
the Olympics is already well under way.
</P>
<P>
   It is the race to find an effective and practical method of
detecting synthetic erythropoietin, the hormone known as EPO.
Unauthorized use of the hormone, which boosts a user's red blood
cell count and hence the capacity to carry oxygen, has tainted
results and reputations in cycling and other endurance sports
throughout the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Even though research teams in other countries are also
attempting to develop a foolproof, lawsuit-proof test, the efforts
based in France at the Laboratoire de Chatenay-Malabry and at the
Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra may be by far the most
advanced.
</P>
<P>
   The French have developed a urine test, which the International
Cycling Union hopes to use during the Tour de France, which begins
on July 1. The test that has been developed at the Australian
institute with the Sydney Games in mind is a blood test.
</P>
<P>
   Both methods have been published in scientific publications this
month, an important step in the validation process and a first for
prospective EPO tests. The French test's methodology has been
published in the British magazine Nature, the Australians' in the
scientific review journal Haematologica.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the sense that some of the previous criticism has been that
there has been no publication of an EPO study, this should help
answer that,'' said Dr. Peter Davis, the EPO research project
manager at the Australian Institute of Sport.
</P>
<P>
   The Canberra-based project has adequate funding, a method it
claims has worked on a small scale, and the motivation provided by
a once-in-an-Australian-scientist's-lifetime deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Australians have been among the most vocal proponents of
improved detection and stricter penalties for performance-enhancing
drug use. Developing a method to identify synthetic EPO would be
both a blow against cheating and a coup for the country. But any
test for EPO would have to be approved by the International Olympic
Committee well before the Games begin on Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say the chances of having a test in place are now 50-50,''
Dr. Jacques Rogge, vice chairman of the IOC medical commission,
said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC usually requires six months to validate a drug test, but
Prince Alexandre de Merode, the medical commission chairman, said
that the IOC is prepared to work on a much tighter deadline in this
instance. Though neither the Australians nor the French expect to
have the test ready to formally present to the medical commission
until late July or early August, officials are scrambling to make
the procedural hurdles easier to clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on track and under the impression the test is coming,''
Davis said. ``But I also understand that it's not a simple matter
of saying: `Here's the test. Now do it.' There are a lot of other
issues that go around taking blood: legal challenges and all the
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogge says that despite concerns about legal action or cultural
sensibilities, Olympic athletes will be required to submit to blood
tests if this test is ready. But Davis said that giving the
athletes of the world the impression that an EPO test is imminent
could be almost as effective a deterrent as actually completing the
test. ``Just the threat of a test might be enough to discourage
it,'' Davis said. ``But we are committed to providing a real test
for Sydney. But it will be up to the IOC how they implement it. And
that's tricky, probably a lot trickier than coming up with the
test. The test is easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The stumbling block with testing for EPO has been that it is a
hormone that occurs naturally in the body. Distinguishing the
injected hormone from what is already present has proved
problematic, but Davis said that a study by the Australian
institute last year, which involved about 30 subjects, produced a
model for solving the riddle.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of that effort, the IOC has contributed $1 million
and the Australian government about $1.5 million to finance the
second phase of testing, which began on March 20 and involves about
100 recreational athletes in Canberra and Sydney. According to
Davis, most of the subjects, all volunteers who are in no position
to contend for the Australian Olympic team, have been administered
either EPO or a placebo for a period of eight weeks. Davis said the
preliminary results of the study had reinforced their confidence in
the test.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the institute's research team, which is
working in conjunction with the Australian Sports Drug Testing
Laboratory in Sydney, is continuing to analyze and profile blood
samples collected from about 1,200 athletes from 10 countries and
disparate ethnic groups to make sure that all variations in blood
type have been taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   According to Patrick Schamasch, the French orthopedic surgeon
who is the director of the IOC's medical commission office, three
other independent research teams _ in Los Angeles, Barcelona, Spain
and Oslo, Norway _ have received smaller amounts of IOC funding to
develop an EPO test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The others are good projects, too, so I'm happy for this
healthy competition,'' Schamasch said. ``But the one thing we have
to be careful about is a false announcement. We are not
pessimistic, but we don't want to implement a test just to
implement one and satisfy media and public expectations.''

</P>
<P>
   EPO use became widespread in cycling in the early 1990s, but the
extent did not become clear to the general public until the 1998
Tour de France, when the French border police found a large supply
of banned performance-enhancing drugs, including more than 200
doses of EPO, in an official Tour de France car driven by a Belgian
employee of one of the leading teams. The Frenchman Jerome Chiotti,
the world mountain bike champion in 1996, recently admitted using
it when he won his title.
</P>
<P>
   Though synthetic EPO, which was initially developed to help
kidney transplant patients, remains undetectable for now, the
International Cycling Union and International Ski Federation have
attempted to combat its use by implementing limits on hematocrit,
or red blood cell counts. If a tested athlete goes over a
predetermined limit _ 50 percent in the case of cycling _ he is not
allowed to start a race. Even though both Davis and Arne Ljunqvist,
an IOC medical commission member, support the intent of such
procedures, both argue against their validity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The limits are, in my view, arbitrary; I think this is the
wrong approach,'' Ljunqvist said. Davis said: ``At Canberra
Hospital, the upper limit of normal is 54, and the normal range is
47 to 50, and that's why it's ridiculous. You take Mexican athletes
at altitude from a place like Mexico City and they will be at 52
easily, and you can manipulate the level so easily. If it's 52,
take a big dose of saline, and it's 49 tomorrow morning. The thing
about our test is that it's impossible to manipulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Hahn, the head of physiology at the Australian institute,
said its test was based on probabilities and involved ``measuring a
number of different parameters,'' including hematocrit levels and
the characteristics of young red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there is a very low probability that someone could
be abnormal on all those parameters unless they were taking EPO,''
he said, explaining that the initial phase of testing showed that
the chance of a faulty test was one in 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The urine test that has been developed in France can detect only
recent EPO use _ up to three days after the fact, according to
Jacques de Ceaurriz, the director of the Chatenay-Malabry
laboratory. The Australian blood test is designed to detect use
three to four weeks later. There has been cooperation between the
French and Australian researchers, with the Australians sending
urine samples gathered in their study.
</P>
<P>
   The French are on an even tighter timetable than the Australians
because of their goal to have the test ready for the Tour de
France. The International Cycling Union has set a deadline of June
20 for validation, and the heads of the Tour cycling teams have
agreed to cooperate if the test is ready. To increase the chances
of meeting the deadline, the cycling union is relying on a less
exhaustive validation procedure than the IOC requires.
</P>
<P>
   But IOC officials are not prepared to get ahead of the science.
They do not want a repeat of what happened during the 1996 Atlanta
Games, when five athletes tested positive for the banned substance
Bromantan only to be exonerated by the Court of Arbitration for
Sport. Rogge said the court ruled that the new test had not been
through the customary validation process, which includes
publication of the results in a scientific review journal and
independent confirmation by outside experts.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Olympic movement succeeds on EPO, that does not
necessarily mean it is winning the fight to level the playing
fields. Human growth hormone, another popular performance-enhancing
drug, will likely remain undetectable in Sydney. And if Schamasch
and other experts are correct, the IOC will soon need to invest
time and money in genetic research as well as hormone research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next challenge will be genetic,'' Schamasch, of the IOC's
medical commission office, said. ``We were laughing as kids about
the bionic man or the bionic woman, but we're going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world with genetic manipulation, EPO injections would no
longer be required, because cells could be modified to produce more
of it internally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the history of nearly all the illegal
substances in sport, they were first used for legitimate medical
purposes,'' Davis said. ``I think it's only logical to think that
if there is already genetic manipulation of cells for beneficial
purposes to fight disease or eliminate disease, someone will
manipulate cells so they can carry more oxygen or recover from
stress.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, experts are manipulating performance in other ways,
even at the Australian institute. In the room next to the EPO
research laboratory is an ``altitude house.'' It is a
self-contained apartment with a dozen beds where top Australian
athletes can legally _ if not ethically _ spend several days and
nights in artificially thin air in order to increase their
endurance and red blood cell count. Altitude chambers are
widespread around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many things that athletes can do, so many ways
they can cheat,'' Davis said. ``Certainly, if we get a test for
EPO, it would be one less, but I'm also not naive enough to think
this will clean it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there are other things, and while there are 75 people
here at the AIS working their hardest to improve performance under
any legal means possible, there will be other places with 175
people who will come up with whatever works no matter whether it's
legal or not.''  &QL;

BASEBALL NOTEBOOK: SOSA TRADE LIKELY; WHITHER ROCKER?; INTERLEAGUE
LOSERS; ORIOLES SUFFER IN CANADA; A STRANGE BASEBALL LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The likelihood is growing that the Chicago Cubs will trade Sammy
Sosa sometime this season. His feud with the Cubs' manager, Don
Baylor, will not be the reason, but Sosa's public reaction to
comments Baylor made about him has sparked internal discussion
about Sosa's future with the team and the direction the Cubs want
to take.
</P>
<P>
   Andy MacPhail, the Cubs' president, said last week that the team
had no plans to trade the home-run-hitting right fielder, but he
left open the possibility by saying, ``Clearly, it's not something
that has a lot of appeal to me at the present time.'' The nonwaiver
trading deadline, July 31, is not ``the present time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs have begun a process of deciding where they want to go.
Will they be better off in the next five years or so with Sosa
(assuming he agrees to a contract extension) or with the four or
five players they could command from another team?
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who has one guaranteed year left on his contract after
this one, has the right to veto a trade, but if the Cubs decide
they want to make a move, he will very likely not stand in their
way. If they make that decision, the Cubs are expected to tell
interested teams what they would want for Sosa. Those talks could
be the highlight of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker Going Elsewhere
</P>
<P>
   Baseball people who have talked to Atlanta Braves officials do
not expect John Rocker to return to the Braves. The front office
and his teammates, they feel, have had enough.
</P>
<P>
   The question then is which teams would be willing to take on the
volatility and attention that Rocker would bring with him. Assuming
he can straighten out his control problems in his stay at Richmond,
Va., one or more teams should have interest.
</P>
<P>
   Interleague Sweeps
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone likes interleague play, and the first series of
games this season has given some teams reason to dislike it.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox had not been swept in a series in the first
two months of the season. Then they played the Philadelphia
Phillies, the team with the worst record in the National League and
no series sweeps. The Phillies won all three games.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago White Sox have a far better record than the
Phillies; in fact, they had the best record in the American League
when they played the Cincinnati Reds. But the Reds led their
division and had suffered only one sweep before they played the
White Sox and lost all three games.
</P>
<P>
   Other interleague sweeps: Montreal over Baltimore, Cincinnati
over Minnesota, Cleveland over Milwaukee, Oakland over San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles 0 for Canada
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Baltimore Orioles will not be making any vacation
visits to Canada any time soon. In fact, the Orioles should be
excused if they ask out of their next scheduled trip there July
21-23.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more bizarre streaks of recent seasons, the
Orioles have lost 20 consecutive games in Canada, 14 to the Toronto
Blue Jays and six to the Montreal Expos, whom they have never
beaten in Canada. The last time the Orioles won north of the border
was June 12, 1998. They beat the Blue Jays that day, 9-5.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckert's Legacy
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Zuckert, who was the secretary of the Air Force under
President Kennedy, died last Monday. No mention of baseball
appeared in his obituary because he had no connection to the game.
However, his name will live in baseball lore for the association he
did not have with the game.
</P>
<P>
   When major-league baseball owners set out to seek a new
commissioner in 1965 before the retirement of Ford Frick, John
Fetzer of Detroit and John Galbreath of Pittsburgh, co-chairmen of
the search committee, identified a man connected with the military
as a potentially good candidate. The man they were said to have in
mind was Zuckert, but somehow the owners wound up interviewing _
and hiring _ William Eckert, an Air Force general known as Spike.
</P>
<P>
   Three years into his term, Eckert was forced to resign. Not only
did he lack knowledge about the game he was running, but he also
was a public relations disaster.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some question about whether there was really a
Zuckert-Eckert mixup, but a former club owner recalled asking
Fetzer about the matter and said the Tigers owner ducked a direct
answer. He quoted Fetzer as saying, ``Well, that isn't exactly
right.'' But neither he nor Galbreath, the former owner said,
wanted to talk about it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enough anecdotal evidence,'' the former owner said.
``I believe it's true.''

SPORTS COLUMN: MORE MONEY COULD RAISE THE INJURY STAKES IN RACING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RAC-BELMONT, being filed after the Belmont Stakes; Post
time 5:27 p.m. EDT.) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's too bad that racing fans regarded Saturday's Belmont Stakes
as strictly leftovers, and that the general population hardly
cared, and that the friendly gents with the grandstand tickets took
such a bath.
</P>
<P>
   Counting on Japanese patrons and other well-heeled types with a
few yen in their pocket to storm to Belmont for a Fusaichi Pegasus
Triple Crown, real fans and speculators had gobbled up the 34,000
Belmont seats shortly after the Japanese-owned horse won the
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   But investing in tickets is a form of gambling, just like
betting on the horses or owning horses, for that matter, or playing
the stock market. Go, baby, go, indeed. A recuperating Fusaichi
Pegasus was nowhere in sight Saturday as a field of pretenders took
to the Belmont course.
</P>
<P>
   The distinct sense of deprivation at yet another year without a
Triple Crown winner revives the impression that racing is a sport
of the last midcentury, like boxing, while other sports are
creating new audiences. Now the people who run racing are talking
about throwing money at the problem, rarely a good solution.
</P>
<P>
   The racing people want to raise the stakes for the Triple Crown
races, so that owners and trainers of these delicate, overbred
animals will be more tempted to enter them in the three races
within five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, everything has a price. That may be true in the
owners' boxes as well as most other corners of the world, but the
racing people should not be proud of the clamor to raise the ante
for the Kentucky Derby ($1 million) guaranteed to the winner this
year), the Preakness ($650,000) and the Belmont ($600,000 to some
afterthought winning his first Grade I stakes Saturday).
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that racing has not had a Triple Crown winner in
the 15 years since marketing types came up with the gimmick of a
``challenge'' _ now worth a bonus of $5 million. In fact, the
Triple Crown has seen more horses ruined than rewarded, not
necessarily anybody's fault, but a reality, nonetheless. That big
bonus was dangling out there last year when Charismatic, a
strapping red-tinged grandson of Secretariat, barreled out of the
chute for the fifth time in 64 days. Less than a mile and a half
later, 85,818 fans, the largest crowd in Belmont history, were
emitting prayers they did not know they remembered. Charismatic
broke down and was saved only by the gallant acrobatics of Chris
Antley, the jockey, who leaped off and comforted the agonized colt
into standing still and not further damaging his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Modern medical response saved Charismatic's life, but he was the
latest casualty in major stakes races. In 1993, Union City was put
down after the Preakness, won by Prairie Bayou, who himself was
destroyed after breaking down on the backstretch in the Belmont.
The Breeders' Cup, the autumn jamboree, has had national-television
tragedies in Go for Wand in 1990 and Mr. Brooks in 1992. And the
historic track at Belmont is still haunted by the death of Ruffian,
the noble filly, during an ill-advised match race in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Racing manages to get through these tragedies, and most trainers
are respectful of their horses. This year Neil Drysdale nursed
Fusaichi Pegasus to a Derby victory, and was squeamish about
entering him in the Belmont after he did not fire in the Preakness.
A minor leg injury a week ago gave Drysdale the reason to withdraw
Fusaichi Pegasus from the Belmont, and more power to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this is a blessing in disguise,'' Drysdale said. ``The
decision whether or not to run him hadn't been made. Well, he made
the decision himself.''
</P>
<P>
   When Frank Stronach, the owner of Red Bullet, did not enter that
Preakness winner in the Belmont, there were some cynical
suggestions that Stronach was thinking about the money he could
make in other major stakes later in the season. Maybe he was, maybe
he wasn't, but money is not necessarily the best thing for the
horses, and does not automatically guarantee glamour, either.
</P>
<P>
   For example: Tahkodha Hills, entered in Saturday's Belmont, was
eligible for a $1 million bonus for having won the Lone Star Derby
in Texas. That gimmick did not excite anybody at the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the fans knew this was the first time since 1970 that
both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness winners had missed the
Belmont. They knew there have been only 11 Triple Crown winners,
none since 1978, and that there must be a reason for the scarcity.
Nobody has hit .400 in baseball since Ted Williams batted .406 in
1941, and that's kind of a neat mystique _ like Secretariat's romp
in the 1973 Belmont, one of a kind.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the absence of star quality drastically reduced the crowd
from the record of 85,818 last year and the third-largest Belmont
crowd of 80,162 that saw Real Quiet finish second in the 1998
Belmont and the fifth-largest crowd of 70,682 that saw Silver Charm
lose to Touch Gold in '97.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like anybody, we are disappointed with the turn of events that
have cost us the Derby and Preakness winners,'' said Terry Meyocks,
president of the New York Racing Association. ``But the well-being
of the horses comes first.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyocks had that right. The owners will have to wrestle with the
possibility that three races within five weeks are too much. In the
meantime, raising the stakes drastically could be dangerous to the
four-legged stars of this industry.

LAWYERS COMPLAIN AS POLICE ARREST SMOKERS IN THE SUBWAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some police officers enforcing the Giuliani
administration's continuing crackdown on quality-of-life crimes are
focusing their efforts on a new public menace, according to defense
lawyers and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, a dozen people have been arrested and jailed for a
night for smoking cigarettes on Manhattan subway platforms. The
formal charge is disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests come as defense lawyers say that the city's
quality-of-life crackdown, which has long taken aim at turnstile
jumpers and marijuana smokers, is continuing apace and broadening.
While city officials credit that approach with driving down crime,
defense lawyers assail it as expensive and unfair overkill that
frequently involves racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers, they contend, are arresting growing numbers of
people for increasingly petty offenses. Mundane offenses that
resulted in a summons or a warning in the past, defense lawyers
said, now result in a night in jail until people are arraigned.
</P>
<P>
   The one-night jail terms usually become the punishment for the
crime, because most defendants in such cases are sentenced to time
served. If they had been given summonses and appeared in court
later, they probably would have been fined but not sentenced to any
time in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers cited a string of arrests this spring as
examples.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 5, Officer John O'Reilly arrested a 27-year-old man in
Manhattan for selling tamales on the street without a license,
according to court papers. The man was held in jail overnight.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 24, Officer Benjamin Kaufman of the 10th Precinct
arrested a man for aggressively panhandling by tap-dancing in front
of a car, then holding his hand out to the driver. The officer
stated in court papers that he recovered a nickel from the
defendant's hand. That man was also held overnight.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, three men recently apprehended for smoking on
subway platforms expressed astonishment at what had happened to
them. One man, arrested by Officer Richard Nenadich at 1 a.m.
Wednesday at the 137th Street station of the Seventh Avenue line,
said he could not believe he had spent a night in jail for smoking
a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ridiculous,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two brothers, 20 and 17, who work as dishwashers in a
restaurant, were arrested for smoking in the Christopher Street
station on May 9 after working until midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The men, who asked not to be named, and feared they would lose
their jobs after missing a shift at work, said they did not know a
person could be arrested for such an offense in the United States.
``We were just smoking the cigarettes,'' one of the brothers said.
``I was sitting and waiting for the train.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said last week that the quality-of-life
crackdown was continuing, but the department has not begun a new
campaign against smoking in subway stations. Detective Joseph
Pentangelo, a Police Department spokesman, said officers might have
chosen to jail some people instead of issuing them summonses
because they did not have proper identification, or because there
were outstanding warrants for their arrest.
</P>
<P>
   But the man arrested on Wednesday said he had identification
with him and did not have an outstanding warrant. The two
dishwashers, who are Mexican immigrants, had no identification with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Pokart, the lawyer for one of the immigrants, called the
arrests appalling. Alexandra Bonacarti, the lawyer for the man
arrested on Wednesday, who is black, accused officers of arresting
black and Hispanic men they see smoking because they believe such
people are more likely to have outstanding arrest warrants. Such
arrests of wanted criminals look good on officers' records.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to walk up to the average person and harass
them,'' she said. ``They absolutely target minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   David Kapner, the Legal Aid Society's Manhattan arraignment
supervisor, said smoking was the latest pretext the police were
using to stop people and check them for warrants or weapons. ``Last
spring, they were arresting people for taking up too much space on
park benches,'' he said.

N.J. NOTEBOOK: SONG REMAINS THE SAME. WILL NEW JERSEY LISTEN? 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story does not carry a byline) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   O, New Jersey! Not only are you the butt of tedious ``What
exit?'' jokes, but you lack what most other states revel in: a song
of your own. And this is certainly not due to any lack of lyricism
west of the Holland Tunnel. It is due more to, dare we count, six
decades of legislative inaction.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the state militia sang ``Jersey Blue'' in 1794 during
the Whisky Rebellion has there been a consensus about a song for
the Garden State. There was a contest for state song in 1939, but
the Legislature didn't make the winner official. In 1956 the
Department of Education reviewed many options, but found none of
sufficient merit. In 1972 the Legislature cast its votes for the
roisterous ``I'm from New Jersey,'' written in 1960 by Red Mascara
of Phillipsburg. It goes something like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from New Jersey and I'm proud about it, I love the Garden
State.
</P>
<P>
   I'm from New Jersey and I want to shout it, I think it's simply
great.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. William T. Cahill refused to sign the bill, reportedly
saying, ``If there is one thing worse than the song `I'm From New
Jersey,' it is Red Mascara singing `I'm From New Jersey.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to 1996, when a law directed the New Jersey State
Arts Council to come up with a list of favorites. Four years and
215 entries later, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It's all a little daunting for the tireless Mascara, 78, a
retired chemical factory worker who for 40 years has lobbied the
Legislature, schmoozing, passing out gumdrops, all for a song. He
said the sponsor of one of the three current bills in favor of his
song is Christopher Kip Bateman, whose father, Raymond, was Senate
president back in 1972 when Cahill rejected the Legislature's
choice.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a move afoot, Mascara said, to create four state
tunes: the top three choices of the 1996 contest, so the state
would have a state song, a state anthem, a state pop song, and, be
still, beating heart _ a state march. His.

 &HT;    Searing musical marches into the scene of the crimes
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the eve of the Tony Awards a year ago, playwright
Alfred Uhry got a call from Hal Prince, who had directed his daring
musical drama, ``Parade.''
</P>
<P>
   The line was charged with emotion. Even though the Lincoln
Center Theater show was by many measures a success _ nine Tony
nominations, including nods for both men _ its run of a mere two
months left them hungry.
</P>
<P>
   And angry. Punishing critiques by The New York Times (most other
reviews were glowing) and the collapse of co-producer Livent,
leaving scant money for advertising, had hastened the show's
demise. Uhry and Prince were still reeling from the one-two punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably not going to win (a Tony) tomorrow night, and the
show is probably not going to win,'' Prince told Uhry, ``but you
are. So I want you to announce that we're going to open again in
Atlanta a year from now.''
</P>
<P>
   It was exactly what Uhry wanted to hear _ or was it? A year and
a half earlier, he'd tried to persuade Prince and his producers not
to premiere ``Parade'' in his hometown, so explosive was its
real-life Atlanta story. As it turned out, there was no local
theater available in the summer of 1998 and to Uhry's mind that was
just as well. He didn't want the musical's quality overshadowed by
controversy. For ``Parade'' tells of events leading to the 1915
lynching of Leo Frank, a Brooklyn-raised Jew who was convicted of
murdering a 13-year-old Marietta girl. Frank has been all but
exonerated by history as a victim of false testimony and
anti-Semitic hysteria, but doubts linger as to who did kill Mary
Phagan in the pencil factory during the Confederate Memorial Day
Parade. Hence, the musical's title, and Uhry's nervousness about
showing his pro-Frank tale to audiences that may contain
descendants of his story's villains: Tom Watson, publisher of The
JeffersonianJournal, and prosecutor Hugh Dorsey. Uhry doesn't claim
objectivity. His great-uncle was Sigmund Montag, who employed Frank
as foreman of his Atlanta factory and raised money for his defense.
</P>
<P>
   `THIS IS NOT OVER YET'
</P>
<P>
   Yet by the time Uhry stepped up last June to accept his Tony for
best book of a musical, he found himself thrilled to announce that
``Parade'' would march again, in Dixie. And he knew that lots of
people from the Times _ ``who went after us any way they could,''
he says _ would be watching from the audience or on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not over yet,'' Uhry declared from the podium,
choosing the words that Leo and Lucille Frank sing when they're
fighting to clear his name. Sounding not like a sore winner
exactly, but certainly a defiant one, Uhry added, ``Look for us to
be back next year.'' Meaning that after a summer-fall tour
including Dallas, Seattle, Denver and Pittsburgh, Prince and Uhry
hope to mount a second assault on New York to give ``Parade'' a
longer run.
</P>
<P>
   Uhry's announcement was wild news to Christopher B. Manos,
producer of Atlanta's Theater of the Stars. He'd begun negotiations
to bring ``Parade'' to the Fox Theatre but had no idea that his
offer had been accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Manos is putting himself on the line for a very risky musical.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps, a gleaming cap on his own stage legacy.
</P>
<P>
   PERSONAL STAKES
</P>
<P>
   Twenty tickets have been reserved by descendants of Gov. John
Slaton, presented as a courageous leader who commuted Frank's
sentence and ordered a new trial (inflaming vigilantes to pluck
Frank from prison to the lynching). If descendants of Jim Conley _
the black janitor who is widely believed to be Phagan's real
murderer _ attend the show, they'll see a character whose apparent
guilt and far-fetched testimony against Frank is almost outweighed
by his victim status. Treated like a dog, he cleverly manipulates
whites as payback.
</P>
<P>
   If descendants and defenders of Tom Watson (portrayed as a
bigoted demagogue) and prosecutor Dorsey (as a sly political
opportunist) speak up publicly against the production, Uhry is no
longer afraid of the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those people get riled up, it's their problem, not mine,''
says Uhry. ``History says we're 99.999 percent sure that Frank
didn't do it, and I'm not going to convince the rest. But I can
engage anybody in this throbbingly human story. I'm a Jew but I'm
also a Southerner, and I understand in my bones how those proud,
decent people could be swayed by a few evil men.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 29, also has a personal stake in ``Parade.'' His marriage
was disintegrating as he wrote ``All the Wasted Time,'' the
achingly beautiful climactic song in which Lucille and the
imprisoned Leo realize that their struggle to clear his name has
made them truly fall in love _ too late. (The lyrics are based on
the couple's letters.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some of me _ the nice Jewish Yankee boy _ in Leo,''
says Brown, ``and there's some of my grandfather, too. But a part
of me is also in all those people in Marietta who were devastated
by the war, forced to send their sons and daughters to work in
factories.'he fateful parade 50 years later as the chorus sings the
rousing anthem, ``The Old Red Hills of Home.'' Brown took the words
from the Marietta gravestone of Phagan, never realizing that they
were written by the now-infamous Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Prince, too, knows the ``Parade'' ground. Like Uhry, he's
descended from German Jews who were among the earliest settlers of
the South; one ancestor was president of the Texas Cotton Exchange.
Controversy would be music to the director's ears _ and nothing
new.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made a lifetime in the theater of doing subjects both
serious and controversial, and I have no intention of backing away
now,'' says Prince. ``When I did `Evita' I heard about it from all
the Argentines in New York. Half were thrilled and half were mad,
but no one was bored.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a case could be made that ``Parade'' is not such an
unusual choice of subject matter for Prince but may be his most
uncompromising work. His 1966 ``Cabaret'' looked at Nazism but
through the framework of raucous song-and-dance; ``Sweeney Todd's''
wronged hero made his tormentors into meat pies but in the form of
a gothic fable, not a study of cannibalism. ``Parade,'' though it
has its share of pageantry and stirring melody, is focused on
injustice.
</P>
<P>
   `I WILL NOT HIDE'
</P>
<P>
   And on a man and woman. Brought together in a rather chilly,
arranged marriage, Leo and Lucille discover their in love in
extremis. Not surprisingly, the ``Parade'' marketing campaign keeps
stressing, ``A True Story . . . A Love Story'' with little mention
of bigotry or lynchings. But Burns, who is only a few years older
than Lucille (23) was at the time of Leo's trial, thinks that love
is indeed the meaning of ``Parade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The story breaks your heart,'' she says. ``Having Alfred
around rehearsals makes everything so real. Lucille was a friend of
his grandmother's when he was a boy, and he made us laugh when he
said she seemed to him like, `just another little old lady.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Burns was struck by Uhry's memory that to the end of her life,
Lucille signed her checks, ``Mrs. Leo Frank.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was her way of saying, `I will not hide,' '' Burns says. ``
`I will not let the world forget.' ''

NBA'S RATINGS RESEMBLE AN AIR BALL  
 JORDAN'S DIFFICULT TRANSITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Dashes are being used in `M-A-S-H' instead of stars, which

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ David Stern will issue his annual finals address
next week in Indianapolis, going over all that is right and amiss
with his league and insisting that business is not as bad as
perceived.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the commissioner's words reflect the genuine
state of the National Basketball Association, Stern knows he is not
presiding over the megapopular product whose growth once seemed to
have no end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through change, but we're convinced things will
pick up,'' he said last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stern spoke before Game 1 between the Los Angeles Lakers and the
Indiana Pacers drew a television rating of 10.5 _ the lowest rating
in 14 years and down 9 percent from Game 1 of the San Antonio
Spurs-Knicks series last June.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the icons who propelled his league in the 1980s and
1990s candidly spoke their minds about the NBA's quality of play
and its interest level.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird: ``I don't think it's totally back. We played
Milwaukee in a Game 4 there and they didn't sell out. It just seems
like a lot of people aren't talking about the NBA as much as they
used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're doing a good job promoting it. I'd like to see
them get more teams on TV than just the Lakers and New York. I
think it's coming back. But the only way it comes back is if you
have great competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Magic Johnson: ``We have to establish our superstars. Who's
going to be our stars now? Who's going to take this league? It's
out there. Shaq is the most dominant. But we need a guy to be the
man in terms of Michael Jordan. So who is that going to be?''
</P>
<P>
   After the Lakers' riveting Game 7 comeback against Portland last
Sunday, even Jordan was not impressed. ``In all honesty, I don't
think they won it,'' he said. ``I think Portland lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird, Johnson and Jordan are not the only ones concerned about
the health of the game. ``When you watch a player like Reggie
Miller in the clutch, it's at its best,'' said Pat Riley, the Miami
Heat coach and team president who coached the Lakers to their last
championship in 1988. ``And you realize it will never not be an
entity. But the evolution of the player and the mentality of the
player _ caused by a number of extenuating circumstances _ has
changed the game and how it is perceived by the public.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The public likes it, but they're going to like it on
their own terms now _ because they don't get the game on the
favorable terms they used to get it. There was more humility by the
players. The money factor, too, is huge. It really is a business
now, even for fans. When fans buy season tickets now, they sign
contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said he had read an article about several hedge-fund
billionaires from the 1980s who lost hundreds of millions during
the stock market's recent downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were brilliant men,'' he said. ``And one simply said, `I
don't understand this market anymore.' He admitted, as a
professional investment counselor, that he doesn't understand his
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you equate back to the league, I don't think a lot of
our fans really understand it right now. They will support it until
they understand it again. But we've got to make them understand it.
The players have to make them understand it. Otherwise, we're going
to lose them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing a lot of viewers to other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though ratings plummeted during the regular season _ off 21
percent from last season's lockout-shortened year _ Stern is
unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV remains the dominant entertainment vehicle, but people
forget everyone's numbers are off,'' Stern said. ```Monday Night
Football' just experienced its worst-ever ratings. We live in a
changing entertainment environment. The number of people who
watched the final episode of `Seinfeld' was lower than the number
of people who watched the final episode of `Cheers.' And that
number was lower than the final episode of `M-A-S-H.' That's where
we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern blames several factors for the low ratings and the
declining interest in the league. ``First, I think it has to do
with the post-Michael era, something we expected to happen,'' he
said. ``You throw in the lockout and an extraordinary amount of
additional programming, and that's where the problems lie. Those
are not insubstantial numbers we're talking about. Adding games on
Saturdays all resulted in the fact of a cumulative effect on the
ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird thinks there is another factor contributing to the league's
interest problems: Many of today's players, he said, do not
resonate with fans as much as players from his era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the players got to do more in their communities,''
he said. ``And stay out of trouble. And when they play, they got to
play hard. You read about all the negative stuff sometimes and we
don't think about the positive. We got a lot of great players in
our league that play hard every night. It's just that you have to
have a majority do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern discounts the notion that players were more passionate
about their jobs two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's Vince Carter, Allen Iverson, the Latrell
Sprewells or the Ray Allens and Kevin Garnetts, we see an intensity
to our players equal to any intensity in the last 20 years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion was we needed New York, everyone was writing
that,'' he said. ``It was never a concern: The ratings will be
fine. We're going through a transition, but I fully expect things
to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   But a wedge is growing, and it is not relegated to the league
and fans. The kinship between coaches and players and the NBA is
not as strong as it once was. Controversies involving league
directives over access and the use of microphones led to widespread
criticism earlier this year and a threatened lawsuit by the
coaches' association.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're marketing just like high-tech stocks,'' Riley said.
``Market the business. Market the image even though there's no
profits. The NBA has marketed their sport extremely well.
</P>
<P>
   ``But maybe they've gotten involved into the game too much,
making these changes. And they made them the last time in a very
arbitrary manner. They said: `Well, you guys don't want to change,
so we'll change them. We're changing the rules, so you get with
it.' That was basically the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they must feel very strongly about the direction they're
going in.''

   Upgrading the Wizards
</P>
<P>
   As Michael Jordan's coach-search odyssey comes to a close _
University of Miami coach Leonard Hamilton seems primed to take the
job _ the Wizards' head of basketball operations must now
concentrate on finding creative ways to upgrade Washington's
roster.
</P>
<P>
   According to Magic Johnson, it will not be easy. Salary-cap
problems that prevent many of the Wizards' players with locked-in,
long-term contracts from being traded for equal value are well
documented. But Johnson said Jordan faced another hurdle, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's called payback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told people it would take him three to five years,'' Johnson
said. ``He's in a tough situation. Nobody in this league wants to
help him because he beat them most of the time. No one is going to
say, `I'll take Juwan or Rod or Ike Austin,''' Johnson said,
referring to Juwan Howard and Rod Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wanted to help us, either. That's the way it is.
Everybody wants to see him lose. They're smiling because he has no
cap room. But he'll break through.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan appeared close to working out a deal with Mike Jarvis,
the St. John's coach, before negotiations broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Jordan is frustrated making the transition from player
to part-owner and NBA executive, Johnson said: ``I would be
frustrated. From his side, it's the same thing. He went after the
guy he wanted and it didn't happen. That has to frustrate him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has a small percentage of ownership in the Lakers in
addition to his outside business interests, which include a
traveling team that plays in Europe. As his playing contemporaries
like Jordan and Larry Bird attempt to make their mark in other
areas of the game, Johnson also is contemplating a more prominent
NBA position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether it would be what Rod Thorn did or what
Larry is doing,'' Johnson said, referring to the new Nets' team
president. ``I'll have to wait. But I'm having fun at what I'm
doing, and I'm committed. When I get back into basketball, I want
to get back into it all the way. I have a goal set. I'm almost
there.''

 &HT;    New companies, old problems
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In this go-go economy, Internet companies are in the
fast lane. The trouble is, according to some experts in human
resource management and employment law, many dot-com companies may
be rushing toward a head-on collision with workplace harassment
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Dot-com firms are proving to be especially susceptible to
workplace harassment problems, according to Chuck Samel, general
manager of legal knowledge development with Los Angeles-based law
firm LRN. Recent cases have involved companies such as Juno, Pseudo
Programs and EarthWeb.
</P>
<P>
   And while those cases may have made headlines, many more claims
go unpublicized, says Scears Lee III, managing director of the Lee
Group, a human resources executive search firm based in Newnan.
``So many of these claims, I've found, (companies) try to settle
them before they ever go to court,'' Lee says.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies especially at risk, Samel says, are the
``pre-public or very recently public companies, probably with fewer
than 1,000 employees, probably less than 2 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Samel lists several key factors that contribute to the
susceptibility of workplace harassment at these firms:
</P>
<P>
   Dot-coms generally fail to hire human resources professionals
early enough in the development of their companies, Samel says.
``The company has great pressure to develop the organization and
the management of the company at `Internet speed,' and they need to
find the chief technology officer, the marketing and sales
professionals, the chief financial officer. It appears that human
resource managers don't get to the top of that list fast enough,''
Samel says.
</P>
<P>
   Without the appropriate focus on human resource issues, dot-coms
fail to educate and train their employees about the laws they must
comply with, Samel says. ``Without that training and education, one
can see why claims for harassment could arise more frequently,'' he
adds.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Accipiter, spokeswoman for the Society of Human Resource
Management, agrees. ``It is often the human resources department
that stands as the policy police,'' she says. ``They are the ones
that put the policies and training in place.''
</P>
<P>
   In dot-com companies, the work force tends to be less
experienced than in more traditional, ``old economy'' companies,
Samel argues, so there's a greater likelihood those employees have
not received education and training on legal compliance issues
elsewhere. ``The more-established Fortune 200 companies are often
hiring people who are on their second and third jobs and may
already be familiar with and have received training on these
issues,'' Samel says.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies tend to have a very relaxed, informal
atmosphere, casual dress code, less structured environment and less
structured work space. To some, Samel says, those factors ``imply
perhaps the company is less interested in legal compliance, and
that (perception) may lead people to think the company is fast and
loose, which may not be true.''
</P>
<P>
   In many of these cases, ``These employees are working very long
hours in close quarters,'' Samel points out. ``That leaves very
little time for socializing outside the workplace without other
employees, so their social life tends to be centered around the
work environment and around their jobs and around their
co-workers.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, ``fast-growing'' or ``emerging'' doesn't always mean
Internet-based, several experts stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that many of them (companies at risk) are smaller
companies and that doesn't have so much to do with the fact that
they are Internet companies. It has more to do with the fact that
they are growing companies,'' contends Samuel M. Matchett, a
partner at Atlanta's King &AMP; Spalding.
</P>
<P>
   John Putzier, president of FirStep(cq), a performance
improvement company near Pittsburgh, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, I find that technology companies are more
progressive in understanding issues of diversity. . . . They are
more colorblind and sex-blind than other companies,'' Putzier
argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every company starts off probably making human resources
errors. Until they get to be a certain size, they aren't feeling
any pain yet. Maybe a lawsuit wakes them up to the need for a human
resource professional,'' Putzier says. ``I don't think they are at
any higher risk. They are vulnerable in the same way that any
company starting out is vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that since the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas
controversy during his Supreme Court appointment hearings, sexual
harassment reports have been on the rise across all industries.
</P>
<P>
   However, Samel and others say that dot-com firms are proving
uniquely susceptible to problems in this area because of their
lightning-fast growth, their often anti-establishment culture and
their tendency to heightened internal camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bunch of guys working on a loading dock is one thing,'' says
Michael Lotito, an attorney with San Francisco office of the
Jackson Lewis law firm as well as the chairman of the Society of
Human Resource Management. ``We're talking about people of both
sexes working 80 hours (a week) toward a common goal'' of building
an Information Age business and becoming wealthy, all at Internet
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Such high-intensity aspects make dot-coms susceptible not only
to workplace harassment but also to wage and work-hour violations
and other matters of burgeoning legal liability, including
intellectual property and compete-noncompete issues, Lotito says.
</P>
<P>
   Some venture capitalists are beginning to recognize some of
these structural issues and are suggesting the dot-coms address
them before they will back them financially, Lotito says.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, some observers say the generally younger management
of these firms may also play an unfortunate role in harassment
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when people get real rich real fast, real suddenly,
they can become pretty arrogant and feel that they can do what they
want _ so they grab somebody's behind,'' asserts employment
attorney Edward D. Buckley of Atlanta-based firm Greene, Buckley,
Jones &AMP; McQueen.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of these companies you find that the management tends
to be very young, and they don't have a lot of experience in
dealing with the issues we're talking about. There is not a lot of
gray hair assisting the companies,'' Lotito says. ``You have more
of a club environment instead of a more structured corporate
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Age has nothing to do with it, Putzier argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would younger people be more likely to commit lacks of
propriety? I know a lot of dirty old men who have been in the work
force for 30 years,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe along the lines of political correctness, Your
high-growth, seat-of-the pants company may be a bit irreverent, but
again, it attracts people who like that,'' Putzier says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a straight-laced conservative person, I doubt you're
going to like working at a dot-com, and I don't think they'd want
you.''
</P>
<P>
   DEFINING HARASSMENT
</P>
<P>
   What does and doesn't constitute harassment is a highly complex
matter, legal experts say. There are essentially two categories of
behavior that qualify, explains Michael Lotito, an attorney with
San Francisco office of the Jackson Lewis law firm as well as the
chairman of the Society of Human Resource Management.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the direct proposition, in which some kind of
special advantage in the workplace is promised in return for an
intimate relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The second type is the hosxual advances,'' he says. ``Sexual
overatures, inappropriate jokes, comments or requests that are
unwelcome, once reported, the company can investigate and take an
appropriate action.''
</P>
<P>
   Title 7 provides for remedies in the event that there is a
violation of its prohibitions, says Matchett. ``It provides for a
jury trial. In the event that an individual wins, it provides for
back pay.'' In appropriate cases, it also can provide for
compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The cases are handled initially and primarily through the
federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Employers wth
fewer than 15 employees are not subject to the rules in Georgia,
according to Matchett. Most cases are resolved before they get to
the EEOC, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The first defense against harassment is awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employee should know what the company's policy is,''
Matchett says, and the policy will generally outline the complaint
process. ``Read your handbook so that you will know what your
company's policy is.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, advises Matchett, ``If you feel you're being harassed,
utilize the policy. Nip it in the bud. The company has the
responsiblity to investigate and take action.''

ON PRO BASKETBALL:   O'NEAL OVERCOMES PACERS' HACKING, LOSS OF
BRYANT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kobe Bryant left the Staples Center on crutches
Friday night, unable to put much weight on his swollen and sprained
left ankle. With one All-Star shelved, the Achilles' heel in
Shaquille O'Neal's game was beginning to throb, too.
</P>
<P>
   The heavenly center _ and hellish foul-shooter _ went to the
line a record 39 times, missing 21. Purist that he is, Larry Bird
had said he would not resort to intentionally fouling O'Neal just
to stay in the game. But this was too good to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's misfortune and O'Neal's misfires had given the Indiana
Pacers a new lease in Game 2 of the National Basketball Association
finals, a chance to return home to Indianapolis for Games 3, 4 and
5 of the series with hope against the Los Angeles Lakers and their
indomitable center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was working,'' Rik Smits said. ``For a while,
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Until O'Neal made nine of 16 free throws in the fourth quarter,
found an open teammate underneath the basket for a game-deciding
3-point play in the final minute and delivered another 40-point
knockout performance. There went the Hack-a-Shaq, the strategy
going down as hard as the Pacers in a 111-104 loss that left Reggie
Miller and the Eastern Conference champions in an 0-2 hole. Bryant,
who is listed as day to day, does not appear healthy enough to play
in Game 3 on Sunday night at Conseco Fieldhouse, but it may not
matter the way O'Neal and his role players played in the
21-year-old guard's absence on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kobe went out, we felt that, you know, we had to pick it
up,'' said O'Neal, who had 24 rebounds and is averaging 21.5 in the
finals. ``So, I took it upon myself to try to get in deep position
and take the high-percentage shots.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bryant fell awkwardly to the floor in the first quarter
after he came down on Jalen Rose's foot, the building went dead
quiet with concern. O'Neal, Glen Rice and Ron Harper soon
alleviated it.
</P>
<P>
   With Bryant out, the other Lakers starters seemed liberated by
the opportunity. Glen Rice and Ron Harper each scored 21 points;
Rice hit the bomb with aplomb, making five of six 3-point shots;
Harper sneaked through the lane for driving layups, hitting eight
of 12 shots for a season high.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's X-rays were negative, and the injury was diagnosed as a
moderate sprain. But Bryant's availability for Game 3 seemed
doubtful, at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had sprained ankles before,'' he said. ``I thought I was
going to get up, shake it off and keep playing. It just kept
getting worse and worse. As far as Sunday goes, the good thing is
we have a cushion now, being up, 2-0. So it's not a do-or-die
situation for me to play on Sunday. If I'm ready to go, if I can
walk and put pressure on it, I'll be ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 2-3-2 finals format began in 1985, no home team has
won all three middle games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like when Kobe went out of the game, if we could've
found a way to put some pressure on them and get them down around
10 points, they would have gotten nervous,'' Rose said. ``We
weren't able to put that strong thrust against what they were
bringing toward us in order for them to start doubting
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, as usual, was to blame. He set records for most free
throws attempted in a game, burying the old record of 24 set by Bob
Pettit in 1958. He also shot more free throws in each half _ 17 in
the first half and 22 in the second half _ than Bill Russell's
previous record of 15 for a half, set in the 1961 finals.
</P>
<P>
   He also became only the fourth player in league history to score
40 points in consecutive games. After his 43-point eruption in Game
1, he is averaging 41.5 points in the two games. Michael Jordan
averaged a finals record 41.0 points over six games against Phoenix
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Pacers are putting him on the line, O'Neal might
just surpass Jordan's mark. But with each intentional foul,
controversy arose over whether the strategy was good for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't worry about ratings,'' Bird said. ``I'm trying
to win a ballgame right now. Whatever it takes to win a ballgame,
we're going to do it. If it takes a four-hour game, that's what
we're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The game lasted 2 hours 55 minutes and included a fourth quarter
that included 45 free throws and lasted 56 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a fan of Hack-a-Shaq,'' said Miller, who finished with
21 points but scored only 8 points in the final three and a half
quarters. ``I like to play straight-up, old-style basketball. When
I first saw it in the Portland series, when they were down 15 or
16, I didn't understand it. But if you're in the game and you've
got 6 or 7 minutes left and you're shooting free throws like he was
shooting tonight, then I could see it. But I'm not a big fan of it,
no.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said: ``Like I said in the last series, I think it's just
a total respect for my game. My father was in the stands tonight,
so I was able to look at him. He told me to relax, take my time,
just play, and I did that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers were not overwhelmed, holding a lead of 67-64 in the
third quarter. And for whatever Miller and Smits (a paltry 2-for-6
shooting in 16 foul-prone minutes) did not give them, Austin
Croshere (career-high 24 points) and Rose (30 points in 48 minutes)
found a way to get to the basket and draw contact.
</P>
<P>
   But the lasting image was of O'Neal, either chipping paint off
the front iron or getting the ball to nestle into the net,
concentrating as if he had $1 million riding on a quiz-show
question. And when the game was in the balance at 99-96 with 58.8
seconds left, he found Robert Horry underneath for a reverse layup
and an eventual 3-point play.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Kobe going down, we had a golden opportunity tonight that
slipped through our fingers,'' Miller said. ``But what can you say?
The guy goes back-to-back 40. You got to give him credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Game 1, O'Neal looked so much bigger than most of the
Pacers on Friday night, like an oversized child at recess whose
classmates could not get the ball out of his hands. In the second
half, he was called for a very questionable flagrant foul on
5-foot-11-inch Travis Best.
</P>
<P>
   Replays showed that Best had initiated contact on the layup try
with a forearm and that O'Neal's block, which sent the guard to the
floor, was clean. But perhaps the image of a 7-1, 330-pound man
colliding with the smallest player on the court makes officials see
things that are not there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand the rules,'' O'Neal said. ``Sometimes they
grabbed me and took me to the ground. I'm not a little guy in a
sports car that runs into a brick wall. But I guess I'm big and I
can take it.''
</P>
<P>
   His team is up, 2-0, and he is averaging 41.5 points a game.
O'Neal will take it.  &QL;

GODOLPHIN USES CURULE FOR EXAMPLE OF TRAINING 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Gen. Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Maktoum, the
defense minister of the United Arab Emirates, the crown prince of
Dubai and the single most powerful global force in horse racing,
was not at the Belmont Stakes on Saturday. Nor was his trainer,
Saeed bin Suroor. The pair were in England for the Epsom Derby with
the colt Best of the Bests, who finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Best of the Bests is an apt name for the runner from the
Godolphin Racing Inc. stable, which dominates the European circuit.
As is the name of Dubai Millennium, a 4-year-old who has been
hailed as the best horse in the world after whipping such American
stalwarts as Behrens and Running Stag in March at the $5 million
Dubai World Cup at the sheik's home track.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, on Saturday, the assistant trainer Tom Albertrani and
the colt Curule were to man the front lines for Godolphin's assault
on one of the few horse races that it had not previously won _ the
Belmont Stakes, the Grade I mile-and-a-half third leg of the Triple
Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Mohammed confidently changed the name of an unraced
2-year-old from Yaazer to Dubai Millennium in anticipation of
greatness, he vowed to win the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and
Belmont. He insisted, however, on mounting the assault his way,
which meant combining heavy spending with guerrilla-training
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe someday you will learn something about how to win these
races from us,'' Mohammed said before sending out Curule and his
stablemate China Visit to credible seventh- and sixth-place
finishes in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed is visible at the July and September horse sales in
Kentucky. Last September he spent $3.9 million on a Kris S. colt, a
record for the Keeneland September sale. But in the past two years
competing in the Triple Crown series, his horses have been largely
unknown when they showed up at the Derby, because he has refused to
follow the traditional preparation of running his stock in American
races such as the Florida Derby or Blue Grass Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he trains them at his racing compound in Dubai _ partly
because he wants to be close to them and partly because he believes
it is the best training facility of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 100 thoroughbreds at Godolphin's Al Quoz
Racing Stable, and industry experts estimate most of them to be
worth $1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   They are ridden daily on their full-scale private track by a
well-paid staff of 40 current and former jockeys from Ireland,
England and the United States. Tending the horses and their stalls
are 70 grooms recruited from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   From the United States, Mohammed imported Albertrani, a Brooklyn
native who, as an assistant trainer for Bill Mott, was an integral
part of bringing along the great Cigar. Kiaran McLaughlin, a former
D. Wayne Lukas assistant who is a successful New York trainer, also
spends winters there conditioning the Godolphin horses.
</P>
<P>
   The formula has been successful enough for the stable to capture
the Irish Derby in 1994 and the English Derby in 1995, as well as
make Suroor the champion trainer in Britain in 1996 and 1998. But
so far, his training methods have not paid off in the American
Classics. Last year, Worldly Manner shipped to the Kentucky Derby
after a trial race in Dubai and finished an encouraging seventh,
but two weeks later in the Preakness he finished 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Curule arrived in Louisville only three days before
the race. Despite having won only one race, the dark bay colt ran
well. So Godolphin decided to skip the Preakness and come straight
to New York. The son of Go for Gin has trained well here, twice
turning in the fastest workouts of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I picked up a very good mount,'' said Jerry
Bailey, who decided to ride Curule after his Preakness-winning Red
Bullet was not entered in the race. ``Believe me, this horse is
going to run very well.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Curule's progress has taken some of the sting out of the fact
that the horse who Godolphin really believed would capture a leg of
the Triple Crown will miss the series completely: Chief Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The colt was bought from the owners William Betz and Philip
Needham for $4 million after finishing second in the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile last November. He has not had an official race since. He
was forced to skip the Kentucky Derby after having a fever upon his
arrival in the United States in late April. But he missed the
Belmont after working poorly here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is disappointing because we bought him purposely to try and
run him in the Kentucky Derby,'' Albertrani said. ``Being that he
got out to Dubai late, we knew it was going to be difficult with
the timing. Once he got to Kentucky and got a temperature, we lost
more time.''

HAFEZ ASSAD, WHO TURNED SYRIA INTO A MIDDLE EAST POWER, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also filed in category ``a'')  
 (EDS: A full-length version, OBIT-ASSAD-ABRIDGED, is also being
filed. See also: ASSAD-DEATH)  
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hafez Assad, the air force officer who ruled Syria for nearly
three decades, transforming a Middle East backwater into an
introverted regional power that endured as the center of unbending
Arab hostility toward Israel, died Saturday in Damascus. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, a survivor of several assassination attempts and at least
one heart attack, died of a heart attack, according to medical
officials quoted by Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Arab autocrats in the perpetual drama of negotiating
Middle East peace, none was more courted, or more aloof, than the
Syrian leader. No lasting peace could hold without him, but none
could be negotiated with him either. A treaty remained elusive
largely because of his role in demanding back every inch of Syrian
territory.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Assad's longevity in office rested on a rigid
intolerance of dissent, most starkly illustrated by the slaying of
thousands of residents of Hama in February 1982 to end a swelling
Islamic insurgency. His was a suspicious police state, barring
modern instruments like the fax or the Internet that might somehow
become tools to undermine his government.
</P>
<P>
   Assad rarely traveled, even within Syria, and as he aged his
public appearances were limited to holidays an religious
ceremonies. But his withdrawn life was also devoid of the lavish
trappings common to other Arab rulers. His home and office, where
he often worked 18-hour days, consisted of two modest villas facing
each other in a residential neighborhood in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   The stream of American presidents, secretaries of state and
other officials who crossed his doorstep over the years, hoping to
keep the latest peace effort from foundering, emerged with a
grudging respect for Assad. He was at once courteous and
calculating, professorial and persistent, unleashing flashes of
self-deprecating humor during marathon negotiating sessions. The
length of the sessions were as legendary as they were
nerve-racking.
</P>
<P>
   When Henry Kissinger arrived in 1973, becoming the first
American secretary of state to visit in 20 years, their initial
meeting lasted 6{ hours. The press, uninitiated in the ways of
Assad, wondered aloud if Kissinger had been kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``His tactic was to open with a statement of the most extreme
position to test what the traffic would bear,'' Kissinger wrote in
``Years of Upheaval,'' the volume of his memoirs published in 1982.
``He might then allow himself to be driven back to the attainable,
fighting a dogged rear guard action that made clear that
concessions could be exacted only at a heavy price and that
discouraged excessive expectations of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad was most renowned for lecturing foreigners, even American
presidents, about the unfair colonial fragmentation of the Middle
East. In case anyone missed the point, his reception hall was
dominated by a large painting depicting the Arab armies under
Saladin defeating the Crusaders during the battle of Hittin in
1187, a not-so-subtle reminder that he considered present
circumstances temporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in his bitterness toward Israel, he retained a certain
wry humor about their conflicting views, and he seemed to derive
great patience from his obvious sense of history,'' President Jimmy
Carter wrote in ``The Blood of Abraham,'' a 1985 study of the
region.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Syria was a young nation adrift before Assad's rule. The
government had been a revolving door swung repeatedly by coups
after independence from France in 1946, resulting in little
development and a population weary of chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodless power grab he staged in November 1970 brought
stability and the first modern construction of roads, schools and
hospitals. Assad followed the Soviet model of a single-party police
state, constructing a network of 15 competing intelligence
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   It was in regional politics, however, that Assad most sought to
create a legacy, remaking Syria into a power among the Arabs
rather. He was inspired by the Arab nationalism preached by
President Gamal Abdul Nasser of Egypt, and like many of his
generation, he sought to inherit Nasser's role as the voice of Arab
unity.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's roots in an isolated, impoverished religious minority
made him an unlikely candidate to become leader of Syria. He was
the ninth of 11 children, born to minor notables in the village of
Qurdaha, in the Ansariya Mountains, which rise from the
Mediterranean coast. The mountains made for a secure home for his
ethnic group, the Alawite sect, a tiny branch of the Shiite school
of Islam. The mountain tribes had been all but ignored during the
400 years that the Ottoman Empire controlled Syria.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for rebelling against Ottoman rule in World War I,
Arabs had expected independence. But a secret pact divided the area
between the British and French.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, with the region still under the rule of France, Assad
became the first member of his family to receive a secondary
education, quickly becoming a leader among students.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he finished high school, his interest in politics
was cemented as he embarked on a military career as he enrolled in
the new Air Force College in Aleppo. By the time the Arab-Israeli
war erupted in June 1967, Assad had become minister of defense,
after the group of officers he helped found seized power in a
violent putsch. He was 35, serving in his first Syrian government.
</P>
<P>
   The 1967 war was over in a week, and the Arabs suffered the
embarrassment of losing the eastern sector of Jerusalem, the Sinai
peninsula and the Golan Heights in Syria. Then, in 1970, after
another debacle, Assad came to power. Palestinian guerrillas in
Jordan had sought to topple King Hussein. Syria sent tanks over the
border to support the guerrillas, then retreated; Hussein kept his
throne. Assad used the disarray to stage a bloodless coup called
``the corrective movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad ruled through the Baath Party, using its secular ideology
as cover for bringing Alawites into important positions. Eventually
the commanders of the special forces, intelligence, the armored
corps and key divisions were all Alawites, a remarkable achievement
for a group that used to produce the servant class.
</P>
<P>
   His first priority as president was trying to erase the stain of
the 1967 defeat. In that he had a ready ally in President Anwar
Sadat of Egypt. The two profited from competition between the
United States and the Soviet Union, with Moscow pouring billions of
dollars of weaponry into their arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   After becoming enmeshed in military and diplomatic conflicts
with Israel and Lebanon, a mrebellion threatened Assad at home.
</P>
<P>
   The first hint came in 1979, when the Muslim Brotherhood
massacred 50 Alawite cadets in the dining room of the military
academy in Aleppo.
</P>
<P>
   Then in June 1980 extremists lobbed at least two grenades at
Assad, who kicked one away while a bodyguard flung himself on the
second, losing his life. In revenge, the military unit controlled
by Assad's brother, Rifaat, descended on a prison and gunned down
at least 250 religious dissidents in their cells.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim extremists next rose up in 1982 in Hama. They killed
Baath Party officials and broadcast appeals from the mosques for a
nationwide insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuing the rebels, the Syrian military leveled half the
city, killing at least 10,000 residents. The carnage brought
widespread condemnation in the West, but it helped ensure Assad's
utter control. When the choice came down to spilling blood or
preserving his hold on power, there was really no question.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't be apologetic,'' recalled an American diplomat.
``Assad would justify it entirely by saying it was the necessary
price to end years and years of Muslim Brotherhood terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria was also linked to brutal attacks carried out by notorious
terrorist groups like the Abu Nidal organization, whose targets
included Israelis and Jews, Syrian dissidents, Jordanian diplomats
and pro-Arafat Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Syria in the 1990s, Assad was consolidating his position
and preparing for his eldest son, Basil, to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   In a December 1991 plebiscite on a fourth, seven-year term as
president, Assad got 99.9 percent of the vote. As one Syrian writer
noted wryly, ``Even if Allah had run, he wouldn't have done as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assad's dynastic plans were threatened when Basil died in an
automobile accident in 1994. Then, Assad picked his next son in
line, Bashar, who had been training in London to be an eye surgeon,
as his heir apparent. Assad is survived by four of his five
children.

HAFEZ ASSAD, WHO TURNED SYRIA INTO A MIDDLE EAST POWER, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also filed in category ``i'')

filed. See also: ASSAD-DEATH)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hafez Assad, the air force officer who ruled Syria for nearly
three decades, transforming a Middle East backwater into an
introverted regional power that endured as the center of unbending
Arab hostility toward Israel, died Saturday in Damascus. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, a survivor of several assassination attempts and at least
one heart attack, died of a heart attack, according to medical
officials quoted by Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Arab autocrats in the perpetual drama of negotiating
Middle East peace, none was more courted, or more aloof, than the
Syrian leader. No lasting peace could hold without him, but none
could be negotiated with him either. A treaty remained elusive
largely because of his role in demanding back every inch of Syrian
territory.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Assad's longevity in office rested on a rigid
intolerance of dissent, most starkly illustrated by the slaying of
thousands of residents of Hama in February 1982 to end a swelling
Islamic insurgency. His was a suspicious police state, barring
modern instruments like the fax or the Internet that might somehow
become tools to undermine his government.
</P>
<P>
   Assad rarely traveled, even within Syria, and as he aged his
public appearances were limited to holidays an religious
ceremonies. But his withdrawn life was also devoid of the lavish
trappings common to other Arab rulers. His home and office, where
he often worked 18-hour days, consisted of two modest villas facing
each other in a residential neighborhood in Damascus.

EDITORIAL: CONSERVATION, FAR FROM HOME  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, June 11:
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, the Nature Conservancy announced that it would
spend $37 million to buy a remote Pacific atoll from a Honolulu
family that had owned it for 80 years. The atoll, Palmyra, seemed
an uninviting place, 1,052 miles from Hawaii and largely
inaccessible except by small plane. With 15 feet of rainfall a
year, Palmyra has only 680 habitable acres at high tide. But the
conservancy decided to make the atoll the single most costly
purchase in its 49-year history for all the reasons that
conservation groups do these things. Palmyra not only is one of the
most pristine places left in the tropical Pacific. It also shelters
the world's largest land invertebrate, the coconut crab, nourishes
tropical trees that have vanished elsewhere and, at a time when
most of the world's coral reefs are under siege, encompasses 15,512
acres of healthy reefs with an astonishing variety of aquatic life.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, Palmyra is an irreplaceable biological asset. It is also
the most recent example of the increasing emphasis that U.S.-based
conservation organizations are placing on acquiring land in remote
areas with the sole purpose of protecting biodiversity, either by
buying it outright or persuading governments to set it aside.
Development, logging, population growth and farming are chewing up
more and more unspoiled land every year.
</P>
<P>
   To scientists, habitat protection is thus a matter of great
urgency. But it is also an attainable objective, daunting as it
seems. Russell Mittermeyer, the president of Conservation
International _ the newest and one of the most aggressive players
on the international scene _ estimates that about 60 percent of the
world's biodiversity is contained in less than 5 percent of the
world's land mass, and that much of this land can be had for an
average of $10 an acre. Just two months ago, for example,
Conservation International established a trust fund to underwrite a
project announced last year to help Suriname, a small South
American country, manage 4 million acres of untouched tropical
forests that Asian timber interests had tried to buy. The total
one-time cost was $16 million to $18 million, or little more than
$4 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its proximity, biological resources and the
inattentiveness of many of its governments, South America has
commanded more attention than other continents. In addition to
vigorous efforts by nearly every U.S. conservation group to stop
the burning of the Amazon rain forest, the Nature Conservancy and
Conservation International have both recently acquired large tracts
of land in Brazil's Pantanal, a huge wetland south of the Amazon
that straddles the border of Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   But other, less visible conservation efforts are taking place
farther afield. The World Wildlife Federation, which has been in
the overseas conservation business longer than any other U.S.
organization, is nearing agreement with the Sakha republic in
Siberia to place 170 million acres of Siberian forest under
protection, with the government of Bhutan in the eastern Himalayas
to protect nearly 6,000 square miles, and with various central
African countries to establish protected wildlife ``corridors.''
Conservation International has recently begun talks with the
Cambodian government to set aside a large forested area that was
once the stronghold of the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   As these examples suggest, there are other conservation
strategies besides the outright purchase of land. In Bolivia, for
example, the Nature Conservancy is training people to manage the
Mercado National Park. In the same country, Conservation
International bought the development rights to 100,000 acres of
land next to Madidi National Park, and then gave the land to the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that private groups like these are doing so much simply
highlights the fact that the U.S. government could do more. One of
the few tangible achievements of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro was to strengthen the nascent Global Environment Facility,
a multilateral body that has helped underwrite some of these
private efforts to help poor countries hang on to their natural
assets. In 1998, the U.S. Congress pledged to give this group $430
million over four years. It is already $200 million in arrears, a
rather shameful record given the commitment of private groups with
fewer resources.

 &HT;    Tragedy brings life in focus
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This week's U.S. Open at the Pebble Beach Golf Links
</P>
<P>
   is much anticipated, as it visits one of the world's most famous
courses. But it also becomes a source of sadness, because of the
LearJet crash that killed defending champ Payne Stewart and five
others in a South Dakota pasture on Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
   For many PGA Tour players who had played the National Car Rental
Classic in Orlando the day before, Monday, Oct. 25 was for kicking
back at the end of a long season. Paul Azinger, like many whose
families were on the trip, went to Disney World with his wife,
Toni, and his children, Sarah and Josie. After Disney and a side
trip to nearby MGM Studios, the Azingers started for their
Bradenton home, about 90 miles away. For the first time all day,
Paul turned on his cell phone. It rang immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something horrible has happened,'' came his brother's stored
message.
</P>
<P>
   Azinger pulled off the nearest exit of I-4, turned into a rest
stop and called his parents. They were hysterical.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it?'' Azinger said, frantically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne Stewart's plane has crashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Azinger remembers collapsing to the ground outside the car.
Immediately dizzy, he tried to walk, but he started to weave on
numb legs and then threw up along the side of the road. At the rest
stop, the Azingers' screams of anguish startled other families.
</P>
<P>
   ``My equilibrium was off,'' Paul said. ``My body was in such
shock. I couldn't think. I couldn't grasp what had happened. I just
lost it. I fell down flat and bawled my head off.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Azinger had taken on lymphoma and won, but he was not ready
for something like this. He woke up the next morning with tears
dried on his cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crying in my sleep,'' he said. ``I woke up on my back
and I had tears all over my face. It was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sweep of inexplicable death, Azinger had lost Stewart and
his close friends and representatives Robert Fraley and Van Ardan.
The night before, Ardan's daughters had spent the night with
Azinger's kids. The next day, Tracey Stewart asked him to speak at
the Friday service in Orlando, which would be attended by thousands
of people, including more than 100 PGA Tour players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say no,'' Azinger said, ``but I'm thinking, `How am I
going to do this? There's no way. I can't even think. I can't
talk.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Four days after the most chilling day of his life, Azinger would
offer a strong, emotional eulogy. In addition to Stewart and Leader
Enterprises agents Fraley and Ardan, the crash also killed course
architect Bruce Borland, pilot Michael Kling and co-pilot Stephanie
Bellegarrigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``To grasp the magnitude of this tragedy was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do,'' Azinger said. ``Clearly, more difficult than
battling cancer. For me, it was.''
</P>
<P>
   A BONDING IN ORLANDO
</P>
<P>
   The sorrow-filled faces of the PGA Tour players assembling at
the First Baptist Church of Orlando will not be forgotten soon.
Many of them, like Fred Couples, who had lost both parents to
cancer, were overcome with grief when Tracey Stewart went past. The
service was broadcast live on The Golf Channel on Friday, Oct. 29,
when play was suspended in the Tour Championship. Azinger's
humorous stories about Payne were the service's highlight. As a
tribute to his friend, he tucked suit pants into his socks in plus
fours-type fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, at a Thursday morning service in Houston, with
Tom Lehman conducting, a lone bagpiper played through an unusual
morning mist.
</P>
<P>
   ``What other athlete would have impacted the world the way Payne
Stewart's death did?'' Azinger asked. ``None. Even (Princess Diana)
death didn't impact the world like that, because hearts weren't
changed over it. . . . Payne Stewart's death impacted the world.
It's like I said in the eulogy. Those guys fought the good fight
and they finished the race _and God called them home, and it
impacted the world. Now what does that say? I don't know. When good
people start leaving at the rate I see good people leaving, I'm
starting to wonder, who's going to be left? Just the bad people?''
</P>
<P>
   Years before, Azinger's cancer experience had changed Stewart
and his appreciation of life. Now Stewart's loss had done the same
for millions of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your eyes are open,'' Azinger said. ``You see things
differently. You want to live a different way. You want to be
better. You want to spend more time with your family. . . . That's
the part that changed everybody who saw that service _ never to
take anything for granted again. That's the good that came out of
it. I think hearts were changed and lives were changed and a lot of
people grew. They matured. I think the tour matured. I think the
players' perspective was changed. The reality of death and our
mortality is very real, and every time we jump on a plane, it's in
the back of our minds. . . . Heck, if I had played better last year
(and made the Tour Championship field), I might have been on that
plane with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Azinger's loved ones, who almost lost him once, know it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say goodbye to my children, I say, `I love you,' '' he
said. ``I just want them to know that if I don't come back, I'll be
all right. I don't tell them that, but they know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Azinger felt Stewart with him during the Hawaii tournament in
January and won for the first time since the cancer was discovered
in his shoulder in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something that everybody looked at and said, `Wow, that
was great. I'm glad that happened,''' Azinger said. ``Think about
that. A guy who hasn't won in seven years. After a horrible
tragedy, he busts out and did it right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the storybook scenario that could unfold this week at
Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be great if I won the U.S. Open?'' Azinger said.
``I'll be the most focused guy there. I can promise you that. I
will be the most focused man in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   LEHMAN: PROTECT THIS PLANE
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Tom Lehman has regularly ridden airplanes for a
living, the routine has not varied. Strongly religious, he always
makes a pre-flight plea for the safety of the pilots and
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk into the plane,'' Lehman said, ``and I put my hand on
the doorway and I say, `Lord God, please protect this plane.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Lehman's hand never had the opportunity to touch
the LearJet that flew from Orlando toward Dallas, with Payne
Stewart, his Ryder Cup teammate and friend, on board Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to go charter a plane now, I'm going to make sure
I know whose plane it is, how old it is, who the pilots are _ all
those factors,'' Lehman said. ``I'm not just going to call up the
first available charter service and say, `Can I get a plane?' I'm
going to definitely make sure whose plane I'm getting on. In
Phoenix, I know there's two guys I call, and if I can't get one of
those two guys, I'll go commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   The references Lehman has made all year regarding a newly
discovered inner peace are a direct effect of Stewart's death.
Lehman lost a close friend, but gained an appreciation of
everything else. A winner twice since Stewart's death, Lehman never
considered life more precious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm way more at peace than I've ever been,'' he said. ``Part
of it is, when you're dead and gone, what's your legacy going to
be? I think the legacy that he left is a pretty good one. What is
my legacy going to be? That's got me really focused on how I want
my son to grow up and perceive his father. How I want my daughters
to perceive their dad. How I want my wife to think of me, and my
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Lehman who offered such comforting words at the Thursday
service in Houston, who stated that he wasn't ``afraid to cry.'' He
helped soothe everyone's aching souls during the draining week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life's too short,'' Lehman said. ``Other things are more
important. I've learned, `Don't sweat the small stuff,' because it
usually doesn't matter. You change your priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest compliment you could give Payne Stewart and his
family is by going on with a changed heart, a changed attitude, a
changed life _ for the better. That would be the ultimate
compliment, that they've affected me that much that my life is
going a different direction. That's quite a legacy to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after Azinger's victory, Lehman won the Phoenix Open
in January to end a PGA Tour victoryless streak of more than three
years. ``A big part of playing your best golf is being free from
the chains and the bindings, so to speak,'' Lehman said. ``It's a
cliche, I know, but it's being free to be who you are. The game's
tough enough without putting that bondage on yourself. I'm sure
'Zinger came into the season with the clearest perspective he's had
since he came back from cancer. . . . You only can get that
perspective, usually, through some kind of a big event in your life
_ usually, something you have to deal with that's difficult. It's
like that movie, `League of their Own,' when Tom Hanks said, `Of
course baseball's hard. If it wasn't hard, everybody would do it.'
It's meant to be hard. The hard part about it is what makes you
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   MISSING THE BENEFIT
</P>
<P>
   Scott and Sally Hoch were angry with Payne Stewart the day he
died.
</P>
<P>
   After Payne promised to play that Monday in an Orlando charity
tournament at Bay Hill for the local Arnold Palmer Hospital for
Children &AMP; Women, Sally called to remind him the night before.
Payne said he had to go to Dallas. It could not be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' he told Sally. ``I forgot to call you. I can't do
it. I've got this other thing I have to do. I'm real sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   A miffed Scott Hoch said, ``When was he going to tell us he
wasn't going to play?''
</P>
<P>
   Payne Stewart had changed his life's priorities, yes, but every
once in a while some old selfishness would surface. Ironically, if
he had kept the charity tournament obligation, he probably still
would be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hoch was on the 16th teebox when his cell phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has happened,'' Sally said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me go ahead and hit this shot,'' Hoch said, driving a ball
down the fairway and then grabbing his phone quickly. Told the
plane had crashed, Hoch informed his amateur playing partners,
``Guys, I can't do this. I've got to go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later, Hoch stood in the locker room at the
Memorial Tournament, remembering Payne Stewart. Suddenly, he cocked
his head to the side and decided, ``You know, I'm not sure Payne
even knew what the front of my house looked like. We both lived in
a lake, and he'd always come over by boat. Just pull up and show up
for a beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever he was, we always had a good time,'' Hoch said. ``We
would rib him. He would rib us back. We'd play shootouts, and I'd
get him for something because he hadn't played any good, and he's
say, `How many majors have you won?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Close in their amateur days, and when they both tried PGA Tour
qualifying school in 1979, Hoch and Stewart grew apart in the
1980s, ``when our careers started going in different paths.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott and Sally called the Stewarts one night and suggested
getting together for dinner. ``Tracey checked and said, `We've got
an opening three weeks from today on a Thursday,' or something like
that,'' Scott said. ``My wife turned to me and said, `They've got
to look at a calendar?' They had a different lifestyle than we
had.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the last couple of years were a lot different,'' Hoch
said. ``He kind of realized that maybe the best part of his career
was gone. We became pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoch's reputation is that he doesn't care what others think of
him, but Stewart's death has made him think about life. Hoch easily
could have been with Stewart that day. They shared the same
executive jet service, but that plane was arranged privately by
Leader Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed when I play poorly now, but it doesn't mean
as much in the whole scheme of things,'' Hoch says. ``It's made me
think to do more of the stuff that I enjoy _ you know, don't put
things off. It's the first time that I've gone on some vacations _
men-type trips like fishing, which I've never done before. And when
I'm home, I'm trying to spend more time with my family, really
trying to do more the things they want to do, more than what I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   LOVE: HURTING AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III's sorrow for Payne Stewart held special
significance. After the plane crash that took Davis Love Jr. in
1988, his son hoped to never again feel the type of numbness that
spread across him on Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Love doesn't know what to expect this week at Pebble Beach, when
the void in the golf world that Stewart used to fill with his style
and personality, will hit everyone again. This past week, Love
recalled what Stewart's instructor, Chuck Cook, had said during the
memorial service in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember (Chuck) saying that he was going to sit down at the
sea wall (along the 18th hole) and enjoy the sunset,'' Love said.
``Maybe I'll go down there and find Chuck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we'll be missing (Stewart) more next week, but I
said the same thing when my Dad died. We don't miss him just
because it's the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a lot more people talking about it, which will
be nice. It will be out in the forefront and that will keep his
memory going.''
</P>
<P>
   Love's father died the same year Alexia was born and five years
before Davis IV came into the world. They know about their
grandfather from their dad's stories and reflections. But with
Stewart's death and another family emotionally ravaged, they got a
present-day reminder of the horror.
</P>
<P>
   When Love heard the news Oct. 25, he was in Nashville on a
golf-course project. His mother, Penta, called from St. Simons
Island to make sure he was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was to turn around and come home,'' Love
said. ``I felt like the right place to be was at home with my
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   A man Love met at the course handed him a devotional book and
added a touching inscription. The man also told Love, ``You know
what you need to do. You need to go home and tell your kids that
this doesn't happy every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Within moments of the tragedy, Love found his life changing
already. And he's ready for another life-altering moment at the
Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to play a little more like he was trying to
teach me to play at the Ryder Cup, with a little bit more passion,
with a little bit more confidence and aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping I can win (the Open). That would be the best
tribute I could give. To thank him and to thank Tracey and the kids
on (the 18th) green Sunday would be the best thing that could
happen. Somebody will get to do it, but I hope it's me.''

CLINTON CALLS COLLEGE A GOOD INVESTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHFIELD, Minn. _ The stock market may be climbing, but
President Clinton told graduates of Carleton College on Saturday
that the degrees they were receiving would prove to be a better
investment than anything Wall Street could offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the course of a career, a person with a bachelor's degree
will earn, on average, $600,000 more than a person who has a high
school diploma,'' Clinton said. ``The return on a college
investment is now nearly double the stock market's historical rate
of return.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final commencement address of his presidency, Clinton
stressed the increased importance of education and recounted what
his administration had done to make college education more widely
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, opportunity requires the constant ability to learn and
relearn, to master new tools and new technologies, to think
broadly, to adjust quickly, to put things in context,'' the
president told the 423 graduates in a 27-minute speech. ``It means
every American needs more than a high school education. It means a
college education is not a luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pointed out that he was the first in his family to go to
college, thanks to financial aid. ``I am well aware if it hadn't
been for that chance that I had so long ago now to go to school, I
wouldn't be standing here today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lamented that his education initiatives, including a
proposal to make college tuition tax-deductible, remained tied up
in Congress. Republicans want education funds to be distributed to
the states in block grants that the state could use for any
programs, including private-school vouchers. The White House
prefers to direct the money to programs that would help repair
schools, reduce class sizes and provide mentors for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about this,'' Clinton said, after urging leaders in
Congress to adopt his agenda. ``A hundred years from now, the
Carleton class of 2100 will be sitting where you are. They'll look
up at this podium, and perhaps they'll see a president reflecting
on the 21st century, the good old days. I hope that he or she can
say that we began this century the right way.''

THIS WAITER WORE A BOW TIE AND CARRIED THE CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.Y. _ In 1989, Skip Kendall was a 24-year-old budding
professional golfer with big dreams, but with little money.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a steady income, Kendall took a job waiting on tables at
an Olive Garden restaurant in Orlando, Fla. Between shifts, he went
to a nearby field and hit golf balls, sometimes still dressed in
his waiter's outfit, bow tie and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left the tie on because it was so hard to put on,'' Kendall
said. ``People passing by probably thought that I was crazy, seeing
this guy in a bow tie hitting golf balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody thinks Kendall is crazy now. He woke up Saturday morning
in second place at the Buick Classic at 7 under par (135), two
strokes behind the leader, Dennis Paulson (9 under par), with a
chance to win his first PGA Tour event and $540,000.
</P>
<P>
   Those days of waiting tables and struggling to make ends meet
are long behind Kendall, who finished 38th on last year's money
list, with earnings of $962,642. Kendall has made the big time,
playing against the world's best, as he dreamed of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kendall remembers the long road he took to get to this
point, whenever he sees an Olive Garden restaurant or has a
conversation with a waiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know where I've come from,'' said Kendall, now 35. ``If I
had the chance, I don't think I would've done it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had done it differently, with a lot of money backing me,
would I have made it? I don't know. Some people have done it that
way, but maybe I wouldn't have been as hungry with the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall already has one top-10 finish this year, third place at
the Bay Hill Invitational, but he has yet to taste victory on tour,
now in his fifth full season. His closest call came at the 1998
Buick Invitational, when he lost in a playoff to Scott Simpson.
Kendall made a 9-foot birdie putt on the 72nd hole to force the
playoff, but on the next hole, he 3-putted from 25 feet, while
Simpson got up and down from the rough for a birdie to win.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Kendall will have another chance. But with a
player like David Duval (5 under par) lurking in contention,
Kendall was not overconfident, not with 36 holes left to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been out here long enough to realize it's only halfway
done,'' Kendall said. ``I've learned that unless I'm coming down
the stretch the last nine holes on Sunday, it's not even worth
talking about. It's like halftime.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the tenacity Kendall used to reach the tour will serve him
well this weekend. He spent years playing on minitours in Florida,
unable to play consistently enough to reach the next level.
</P>
<P>
   Even when times were difficult, Kendall said he never considered
quitting. He grew up in Wisconsin, playing golf with three other
players from that state who have made the tour _ Steve Stricker,
J.P. Hayes and Jerry Kelly. If they could make it, Kendall figured
he could, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a backup plan,'' Kendall said. ``Once you start
thinking about a backup plan, I think you're better off doing
something else.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Kendall waited tables, golf was still his priority. He used
the money not only to support himself but to pay for entry fees to
qualify for tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   But Kendall's career blossomed in 1997, after he made the tour
by finishing in the top 10 on the 1996 Nike Tour list. At 5 foot 8
and not one of the tour's long hitters, Kendall battled to 74th on
the money list in 1997, keeping his tour card and building his
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   With each successful season, Kendall feels more as if he
belongs, and he has learned to deal better with setbacks. He will
not be playing in next week's U.S. Open, because he failed to
qualify, but a victory this weekend would help ease the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be watching my peers on television,'' Kendall said.
``Have some fun, play with my son, have a big old cocktail in front
of the television.''
</P>
<P>
   How satisfying would it be this weekend for Kendall to beat many
players who are headed to Pebble Beach? He liked that thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe guys want to peak next week, but I don't think David
Duval or Phil Mickelson or any of those guys are coming here not to
win,'' Kendall said. ``Those guys all want to win just as much as I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what happens this weekend, at least Kendall will
be doing what he loves, no longer waiting on tables to make ends
meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to continue to play well,'' Kendall said.
``Hopefully on the last day, I'll be there down the stretch.''

LAKERS HAVE WON BEFORE WITHOUT STAR GUARD 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kobe Bryant hobbled into the postgame interview
area on crutches, the pain from his sprained left ankle relieved
somewhat by his team's victory. As Bryant collapsed on the floor
early in Game 2 on Friday night, the Los Angeles Lakers' hopes for
holding home-court advantage seemed to fall with him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Lakers turned back several rallies by the Indiana
Pacers to win, 111-104, and take a 2-0 lead in games in the
four-of-seven-game National Basketball Association finals.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome required Ron Harper and Glen Rice to score 21 points
each, but the Lakers pointed to the fact that they had survived
before without Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Much as they did when Bryant missed the first 15 games of this
season with a broken hand, the Lakers focused harder and continued
to run their triangle offense. Shaquille O'Neal responded to
Bryant's absence with 40 points and 24 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is not expected to play Sunday night in Game 3 at Conseco
Fieldhouse in Indianapolis and could be sidelined for Game 4 on
Wednesday. X-rays taken after he rolled his ankle with 3 minutes 26
seconds remaining in the first quarter were negative, and the
injury was diagnosed as a moderate sprain.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant injured the same ankle in Game 5 of the Western
Conference finals and missed two practices, but returned in time
for Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had been undergoing therapy on the ankle, using
range-of-motion exercises to increase flexibility and strength.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at the Staples Center on Friday night went silent when
Bryant landed awkwardly on the side of Jalen Rose's foot as Rose
came out to contest Bryant on the right wing. Bryant made his jump
shot to give the Lakers a 22-20 lead, but his left foot landed on
Rose's left foot, and Bryant's ankle twisted. Rose did not flinch,
but Bryant rolled on the court in pain and was taken to the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was no mystery to us,'' Coach Phil Jackson of the Lakers
said. ``We just said: `Go out there and play the way you know how
to play. Take the shots that become available, don't hesitate,
don't look for someone else. You have to pick it up.' And they
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The reserve guard Derek Fisher said: ``It's more a feeling you
have as a player when one of your guys is out. Not a lot has to be
said because everybody understands the situation. You just focus on
doing your job, and when everybody does that, we're O.K.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bryant's status in doubt _ he is listed as day to day _ the
Lakers will again look toward Rice, Harper and Robert Horry to pick
up the offensive slack.
</P>
<P>
   Rice compensated for Bryant's absence by scoring 13 of his 21
points in the first half. Rice made seven of 15 shots overall,
including five of six 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Harper's 21 points came on eight-of-12 shooting. He also handed
out six assists.
</P>
<P>
   Horry scored only seven points, but made a key 3-point play with
58.8 seconds left to give the Lakers a 102-96 lead after the Pacers
had pulled to within 99-96.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of guys on this team,'' O'Neal said. ``We have a
lot of weapons on this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe going out, it just gave Glen and the others a lot more
touches, a lot more opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The backup guard Brian Shaw added: ``We were able to win games
earlier in the season without Kobe. That will help our confidence a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter the prognosis for Bryant's injury, Jackson planned to
evaluate the situation on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Kobe's the kind of player that will get up off the
floor and play if he could,'' Jackson said. ``We know that. And
when we heard that he was possibly out for the game, I knew it was
going to be serious enough to threaten another game in two days.''

NEW YORKER'S DISAPPEARANCE IN JAMAICA BAFFLES POLICE AND FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time Claudia Kirschhoch set foot in Jamaica, she had
lived a year in France and taken a handful of language courses. She
worked as an editor for the Frommer's travel guide series and pored
over maps with an intense curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister called her ``a very savvy traveler,'' and a fellow
travel writer said she was ``bright and intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are just a few of the reasons that the disappearance of
Kirschhoch, 29, more than a week ago from a beachside hotel in
Jamaica has confounded her parents, friends and local police
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Since June 1, the day Kirschhoch, a resident of the Astoria
section of Queens, failed to fly back to New York as scheduled,
Jamaican police officers have plastered their country with her
photograph. Island newspapers have carried the story of her
disappearance on their front pages. And her parents have flown to
Jamaica and offered the equivalent of about $6,200 for information
leading to her whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the search has dragged on, from beaches to nightclubs,
from posh hotel lobbies to street markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a terrible feeling, because you're helpless even
though you know every effort is being made,'' said Deborah Martin,
34, Kirschhoch's sister. ``But we're very hopeful and confident
we'll find her.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirschhoch disappeared from the small resort town of Negril, on
the lush western tip of Jamaica, while on a working trip sponsored
by the Sandals resort chain, which has 10 luxury hotels throughout
the Caribbean. Kirschhoch accompanied a freelance travel writer to
Negril on May 25 after a Sandals-sponsored trip to Cuba was
canceled during a stopover in Jamaica because of visa
complications.
</P>
<P>
   The other writer, Tania Grossinger, said she returned to New
York on May 27 after having a final buffet breakfast with
Kirschhoch in the Beaches Negril hotel, where the two were staying.
</P>
<P>
   Kirschhoch was last seen by a lobby receptionist on either May
29 or May 30, police officials said. The two exchanged greetings.
Nothing seemed amiss. But by June 1, Kirschhoch still had not
checked out, prompting hotel staff to enter her room.
</P>
<P>
   There, they found her clothes, her passport, even her wallet,
with cash and credit cards still inside. But there was no sign of
her.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica has long been popular with tourists, but recent years
have seen a surge in street violence due to turf wars between rival
drug gangs. Last year the number of visitors declined.
</P>
<P>
   Baffled police officials said they were keeping all
possibilities open in their investigation into Kirschhoch's
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``She tended to be interested in seeking out local color as
opposed to doing organized hotel-type activities,'' Martin said.
``She's a very open and trusting person, completely without
prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But by all accounts, Kirschhoch was not one to travel
irresponsibly. She grew up in a modest two-story stucco home in the
quiet suburb of Morristown, N.J., and her family often took summer
vacations, driving up the coast to Cape Cod or Maine. Her parents,
Frederick and Maryann Kirschhoch, encouraged their children to
travel, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Kirschhoch became an avid bird-watcher and grew close to
nature, the kind of person who often combed a beach for seashells,
her sister said. In high school, she studied French. And after
graduating from Washington &AMP; Lee University with a degree in
journalism, she lived for a year in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Kirschhoch also dabbled in other languages, Martin said, and
took frequent trips to places like Italy and the Canary Islands.
She had played the violin since she was a toddler, and she loved
reading poetry, newspapers and novels. In particular, she admired
the writing of Paul Bowles. In Bowles' most famous novel, ``The
Sheltering Sky,'' a woman vanishes into the Sahara desert while her
lover desperately searches for her.
</P>
<P>
   After returning from France, Kirschhoch lived for several years
in Morristown with her parents while working as an editor at small
book publishers. Then last year, she landed an editing job with
Frommer's, a position her sister called ``a perfect fit'' for her.
She also moved into a one-bedroom apartment in Queens to be closer
to Manhattan's cultural events.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Frommer's job took Kirschhoch on a trip to
Seattle and on a junket sponsored by Walt Disney Co., Martin said.
Then along came Sandals and the offer of a trip to Cuba. Martin
said she last saw her sister at a family cookout on Mother's Day,
May 14. The two chatted by telephone a couple of weeks before the
Cuba trip, just catching up on each other's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Kirschhoch was offered the Sandals trip only after two of the
four travel writers originally assigned to the journey canceled at
the last minute, Grossinger said. On May 24, Sandals flew
Kirschhoch, Grossinger and a couple from Chicago into Montego Bay,
a tourist resort on the northwestern coast of Jamaica. There, the
group was told that they would not be able to continue to Cuba
because of visa problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Sandals offered the writers the option of staying at its
Jamaican resorts, Grossinger said. The Chicago couple stayed in
Montego Bay, while Kirschhoch and Grossinger caught a hotel van the
next morning for the two-hour drive to Negril, a town with a 7-mile
stretch of white-sand beach and a population of about 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Grossinger and Kirschhoch checked into separate rooms in
low-slung wooden buildings surrounded by lush tropical plants. They
had balconies overlooking the ocean, Grossinger said, and king-size
beds and terry-cloth bathrobes in their rooms. Rainstorms kept them
off the beach most of the time, and Kirschhoch spent hours reading
a book on Asian metaphysics. But the two writers shared meals
together, eating jerk chicken during the day and having dinners at
the hotel's Japanese and Italian restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   On May 27, they ate their last breakfast together, right before
Grossinger flew back to New York. She said Kirschhoch mentioned
that she wanted to see more of the island, like the Bob Marley
Museum in Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said that when we get into the city, we'll call each other
and get together for lunch,'' Grossinger said. ``She was a bright
and intelligent young lady with whom I would have been happy to
continue contact.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   For more than a week, police officers have been asking people
all over Jamaica whether they have seen a slim white woman, 5 foot
2, with long brown hair. Last week, Michael Spring, the publisher
of Frommer's, flew to Jamaica with Kirschhoch's parents to help in
the search. The U.S. Consulate there has supported them by issuing
press releases and holding news conferences, as well as by helping
the police..
</P>
<P>
   But so far, all the efforts have yielded only frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing whatsoever,'' said Superintendent Linette
Williams of the Negril Police. ``She likes to explore, she likes to
go places on her own. As much as you want to be adventurous, how
long would you go without checking in? But we still have hope.''

HAFEZ ASSAD, WHO TURNED SYRIA INTO A MIDDLE EAST POWER, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Rewrites throughout.)  
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ President Hafez Assad of Syria, a standard-bearer of
Arab nationalism and anti-Zionist fervor who ruled his country with
an iron hand for three decades, died of a heart attack Saturday. He
was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Although Assad had long been in ill health, his death casts a
cloud of uncertainty over the dynamics of peace and conflict in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   But Syria itself moved swiftly to give at least the appearance
of stability. After the announcement of the death, the Syrian
Parliament began to pave the way for Assad's son Bashar, a
34-year-old ophthalmologist, to take over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had long hoped to turn over the reins of power to Bashar
Assad. Indeed, a crucial formal step toward that transition was to
have taken place next Saturday during a rare political convention
of the Syrian Baath party.
</P>
<P>
   An autocrat who brooked no dissent, Assad wielded such authority
that Syria, a nation of 17 million people, remained largely
unconnected to the Internet because of his fears of its influence.
Still, he is credited with transforming Syria from a backwater
nation into a semideveloped one and, more importantly, into a
regional powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he earned begrudging acceptance from world
leaders who criticized his outmoded Soviet-style leadership but
came to respect his courtly tenacity and deep-seated convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our differences, but I always respected him,''
President Clinton said Saturday as he issued condolences from
Northfield, Minn., where he gave the commencement address at
Carleton College.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad, according to his father's authorized biographer,
the English journalist Patrick Seale, ``would not deviate from his
father's legacy.'' But even if he formally assumes power in the
near future, it will take him considerable time to emerge from the
shadow of his father and assert himself as leader.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he could face a family feud with his uncle, Rifaat
Assad, who had sought to succeed his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Also unclear is whether the ruling Alawite minority led by the
Assads will be able to retain its tight grip on Syrian politics.
</P>
<P>
   This opens up the possibility of tense and destabilizing
transition in Syria at a crucial time in the relationship between
Syria and Lebanon and between Syria and Israel. Israel's recent
troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon after 22 years scrambled the
power lines in the Israeli-Lebanese-Syrian triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Although Assad took a resolutely hard line toward Israel, many
Western diplomats believed that he was the linchpin to any peace
breakthrough between Israel and its northern neighbors. Many also
believed that only Assad was strong enough to deliver a change in
five decades of hostile habits. He had survived several
assassination attempts and at least one heart attack and he had
suffered from a variety of debilitating illnesses for years. But,
despite his gaunt appearance and his infrequent travels abroad,
many in Syria had wondered if talk of his imminent demise was not
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian television made an official announcement only after the
news had circulated internationally first. It showed members of the
Syrian Parliament standing for a moment of silence, many of them
crying and holding their heads in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a day of sadness and sorrow in every home, school,
farm, factory and quarry,'' the announcer on state-run television
said. ``Sadness is in the heart of every man, woman and child
because the legacy of his accomplishments is a sun that will shine
not just on this generation but on the many to come.''
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, state television interrupted programming to run live
broadcasts from the Syrian Parliament _ a highly unusual sight here
_ that included recitations from the Koran in memory of Assad.
</P>
<P>
   When he first took office last summer, Israel's Prime Minister
Ehud Barak assiduously courted Assad, issuing flattering public
messages about his strength as a leader. Barak and many Western
experts believed that Assad wanted to return to peace talks with
Israel in order to regain the Golan Heights, which he had lost as
Syria's defense minister in 1967, within his lifetime and to ease
the burden on his presumed successor, his son.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter the two countries communicated briefly, but the
peace effort, with the United States as intermediary, screeched to
a halt.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva in March, President Clinton made a final, failed
attempt to revive the talks at a meeting with Assad. The meeting
ended with American pronouncements that its diplomatic focus would
shift to the Israeli-Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
   But after Israel withdrew its troops last month from Lebanon,
where Syria is the power broker, officials here and in Syria
proffered tentative hope about renewing the peace effort. Barak,
however, said publicly this week that he was wondering if Assad's
heart would ever be in it.
</P>
<P>
   Israel expressed condolences Saturday night to the Syrian
nation, but it also voiced concern over how a transition period
would affect the calm that has reigned on its northern border since
the troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel views with importance the keeping of quiet on its
borders with Syria and Lebanon and expects that Syria will continue
to do so, too,'' said a statement issued by Barak's office.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel's deputy defense minister, Ephraim Sneh, also sent a
message regarding relations between the nations. ``The true test of
any new leader is how fast he renews the peace process with
Israel,'' Sneh said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Syria possesses a largely Russian-equipped military machine that
is believed to be far less potent today than when Assad, a career
military man, assumed power in 1970. But with mid-range and
long-range missiles, and with 30,000 troops stationed in Lebanon,
it remains a force in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Syria installed the current civilian leadership of that country.
But after the recent Israeli troop withdrawal, eager to reconcile
their nation and enter a new era of calm, the Lebanese leaders _
and the Hezbollah guerrilla movement, which is backed by Syria and
Iran _ started to test just how much autonomy Damascus would
permit. This transition period could strengthen their move in that
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the ``Lion of Damascus'' because his family name means
lion in Arabic, Assad was the last surviving member of a generation
of Arab rulers after the deaths of King Hassan of Morocco and King
Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had surprised Middle East observers by attending King
Hussein's funeral, a visit that marked a warming in what had been
an icy relationship with Jordan. Since then, the late King
Hussein's son, King Abdullah, has been a frequent visitor to
Damascus and has cultivated a personal relationship with his fellow
Western-educated scion, Bashar Assad.
</P>
<P>
   From Gaza City, Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader who was an
archrival of the Syrian president, declared a three-day mourning
period. In a statement, he said that the Palestinian people ``would
stand with their Syrian brothers and believe in their ability to
survive this critical moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Arafat said they hoped the moment would serve to
reunite the Palestinian and Syrian people.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Hafez al-Assad's on-again, off-again approach to the
Middle East peace process frequently drove U.S. and Israeli
policymakers to distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Both Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. President Bill
Clinton have argued that Syria's president, who died Saturday at
69, had made a ``strategic decision'' to resolve his differences
with Israel peacefully. But some wonder if Syria has really
resigned itself to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's refusal to return to the table after January's
Israeli-Syrian peace talks in Shepherdstown, W. Va., a subsequent
wave of deadly violence in southern Lebanon preceding Israel's
recent exodus, and a frosty March summit in Geneva with Clinton
hardly seemed evidence of pacific intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Was the Syrian leader temperamental and unpredictable? Were
Clinton and Barak gulled by the mistaken view _ first advanced by
Henry Kissinger after the 1973 Yom Kippur War and now accepted as
conventional wisdom in foreign ministries worldwide _ that Assad, a
maddeningly clever negotiator, was entirely trustworthy once he had
given his word?
</P>
<P>
   In light of Assad's enigmatic behavior, should Israel and the
United States not forgo the notion that only procedure, not
substance, stands in the way of an Israeli-Syrian agreement?
</P>
<P>
   Many pundits in Israel and the United States have answered yes
to all these important questions. A pall of skepticism enveloped
the Syrian track, especially after attacks on Israeli troops by
Hezbollah, the radical Shiite militia that operates with Assad's
blessing in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for some observers, Syria's behavior showed that Assad
was not resigned to Israel's existence and was interested not in
peace but in process _ in stringing out the negotiations to
preserve Syria's regional position rather than cutting a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a serious misreading of Assad, one that could have
easily led policymakers to miss a rare opportunity to achieve a
larger Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Assad's behavior was anything but erratic; it was
consistent and predictable.
</P>
<P>
   To understand that consistency, one must understand the man
known as the sphinx of Damascus and the world in which he lived.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RIDDLE OF THE SPHINX &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Syria has long been the great holdout in the peace process and
the leader of Arab hard-liners who reject accommodation with the
Jewish state. Assad himself was defense minister when Syria lost
the Golan Heights to Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he had kept their return high on his list of
priorities, which also included reinforcing his narrowly based
regime and extending de facto Syrian control over Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But when Assad's Soviet patron collapsed, the sphinx of Damascus
began rethinking his anti-Western orientation. He joined the 1991
Gulf War coalition against his rival, Saddam Hussein of Iraq, and
sent Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara to the subsequent
Madrid peace conference.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts such as Moshe Ma'oz argued that Assad had realized that
he no longer had a military option and had adopted a new Israel
strategy based on diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Such a decision helps explain the 1994 series of high-level
negotiations between Syria and Israel at the Wye Plantation in
Maryland in the wake of the Israeli-Palestinian pact negotiated at
Oslo the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye talks were broken off in 1996 by Israel _ not Syria _
after Syria refused to condemn a spree of tourist attacks on
Israeli buses by Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist group.
</P>
<P>
   The Israel-Syria track remained on hiatus during the prime
ministership of the hard-line Benjamin Netanyahu, but great
expectations arose after the 1999 election of Barak, who promised
to push hard for a deal with Damascus and praised Assad as a bold
modernizer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said repeatedly that a deal swapping the Golan Heights
for peace was well within reach. When Assad sent Shara to negotiate
with Barak in Shepherdstown in January, it was the highest-level
meeting ever between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Where is the consistency in this track record? The key is that
Assad had devoted his life to what he saw as the defense of the
Arab national cause.
</P>
<P>
   That cause, Assad believed, was betrayed by his fellow Arab
leaders _ from Egypt's Anwar al-Sadat, who made a separate peace
with Israel in 1978, to Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
Chairman Yasser Arafat, who agreed to the 1993 Oslo accords, to
Jordan's King Hussein, who signed a peace treaty in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had pledged that, unlike those weak leaders who
capitulated to Israel and the United States, he would uphold the
dignity of Arab unity without compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The ailing Assad wanted this steadfastness to be his legacy. He
also hoped to guarantee his place in Arab history by passing power
to his 34-year-old son, Bashar, whom Assad figured would find it
easier to take the reins if Syria had made its painful
accommodation with the Jewish state on the elder Assad's watch _ an
unfulfilled accomplishment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   How would an Assad-style peace with Israel have differed from
the pacts reached by the Arab leaders whom he had so passionately
condemned? Assad had always emphasized a comprehensive Arab-Israeli
settlement, bitterly opposing separate bilateral agreements with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But since Egypt, Jordan, and the PLO had all concluded bilateral
deals with Israel, what meaning could the principle of
comprehensiveness now have?
</P>
<P>
   Assad conceded that comprehensiveness no longer had a geographic
dimension. He called comprehensiveness no longer horizontal but
vertical _ meaning that unlike such ``discredited'' Arab leaders as
Sadat and Arafat, who both left key issues about Palestinian rights
for later talks, Assad would not defer the resolution of any issue
standing between Syria and Israel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Israel would have to clearly and definitively commit itself to
the full return of all Syrian territory before Assad would shake
hands with the Israeli prime minister. Were he to do otherwise, he
said, the Arab world would judge him a hypocrite who behaved no
differently than those he excoriated.
</P>
<P>
   Given this steely conviction, Assad's public statements praising
Barak's integrity and courage shortly after Barak's election last
May were most unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Those statements would not have been made, nor would Assad have
agreed to send Shara to Shepherdstown, had Barak not assured Assad
(via Clinton) that the 1967 armistice lines could become the border
between Israel and Syria. That would let Syria reclaim the entire
Golan Heights, which it held until the Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts had thought that Israel would hold out for the
international border demarcated by France and Britain in 1923, but
Barak instead reaffirmed the commitment that his mentor, the
martyred Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, had made to Assad.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not as arcane as it sounds: the 1923 lines would
keep the Sea of Galilee, with its precious reserves of fresh water,
entirely within Israel's borders.
</P>
<P>
   For Assad, the Israeli promise to return to the 1967 borders
unlocked the door to negotiations with Israel without risking being
seen as a traitor to Arab nationalism. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,150, OR CONTINUE TO 1,325) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Assad to be able to sign a peace agreement with Israel, he
would have to be able to convince himself, the Syrian leadership,
and the Arab world that he yielded absolutely nothing to Israel
before he had won a clear commitment that fully restored Syrian and
Arab honor.
</P>
<P>
   The personal distance and angry rhetoric let Assad maintain what
he insisted was a distinction between himself and the treasonous
Sadat, Arafat, and Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah clearly would never have increased its lethal attacks
against Israeli troops without Assad's go-ahead. By the same token,
however, Assad also clearly kept Hezbollah from retaliating against
Israel's northern cities after Israel responded to the Hezbollah
attacks by bombing Lebanese power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing happened in Lebanon, domestically or internationally,
without Assad's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Heating up the Lebanese-Israeli border war was seen by Assad as
essential to his claim that _ despite the American working
document's suggestion that he, too, had caved in to Israel _ he
remained the unyielding, reliable defender of Arab honor. &QL;

APPREHENSION, HOPE FOLLOW IN WAKE OF ASSAD'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The death Saturday of Hafez Assad, the Syrian strongman
who skillfully managed to keep his nation a pivot of political
power in the Middle East, brought expressions of both apprehension
and cautious hope for stability from regional and world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, where Assad exercised complete power, government
leaders praised him effusively as the guardian of Arab pride and
the man who helped Lebanon emerge from its long civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faced with the terrible catastrophe that strikes Lebanon at
its heart, because of what the late leader gave through his
efforts, his thinking, his reason and his heart, we decree a week
of official mourning starting today,'' said Lebanon's prime
minister, Selim al-Hoss.
</P>
<P>
   Syria maintains about 30,000 soldiers in neighboring Lebanon,
which it treats as a satellite state.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's son, Bashar, who appears poised to take over his
father's post, has been in charge of Syrian activities in Lebanon
for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, the office of Prime Minister Ehud Barak issued a
statement that underlined Israeli hopes that Assad's heir will
exercise authority to make decisions and, if possible, sign a
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a statement issued in Northfield, Minn.,
where he was speaking, also offered condolences to the Assad family
and to Syrians while adding his hope for a renewed peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past seven years, I have met him many times and
gotten to know him very well,'' Clinton said. ``We had our
differences, but I always respected him.''
</P>
<P>
   The two presidents last met in Geneva this spring, but their
meeting ended in disappointment. Despite high hopes for an
agreement on restarting peace talks between Israel and Syria, Assad
returned to Damascus without committing his country to a date for
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had calculating, and often rancorous, relations with his
fellow Arab leaders. But after his death, the decades of bitterness
were not mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, who was alternately embraced and undercut by
Assad, declared three days of mourning in the
Palestinian-controlled territories.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, Esmat Abdel-Maguid, the secretary-general of the Arab
League, predicted that Syrian policy for the moment would continue
along the same lines as under Assad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that Syria will proceed along the same path chosen
by the departed president with strength and might,'' he told the
Al-Jazeera pan-Arab television station. ``I am certain the Syrian
leadership will complete this process.''
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, Assad was remembered as a crafty leader by Yevgeny
Primakov, a former prime minister and intelligence chief who knew
the Syrian president well. Syria, under Assad, was a major client

had great respect for him. He was a wise statesman who ran his
country under the difficult conditions of confrontation with Israel

could open a window to a more confident search for peace.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Hafez al-Assad's on-again, off-again approach to the
Middle East peace process frequently drove U.S. and Israeli
policymakers to distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Both Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. President Bill
Clinton have argued that Syria's president, who died Saturday at
69, had made a ``strategic decision'' to resolve his differences
with Israel peacefully. But some wonder if Syria has really
resigned itself to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's refusal to return to the table after January's
Israeli-Syrian peace talks in Shepherdstown, W. Va., a subsequent
wave of deadly violence in southern Lebanon preceding Israel's
recent exodus, and a frosty March summit in Geneva with Clinton
hardly seemed evidence of pacific intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Was the Syrian leader temperamental and unpredictable? Were
Clinton and Barak gulled by the mistaken view _ first advanced by
Henry Kissinger after the 1973 Yom Kippur War and now accepted as
conventional wisdom in foreign ministries worldwide _ that Assad, a
maddeningly clever negotiator, was entirely trustworthy once he had
given his word?
</P>
<P>
   In light of Assad's enigmatic behavior, should Israel and the
United States not forgo the notion that only procedure, not
substance, stands in the way of an Israeli-Syrian agreement?
</P>
<P>
   Many pundits in Israel and the United States have answered yes
to all these important questions. A pall of skepticism enveloped
the Syrian track, especially after attacks on Israeli troops by
Hezbollah, the radical Shiite militia that operates with Assad's
blessing in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for some observers, Syria's behavior showed that Assad
was not resigned to Israel's existence and was interested not in
peace but in process _ in stringing out the negotiations to
preserve Syria's regional position rather than cutting a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a serious misreading of Assad, one that could have
easily led policymakers to miss a rare opportunity to achieve a
larger Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Assad's behavior was anything but erratic; it was
consistent and predictable.
</P>
<P>
   To understand that consistency, one must understand the man
known as the sphinx of Damascus and the world in which he lived.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RIDDLE OF THE SPHINX &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Syria has long been the great holdout in the peace process and
the leader of Arab hard-liners who reject accommodation with the
Jewish state. Assad himself was defense minister when Syria lost
the Golan Heights to Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he had kept their return high on his list of
priorities, which also included reinforcing his narrowly based
regime and extending de facto Syrian control over Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But when Assad's Soviet patron collapsed, the sphinx of Damascus
began rethinking his anti-Western orientation. He joined the 1991
Gulf War coalition against his rival, Saddam Hussein of Iraq, and
sent Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara to the subsequent
Madrid peace conference.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts such as Moshe Ma'oz argued that Assad had realized that
he no longer had a military option and had adopted a new Israel
strategy based on diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Such a decision helps explain the 1994 series of high-level
negotiations between Syria and Israel at the Wye Plantation in
Maryland in the wake of the Israeli-Palestinian pact negotiated at
Oslo the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye talks were broken off in 1996 by Israel _ not Syria _
after Syria refused to condemn a spree of tourist attacks on
Israeli buses by Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist group.
</P>
<P>
   The Israel-Syria track remained on hiatus during the prime
ministership of the hard-line Benjamin Netanyahu, but great
expectations arose after the 1999 election of Barak, who promised
to push hard for a deal with Damascus and praised Assad as a bold
modernizer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said repeatedly that a deal swapping the Golan Heights
for peace was well within reach. When Assad sent Shara to negotiate
with Barak in Shepherdstown in January, it was the highest-level
meeting ever between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Where is the consistency in this track record? The key is that
Assad had devoted his life to what he saw as the defense of the
Arab national cause.
</P>
<P>
   That cause, Assad believed, was betrayed by his fellow Arab
leaders _ from Egypt's Anwar al-Sadat, who made a separate peace
with Israel in 1978, to Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
Chairman Yasser Arafat, who agreed to the 1993 Oslo accords, to
Jordan's King Hussein, who signed a peace treaty in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had pledged that, unlike those weak leaders who
capitulated to Israel and the United States, he would uphold the
dignity of Arab unity without compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The ailing Assad wanted this steadfastness to be his legacy. He
also hoped to guarantee his place in Arab history by passing power
to his 34-year-old son, Bashar, whom Assad figured would find it
easier to take the reins if Syria had made its painful
accommodation with the Jewish state on the elder Assad's watch _ an
unfulfilled accomplishment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   How would an Assad-style peace with Israel have differed from
the pacts reached by the Arab leaders whom he had so passionately
condemned? Assad had always emphasized a comprehensive Arab-Israeli
settlement, bitterly opposing separate bilateral agreements with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But since Egypt, Jordan, and the PLO had all concluded bilateral
deals with Israel, what meaning could the principle of
comprehensiveness now have?
</P>
<P>
   Assad conceded that comprehensiveness no longer had a geographic
dimension. He called comprehensiveness no longer horizontal but
vertical _ meaning that unlike such ``discredited'' Arab leaders as
Sadat and Arafat, who both left key issues about Palestinian rights
for later talks, Assad would not defer the resolution of any issue
standing between Syria and Israel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Israel would have to clearly and definitively commit itself to
the full return of all Syrian territory before Assad would shake
hands with the Israeli prime minister. Were he to do otherwise, he
said, the Arab world would judge him a hypocrite who behaved no
differently than those he excoriated.
</P>
<P>
   Given this steely conviction, Assad's public statements praising
Barak's integrity and courage shortly after Barak's election last
May were most unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Those statements would not have been made, nor would Assad have
agreed to send Shara to Shepherdstown, had Barak not assured Assad
(via Clinton) that the 1967 armistice lines could become the border
between Israel and Syria. That would let Syria reclaim the entire
Golan Heights, which it held until the Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts had thought that Israel would hold out for the
international border demarcated by France and Britain in 1923, but
Barak instead reaffirmed the commitment that his mentor, the
martyred Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, had made to Assad.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not as arcane as it sounds: the 1923 lines would
keep the Sea of Galilee, with its precious reserves of fresh water,
entirely within Israel's borders.
</P>
<P>
   For Assad, the Israeli promise to return to the 1967 borders
unlocked the door to negotiations with Israel without risking being
seen as a traitor to Arab nationalism. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,150, OR CONTINUE TO 1,325) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Assad to be able to sign a peace agreement with Israel, he
would have to be able to convince himself, the Syrian leadership,
and the Arab world that he yielded absolutely nothing to Israel
before he had won a clear commitment that fully restored Syrian and
Arab honor.
</P>
<P>
   The personal distance and angry rhetoric let Assad maintain what
he insisted was a distinction between himself and the treasonous
Sadat, Arafat, and Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah clearly would never have increased its lethal attacks
against Israeli troops without Assad's go-ahead. By the same token,
however, Assad also clearly kept Hezbollah from retaliating against
Israel's northern cities after Israel responded to the Hezbollah
attacks by bombing Lebanese power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing happened in Lebanon, domestically or internationally,
without Assad's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Heating up the Lebanese-Israeli border war was seen by Assad as
essential to his claim that _ despite the American working
document's suggestion that he, too, had caved in to Israel _ he
remained the unyielding, reliable defender of Arab honor. &QL;

COUNTDOWN TO THE PARADE, WITH PRIDE AND PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Each spring for the last 20 years, Nestor Rantas has
traveled to the Bronx from Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico, to sell hats,
T-shirts, key chains and anything else bearing the colors or name
of his native land. So it was no surprise that early Saturday, the
day before the annual Puerto Rican Day Parade in Manhattan, Rantas,
44, was standing near Southern Boulevard in the Bronx with a bundle
of flags in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   He was a small dot in a sea of red, white and blue flags on East
Tremont Avenue. Men carrying their own collections of flags and
hats came by and asked what he still had in stock. Some were
looking for flags to place on their cars or to drape around
themselves during the parade; others were sellers trying to stock
up.
</P>
<P>
   Each year in the weeks before the parade, hundreds, perhaps
thousands of vendors and hawkers take to the streets of the Bronx
to sell the symbols that unite proud Puerto Ricans, many of whom
travel across the country for the event. And this neighborhood,
where Rantas also owns the Borinquen Records store, is at the
center of that industry.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Rantas said that he sold the apparel ``for the people
of Puerto Rico.'' But his next comment, which came after the driver
of a flatbed truck stopped to pick up a flag, suggested a motive
somewhat less altruistic. Rantas said he made tens of thousands of
dollars each spring selling the items on the street and in his
nearby store. But he does think that the economic returns show
another type of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Puerto Rico, everything,'' he said. ``It is also good for
the community because so many people are buying flags and selling
them on the streets, and that helps the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Among New York City's many annual parades, the Puerto Rican Day
Parade is particularly merchandise-rich. In the weeks before the
event, flags begin popping up in windows all over heavily Puerto
Rican sections of East Tremont and Mott Haven in the Bronx, East
Williamsburg in Brooklyn and the Lower East Side and East Village
in Manhattan. People also drape flags on the hoods of their cars or
use them as shawls, hang trinkets in their cars and wear T-shirts
emblazoned with slogans like ``I love you Puerto Rico.''
</P>
<P>
   The vendors are the economic engine of the annual rite.
</P>
<P>
   There are no official city estimates on the revenue generated by
the hundreds of thousands of people drawn into New York City by the
parade, or ``el desfile,'' as it is more commonly known in the East
Bronx. But business people in the neighborhood said that the
economic windfall was essential.
</P>
<P>
   Ramy Khalif, 28, the owner of Mak 99 Cents store at East Tremont
and Marmion Avenue, said he had purchased 40,000 Puerto Rican flags
about three weeks ago to sell _ at $1 to $8 _ before the parade.
Only 2,000 flags were left Saturday morning. He had already run out
of towels and caps.
</P>
<P>
   The merchandise cost Khalif about $70,000, and he expects to
make more than $100,000. He said Saturday that he expected to sell
out in several hours. ``I don't think there will be anything
left,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At Rantas' music store, the rows of CDs and tapes that usually
fill the store have been replaced by flags, T-shirts, clocks, coat
racks, towels and key chains. There were even belts, plates and
umbrellas. Rantas would not say how much he expected to make from
the parade, except that it would be in the tens of thousands of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But to many, he said, the merchandise sales are simply a symptom
of pride. For Juan Nass, who is not Puerto Rican, it is less about
pride and more about money. ``Tomorrow is going to be slow and back
to normal, but in the week before the parade we make lots of
money,'' he said.

NEW YORK CITY UNIONS CALL FOR PROGRESS IN TALKS ON NEW CONTRACTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Union leaders representing 300,000 New York City
municipal workers say their members are growing increasingly angry
about the lack of progress in labor negotiations that could be one
of the last big tests of Rudolph Giuliani's mayoralty.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts of half the city's work force have already
expired, and the leaders say their unions may hold large
demonstrations outside City Hall if the negotiations do not show
significant progress soon.
</P>
<P>
   The municipal unions have taken the position that Giuliani
should be especially generous in this round of negotiations because
the city has projected a $3.2 billion budget surplus and because
city workers accepted a two-year wage freeze in their previous
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there is economic prosperity in the city,'' said Lee
Saunders, the trustee running District Council 37, the umbrella
union representing 125,000 municipal workers. ``Our members
sacrificed in the past when the city was experiencing financial
difficulties. Our members made sacrifices in their wages and
pension funds, and now that the city is in strong financial shape,
we should be rewarded with increased wages and benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, the leaders of the city's largest municipal
unions said they saw one major obstacle to progress in the talks:
Giuliani's demand that there be no across-the-board wage increase,
but instead individualized merit increases in which some workers
would receive no raise while others might receive up to 6 percent a
year. Several union leaders said the mayor's proposal would leave
many workers without raises and would create tensions between union
members who receive merit raises and those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not realistic to ask our members to accept a system of
individualized merit pay,'' said Patrick Lynch, president of the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. ``Every police officer should
get a merit pay increase, because every police officer did work
that helped bring about a substantial reduction in crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of
Teachers, also criticized the mayor's proposal, saying: ``There's
not one union in the City of New York that will accept a contract
without a pay increase for all of its members. Ultimately, if the
mayor stays on this course of individualized merit pay or nothing,
then nobody's going to do a contract with him, and then it's clear
to me that he's just not serious about bargaining.''
</P>
<P>
   But Deputy Mayor Robert M. Harding insisted that Giuliani was
indeed serious about bargaining. ``He's already shown his ability
to negotiate with the unions,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Harding said that in the last round of citywide bargaining,
Giuliani and the city's unions successfully negotiated a five-year
contract containing a no-layoff clause, a two-year wage freeze and
a 12 percent increase over the last three years. He also noted that
the city reached a pension agreement with the unions just two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement, which would require state legislation to take
effect, would reduce the amount that city workers contribute to
their pensions each year by about 3 percent of their annual salary.
In return, the unions approved a plan to let the city use $808
million from unexpectedly high investment profits from union
pension funds. The one-time windfall would be used in the city's
operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   Some labor experts say some of that money may be used to finance
a labor contract (each 1 percent wage increase in the city's
payroll costs about $160 million). Several experts said they
expected that Giuliani would eventually propose a fallback position
that included a modest wage increase for all employees and
individual merit increases on top of that.
</P>
<P>
   James F. Hanley, the city's labor commissioner, said the
recently negotiated pension agreement created a spirit of
cooperation that could give some momentum to the collective
bargaining. He added that the unions would feel some pressure to
reach an agreement soon because their members would see the
reductions in their pension contributions until an overall labor
agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he would not predict when an agreement would be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the early stages,'' Hanley said.

DEVILS BEAR DOWN IN PURSUIT OF THE CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The New Jersey Devils had primed themselves to drink
champagne out of the Stanley Cup on Thursday night in New Jersey.
Instead, they were drinking water out of small plastic bottles, and
some looked devastated when they saw five men dressed like armed
guards wheel hockey's Holy Grail out of their house.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Stars had denied the Devils the party they had
prepared to stage in front of their festive fans at Continental
Arena. After taking a 3-1 lead in the series by winning two games
here, a number of the Devils thought the Stars took away something
that had already belonged to them.
</P>
<P>
   It was after the triple-overtime loss early Friday morning that
some of the Devils deeply digested the fact that they need four
victories in the finals to win the Stanley Cup. And the fourth one
is the toughest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anybody knows what it takes to get the final
win,'' said Devils Coach Larry Robinson, the man responsible for
taking over a team in disarray with eight games left in the regular
season and bringing it to this stage. Robinson won six Stanley Cup
rings as a player. ``I told the guys: `If you're nervous, you
should be. If you're scared, you should be.' I think that if you
have not experienced these two things in your hockey career you
have never been in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like a fear of dying or a fear like falling off a
bridge. It's a different kind of feeling that you get, knowing that
the Stanley Cup is within your reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur knows very well what Robinson is talking about.
Brodeur also knows the sacrifices that have to be made to get the
reward of raising hockey's ultimate prize. That is why Brodeur cut
short an interview just minutes after the loss in Game 5 by saying:
``This is the last question. My preparation is starting now.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur gave his teammates every opportunity to finish the job
two nights ago, but they failed him and they failed themselves by
not scoring a single goal in 106 minutes of hockey. Brodeur has
been one of the best goaltenders in the league the last seven
years, but overtime playoff games are not his strong suit.
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday night's loss, Brodeur has three victories in 14
overtime playoff games, including triple and quadruple overtime
losses. His performance in the loss to Dallas and its goalie, Ed
Belfour, in Game 5 was as memorable as the loss to Dominik Hasek in
the 1994 playoffs. Hasek made 70 saves to give the Buffalo Sabres a
1-0 victory in that game, the sixth of the Eastern Conference
quarterfinals series, which the Devils eventually won in the
seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   The Belfour-Brodeur duel Thursday night and Friday morning
involved so many spectacular saves _ 48 by Belfour and 40 by
Brodeur _ that a number of hockey observers are calling it the
greatest display of goaltending in the history of the Stanley Cup
finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever seen anything better,'' Dallas coach
Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been more games with more shots and more acrobatic
saves, but to come up with two such brilliant goaltending
performances in the same game in the Stanley Cup finals, when one
team is looking to clinch and the other to avoid losing its title,
was something remarkable indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said his team had the advantage of ``fresher legs''
going into Game 6 Saturday night. He based his claim on the fact
that his players are younger and his belief that the ice time two
nights ago was more widely dispersed among his players. But the
official statistics proved Robinson wrong, as each team had seven
players with more than 30 minutes of ice time.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's remark that Mike Modano, who played 43 minutes and 37
seconds and scored the only goal, after 106 minutes 21 seconds of
play, had played ``75 minutes'' angered Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry should mind his own business,'' Hitchcock said, adding
that Robinson should ``worry about his own team.''
</P>
<P>
   That burst of hostility is what the Stanley Cup playoffs do to
people who have gone through agony every day for two months.

   SEC-KRAMER _ DESTIN, Fla. _ Roy Kramer often is described as the
most hands-on commissioner in the history of the Southeastern
Conference. A year ago, the kitchen staff at the Sandestin Hilton
found out why. The SEC awards dinner, held annually at this beach
resort, runs strictly on Kramer Time. The appetizer is served at 7
p.m. and the last speech, which is his, is over at 9. Two hours and

 &HT;    ASSAD'S DEATH LEAVES MIDEAST PEACE IN DOUBT
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM Syrian President Hafez Assad was the last critical
hold out in the long search for peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   While Assad took a hard line, he might have also been the sole
figure in Syria capable of making a deal and staying in power to
ensure it was kept. With his death Saturday, prospects of a wider
deal between Israel and its Arab neighbors were shaken up. But they
were not lost.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, Assad was the last major Arab leader to take the
so-called rejectionist line in his dealings with the Jewish State.
He held that line throughout 30 years in office. And he watched
bitterly as contemporaries such as Egypt's Anwar Sadat, Jordan's
King Hussein and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat all signed
treaties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He scorned them as sell-outs to Arab honor that he had vowed to
protect. In taking that hard line, Assad sought to keep the door
shut between Israel and the rest of the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Middle East has lost the ``Lion of Damascus,'' the
question remains whether it will get a lamb to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate wake of Assad's death, estimations over what
happens next -- and, specifically, whether peace will be easier or
harder to achieve remained divided.
</P>
<P>
   One view is that the peace process, already stalled since
January, will be on hold for months or more while the likely
successor, Assad's 35-year-old son, Bashar, consolidates power.
</P>
<P>
   A contrary view is that, while the process might be on hold in
the short run, chances have improved for deal down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The major issue of contention is the Golan Heights. Israel
captured the strategic plateau in 1967. Assad, who headed the
Syrian Air Force at the time, took responsibility for the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Several times since 1990, he had sent envoys to engage in peace
talks in Madrid and Washington, only to later arrange for them out.
to walk out. A succession of high-level U.S. diplomats came to his
palace, which overlooks the capital, vainly seeking to nudge the
process along.
</P>
<P>
   The last round Israel broke off in January, with Syrian
officials saying that they needed more guarantees that Israel would
ultimately relinquish the entire plateau.
</P>
<P>
   A peace treaty with Syria could open up the Arab world at large
to normal diplomatic and economic ties with Israel. It also could
end any real threat to Middle East stability since the
Palestinians, whatever their stance, lack anywhere near the
military might of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has made peace a keystone of his foreign
policy, a goal he hopes to achieve before leaving office next
January. But Clinton, as his predecessor, had to cope with Assad's
unbending determination to recover every inch of the land lost --
in return at best for a only ``cold'' peace with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Assad knew that any peace with Israel would be tough pill for
Syrians to swallow, many of whom still remain bitter over their
nation's military defeats at Israel's hand in 1967 and 1973.
</P>
<P>
   No newcomer, one argument goes, can take the risk of forcing
upon his people a controversial peace with the historic archenemy.
</P>
<P>
   As the virtual certain newcomer, Basher, had focused his
attention on becoming an ophthalmologist until his older brother's
death in a 1994 car crash.
</P>
<P>
   Potential rivals for power include his uncle, Rifaat(cq) Assad,
a free-wheeling businessman who lives in Europe. Opposition could
also coalesce around the Sunni Moslems majority, who has rebelled
unsuccessfully against the regime in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he does survive politically, Bashar remains largely an
unknown. He was to receive his first official position in the
government next week.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from touting the Internet and a campaign against
corruption, his positions on external issues have closely tracked
his father's views.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar may face rivals, if not immediately, then after he's in
the job long enough to get some of the blame for Syria's economic
stagnation. Some Syrians see him as too inexperienced. Others are
tired of rule by the Alawites, who comprise only about 12 percent
of the country's 15 million people.
</P>
<P>
   he Assad family is from the minority of Alawites, a branch of
Islam within Sunni Muslim majority. Their power rests delicately
and could be upset by a controversial bargain with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will Bashar be strong enough to make a dramatic step,
especially and external one? I doubt it,'' said Glenn Robinson,
associate professor of Middle Eastern studies at the Naval
Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Some more optimistic views, however, were being voiced here.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's main television channels broke into their regular
coverage Saturday night with video footage from the Damascus of the
Syrian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculated that Bashar might be easier to deal with than
his father, who had to carry the bruises from military defeats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assad wasn't ready all these years to make peace with us. He
tried to prove that he would get more than Sadat,'' said Israeli
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin. ``The new leadership comes into
power without that historical burden.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near future, the chances of our renewing peace talks
with Syria are slim,'' said Israel cabinet minister Haim Ramon.
``When, the peace talks do resume the chances of success are
greater.''

<P>
   BEIRUT _ The sudden death of President Hafez Assad of Syria last
night threw the Middle East into shock and profound uncertainty as
one of the Arab world's most powerful military nations found itself
leaderless.
</P>
<P>
   As a Syrian television announcer burst into tears while
broadcasting news of the 69-year-old president's death, Arab and
Israeli leaders desperately tried to find out if Assad's son Bashar
_ who was due to be made Dauphin at next Saturday's Ba'ath party
congress _ would be taking over the country.
</P>
<P>
   President Assad belonged to Syria's minority Alawite community
and for years Syria's enemies have been predicting a bloody
denouement if Assad were to die suddenly. But Assad himself and his
foreign minister, Farouq el-Sharaa, have always predicted an
orderly transition of power.
</P>
<P>
   This might have been easier if the Syrian government had not
just embarked on a purge of senior government officials _ including
the prime minister _ for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Alawi officers command the best trained units in the Syrian
army, but a number of former special forces officers may now wish
to stake their own claim to the leadership of the nation that, at
one point earlier this year, seemed on the verge of signing a peace
agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since 1982, when he suffered his first heart problems,
Assad's health has been a subject for constant speculation. But
there had been no prior hint of his imminent death, which has left
Syrians unprepared for the great changes which must now lie ahead
in their country.
</P>
<P>
   Will there now be a peace agreement with Israel?
</P>
<P>
   Will Syria's new ruler persuade the Israelis to return the
occupied Golan Heights?
</P>
<P>
   Will Syria's 21,000-strong army in Lebanon remain in the
neighboring country or return to their barracks in Syria?
</P>
<P>
   And what will happen in southern Lebanon where _ until Israel's
withdrawal earlier this month _ the Hezbollah were fighting a
ferocious guerrilla war against the Israelis with full Syrian
support?
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Saturday night: ``Hafez
Assad was a figure of stability in the Middle East and much
respected in the Arab world and beyond... The best testimony to
(his) memory would be for all involved to redouble their efforts to
bring a just and lasting peace to the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The past 14 months have already taken the lives of three major
Middle East leaders: King Hussein of Jordan, King Hassan of Morocco
and the Emir of Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
   Few could have imagined that Assad _ the president with more
physical energy than any other who could talk foreign ambassadors
to exhaustion as he explained Syria's policies _ would now die. &QL;

PENICHEIRO STEPS ON ACCELERATOR, AND MONARCHS RACE PAST LIBERTY 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the New York Liberty players missed their shots,
and that was with stunning frequency Friday night at Madison Square
Garden, the Sacramento Monarchs sent the rebounds directly to point
guard Ticha Penicheiro. From there, Penicheiro only accelerated,
starting the fast break every time down court with such urgency, it
was as if she were entering the autobahn.
</P>
<P>
   Her Monarch teammates filled the lanes seamlessly and she
flipped them no-look passes, leaving the Liberty looking dazed and
breathing hard through their open mouths as the ball landed neatly
in the net.
</P>
<P>
   When Penicheiro was not igniting the fastest break in the
Women's National Basketball Association in Sacramento's 77-56
victory, Yolanda Griffith was showing why she was the league's most
valuable player last season.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Tari Phillips succeeded in matching her, even getting
a game-high 25 points and nine rebounds to Griffith's 24 points and
eight rebounds, but no one else on the Liberty could keep up with
the rest of the Monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   With a small bench, whittled down by injuries, and ice in its
fingertips, New York (2-4) lost its fourth and worst game of the
season. The Monarchs, considered one of the top teams in the
preseason, overwhelmed the Liberty early, using a 46-27 halftime
lead to win for the first time in four games.
</P>
<P>
   Including Phillips, who converted nine of 16 shots from the
field, the Liberty shot 28.6 percent. ``It was almost like there
was a lid on the basket,'' Liberty coach Richie Adubato said.
``When you shoot 28 percent, you're not going to win. We just
played the worst game that we've ever played since I've been here,
in regard to giving them a head start and not being able to shoot
the basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Penicheiro and her teammates orchestrated the head start. With
13 minutes 46 seconds remaining in the first half, forward Vickie
Johnson's 3-pointer put the Liberty ahead, 10-7, but Griffith
scored five straight points, and suddenly, the Monarchs were in the
middle of their minirun, a warm-up for their 14-0 run two minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they were done, the Monarchs held a 31-15 lead.
Griffith went into halftime having scored 14 points. ``Tonight,''
Griffith said, ``we ran the floor like the old Sacramento Monarchs
used to do last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips noticed. ``One way to kill the morale of a team is on
fast-break points because sometimes you look up and you don't know
the ball is going the other way,'' Phillips said. ``It kills you
offensively, defensively. It kills your legs and your stamina.''

   NEW YORK _ For many homeowners, the benefits of adding a new
room are often outweighed by cost: Even a small addition usually
runs into tens of thousands of dollars. Price, however, becomes
less of a factor if an addition has no roof, no walls and no
interior finishing touches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deck is becoming an increasingly important part of many
families' summer activities,'' said Robert Marshal, the owner of
Craftsman Custom Decks and Porches in Beacon.
</P>
<P>
   Marshal said that while there may be limitations on the size of
a new deck _ building codes often have minimum side- and rear-yard
setback requirements _ most properties have room enough to allow
for at least some extension of the house into the outdoors. But, he
said, just extending isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can build a simple rectangle and stick it on the back
of your house,'' he said. ``But a deck's shape and layout are very
important. That's why it's usually best to hire an architect to
draw up plans that take all the various factors into account.''
</P>
<P>
   Inexperienced contractors and homeowners who design their own
decks, Marshal said, often do not consider circulation paths and
privacy. ``You don't want to end up with a deck that makes people
squeeze between a picnic table and a hot grill to get to the
stairs,'' he said, adding that a professional deck designer will
typically consider such things and may include a bumpout _ a small
extension that juts beyond the main area of the deck _ for the
grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``And privacy panels are not just useful for privacy,'' Marshal
said. The panels, sometimes made of lattice, extend above the
railing and ``also provide a surface that can be used to attach
shelves for storage and hooks for hanging utensils,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The panels, when combined with a well-designed railing and
spindle system, can enhance the look of a deck from the perspective
that counts most: the homeowner's. ``A deck should be beautiful to
look at from inside the house,'' he said, adding that one mistake
many homeowners make is to build the railing too high _ and that
anything over 42 inches starts to look too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives the deck the appearance of a playpen,'' he said.
Most building codes require the railing to be a minimum of 30 to 36
inches high, he said. Spindles, he said, should be spaced about 4
inches apart.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost always necessary, Marshal said, for a homeowner,
architect or contractor to file plans and get a permit from the
local building department before construction can start.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hyman, the owner of BMI Decks in Pomona, said that an
economical way to transform an ordinary deck into a special one is
to, well, cut corners. ``The cheapest way to jazz up a deck is to
literally cut the corners off,'' Hyman said. ``It's a good
tradeoff. You lose only a little space but it looks a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way to enhance a deck, he said, is to run deck boards
diagonally or in a herringbone pattern. ``I usually don't charge
more for an angled pattern or herringbone,'' he said, explaining
that some contractors might charge more because of the increased
material and labor costs necessary for the angled cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman, like many deck contractors, charges on a per-square-foot
basis, based on the material used.
</P>
<P>
   For premium grade, pressure-treated yellow pine decking, Hyman
said, he charges $14 a square foot. For standard cedar, which
generally contains some knots, and for clear cedar _ which is
knot-free _ the charges are $16 and $18 a square foot,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   And for synthetic lumber _ a composite material made of plastic
and wood _ the charge per square foot is $19. The prices include
labor and installation. A 12-by-12-foot deck, 144 square feet,
would cost from $2,000 to $2,700, depending on the materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Composites are becoming more and more popular,'' Hyman said.
``They install just like wood and they're virtually
maintenance-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Renter, president of Deck and Patio Co., a contractor in
Huntington Station, agreed. ``The nice thing about using a
composite is that it doesn't split, doesn't crack and doesn't
splinter,'' Renter said. ``And once it's installed, all it needs is
an occasional washing to keep it looking like new.''
</P>
<P>
   While composite materials cannot be used for structural framing
_ most contractors use pressure-treated yellow pine for the posts,
beams and joists that support the deck _ composite decking
materials are attractive for homeowners who want to restore or
replace an existing deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the framing is in good shape, we can tear off the old wood
surface and replace it with Trex,'' Renter said, referring to the
brand name of one composite decking product. ``Even if your deck is
15 years old, this is a very economical way of getting a new deck
that you'll never have to maintain again.''
</P>
<P>
   The charge for installing new Trex decking on an existing deck
frame, he said, runs about $12 per square foot. ``And if the
customer wants to rip off the old deck surface, we take $2 a foot
off the price,'' Renter said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are more ambitious have even more options.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Taylor, the owner of Just Decks in Toms River, N.J., said
that his company can provide custom-sized, precut deck kits that
customers can assemble themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most times, homeowners who buy kits ask us to come out to dig
and pour the footings,'' he said, referring to the concrete support
posts that must be poured _ usually to a depth of about 3 feet _ to
ensure that freezing and thawing will not affect the stability of
the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said that a standard 12-by-12-foot pressure-treated
yellow pine deck cut into a kit would cost about $1,800. That
amount does not include extra charges for digging and pouring the
footings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For decks he builds on site, Taylor said, he charges a flat
price of $6 a square foot for labor. ``Then we ask the customer
what kind of material they want, and we give them an itemized bill
for every piece of lumber we buy,'' he said. ``We also give the
customer the option of going out and purchasing the lumber
themselves if they want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said that customers should insist on itemized pricing
when getting quotes. ``Most contractors will give a square-foot
price for the whole job, labor and materials included,'' Taylor
said. ``If you're dealing with a reputable contractor, that's not a
problem. But some contractors figure that since the less they spend
on the materials, the more they can put in their pocket, why not
buy the cheapest material?''
</P>
<P>
   Marshal said that another reason decks are becoming more popular
is concern about ticks that carry Lyme disease. ``People still want
to be outside,'' he said. ``They just want to stay off the grass.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the reason, Taylor said, more and more decks are
being built. ``Everybody has different tastes and different
needs,'' he said. ``But you can always fit a deck into your
budget.''

SYDNEY STILL FACES HURDLES IN PREPARING FOR OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN SHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ This city of 4 million is in the blocks for
the Olympics, which start in three months, and is becoming as
nervous as any finalist facing a chance for gold and glory.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian organizers of the 2000 Summer Games, the biggest
in Olympic history, have prepared well, but they are finding the
last warm-ups for the event harder than anything that has come
before.
</P>
<P>
   Event sites, budgets, logistics, technology and accommodations
are on schedule, the organizers say, but ticketing, transport links
and hiring enough hands to do everything remain difficult hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney, a metropolis anchored on bays and beaches, is bracing
itself for the Games, which begin Sept. 15 with the opening
ceremony at the 110,000-seat Stadium Australia, the largest site
built for any Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic torch arrived from Greece last Thursday, with the
relay starting at Uluru, a dome-shaped desert monolith about 1,400
miles northwest of Sydney. Uluru was chosen for its sacred status
among Aborigines, who were here for 40,000 years before white rule
began in 1788.
</P>
<P>
   In the longest torch parade in Olympic history, about 10,000
runners, chosen from 40,000 volunteers, from grade-schoolers to
veterans, will relay it 20,000 miles. The route passes remote
ranches, gold-mining townships and the Great Barrier Reef and takes
in hundreds of crossroad communities before reaching Sydney on the
eve of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   For the Games' organizers _ the government-appointed Sydney
Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, which includes
political and business leaders _ the televised relay is primarily a
marathon marketing exercise to boost ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Last year billing errors and delays and the controversial
reservation of prime seats for wealthy clubs and individuals slowed
ticket sales to 2 million; 3 million more, with a price tag of $140
million U.S., remain to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   A live telephone-sales campaign started last week, timed to turn
televised images of the torch into ticket orders.
</P>
<P>
   John Moore, the organizing committee's former marketing
director, said, ``The torch run is crucial to igniting more
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month sales were spurred when Australian swimmers set world
records in the country's Olympic trials, creating headlines that
helped bring 450,000 mail orders worth $30 million U.S..
</P>
<P>
   David Richmond, the Olympics Coordination Authority's director,
said he was pleased with the pace of recent sales but conceded,
``It will be a challenge to sell all the remaining tickets.''
Richmond pointed out that Australia has a population of 19 million
in an area almost as large as the United States, whereas for the
Atlanta Games in 1996 there were 19 million potential ticket-buyers
living within a five-hour drive.
</P>
<P>
   Getting about 5 million ticket-holders to and from the 635
sessions of 292 events involving 10,000 athletes in 28 sports over
two weeks at 10 principal sites is a transportation task for which
Sydney has the public structure, the organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   But the city will need better management than was revealed
recently by a series of rail accidents and highway control errors.
Two of the dozen rail mishaps were on new tracks built to the main
stadium and the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Knight, the minister for Olympics, alarmed by such
transportation risks for the Games, engineered a switch of control
of the public rail system from bureaucrats to a senior Olympic
official, who was given priority powers to ensure reliability of
services.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, a senior member of the government of New South Wales,
which is underwriting the Games, said he would be ``remorseless in
confronting problems before and during the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people and systems could be stretched to the breaking
point,'' he said.

   (UNDATED) _ Hafez al-Assad's on-again, off-again approach to the
Middle East peace process frequently drove U.S. and Israeli
policymakers to distraction. Was the Syrian leader, who died
suddenly Saturday at 69, temperamental and unpredictable? Were his
enemies gulled by the mistaken view that Assad, a maddeningly
clever negotiator, was entirely trustworthy once he had given his
word? Many pundits in Israel and the United States think so. But
this view is a serious and unfair misreading of Assad. In fact, his
behavior was anything but erratic; it was consistent and
predictable. To understand that consistency, one must understand
the enigmatic man known as the ``sphinx of Damascus'' and the world
in which he lived. To the end, Assad remained the uncompromisingly
tough, unyielding defender of Arab honor....By Henry Siegman,

REAL ESTATE: RAISING THE RENT, AND RAISING THE ROOF 
</HEADLINE>
   By DENNIS HEVESI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is surely one of the most thankless tasks in
public service. And on Thursday morning, when the gavel pounds for
the start of this year's all-day hearing on proposed rent increases
for New York City's 1 million rent-stabilized apartments, members
of the city's Rent Guidelines Board may well have shudders from
hearings past lurking in the recesses of their minds.
</P>
<P>
   They may think of marbles arching at them from the back of the
auditorium. Of rainstorms of epithets. Of circling like covered
wagons on stage to conduct business while a phalanx of police
officers holds the placard-shaking crowd at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine board members, those most wondering why they are
doing this may well be the five public representatives seated
center stage, with landlord members on their right, tenants on
their left.
</P>
<P>
   This year the board has issued a preliminary recommendation that
rents on apartments covered by the rent-stabilization regulations
be raised by 4 percent for one-year leases and 6 percent for
two-year leases _ a significant jump from the 2 and 4 percent
increases ordered in most recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling unruly meetings of years past, Vincent Castellano, one
of the two landlord members _ who readily affirms that he serves on
the board to protect his own interests and those of the city's
25,000 other landlords _ said: ``Can you think of any agency of
government where the meetings are as bizarre? It's a zoo.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the public members' motivation, he said, ``They're
masochists.''
</P>
<P>
   David Pagan, one of the two tenant representatives, is the
administrator of Los Sures, a housing and community development
organization in Brooklyn. ``I come in from the neighborhoods where
I deal with a lot of tenants, that's why I'm here,'' Pagan said.
``The public members, I don't know. I can't figure what's there for
a public member.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much recognition; it's not a power position,''
Pagan said. ``They really must love to be helpful. At the same
time, how long can you be helpful if you are being hit over the
head?''
</P>
<P>
   There is also not much pay; the members receive the same
$100-a-day fee that was set in 1969 when the Rent Guidelines Board
was created _ a point of particular annoyance to them. ``We get
$100 per session, about 10 times a year,'' Pagan said. ``So it's an
extra thousand dollars, for which we have to reveal our financial
history'' _ in a 35-page form.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, meetings of the board have been somewhat calmer in
recent years. ``Far more decorous than prior years,'' said
Castellano, the landlord representative, ``almost bordering on the
civil _ almost, not quite.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the relative decorum ``has to do with the economy,''
Castellano said. ``It's hard to get worked up about a 2 or 4
percent increase when you've got a job. If you're unemployed, it's
a different story. It's not the hot-button issue it was in the
early '90s.'' Yet when the board convenes in the Great Hall of
Cooper Union at 10 a.m. Thursday, the button may be pushed a bit.
</P>
<P>
   For five of the last six years _ not counting tumultuous 1996
when they were 5 and 7 percent _ the rent increases have been 2
percent and 4 percent. And in the view of tenant advocates, since
inflation is largely in check, the current proposal for 4 percent
and 6 percent increases seems unjustified.
</P>
<P>
   The landlords argue, however, that they have been hit with
significant increases in fuel costs and real estate taxes, and
deserve compensation even greater than the preliminary
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   The board's final vote will not be taken during the public
hearing, but is scheduled for 5 p.m. on June 22, also in the Great
Hall at Cooper Union. The final guidelines will affect those leases
with starting dates between Oct. 1, 2000 and Sept. 30, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Piqued last month by media accounts that a proposed change in
the way the board's staff provides economic reports could lead to
whopping increases of 8.5 percent and 12 percent (in fact, the
change was not adopted by the board), public interest in the
current proposal has been stirred.
</P>
<P>
   And with it, renewed railing on opposing sides of the
landlord-tenant divide that (a) the rent board is in the pocket of
a city administration beholden to the real estate lobby or (b)
tenant advocates are simply flexing their numbers to politicize the
process, invoking protection of the poor on behalf of lots of
people who can afford to pay more.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the board's deliberations is a debate over whether
one year's rent guidelines should be based solely on economic
factors from the immediately preceding year or should compensate
for previous inflationary fluctuations. Also at issue is what role
a potentially one-time spike in a particular element of the
calculations _ fuel costs, in this instance _ should play.
</P>
<P>
   All of which sets the stage for 12 hours of vigorous contention
on Thursday, with landlord and tenant advocates from the audience
taking turns in last-word attempts to test the limits of their
allotted three-minute speaking times _ punctuated by vociferous
support or derision from opposing factions in the crowd.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Edward A. Weinstein, for one, will brook little of the disorder
of the not-too-distant past. Weinstein, one of the five public
members of the board, is a retired senior partner at the accounting
firm of Deloitte &AMP; Touche and sits on the boards of six
not-for-profit organizations, including the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
At the request of a friend in the city administration (whom he
would not name), Weinstein agreed to serve on the rent board three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given my background, I'm not quite used to what I've had to
endure from the people who attend the meetings,'' Weinstein said.
``It's a question of unruliness, and the feeling that they have the
absolute right to just yell out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind if they applaud or boo or hiss, although it's
childish,'' Weinstein said, ``but they disrupt people who are
speaking and scream out their unhappy remarks. It just offends
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivid in his recollection is a woman who confronted him at the
intermission of a meeting during his first year on the board. ``She
started screaming at me that I had never heard of Patrick Henry or
the Boston Tea Party,'' Weinstein said, ``meaning I had no right to
stifle their right to dissent. I just walked away.''
</P>
<P>
   The low moment for Edward S. Hochman came in 1994, the year
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani appointed him to serve as chairman and a
public member of the board. That year, the board voted increases of
2 percent and 4 percent and, after a four-year hiatus, reinstituted
what it calls the low-rent supplement _ an extra charge for
apartments with rents below a certain level. Tenants call it the
``poor tax.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the supplement was $5 for stabilized apartments renting
for $325 or less. For the next four years, no supplement was
charged. But in 1994 it was restored at $15 for apartments renting
for $400 or less (This year the board has proposed a supplement of
$15 for rents up to $500).
</P>
<P>
   ``After the final meeting in '94, when it died down,'' Hochman
said, ``I walked to the subway _ the good old City Hall stop for
the 4, 5 and 6 trains _ and a couple of people in the crowd
followed me and threatened to throw me on the tracks. I remember
thinking that's not such a bad idea, an alternative to suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   During the final meeting in 1996, the one year in the last six
in which the increases exceeded 2 and 4 percent, rising to 5 and 7
percent, ``I got hit with marbles, gum and tacks,'' Hochman, who is
a corporate lawyer, said.
</P>
<P>
   That '96 meeting was probably the stormiest in the board's
31-year history. Kenneth Rosenfeld, director of legal services for
Northern Manhattan Improvement Corp., a tenant rights group, was
then one of the two tenant representatives on the rent board. He
left the board last year.
</P>
<P>
   Fully the tenant advocate, Rosenfeld recalled: ``In that year,
there was a temporary increase in fuel costs. And, despite the
staff statistics in what is called the Core Price Index, the board
ignored its own data and passed what, under those circumstances,
were startling and onerous guidelines'' _ the 5 and 7 percent
increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place was full of people screaming,'' Rosenfeld said.
``Landlords were yelling, too. We voted on the apartments and the
crowd went nuts. In order to continue the meeting, because there
were other votes to be taken, we ended up sitting in a circle on
the stage at 1 Police Plaza, trying to conduct the rest of the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   If the 5 and 7 percent increases of 1996 were outrageous, in
Rosenfeld's tenant-protective eyes, the 2 and 4 percent guidelines
of 1994, '95, '97, '98 and '99 were less egregious only to a
degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two and 4 percent may sound reasonable,'' he said, ``but if
you recall, in almost all those years inflation was significantly
lower than in the past and, in the most recent years, almost
nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Pagan, one of the two current tenant representatives, agreed.
``We're talking about zero and maybe 1 percent inflation, and the
fact is that they went to 2 and 4,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year,'' Pagan continued, ``oil is the factor that has
skewed landlord costs more than anything else, and everybody
understands that oil is one of those commodities for which the
price will come down at some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the issue of whether the board should allow a
one-time spike in a particular economic factor to govern the
guidelines, Pagan said: ``What happens is that we are building in a
higher percentage rent increase, and when the oil price comes down
and inflation comes down to a normal level, because the oil was
pushing it, we will not get a reduction on rent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're just putting costs on top of costs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to an annual study produced by the board's staff
called the Price Index of Operating Costs _ or ``the PIOC,'' in
board terminology _ Weinstein said Pagan was contending ``that if
we take a look at the PIOC in relation to the increases voted upon
by the board, in general the board lags behind in those years when
the PIOC shows abnormal inflation, and the board leads the PIOC in
years of moderate or low inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So he's saying that the board tends to act as a moderating
force when it comes to prices,'' Weinstein continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I look at a year within itself, as well as within a
framework of history, and try to achieve a balance,'' Weinstein
said. ``So his interpretation is that of the tenant
representatives, and I don't agree with it. I think what we did was
appropriate, based upon the statistics that we saw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we do, this board is not going to be popular,'' he
said. ``Either the tenants or the landlords are not going to be
happy, and probably both.''

   (UNDATED) _ Hafez al-Assad's on-again, off-again approach to the
Middle East peace process frequently drove U.S. and Israeli
policymakers to distraction. Was the Syrian leader, who died
suddenly Saturday at 69, temperamental and unpredictable? Were his
enemies gulled by the mistaken view that Assad, a maddeningly
clever negotiator, was entirely trustworthy once he had given his
word? Many pundits in Israel and the United States think so. But
this view is a serious and unfair misreading of Assad. In fact, his
behavior was anything but erratic; it was consistent and
predictable. To understand that consistency, one must understand
the enigmatic man known as the ``sphinx of Damascus'' and the world
in which he lived. To the end, Assad remained the uncompromisingly
tough, unyielding defender of Arab honor....By Henry Siegman,

   BEIRUT _ The sudden death of President Hafez Assad of Syria
Saturday threw the Middle East into shock and profound uncertainty
as one of the Arab world's most powerful military nations found
itself leaderless. Ever since 1982, when he suffered his first
heart problems, Assad's health has been a subject for constant
speculation. But there had been no prior hint of his imminent
death, which has left Syrians unprepared for the great changes
which must now lie ahead in their country....By Robert Fisk, The

 NEW YORK: probably both.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The statistics, compiled by the board's full-time staff of six,
provide only guidance to the members in their deliberations, rather
than setting a hard-and-fast conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Rent stabilization was instituted in 1969 to counter the effects
of Rockefeller-era vacancy decontrol laws that allowed a landlord
to go to free-market rents when a rent-controlled apartment became
vacant. There were widespread instances of landlords forcing out
long-time tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Under stabilization, the owner of a vacated rent-controlled
apartment could set an initial free-market rent, after which the
rent would be subject to the increases allowed by the board. There
are currently about 70,000 rent-controlled apartments in the city,
down from more than 1 million at the time stabilization was
enacted.
</P>
<P>
   The rent board's staff prepares at least five reports each year
assessing the affordability and profitability of stabilized
housing. Probably the most significant are the Price Index of
Operating Costs and the Income and Affordability Study.
</P>
<P>
   Like the federal Consumer Price Index, the PIOC surveys a basket
of goods _ among them taxes, labor, fuel and contractor costs _
that estimate the cost of running a rent-stabilized apartment. It
then offers a projection of the coming year's expenses for the
landlord.
</P>
<P>
   The Income and Affordability Study focuses on tenants, surveying
such factors as their salaries, Social Security, public benefits,
rent-to-income ratios, eviction rates and homelessness. It provides
a balance to the data on landlord costs.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld, who in his years on the board frequently clashed with
Hochman, the chairman, believes the board's political balance has
changed in recent years. ``Having been appointed by Mayor Dinkins
in '93, the last year of his term, I spent most of my time on the
board under the Giuliani administration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw an extreme shift in the attitudes of both the city
administration and the Giuliani appointees _ from balancing out the
inequities in the rent-regulated universe toward satisfying the
landlord and real estate lobbies.'' Of the nine current members,
seven _ including the chairman and three other public
representatives _ were appointed by Giuliani. Members serve two-,
three- or four-year terms, except for the chairman, who serves at
the pleasure of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Bart D. Carmody, one of the new public members, sees no shift in
the board's attitude. ``Simply put, when the vote was 2 and 4
percent, the tenants were making statements about the public
members being pro-landlord,'' said Carmody, who is a certified
public accountant. ``This year, when the rates, in my view, could
have been higher, the landlord advocates are crying that we are
pro-tenant. So, my point is: one year yes, one year no.''
</P>
<P>
   Castellano, the landlord representative appointed by Giuliani,
thinks ``it's funny how some of the tenant advocates portray the
behind-the-scenes politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hear from them that the mayor has such control over the
board,'' he continued, ``the fact is that virtually everybody on
the board is doing the mayor a favor by being there, and if he had
to replace them it would be difficult, at best. There is not a long
line of people who want to take this kind of abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no cohesive bloc of public members, Castellano said.
``My role and the role of any of the advocate members is to
persuade at least two public members to agree with us and,
hopefully, get the chair's vote,'' he said. ``That makes a bare
majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Hochman, the chairman, asked rhetorically: ``Does the
administration have an interest in what the Rent Guidelines Board
does? I not only presume so, I would hope so. Do I, as the only
member of the board who, by law, can be fired at any time, the one
designated as the administration's representative, talk to the
administration?
</P>
<P>
   ``When all the reports come in, I tell the administration that
this was the board's factual findings and this is the general range
where I anticipate that the preliminary guidelines may be,''
Hochman continued. ``I have never talked to the mayor on this.
Usually I send my report to a deputy mayor. I'll say, `This is a
general range; do you guys have a problem with that?' The answer
has always been no.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmody said, ``I would think the mayor has to look more to the
voters than any industry'' _ a point not entirely lost on
Rosenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   ``In appointing the board and approving, to the extent that a
mayor does, the final result,'' Rosenfeld said, ``a mayor is
balancing out how much influence the real estate lobby has and the
dollars it provides to political campaigns with the potential votes
of 1 million regulated apartments.''
</P>
<P>
   Hochman pointed out that those 1 million apartments house
perhaps 2 million voters. ``I've always said that if either side
ever thanks us, we've probably done a poor job,'' he said.

HOBOKEN JOURNAL: CANCER AND POLITICS IN CITY OF GRUDGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOBOKEN, N.J. _ Most people here will tell you that not much is
different since the mayor got cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, Anthony Russo, a feisty 53-year-old former
schoolteacher who has ruled this bustling city of 35,000 across the
river from New York City since 1993, may be bald. (In typically
aggressive style, he shaved his head before his hair could fall
out.) But he has not slowed down appreciably.
</P>
<P>
   He signs orders, yells at his opponents on the city council and
continues negotiations to fix up the once-crumbling waterfront,
which has sprouted two lovely parks and an apartment complex during
his tenure. He accused some officials who sent him get-well cards
of doing so out of guilt rather than concern.
</P>
<P>
   But to the extent that the civic climate has changed at all
since late March, when Russo announced that he had just had surgery
to remove a brain tumor the size of a golf ball, there is
considerable disagreement about what, exactly, has happened. This
is not surprising. Beneath Hoboken's ceaseless waves of
gentrification lurks an old world where political grudges are
nursed like kittens and shifting allegiances are monitored more
closely than the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Russo's most devoted adversary on the City Council, Tony Soares,
said the mayor had mellowed a little. ``I think he's a little more
approachable now,'' Soares said recently. ``As much of a tyrant as
he's been all these years, you can't help but be sympathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, though, he reversed himself. ``As much as you
want to be respectful to him,'' Soares said, ``he forces you into
confrontations.''
</P>
<P>
   Margie O'Brien, a crossing guard in the city for more than 30
years and the author of several books on Hoboken history, said that
Russo's enemies had grown more vicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the animal world,'' O'Brien, 56, said last week as
she waved a flock of children across 11th Street. ``If one goldfish
is weak, the other goldfish go after him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other events in Hoboken's fractious public life, the
mayor's handling of his health problem is viewed in some quarters
as part of a vast conspiracy. The mayor, some say, fabricated his
entire illness to help his wife, Michele, win a seat on the school
board in April. Similarly, cynics contend, the mayor, a
two-pack-a-day smoker for 40 years, started giving tearful
antitobacco lectures in the public schools shortly before the
election to garner votes for Mrs. Russo. The mayor scoffs at such
notions.
</P>
<P>
   Many have pointed out that while Russo has held a series of news
conferences to update Hobokenites on his cancer, Ruben Ramos, 26,
an opponent of Russo's on the council who has Hodgkin's disease,
has sought little publicity for his plight.
</P>
<P>
   For Russo, of course, life has changed utterly. Like his
counterpart across the Hudson, another get-things-done
Italian-American mayor who brooks little dissent and has a weakness
for mob movies ( Russo played a Mafioso's bodyguard in ``Analyze
This''), Russo says that cancer has rearranged his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've become more pensive, more God-fearing, more God-loving,''
Russo said in his office on the second floor of City Hall the other
day. ``Maybe before I was looking for the glitz and the glitter. I
would go out after government events and I would have a few drinks
and flirt. And maybe this made me realize how important family is
to me. My personal future and my family's future, not my political
future, are what's important.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the mayor was tired. He had gone in for some tests
the day before and he had not received the results as he had
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit and think,'' he said. ``It's constantly on my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't come in to work until 4 in the afternoon, and he made
his entrance at the 7 p.m. council meeting 15 minutes late. His
dark blue blazer made the folds of his naked head look pale. He
took his usual spot, leaning on the railing that separates the
audience from the council, and scowled.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just after it was announced that Russo had appointed a
commissioner, Jean Rodriguez, to the city's public housing
authority, chaos erupted. Ramos said that the mayor had said in
April that his administration would consult with tenants of public
housing before making any new appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not say that,'' Russo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You said you would meet with the residents,'' Ramos repeated.
``That's what you said, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it is not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Several others joined the fray. Russo accused Ramos, whose ward
contains most of the city's public housing, of being lax in his
duties. Ramos, who took several months off to fight Hodgkin's, took
offense. The council president, Nellie Moyeno, banged her gavel
until the room echoed like a construction site.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually things calmed down. Rodriguez, beaming, was sworn in
and accepted hugs or kisses from all nine council members,
including Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, though, Russo got into a shouting match
with the head of the public housing tenants' association, Linda
Walker, who was also upset at not being consulted on Rodriguez's
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ab-so-lute-ly pos-i-tive-ly wrong!'' Walker boomed.
For the mayor to hold a meeting on the eve of the school board
election and make promises to the residents of public housing just
to get their votes to put his wife in office, she said, then to
just disregard that promise __
</P>
<P>
   ``Every promise I ever made in the seven years that I've been
mayor has been kept, Linda!'' Russo yelled, nearly drowning her out
even though she had the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, he accused Walker of being on the payroll of
one of his archrivals.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Walker said that cancer had indeed changed Russo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gone straight to the devil,'' she said. ``As far as
making amends and trying to make sure he doesn't land on a
pitchfork when he goes, forget it. He's worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Up in his office, Russo basked in the afterglow of his
outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a reprieve for me,'' he said. ``There was a little
action. It got my mind off things.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the test results came in. There was no active
cancer anywhere. Even the nodules in his lungs, where doctors
believed the cancer started, were benign, though Russo has been
directed to have one-third of his right lung removed just to be
safe.
</P>
<P>
   Russo was ecstatic and grateful.
</P>
<P>
   The news was greeted in the true Hoboken spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen the tests?'' asked a skeptical member of the
opposing camp. ``Some people believe that he's just announcing this
to keep his troops from starting to rally against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And another thing. If these things in his lungs are dormant,
why are they being removed?''

ONE KILLED AND 17 HURT IN NEW YORK SPATE OF VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 12-year-old boy who was shot in the face on a South
Bronx basketball court was one of 18 people shot or stabbed in
apparently unrelated attacks in an unusually fierce seven-hour
eruption of street violence that ended early Saturday morning, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The night of shootings and stabbings, which left one person dead
and two critically wounded, comes at a time when overall reported
crime _ which includes homicide, rape, robbery, assault and theft _
is at a record low and continuing to drop, according to police
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But police officials have been vexed by a stubborn but small
increase in the murder rate and the number of shootings, despite an
intense and controversial narcotics crackdown that officials have
said was intended to reduce street violence.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents began at about 9 p.m. Friday with the shooting of
the 12-year-old and a 22-year-old man in the Melrose Houses, a
low-income development at E. 155th Street and Courtlandt Avenue,
and continued steadily throughout the night in the Bronx, Brooklyn
and Queens until just after 4 a.m. Saturday.

FIRST-GRADER WITH LEUKEMIA TEACHES TOWN LESSON ON COURAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Nonsubscribers

<TEXT>
<P>
   TARRYTOWN, N.Y. _ Aria Lams was matter of fact about her
illness: ``I've been sick since I was a little girl,'' she told her
first-grade classmates last fall. ``I had lost my hair. But now I'm
better.''
</P>
<P>
   She had had leukemia since she was 3{, and after more than two
years of treatment was in remission. Her teacher, Lori Blueglass,
gave a party in class with about 40 students and teachers. Aria and
her brother, Jordan, a fifth-grader, danced for everyone. Aria was
6 and happy.
</P>
<P>
   By January, a persistent flu turned into a fresh diagnosis of
leukemia. The news settled like fog over the all-first-grade John
Paulding School, which is usually a carnival of little people, or,
as the principal says, ``a place for toothless wonders.''
</P>
<P>
   Every school has children with adult-size problems, but a
6-year-old flirting with death gave everyone new perspective on
life. As another school year winds down, the courage of the
blue-eyed girl in pink pajamas lying in isolation at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center has reminded teachers here why they
teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are always hoping we have an impact on the child,''
Blueglass said, ``but for a child to have such an impact on me _
that's the kind of thing you don't imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Aria has barely been to school since January. Blueglass has
tutored her at home, helping her with reading and projects. One
day, Blueglass arranged for Aria to come to school after dismissal,
so she could make wind chimes, like the other students had.
Janitors scrubbed the classroom to protect Aria from germs.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so happy,'' remembered Blueglass, the mother of three,
including first-grade twins. ``She looked around. She said: `Look,
my name's still on my hook. My pictures are still up.' I said, `Of
course, you're still part of the class.'''
</P>
<P>
   Aria endured another round of chemotherapy and again lost her
brown hair. Doctors said her only hope was a bone marrow
transplant. Her brother turned out to be a perfect match and
willing donor. ``Whatever it takes,'' he told his father, Jeff
Lams, a musician.
</P>
<P>
   Aria returned to class for three days in May before the
transplant. She wore a straw hat with a flower. A piece of tissue
inside kept the straw from scratching her head. She took off the
hat and hung it on the hook under her name. Some children didn't
recognize her at first, but then they realized it was just Aria.
``She didn't have any hair,'' her classmate, Jonathan, said the
other day, wrestling with a difficult idea, ``but it counts on the
inside more.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the moment Blueglass learned the lesson of Aria. Here
was a little girl, bald and vulnerable, yet buoyant. ``I don't know
that I could have done what she did,'' Blueglass said, ``come in
here and take off her hat and hang it on her hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Aria floated down the hall, greeting people. Her classmates
protectively whispered to Blueglass that some children had giggled
at Aria's baldness. But Aria was oblivious. In a picture she drew
of herself in class, she is wearing bold purple and orange clothes
and a distinctive purple hat. ``It's a sign of happiness,''
Blueglass said.
</P>
<P>
   After the third day at school, Aria went to the hospital for the
transplant. ``I picked her up that afternoon,'' said Lams, ``and
there was hugging and tears. Kids, the principal, teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Aria's hospital room is adorned with signs of a community
caring. There are cards from family friends at the First Baptist
Church of Tarrytown, letters from children, stuffed animals, an
enlarged $5,000 check representing money raised by raffling a quilt
made by a Paulding teacher, Mary Kate McCabe. Classmates call and
Aria's kindergarten teacher, Karen Garibaldi, telephones daily and
works on spelling with her.
</P>
<P>
   Aria is scheduled to come home soon, but she won't be able to
return to class this school year. Even so, said the principal,
Marilyn Mercado-Belvin, the year will be remembered as the one Aria
``taught us all about strength and courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Blueglass is making sure Aria doesn't miss all the year-end
activities _ like publishing her first book.
</P>
<P>
   Aria's book, ``Big Bear,'' is about a family skiing trip. In the
book, there is no fear, only fun. ``We went down a hill with nets
at the bottom to catch us if we went too far,'' Aria wrote.
</P>
<P>
   With Aria in the hospital, Blueglass wrote the book's ``About
the Author'' page. ``I am in first grade at John Paulding School,''
it reads. ``I like to sing, dance and act. My best friend is
Laura.'' Then, drawing on the hope Aria taught her, Blueglass
wrote, ``I can't wait to start second grade.''

REAL ESTATE: IN CHICAGO, FROM PRINTING PLANT TO TECHNOLOGY HUB 
</HEADLINE>
   By JILL SCHACHNER CHANEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A landmark building that once housed the country's
largest commercial printing facility is now being converted into a
mammoth ``carrier hotel'' housing multiple telecommunications and
Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   When renovation of the onetime R.R. Donnelly &AMP; Sons Calumet
Plant into the Lakeside Technology Center is completed this fall,
it will hold what the developers say is the country's largest
planned carrier hotel. It will offer more than 1.1 million square
feet of space devoted to the technical needs of telecommunications
providers and Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-story, English Gothic-style Calumet Plant has been a
fixture on Chicago's lakefront since it was built in the early 20th
century as part of the historic Lakeside Press printing complex
that was once owned by R.R. Donnelly. Publications including Life
magazine, Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.'s Big Book catalog and the Yellow
Pages were printed in the complex before operations there ceased in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly relocated its corporate headquarters from the complex
to downtown Chicago in 1992 following the city's condemnation of
part of the complex to expand the McCormick Place convention
center. The company also moved most of its remaining printing work
to its other printing facilities throughout Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Developers of the Lakeside Technology Center say that the market
for these kinds of facilities is strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that this was a relatively underserved market in
general and in Chicago specifically,'' said Robert Stuckey,
managing director of the Carlyle Group in Washington, which is
developing the property in a joint venture with Core Location of
Bethesda, Md. ``We felt that Chicago is a tier-one
telecommunications hub, along with New York, San Francisco and Los
Angeles, and that there was pent-up demand here that was not being
served.''
</P>
<P>
   The onetime Lakeside Press complex, he said, ``had certain
physical and technological features that set it apart from
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrier hotels have unusual operational requirements, including
multiple power sources, numerous ventilation outlets and floors
capable of bearing heavy loads. Tenants of these facilities need to
have self-contained heating, cooling and ventilation systems as
well as extraordinary amounts of electric power and individualized
security systems, said David B. Larson, a senior project architect
for McClier Construction in Chicago, which is reconstructing the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Calumet Plant was built as an industrial facility,
the building was ripe for transformation. It offered 14-foot
ceiling heights, floors capable of bearing 250 pounds per square
foot and approximately 30 existing shafts to allow McClier to adapt
them as vertical risers for chilled water, electric wiring and
exhaust, Larson said.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the plant is just blocks away from the North
American fiber-optic long-haul route, a major transcontinental
fiber-optic cable route. The proximity will allow the building's
tenants easy access to the fiber- optic infrastructure that they
need to run their businesses, said Michael Jacoby, president of
Core Location, a developer of carrier hotels, data centers and
other high-tech buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The developers say that the renovation of this fabled building
into the largest carrier hotel in the country is somewhat ironic,
given that it was built as the largest producer of a different kind
of communications. Built in four stages between 1912 and 1929, the
Calumet Plant _ named for its location at the intersection of
Calumet Avenue and 22nd Street on the South Side of Chicago along
the Illinois Central Railroad tracks that follow the Lake Michigan
shoreline _ doubled Donnelly's printing capacity. It also contained
Donnelly's executive offices, an art gallery and a library.
</P>
<P>
   The developers plan to restore the building's Gothic-style
executive offices and library and will allow tenants to use them
for meetings. Some 600 printers' marks, decorative stone shields
depicting printers' tools that once decorated the facade of the
building over the main entrance, will also be restored, Jacoby
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Calumet Plant remained an active printing press plant for
Donnelly until 1993, when Sears discontinued production of its Big
Book catalog and company executives decided that operating the
plant, which was spread over eight floors, was no longer
economically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Donnelly sold the rest of the Lakeside Press complex,
which included the Calumet Plant, to Landmark America, a Portland,
Maine, development company. The company originally planned to
develop the property into a mixed-use development, though
construction has not begun on any of the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Landmark America sold the Calumet Plant to Core Location and the
Carlyle Group last year for an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago officials, who once worried about the vacant Lakeside
Press buildings, are applauding the transformation of the Calumet
Plant because it has helped propel an ambitious plan by Mayor
Richard M. Daley to position the city as a leader in technology. To
spur that growth, the city provided the building's developers with
a $3 million energy grant to help subsidize the costs of
construction. An additional $1 million in tax abatements was given
to the building's anchor tenant, Global Center of San Jose, Calif.,
a Web-hosting Internet services company, as an incentive to cement
the deal, said Jimm Dispensa, assistant commissioner of the
technology development unit of the city's Department of Planning
and Development.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Johnson, vice president of design and construction for
Global Center, a unit of Global Crossing, a fiber-optic network,
said that the tax-increment funds had little to do with the
company's decision to lease space in the carrier hotel, however.
The company, which leased the center's 135,000-square-foot third
floor, had been looking for a carrier hotel to house its operations
in Chicago for some time. ``We have studies that tell us what
particular arenas in the world we should be in,'' Johnson said.
``Chicago rated high in terms of what we could get for a customer
base and for its proximity to fiber.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Global Center would like to double the amount of
space it leased in the carrier hotel but would be unable to because
the 1.1 million-square-foot building was already 75 percent leased.
Rentals in the building range from $26 to $40 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Other tenants include 360networks, a fiber-optic network, and
Qwest Communications and Level 3 Communications, both
telecommunications companies, according to Jacoby.
</P>
<P>
   David Love, senior vice president of network operations for the
Vancouver-based 360networks, said that his company decided to lease
space in the building because of its proximity to its own cable
network. The company said that it would use its space to drop off
its voice and data traffic and pick up other traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that a number of other carriers like us are in the
building'' was a plus, Love said. ``It makes it so easy to share
traffic with them,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the developers' research had shown a need for this
kind of space in Chicago, they say they were being taken by
surprise by the demand for the space. ``We thought it would take
three years to lease this much space,'' Stuckey said. ``It looks
like it will lease up in one year.''

GAUGING THE MEANING OF GYRATING SCHOOL TEST SCORES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In this era of standardized student testing, it has
become an all-too-familiar ritual in New York City and across the
country: the leader of the school system calls a news conference
and holds a wedding or a funeral, crowing if scores are up,
grieving and accepting blame if they are down.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, most New York City chancellors have been able to
do a bit of both. Test results can be relied on to rise some years
and fall others. For parents and many teachers, the constant
ratcheting up and down of scores _ testing experts call it the
sawtooth effect _ is confusing and exhausting, if not dispiriting.
</P>
<P>
   So it was a reality test last week when Harold Levy, New York's
newly appointed chancellor, greeted two successive waves of good
news on testing _ a nine-point rise on a statewide test and a
five-point rise on a citywide test _ by urging caution. Levy
half-joked that he would post bar charts in the lobby of 110
Livingston Street in Brooklyn, headquarters of the Board of
Education, where, like a corporation reporting to stockholders, the
school system would be forced to expose its long-term gains and
losses.
</P>
<P>
   In the war of perception against reality, almost nothing can be
harder to gauge than the meaning of test scores. It seems only
common sense that a system of 78,000 teachers and 1.1 million
school children _ or, as Levy likes to point out, one out of 43
schoolchildren in America _ is too big an oceanliner to turn around
in just a year. Is the curriculum new and wonderful? Did the
quality of teachers improve? There is no systemic evidence of
either. Yet, parents and teachers are encouraged to judge their
children and schools the way investors watch the Dow industrials go
up and down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a quantifiable aspect to testing that is so
seductive,'' said Gary Lincoff, the father of a fifth-grader in
Manhattan. ``If a kid does well and scores high, you can dismiss
the tests as meaningless, because you're happy. But if your kid
gets a low score, you suspect he isn't getting it and blame
yourself, your child, or go the other way and blame the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success in America is like a quiz show. It's how to be a
millionaire, and there's usually a number in there.''
</P>
<P>
   But the more sophisticated view, experts say, is that it is
almost impossible to attribute real meaning to a one-year gain in
scores.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City reading test seems a particularly clear case
in point. Both New York City and New York state are now in their
second year of a new reading test, and experts say it is almost
axiomatic that scores go up in the second year of a test.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, in the first year of the new state test, 32.8
percent of New York City's fourth-graders and 56.8 percent of the
fourth-graders in the rest of the state met state standards for
reading and writing. A week ago, the state released this year's
results, showing that 41.7 percent of fourth-graders in New York
City met the standards, a gain of 9 percentage points, as did 68.2
percent in the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, the results of New York City's separate reading
test for grades 3, 5, 6 and 7 came out, offering some corroboration
of the rise in performance. On the city test, 40.8 percent of
students met the standards, up from 35.7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Every district and almost every school in New York City
improved. But despite the overall improvement, schools at the
bottom stayed at the bottom and schools at the top remained at the
top.
</P>
<P>
   Pessimists point out that the scores still mean that 6 out of 10
students in New York City, mostly impoverished black and Hispanic
students, are not meeting city and state standards for reading and
writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some schools, what I call the dead zone schools, just seem
stuck at the bottom,'' said Raymond Domanico, education consultant
to the Metro Industrial Areas Foundation, a coalition of New York
civic and church groups. ``They were dysfunctional, they continue
to be dysfunctional, and they won't reap the benefits of any of
these systemic efforts until we get more highly qualified teachers
and principals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education, in its press release, ascribed the rise
in scores to a variety of causes: from more diagnostic reading
tests and expanded prekindergarten to reduced class size and
after-school reading classes. But as David Liben, principal of the
Family Academy in Harlem, pointed out, ``You have to look at this
like Sherlock Holmes.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy defended testing as a crude if necessary check on the
system, yet sided with the skeptics in suggesting that a one-year
gain revealed very little about the condition of the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to identify causality with any certainty,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of standardized testing use widespread fluctuations to
argue that tests are meaningless and should be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   But others, echoing Levy, warn that test results matter most in
the long term. From the 1960s to the '90s, performance on
standardized tests declined in New York City as schoolchildren
became poorer and dropout rates went up. Though both the dropout
rates and test scores have shown a slight improvement in recent
years, as the economy has improved, it is too early, experts say,
to conclude that the change reflects real progress in the school
system.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said that rather than focusing on test results, he wanted
to focus on hiring, encouraging and retaining good teachers,
principals and superintendents. ``In business,'' he said, ``you
call it management.''

IN A POOL OF AMERICA'S CUP TALENT, AN AUSSIE TEAM RIDES HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Skirting the racecourse in these famed sailing
waters, the Sayonara, the maxi-yacht owned by the billionaire Larry
Ellison of San Francisco, was easily the most conspicuous vessel in
the spectator fleet taking in last week's Farr 40 world
championships, which finished on Friday with an impressive victory
by the Australian John Calvert-Jones' Southern Star.
</P>
<P>
   The Farr 40 series _ named for the designer Bruce Farr and his
simple, fast and identical 40-footers _ may be the premier pro-am
circuit in yacht racing.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-kept secret in sailing, according to the dockside
chatter in Newport, is that Ellison, the founder of Oracle, the
computer software company, is on the cusp of announcing his
challenge for the 2003 America's Cup. If Ellison is indeed in the
market for cup talent, he came to the right place.
</P>
<P>
   The professional tacticians in the 27-boat Farr fleet included
the cup-winning Kiwi star Brad Butterworth, the America One skipper
Paul Cayard and seasoned cup competitors like Tom Whidden, John
Kostecki, Peter Holmberg and Terry Hutchinson of the United States,
and the Australians Rob Brown and Grant Simmer, who played major
roles when Australia won the cup off Newport in 1983. It was
Simmer, one of the world's most underrated sailors, calling the
shots on the victorious Southern Star.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Farr 40 class rules, the onboard pros (in the
10-person crew, just four are allowed) can call tactics and trim
sails, but only the boat's owner is permitted to steer. So it is
not unusual in a frenzied mark rounding to see the likes of a
Butterworth or a Whidden hunched behind a helmsman barking a stream
of instructions. Driving a Farr 40 can be sailing's equivalent of
having Tiger Woods caddie for you in the club championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owner-driver rule has really raised the skill level of all
the owners in the class,'' said John Thompson, whose Solution took
fifth in the regatta. ``You can be 15th or 20th in a given race and
when you look around you see an awful lot of good guys around
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Thompson, John Kilroy _ his defending class champion, Samba
Pa Ti, finished second this year _ traded down from a string of
larger grand prix racers to join the Farr 40 contingent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent 35 years sailboat racing all over the world in maxis
and other classes and it got to the point where I was exhausted by
changing keels and rigs all the time to remain competitive,'' he
said. ``But this boat has brought back the fun of sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a Farr 40 is not inexpensive, Geoff Stagg of Farr
International said a race-ready boat with sails and electronics
costs about $315,000. The class is growing rapidly. The builder
Barry Carroll makes three a month, and by next year the worldwide
fleet will number over 110 vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a lot of money, but a custom 40-foot racer will
run over 700 grand,'' Stagg said. ``So there's a lot of value
there. And all the boats are dead-nuts even. So at the end of the
day, there are no excuses. The owners in this class are wealthy,
driven, successful people. If they have a bad regatta, they know
there's no one else to point at. They have to get better. And
because of who they are, that's what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   If the owner-driver rule is one of the class cornerstones, so
too is the simplicity of the design. ``It's got a swept-back
carbon-fiber rig with small jibs and no running backstays,'' said
the pro racer Robbie Haines, who called tactics on George
Andreadis' third-place Atalanti.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of last week's event, the sailors were tested in
conditions ranging from Tuesday's bleak, unseasonable, 30-knot
northeaster to Friday's classic 15-knot smoky southwesterly. The
top spot on the leader board changed continually until the crew
aboard Southern Star sealed the championship with third- and
fourth-place finishes on the final day of racing. ``Our team was
fantastic, and Grant did a superb job of getting us around the
course,'' said the winning skipper, Calvert-Jones, referring to
Simmer.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the week's synergy, rumor had it that Bruce Farr
would design Ellison's America's Cup racers if he decides to
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   If Ellison's goal is to win the cup, it was apparent last week
that there are plenty of skilled hired guns out there. But if
Ellison's aim is to become a better sailor, he should consider
buying a Farr 40.
</P>
<P>
   Making Waves
</P>
<P>
   Next Friday, up to 190 boats are expected to cross the starting
line to begin the 42nd sailing of the biennial 635-mile
Newport-Bermuda race, organized by the Cruising Club of America and
the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club.

REAL ESTATE: 3 DOT-COM PARTNERS FIND 4-STORY HOUSE IN THE SKY 
</HEADLINE>
   By TRISH HALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All those baby boomers who envy the wealth of the
young Internet moguls can take solace, at least, in this: the
dot-commers may live in fabulous places, but they often work so
hard they have little time to exploit the opportunities for fun
their good fortune presents.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, John Galbraith and Chi-Lin Chang decided to start
an Internet company that would allow people to browse and shop
privately, without revealing name, e-mail address or credit card
information to individual vendors. They quickly raised money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a financial background,'' said Galbraith, 24, who had
worked at a brokerage company and a financial Internet site. And,
he said, ``some of my family's friends are in the venture-capital
world.'' Chang, 21 and like Galbraith a New Yorker, decided to take
a leave from his junior year at Columbia, where he is majoring in
economics. He had met Galbraith when they were both working on
Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   In January, money in hand, they brought in Bill Holmberg, 25,
who had gone to Georgetown University with Galbraith (no relation
to the economist John Kenneth Galbraith). They began looking for a
place for their new company, Incogniti Inc., that could be both
office and home.
</P>
<P>
   The three young men, who swivel seamlessly in midconversation to
answer telephones, started in the usual way, checking
advertisements and meeting with brokers. In a story that is
becoming eerily familiar, they told of going with one broker who
took them to a large sweatshop and promised that if they rented the
space, all the people would be gone in short order.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they hooked up with Lake Shaw, a broker for
CitiHabitats, who took them to a 34-story building in the financial
district that is handled by her company. The former office
building, at 100 John St., was renovated and turned into
apartments. But what she showed the three men was hardly a regular
place.
</P>
<P>
   It is a house in the sky, a meandering four-story penthouse with
four bedrooms, six bathrooms, huge windows giving views in three
directions, and a rooftop terrace shared with the rest of the
building but contiguous with their space.
</P>
<P>
   They immediately took the penthouse, which rents for $9,500 a
month, and because their business had no financial history, paid a
year's rent in advance. The original rent being asked was $15,000 a
month, they said, and someone had taken it at that price but backed
out when it became clear that the roof deck was shared.
</P>
<P>
   They use their first floor, the former living room, as an
office, with space for a half-dozen desks and a conference room.
</P>
<P>
   They are working on readying their site, www.ivanish.com, which
is scheduled to launch in September. Internet users will be able to
log on to ivanish.com and type in their destinations from there,
and they will be able to shop by revealing their personal data and
credit card information only to this company, and not to the actual
vendors who sell them merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch tends to be things like Tortino's pizza rolls, cooked in
the microwave. Upstairs on the middle two floors each of them has a
large bedroom and private bath; the top floor is an entertainment
center, leading to the deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great for single guys,'' said Chang. ``But a family is
not going to want to live here.'' The neighborhood has few
children, he says, and lacks stores and services, although a large
grocery store called Jubilee, with good vegetables and fruit, and a
range of upscale products and organic foods, just opened up the
street. ``Jubilee is like a haven,'' Chang said.
</P>
<P>
   They liked the penthouse because it was ready to go, not a raw
space. And if they ever have time, they'll take advantage of its
spectacular views of Manhattan, looking north. ``We haven't had any
dinner parties yet,'' Galbraith said. ``But every time we achieve a
big milestone we want to have a big party.''
</P>
<P>
   The three start working every morning at about 9 and continue
until about 10 at night. ``Since we're here, we can work all the
time,'' Galbraith said. And there's no wasted time. ``What I love
is that the commute is quick and easy,'' Chang said.''And there's a
gym downstairs. That keeps me sane.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood, he said, ``gets very barren at night and on
weekends.'' Not that it matters, really. ``When I go out ...,''
Chang said, ``well, I'm usually too lazy to get out of my room.''

21 HORSES DIE IN BROOKLYN STABLE FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH KERSHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fire officials Saturday were investigating the cause
of a fire that gutted the Bergen Beach Stables, a century-old horse
barn in the Mill Basin section of Brooklyn, killing 21 horses.
</P>
<P>
   The two-alarm fire broke out shortly before midnight Friday,
engulfing the wooden 46-stall barn at 1364 East 66th St. in 30-foot
flames. Responding, 121 firefighters were called to the scene and
brought the fire under control by 1 a.m., fire officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   First Deputy Fire Commissioner William Feehan, speaking at a
news conference at the stable, said that investigators had no
evidence of foul play, but officials still had not determined how
the fire had started. Barns are not required to have a sprinkler
system, he said, and the barn was filled with hay, so flames moved
furiously through the stables.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not determined whether it's accidental or
suspicious,'' Feehan said. ``And there's nothing at this point that
leads us to believe it's anything other than accidental.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters rescued two of the 24 horses in the barn, including
a badly burned pony belonging to the owner of the stables, Karen
Facciolo. She got a call from a neighbor and arrived at the scene
before the Fire Department, watching in horror as her stables went
up in flames with the horses trapped in their stalls. A couple who
live next to the barn saw smoke rising from the stables and managed
to rescue another horse by ripping apart the door to its stall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole top of the barn was up in flames,'' said Facciolo,
who has owned the stables for 16 years. ``It was gone, gone. The
middle of the barn looked like a volcano.''
</P>
<P>
   Horse owners who were in the barn hours before the fire said
that all the electricity had been shut off when the horses were put
in their stalls for the night and that no flammable liquids were
kept inside the stables.
</P>
<P>
   The Bergen Beach Stables was the last of three sets of stables
in the neighborhood near Jamaica Bay, where many residents grew up
riding along Bergen Beach or brought their children and
grandchildren to watch the horses munching on hay and trotting
around the paddocks. One stable, a few blocks away, burned down in
1968, killing 54 horses and setting 50 others loose. Another stable
in the area closed shortly after that.
</P>
<P>
   Several horse owners joined Facciolo early Saturday morning and
watched as horse carcasses, some of them weighing up to 2,000
pounds, were hauled out of the smoky wreckage with forklifts. By
late morning, a dozen emotionally devastated horse owners and young
riders stood on the street at the edge of the 3-acre property, now
filled with the barely recognizable remains of the stable built in
1901, as the smell of manure and burned wood wafted through the
air. Some of the owners clutched pictures of their horses,
consoling each other and talking about the possibility of raising
money to rebuild the barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a horror, it's just a horror,'' said Irene O'Brien,
who said she lost a bay quarter horse named Added Incentive.
O'Brien said she had kept that horse in the stables for the past
five years, along with two others that she was leasing for her
daughters to ride.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said she had left the stable with Facciolo at 9 p.m.
Friday _ just hours before the blaze broke out _ after completing
what had become a nightly ritual: taking her horse out to graze,
locking him in his stall for the night and feeding him a few
carrots.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Rizzo said he had kept two quarter horses, a mare and her
offspring, at the stable for 15 years, and spent hours each day in
the barn. He said he had renovated their stalls to include
skylights, fans and varnished walls. Rizzo said that when he
learned early Saturday that the horses, Babe and Dancer, had died
in the fire, he felt like he had lost ``my daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the dead horses, Belgian Draft Horses named Jake and
Betty, belonged to the City of New York Parks and Recreation
department, which was boarding them at the Bergen Beach Stables
while they trained for the department's mounted park patrol. The
death of the horses leaves the department with eight for the
mounted park patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just very sorry that we lost two fine horses,'' said
parks Commissioners Henry J. Stern
</P>
<P>
   Two of the surviving horses were taken to the Brooklyn Mounted
Police Troop E Headquarters in Brighton Beach, where they were
being treated by a private veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Facciolo said she was keeping her pony, Dino, who was badly
burned in the fire, in her backyard, a few blocks from the stable.

 &HT;    ASSAD'S DEATH LEAVES MIDEAST PEACE IN DOUBT
 &HT;    Ed: Correcting Basher's age to 34 and making population 17.2
million.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM Syrian President Hafez Assad was the last critical
hold out in the long search for peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   While Assad took a hard line, he might have also been the sole
figure in Syria capable of making a deal and staying in power to
ensure it was kept. With his death Saturday, prospects of a wider
deal between Israel and its Arab neighbors were shaken up. But they
were not lost.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, Assad was the last major Arab leader to take the
so-called rejectionist line in his dealings with the Jewish State.
He held that line throughout 30 years in office. And he watched
bitterly as contemporaries such as Egypt's Anwar Sadat, Jordan's
King Hussein and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat all signed
treaties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He scorned them as sell-outs to Arab honor that he had vowed to
protect. In taking that hard line, Assad sought to keep the door
shut between Israel and the rest of the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Middle East has lost the ``Lion of Damascus,'' the
question remains whether it will get a lamb to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate wake of Assad's death, estimations over what
happens next -- and, specifically, whether peace will be easier or
harder to achieve remained divided.
</P>
<P>
   One view is that the peace process, already stalled since
January, will be on hold for months or more while the likely
successor, Assad's 34-year-old son, Bashar, consolidates power.
</P>
<P>
   A contrary view is that, while the process might be on hold in
the short run, chances have improved for deal down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The major issue of contention is the Golan Heights. Israel
captured the strategic plateau in 1967. Assad, who headed the
Syrian Air Force at the time, took responsibility for the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Several times since 1990, he had sent envoys to engage in peace
talks in Madrid and Washington, only to later arrange for them out.
to walk out. A succession of high-level U.S. diplomats came to his
palace, which overlooks the capital, vainly seeking to nudge the
process along.
</P>
<P>
   The last round Israel broke off in January, with Syrian
officials saying that they needed more guarantees that Israel would
ultimately relinquish the entire plateau.
</P>
<P>
   A peace treaty with Syria could open up the Arab world at large
to normal diplomatic and economic ties with Israel. It also could
end any real threat to Middle East stability since the
Palestinians, whatever their stance, lack anywhere near the
military might of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has made peace a keystone of his foreign
policy, a goal he hopes to achieve before leaving office next
January. But Clinton, as his predecessor, had to cope with Assad's
unbending determination to recover every inch of the land lost --
in return at best for a only ``cold'' peace with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Assad knew that any peace with Israel would be tough pill for
Syrians to swallow, many of whom still remain bitter over their
nation's military defeats at Israel's hand in 1967 and 1973.
</P>
<P>
   No newcomer, one argument goes, can take the risk of forcing
upon his people a controversial peace with the historic archenemy.
</P>
<P>
   As the virtual certain newcomer, Basher, had focused his
attention on becoming an ophthalmologist until his older brother's
death in a 1994 car crash.
</P>
<P>
   Potential rivals for power include his uncle, Rifaat(cq) Assad,
a free-wheeling businessman who lives in Europe. Opposition could
also coalesce around the Sunni Moslems majority, who has rebelled
unsuccessfully against the regime in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he does survive politically, Bashar remains largely an
unknown. He was to receive his first official position in the
government next week.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from touting the Internet and a campaign against
corruption, his positions on external issues have closely tracked
his father's views.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar may face rivals, if not immediately, then after he's in
the job long enough to get some of the blame for Syria's economic
stagnation. Some Syrians see him as too inexperienced. Others are
tired of rule by the Alawites, who comprise only about 12 percent
of the country's 17.2 million people.
</P>
<P>
   he Assad family is from the minority of Alawites, a branch of
Islam within Sunni Muslim majority. Their power rests delicately
and could be upset by a controversial bargain with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will Bashar be strong enough to make a dramatic step,
especially and external one? I doubt it,'' said Glenn Robinson,
associate professor of Middle Eastern studies at the Naval
Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Some more optimistic views, however, were being voiced here.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's main television channels broke into their regular
coverage Saturday night with video footage from the Damascus of the
Syrian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculated that Bashar might be easier to deal with than
his father, who had to carry the bruises from military defeats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assad wasn't ready all these years to make peace with us. He
tried to prove that he would get more than Sadat,'' said Israeli
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin. ``The new leadership comes into
power without that historical burden.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near future, the chances of our renewing peace talks
with Syria are slim,'' said Israel cabinet minister Haim Ramon.
``When, the peace talks do resume the chances of success are
greater.''

   MICROSOFT-FUTURE _ WASHINGTON _ Far from breaking up as a
federal court has ordered, Microsoft is preparing to roll out
``Next Generation Window Services'' that would make the company
more integrated and far-reaching than ever. The plan calls for
tight integration of the computer operating system and a Web
browser that would let people use a number of devices _ including
PCs, handheld computers and Web-enabled telephones _ to access
application programs and data stored on Internet servers. The plan,
often called a blueprint for Microsoft's future, seems incompatible
with the antitrust regulators' vision. (Glass, Cox News Service).

more H-1B visas _ are stuck in Congress with uncertain prospects of

Her family has no bathroom and they sleep in a hut that's a virtual

Peralta's life has been so harsh she wants to finally vote for an
opposition candidate in Mexico's July 2 presidential election. But
she's frightened that her vote might cost her the $45 a month
supplement she receives from Progresa, a federal welfare program
here. Although it is illegal, Peralta's welfare coordinator
confirms that she has been under pressure to instruct Progresa
recipients to vote for Mexico's ruling party on July 2 _ or suffer
the consequences. Other impoverished Mazahua Indians in this rugged

SOUTH AFRICA IN QUANDARY: SHOULD GAYS DONATE BLOOD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite lede.)  
 By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Endowed with a bill of rights that
is one of the world's most expansive and beset by an AIDS crisis
that is one of world's worst, South Africa finds itself trying to
reconcile the two in the face of a challenge to its practice of
disqualifying gay men from giving blood.
</P>
<P>
   The South African Human Rights Commission has concluded that
under the country's liberal, 4-year-old Constitution, men who have
sex with other men cannot for that reason alone be disqualified as
blood donors, as they are here and in most countries, including the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's blood banks have so far refused to abide by the
commission's opinion, and the two sides are searching for a
compromise. But if they cannot find some common ground, the matter
could end up in court, pitting the constitutional freedoms that
many here died struggling for against the epidemic that so many
here are now dying from.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, which has a population estimated at about 44
million, the rate of new infections is among the highest on the
continent, and the spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is
perhaps the most serious threat to the country's future.
</P>
<P>
   A safe blood supply is essential to containing the crisis, and
for the people who run the blood banks that responsibility can mean
hard decisions and hurt feelings. Understanding as they say they
are of the pain their policies can cause, they make no apologies
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to maintain the safety of the blood supply, and
worldwide there are certain risk factors that would compromise that
safety,'' said Anthon Heyns, medical director of the South African
Blood Transfusion Service, which is based here and is the largest
of the country's six blood banks, supplying about 60 percent of the
nation's blood.
</P>
<P>
   One of those risk factors is male-to-male sex, according to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the blood supply
in the United States and helps set the standards used in much of
the world. Others include using intravenous drugs, having sex with
prostitutes and traveling in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the risk factors, however, have drawn the kind of
impassioned criticism that has periodically surfaced toward the ban
on men who have had sex with other men.
</P>
<P>
   For activists, the case will be an important test of the
Constitution, which is unequivocal in its protection of the civil
rights of gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an infringement on gay men's rights, and what's the worth
of the Constitution if people's rights are not being protected,''
said Carrie Shelver, director of the National Coalition for Gay and
Lesbian Equality, an umbrella organization of about 50 groups
around the country. ``It's really based on stereotypes, and the
stereotype is that gay men are promiscuous.''
</P>
<P>
   The case here began almost a year ago after a gay man filed a
complaint with the Human Rights Commission alleging discrimination
on the part of the Cape Town blood bank that rejected him because
he said he had sex with another man at least once in the previous
five years.
</P>
<P>
   After studying the matter for several months, the commission
handed down its opinion earlier this year, saying blood banks could
not exclude men who have sex with other men from giving blood. Such
men, the commission said, are no more of a risk to a safe blood
supply than any number of other groups for whom there are no such
restrictions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think the Human Rights Commission is spot on,'' said Udo
Schuklenk, the director of the bioethics program at the University
of the Witwatersrand here and the co-editor of the magazine
Bioethics. ``The problem is, you're discriminating against people.
Equal risk is being treated unequally.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuklenk says the questions asked of prospective donors need to
be more specific about their sexual practices _ for instance,
whether the sex was unprotected by a condom _ in order to discern
the risk to the blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the current restrictions say that even that is not
enough. ``We cast a wide safety net, and inevitably with a safety
net you are going to unfortunately pull in people who would
otherwise be safe donors,'' said Dr. Arthur Bird, medical director
of the Western Province Blood Transfusion Service in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has said that it would like to see a study done
on the prevalence of HIV among gay men here to see if South Africa
is indeed justified in following the guidelines laid down by public
health authorities in the United States and other countries where
the infection patterns have shown marked difference.

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Down a narrow lane near the western outskirts of
this city, wood-framed country houses and arching trees impart a
rural feel, giving no hint that nearby is a place where a special
kind of intellectual intensity rules the day.
</P>
<P>
   But past a park can be seen the functional beige buildings of
Ner Israel Rabbinical College, where the study hall reverberates
with the voices of scores of young Orthodox Jewish men, debating
one-on-one, across tables stacked high with books of Jewish law and
tradition. It is an activity that occupies students here morning,
afternoon and evening, Sundays through Fridays, before the start of
the Jewish sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is not how much ground you cover,'' explained Isaac
Greenberg, 21, a pile of well-thumbed texts at his elbow, ``but how
you understand it and how you incorporate it in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a scene was a staple of Eastern European Jewish life a
century ago, when yeshivas _ traditional academies for the study of
Judaism's authoritative texts _ flourished. But rather than merely
reflecting the past, what is happening here is part of a growing
trend within Orthodox Judaism's most rigorously traditional sector.
</P>
<P>
   The number of collegiate and graduate students pursuing
religious studies in these all-male institutions ``has probably
almost doubled'' since 1980, to about 18,000 nationwide, writes
William Helmreich in a new edition of his book ``The World of the
Yeshiva,'' from Ktav Publishing House, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Helmreich, who teaches sociology at City College of New York and
the City University Graduate Center, said in an interview that the
growth is primarily because of a high birthrate among the adherents
of Orthodox Judaism, and greater economic prosperity that allows
them to provide more financial support to these institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews account for about 7 percent of the nation's 5.5
million Jews, but within that area of Judaism, a shift has been
occurring. As yeshiva enrollments have grown, so too has the
religious influence of the right wing _ at the expense of
Orthodoxy's once-dominant modern wing, which holds that Jews can be
fully observant and highly involved in wider American society.
</P>
<P>
   While modern Orthodox young people have become doctors, lawyers
and other white-collar professionals, sociologists like Helmreich
say, the right wing has been turning out a high number of rabbis
and religious school teachers, who in turn help shape the religious
lives of many in Orthodoxy's next generation.
</P>
<P>
   At Ner Israel, many people see growth around them.
</P>
<P>
   Yaakov Feinstein, 26, of New York City, a student of Talmudic
law, said he has seen the college add a dormitory and faculty
housing during the past dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more than Ner Israel, I think the total community
is growing,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the college, he said, ``We're really here to be
God-fearing Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Ner Israel was founded in Baltimore in 1933 by Rabbi Jacob
Ruderman, a Lithuanian immigrant, who began with 15 students. Now,
800 boys and young men attend the high school, collegiate and
graduate programs. The college's enrollment has grown by 50 percent
since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Among yeshivas, Ner Israel is unusual in that it has always
allowed students access to secular, professional education. The
college is accredited by the state of Maryland and has agreements
with public and private universities at which its students can
major in law, business and other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The roster of recent alumni includes bankers, accountants and
psychologists _ as well as rabbis and religious school teachers,
who college officials say make up 50 percent of graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Ner Israel's mission statement makes clear that its priority is
religious studies. Students pursuing secular degrees are asked to
limit their work to nights or summer. The college's purpose, the
statement says, is to preserve ``a rarified environment'' for
dedication to ``intense Torah study.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of that study is chavrusa, students working in
pairs, each young man selecting a partner based on intellectual and
social compatibility. In the daily debate over religious texts lies
educational growth, college officials say.
</P>
<P>
   How long do they spend in this kind of study? ``I'd say you've
got to figure eight hours a day, at least on average,'' said Rabbi
Ezra Neuberger, dean of the graduate school. ``The more diligent
would be a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the hill from the academic buildings is a residential area
called Yeshiva Lane, where modestly dressed women with head
coverings supervise flocks of children outside the six-bedroom town
houses and three-bedroom apartments, built for faculty and graduate
students.
</P>
<P>
   The sight suggests a self-contained community, but the college
has built ties to Orthodox Jews worldwide. Since the revolution in
Iran two decades ago, it has taken in Iranian Jewish refugees.
Nearly 50 study here now, said one of their rabbis, who asked not
to be named out of concern for relatives in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But there are others from overseas, too. ``There are a lot of
South Americans here, a lot of Europeans, a lot of Australians,''
said Rafael Mael, 20, of Baltimore. ``I've roomed with people from
Chile and Panama.''
</P>
<P>
   A person who has helped foster ties to Latin American
communities is Moshe Filler, 34, who came from Mexico City and
enrolled in Ner Israel to study as a teacher some years ago. Now he
runs programs that bring young Latin American Jews to study for the
summer on campus, while maintaining the college's links with Jewish
communities in Bolivia, Costa Rica, Peru and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become like a center for all these communities,''
Filler said.
</P>
<P>
   His job involves considerable travel. ``Last week I was in
Chile,'' he said. ``Today, I go to Guatemala.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuition at Ner Israel is $9,000 a year, but only a minority of
students pay full cost. The college considers its applicants first,
then finds out if those it accepts can pay, said Rabbi Herman N.
Neuberger, the president. ``We feel we do make a contribution to
the spiritual life of America through training of our young men,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many students have come here from Orthodox day schools. But some
have taken a different route.
</P>
<P>
   Among the latter is Gil Neuman, 31, who arrived last October
after two years' study in Israel. Before that, he worked in
Hollywood, producing and writing films.
</P>
<P>
   But his life changed one Friday evening when he attended a
Sabbath dinner at the home of a Ner Israel graduate, where, he
said, he was deeply impressed with the religious lives of those he
met.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had a sense of purpose and a sense of meaning that
nobody has in today's world,'' Neuman said.

RACIAL BIAS FOUND IN SIX MORE CAPITAL CASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change Tuesday to Monday in 2nd graf.)  
(See also TEXAS-DEATHROW-LAWYER) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Less than a week after the U.S. Supreme Court vacated
the death sentence of a Texas inmate because of racially biased
testimony in his case, the state attorney general announced that
six other convicted killers are likely to have their death
sentences overturned for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   A two-month investigation by Attorney General John Cornyn
focused on capital cases involving Walter Quijano, a clinical
psychologist who has often served as an expert witness for
prosecutors across Texas in sentencing hearings. On Monday, the
Supreme Court unanimously vacated the death sentence of a convicted
murderer, Victor Saldano, because Quijano had testified that race
could be considered a factor in determining whether Saldano should
receive the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Cornyn announced that Quijano had provided similar,
racially charged expert testimony in six other cases of inmates now
on death row. Cornyn's staff has notified defense lawyers
representing the six inmates that his office will not object if
they seek to overturn the death sentences based on Quijano's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Texas want and deserve a system that affords the
same fairness to everyone,'' Cornyn said in a statement released
via e-mail late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This new development does not mean that these inmates will be
set free. In fact, Cornyn asked the Supreme Court to vacate
Saldano's death sentence so that he could hold a new sentencing
hearing ``in which race is not considered.'' Under Texas law, a
jury must consider whether a defendant could be ``a continuing
threat to society'' when deciding the death penalty. In the case of
Saldano, who is an Argentine national, Quijano advised jurors that
the defendant could be considered more dangerous based on the fact
that Hispanics were ``over-represented'' in prisons.
</P>
<P>
   In his review, Cornyn found eight capital cases involving
Quijano but only six involved racially charged testimony. Cornyn
also said his staff had reviewed the files of the 218 inmates
executed in Texas since 1982 and found that none of those
executions were based on ``this kind of testimony by Dr. Quijano.''
His statement did not say whether other experts might have provided
such testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The six death row inmates whose sentences will likely be
overturned are convicted murderers: John Alba, Carl Henry Blue,
Eugene Alvin Broxton, Duane Buck, Gustavo Julian Garcia and Michael
Dean Gonzales.

 &HT;    ASSAD'S DEATH LEAVES MIDEAST PEACE IN DOUBT
 &HT;    Ed: Deletes dateline. This story should run without a dateline
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Syrian President Hafez Assad was the last critical hold out in
the long search for peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   While Assad took a hard line, he might have also been the sole
figure in Syria capable of making a deal and staying in power to
ensure it was kept. With his death Saturday, prospects of a wider
deal between Israel and its Arab neighbors were shaken up. But they
were not lost.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, Assad was the last major Arab leader to take the
so-called rejectionist line in his dealings with the Jewish State.
He held that line throughout 30 years in office. And he watched
bitterly as contemporaries such as Egypt's Anwar Sadat, Jordan's
King Hussein and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat all signed
treaties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He scorned them as sell-outs to Arab honor that he had vowed to
protect. In taking that hard line, Assad sought to keep the door
shut between Israel and the rest of the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Middle East has lost the ``Lion of Damascus,'' the
question remains whether it will get a lamb to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate wake of Assad's death, estimations over what
happens next -- and, specifically, whether peace will be easier or
harder to achieve remained divided.
</P>
<P>
   One view is that the peace process, already stalled since
January, will be on hold for months or more while the likely
successor, Assad's 34-year-old son, Bashar, consolidates power.
</P>
<P>
   A contrary view is that, while the process might be on hold in
the short run, chances have improved for deal down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The major issue of contention is the Golan Heights. Israel
captured the strategic plateau in 1967. Assad, who headed the
Syrian Air Force at the time, took responsibility for the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Several times since 1990, he had sent envoys to engage in peace
talks in Madrid and Washington, only to later arrange for them out.
to walk out. A succession of high-level U.S. diplomats came to his
palace, which overlooks the capital, vainly seeking to nudge the
process along.
</P>
<P>
   The last round Israel broke off in January, with Syrian
officials saying that they needed more guarantees that Israel would
ultimately relinquish the entire plateau.
</P>
<P>
   A peace treaty with Syria could open up the Arab world at large
to normal diplomatic and economic ties with Israel. It also could
end any real threat to Middle East stability since the
Palestinians, whatever their stance, lack anywhere near the
military might of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has made peace a keystone of his foreign
policy, a goal he hopes to achieve before leaving office next
January. But Clinton, as his predecessor, had to cope with Assad's
unbending determination to recover every inch of the land lost --
in return at best for a only ``cold'' peace with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Assad knew that any peace with Israel would be tough pill for
Syrians to swallow, many of whom still remain bitter over their
nation's military defeats at Israel's hand in 1967 and 1973.
</P>
<P>
   No newcomer, one argument goes, can take the risk of forcing
upon his people a controversial peace with the historic archenemy.
</P>
<P>
   As the virtual certain newcomer, Basher, had focused his
attention on becoming an ophthalmologist until his older brother's
death in a 1994 car crash.
</P>
<P>
   Potential rivals for power include his uncle, Rifaat(cq) Assad,
a free-wheeling businessman who lives in Europe. Opposition could
also coalesce around the Sunni Moslems majority, who has rebelled
unsuccessfully against the regime in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he does survive politically, Bashar remains largely an
unknown. He was to receive his first official position in the
government next week.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from touting the Internet and a campaign against
corruption, his positions on external issues have closely tracked
his father's views.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar may face rivals, if not immediately, then after he's in
the job long enough to get some of the blame for Syria's economic
stagnation. Some Syrians see him as too inexperienced. Others are
tired of rule by the Alawites, who comprise only about 12 percent
of the country's 17.2 million people.
</P>
<P>
   he Assad family is from the minority of Alawites, a branch of
Islam within Sunni Muslim majority. Their power rests delicately
and could be upset by a controversial bargain with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will Bashar be strong enough to make a dramatic step,
especially and external one? I doubt it,'' said Glenn Robinson,
associate professor of Middle Eastern studies at the Naval
Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Some more optimistic views, however, were being voiced here.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's main television channels broke into their regular
coverage Saturday night with video footage from the Damascus of the
Syrian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculated that Bashar might be easier to deal with than
his father, who had to carry the bruises from military defeats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assad wasn't ready all these years to make peace with us. He
tried to prove that he would get more than Sadat,'' said Israeli
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin. ``The new leadership comes into
power without that historical burden.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near future, the chances of our renewing peace talks
with Syria are slim,'' said Israel cabinet minister Haim Ramon.
``When, the peace talks do resume the chances of success are
greater.''

CLEAR THE PATH: LOROUPE SIZZLES IN MINI MARATHON 
</HEADLINE>
   By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the 1-mile mark of the New York Mini Marathon
Saturday, the official race truck ordered the police motorcycle
escort and the vehicle carrying the news media to speed it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're catching up,'' the driver barked over the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   He should have said she's catching up.
</P>
<P>
   Tegla Loroupe, the Kenyan waif, was about 100 yards ahead of a
pack and gaining on the truck of the New York Road Runners Club,
the race's sponsor. Fading behind was an elite group: fellow
Kenyan, Catherine Ndereba, winner of the 2000 Boston Marathon;
Adriana Fernandez, the reigning New York Marathon champion; and
Ethiopia's Fatuma Roba, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist in the
marathon.
</P>
<P>
   It was a one-woman race with Loroupe setting a record pace of 4
minutes 58 seconds through the first mile and running the second
fastest 5-mile pace on the 6.2 mile course in Central Park to win
her fifth Mini Marathon title in a time of 31:37. It was the
fifth-fastest time in the 29-year history of the women's-only race.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the Olympic-caliber field was ready, willing or able
to match Loroupe's quick, easy stride. Ndereba finished second in
of 32:22 _ 45 seconds behind _ and Roba crossed the finish line in
32:25 for third place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Tegla has good speed and likes her own place, so I was
looking to go as fast as she was going and that's why I became No.
2,'' Ndereba said. ``I tried to beat myself and stay close to
Tegla.''
</P>
<P>
   And to think Loroupe, who was running with a headache brought on
by the 78-degree temperature at the 9 a.m. start of the race, said
she actually tried to slow the pace because she didn't want to
``take advantage'' of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to run because I knew the weather was going to be
a factor and I had a headache,'' Loroupe said. ``I was feeling
good, however. When I'm feeling good I don't want to take advantage
of my colleagues. So when you're in a good field, I always try to
support one another and not run against.''
</P>
<P>
   Once she took the lead, Loroupe said she knew the race was hers
to win after 3 kilometers because the crowd lining the route was
shouting that she was about 20 meters ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fans were shouting all the way, so I had a little
strength,'' said Loroupe, who was joined by her younger sister,
Emily, who finished 20th. Another sister, Gladys, 18, was watching
from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Anne-Marie Lauck of Milton, N.J., a 1994 winner of the Mini
Marathon, finished ninth in 34:11. Lauck said she ran a bad race
and was frustrated by her results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really miffed,'' said Lauck, who plans to the compete in
the 10,000-meter Olympic trials next month. ``I felt very fatigued
and had problems breathing. I have to go back to the drawing
board.''
</P>
<P>
   But others in the field, considered one of the fastest ever
assembled, were encouraged by their performances. Ndereba said her
finish bodes well for her chances of making the Kenyan Olympic team
in the 10,000 meters. The trials will be held next month. Roba,
already a member of the Ethiopian women's Olympic marathon team,
said the race showed she has ``good speed for the marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez appeared to labor on the hilly stretches of the
course, but still managed to cross the finish line in fifth place
in 32:44.

YANKEES COME BACK TO HAMMER THE METS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball managers warn their players constantly that they must
be consistent in their approach, that they cannot turn on and turn
off their effort and expect to succeed. But Yankees Manager Joe
Torre cannot say this. His players have responded in almost every
pressure game the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the possibility of losing the first two games of
their interleague series with the Mets, the Yankees fell behind
Saturday before obliterating the Mets' starting pitcher, Bobby J.
Jones, and the relievers who followed, 13-5.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill and Derek Jeter each had three hits, each slugging
a home run, and Jorge Posada broke a fifth-inning tie with a
three-run homer. Andy Pettitte (6-2) was ordinary, struggling
early, but was good enough to beat Jones (1-3).
</P>
<P>
   The third and final game of this series will be placed Sunday
night, with the Yankees' David Cone _ who has not won a decision
since April _ pitching against the Mets' Mike Hampton (6-5).
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner _ who did not
attend Saturday's game, after leaving Yankee Stadium in the middle
of Friday's wipeout _ is not a patient man, and if the Yankees had
lost Saturday, it might have only served to heighten his team's
interest in a superstar outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and the Mets have had cursory trade talks with the
Chicago Cubs about outfielder Sammy Sosa. Cubs scouts are combing
the Yankees' farm system, preparing for the possibility they may
decide to deal Sosa and ask the Yankees for a ransom in talent,
such as the top prospect Alfonso Soriano, the Class AA outfielder
Jackson Melian and others.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa would not be a perfect fit for the Yankees, being a
right-handed free swinger who strikes out a lot, and he is
expensive. His salary would make him their fourth player earning
$10 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   But he is hugely popular and a productive slugger, and the Mets
and the Yankees will pursue him, if he becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get in on everything to find out what the price
is,'' said Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte's favorite player in baseball is Roger Clemens.
Pettitte lives in Texas, near Clemens. In the off-season, he drives
20 minutes daily to work out at Clemens' house. He follows Clemens
in the rotation. He follows Clemens in performance, it would seem.
</P>
<P>
   They pitched back-to-back for the first time May 12-13, and both
allowed 10 hits and six runs in four and two-thirds innings. They
both pitched complete games May 28-29. Clemens allowed six runs in
five innings on June 3, Pettitte six runs in six innings the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   Their improbable parallel lives continued this weekend. Clemens
threw 30 pitches in the first inning on Friday; Pettitte labored
and threw 33 pitches in the first inning Saturday. Clemens allowed
a grand slam to Mike Piazza in the third inning on Friday night,
the Mets taking a lead, and in the third inning Saturday, Robin
Ventura bashed a two-run homer to push the Mets in front, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clemens-Pettitte symbiosis was broken in the bottom of
the third inning, for one very simple reason: whereas Al Leiter
stifled the Yankees as the Mets trounced Clemens on Friday, the
Yankees overcame Pettitte's mistakes by bashing Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was an All-Star in 1997 because he had extraordinary
control of his fastball and changeup. But he has had shoulder
surgery since then and his command is ordinary, leaving him
vulnerable. The Yankees' batters were taking monstrous hacks at him
right away, as if they were in a home run-hitting contest. O'Neill
swung hard in the first inning, and when he realized he had lifted
a harmless fly to right, he pirouetted to his left, angry with
himself, feeling as if he should have hammered the ball.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mets leading, 3-2, in the bottom of the third, Jones
fell behind O'Neill, three balls and no strikes, tried flipping a
fastball over the plate and O'Neill destroyed it. Center fielder
Jay Payton retreated to the fence and created some drama, but
O'Neill was jogging, knowing he had just tied the game with his
seventh homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored twice in the fifth, Todd Zeile ripping an R.B.I.
double in the middle of the inning and then scoring on Payton's
run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte seemed to be barely hanging on, his pitch count
mounting on the hot and muggy afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But there were always more runs to get against Jones, though he
nearly got through the fifth inning that would have qualified him
for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had a runner at first and one out and Jeter took a
called third strike. But O'Neill laced a double into the gap in
right-center field, with Ricky Ledee circling the bases. Bernie
Williams ripped a single to left, O'Neill challenging the poor
throwing arm of Jason Tyner and scoring the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Mahomes was warming up in the bullpen; Jones remained in the
game, wounded, at the mercy of the hitters.
</P>
<P>
   With the count no balls and two strikes on Tino Martinez,
Williams broke from first and shortstop Kurt Abbott rushed over to
cover second _ and Martinez lined the ball just to Abbott's right,
and with his momentum carrying him toward second, Abbott could only
get the tip of his glove on Martinez's hit. First and second, two
out.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' pitching coach, Dave Wallace, emerged from the dugout,
and when Jones saw him, the pitcher's body rippled with a curse.
Jones walked off, looking over his right shoulder to see who would
replace him.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mahomes, a right-hander who ran the count to 3-2 on
Posada, until he relented and threw a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Posada murders most fastballs. He murdered this fastball,
driving it about six rows into the upper deck, a homer worth three
runs. To Yankees fans among the 55,839 at Yankee Stadium, the
natural order of the world had been restored.
</P>
<P>
   The rest was just overkill: Jeter homered in the sixth inning.
The Yankees added four more runs in the seventh. &QL;

SPORTS COMMENTARY: SAMMY SOSA? METS YES, YANKEES NO 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the middle of the Yankees-Mets interborough
weekend, Sammy Sosa's name blew in from Chicago to intrude on
conversations for at least a New York minute.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old right fielder, who hit 66 and 63 homers the last
two seasons and has hit 19 so far this season, would prefer to
finish his career in Chicago, but if he and the Cubs cannot get
together on a multiyear contract for more than his current $10
million salary, he may be auctioned sooner or later to the highest
bidder.
</P>
<P>
   That highest bidder could be the Mets; it probably would not be
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Neither New York club would comment officially Saturday on
Sosa's possible availability, to avert any tampering complaints,
but Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said the idea of a
big deal before the July 31 trade deadline did not scare his team's
front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get in on everything and find out what the price
is,'' Phillips said, sitting in the Mets' dugout before their 13-5
loss Saturday at Yankee Stadium. ``If we want to make a big deal,
I'm confident we could make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips acknowledged the ``uncertainty'' in the Mets' outfield,
which Sosa's presence would surely ease. Sosa would also give the
Mets another power hitter in the middle of their batting order,
either in front of or behind their cleanup hitter, Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   During their desperate quest in recent years for a National
League pennant and a real subway series with the Yankees, the Mets'
owners have been willing to pay top dollar for a top performer, as
they have for Piazza, Robin Ventura, Al Leiter and Mike Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, again in second place in the National League East
behind the Atlanta Braves, need Sosa much more than the Yankees do
in their duel with the Boston Red Sox for first place in the
American League East.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of Sosa's recent headlines in Chicago over his next
contract and his edgy relationship with Don Baylor, the Cubs' new
manager, George Steinbrenner has asked some of his advisers whether
Sosa would be worth the Cubs' stiff price and another $10 million
to the Yankees' payroll.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of Steinbrenner's confidants has suggested that
Sosa is not what the Yankees need because he strikes out too often.
With both David Cone and Roger Clemens struggling, the Yankees'
primary need is a premier pitcher, not a slugger who swings and
misses unless he hits a homer.
</P>
<P>
   As the most popular Cub since Ernie Banks, Sosa has often said
that he wants to be a ``Cub for life, like Ernie was,'' even if
that Hall of Fame slugger never played in a World Series. The Cubs
have not been in a World Series since 1945; they have not won a
World Series since 1908.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa also wants to know why the Cubs, who are always rebuilding,
don't seem to want to rebuild around him and his big bat.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago cynics contend that executives of The Tribune Co., which
owns the Cubs, have fostered the Sosa controversies over his next
contract and his relationship with Baylor to grease the skids to
his eventual departure. His contract expires after the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor apparently annoyed Sosa with a spring training comment
that the right fielder had deficiencies defensively. That
assessment is true, as any major league scout would tell you, but
that line did not endear the new manager to the slugger who is
cherished as this era's Cub.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has also mentioned that if the Cubs are smart, they will
sign him to a contract extension before Alex Rodriguez, the Seattle
Mariners' shortstop, goes on the free-agent market after the World
Series. Rodriguez is expected to lift baseball's top market price
to at least $20 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   But since the free-agent era began, teams that have waited to
sign their premier players have almost always paid many more
millions than they would have if they had signed that player before
he went on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, that could be the very reason the Cubs are
apparently not willing to sign Sosa now. The longer the Cubs wait,
the more they can argue that they just can't afford Sosa's price,
whatever it might be.
</P>
<P>
   After all, even with Sosa, the Cubs, with a 25-37 record after
yesterday's 4-3 loss to the White Sox, are on another treadmill to
oblivion, in fourth place in the NL Central. They wouldn't be much
worse without him.
</P>
<P>
   So for all his home runs, for all his kisses to the Wrigley
Field fans, Sammy Sosa might be changing uniforms. If that happens
before the July 31 deadline, look for the Mets to explore whatever
it would take to put him in right field at Shea Stadium. And maybe
even get him. &QL;

CLINTON ADVISES GRADUATES A FINAL TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHFIELD, Minn. _ Ask not what you can do for your country.
Listen to what your country's leader has done for you.
</P>
<P>
   In his 23d and final commencement address as president, Bill
Clinton made his own accomplishments the theme of his speech to the
423 graduates and about 7,000 other spectators who endured long
lines, metal detectors, and a brief but drenching rainstorm to hear
Clinton speak Saturday at Carleton College.
</P>
<P>
   The president included inspirational remarks to the assembled
degree recipients, urging them to help end child poverty, to ``put
a human face on the global economy,'' and to encourage racial
harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the dais in the muggy weather, the president stood
and shook the hand of every graduate of what he called ``this
remarkably diverse'' class.
</P>
<P>
   But the bulk of Clinton's remarks focused on his
administration's record, particularly in education.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reiterated, as he has often done in the last year of his
presidency, that the nation is in an era of unprecedented
prosperity, with the welfare rolls and the crime rate lower than
they have been in decades.
</P>
<P>
   He reminded listeners that Saturday was the one-year anniversary
of the day the Yugoslav government agreed to NATO's demands, ending
the war in Kosovo, which Clinton said ``reversed the tide of ethnic
cleansing in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of that,'' Clinton said. ``But it showed that
it's a very different world,'' one characterized by globalization
and exploding technological development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked very hard to prepare this country for the 21st
century, and now it belongs to you. It's up to you to decide what
to do with it,'' he told the graduates.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton was sitting on the dais waiting to deliver his
speech, he was handed a note confirming the death of Syrian
President Hafez Assad. But Clinton did not mention Assad during the
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The president spent much of his address recounting the specifics
of education programs, especially higher education aid and loan
initiatives, forged by his administration.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Hope scholarships'' to tax-free education investment
accounts, Clinton said the administration has done much to help
students and their parents deal with the escalating cost of the
ever-more critical higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every American needs more than a high school education. It
means a college education is no longer a luxury,'' Clinton told the
group. ``Unless we can more generally spread the benfits of
education, your generation will not be able to build the future of
your dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country cannot afford to leave any students behind simply
because they cannot afford to pay for college,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Representative Bill Goodling, a Pennsylvania
Republican who heads the House education committee, said he was
disappointed that Clinton would use a commencement speech to
advance a ``misguided political agenda.'' Goodling said the Direct
Student Loan program, for example, had many administrative problems
the president did not mention.
</P>
<P>
   The White House took the occasion of the graduation to release a
self-generated report card on its educational accomplishments, in
the form of a US Department of Education report called ``Expanding
College Opportunity: More Access, Greater Achievement, Higher
Expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   College enrollment is up, the report said, with 66 percent of
1998 high school graduates enrolling in college, compared with 60
percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Further, while college costs have quadrupled in the last two
years, the financial rewards are clear, Clinton said. College
graduates today can expect to earn $600,000 more over a lifetime
than high school graduates; women will earn about twice as much
with a college degree than without one.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reminded the graduating class that he ``came from a
family where nobody had ever gone to college before, but from the
time I was a little boy, I never had any doubt I was going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am well aware, if it hadn't been for that chance I had a
long time ago to go to school, I wouldn't be here today,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   As the students and their families filed off to celebrate the
graduations, Clinton was flown by helicopter 45 miles back to
Minneapolis, where he spent an afternoon raising an estimated
$500,000 for his party.
</P>
<P>
   The president's appearance at a Democratic National Committee
lunch was expected to raise a minimum of $200,000. A later address
to the New Leadership Network and Minnesota Democratic Farmer Labor
Party at a popular music club _ where the Minnesota ban Soul Asylum
played _ was expected to raise at least $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the president used his weekly radio address
to announce regulations that allow states to provide paid leave
after the birth or adoption of a child. He also announced a
regulation, effective June 20, that allows federal employees to use
up to 12 weeks of sick leave to care for a seriously ill family
member.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks recorded Friday, Clinton said he sought the changes
because many workers cannot afford to take time off without pay, as
stipulated under the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen states, including Massachusetts, are considering
legislation to provide paid leave through means such as
unemployment insurance, and the president said he hopes more states
will join them.
</P>
<P>
   Such assistance is strongly supported by labor and women's
groups in Massachusetts, though state officials are wary of dipping
into the $1.9 billion unemployment insurance fund, and businesses
fear an increase in labor costs.

 &HT;    Earnhardt on a roll again
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ His seven Winston Cup championships aside,
racing possibly has never have been more fun for Dale Earnhardt
than it is right now.
</P>
<P>
   The good times have been rolling this weekend. Saturday, he
finished third in the IROC race at Michigan Speedway and now needs
just a fifth-place finish in the fourth IROC race at Indy to repeat
as the series champ.
</P>
<P>
   Then he got on top of a hauler and helped oldest son Kerry to a
third place finish in the Flagstar 200 ARCA race. ``Dad was more
like a coach; he tells me how to get in the corner and what line to
take,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Earnhardt starts ninth in the Kmart 400 while son, Dale
Jr., who had the fastest car (181.287 mph) in Saturday's final
practice, starts sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest development, however, may be the sudden appearance
of The Intimidator in the rear-view mirrors of the usual Cup points
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, after 13 races of the 34-race schedule, Earnhardt has
climbed to third in the point standings, 16 points behind
second-place Ward Burton and 98 points behind today's pole-sitter,
Bobby Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt has only one victory this year, at Atlanta on March
12, but he has more top 10 finishes (10) than any other driver. And
he has momentum: six of his top 10s have come in the past seven
races.
</P>
<P>
   This is familiar territory. From 1993 until the end of the 1996
schedule, Earnhardt fell out of the top 5 in points only one time
in 124 events.
</P>
<P>
   He's been here before, so he prefers to ignore the points
standings at this point in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't really looking at the points that much,'' Earnhardt
said. ``You look at it race by race and win by win. If you're
competitive week in and week out, then the points will come. As we
start to approach the halfway mark of the season the points will
become more of an issue. Right now we just want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But crew chief Kevin Hamlin is pretty pumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty neat being right there and having it within your
grasp,'' Hamlin said. ``Last year, we always thought we had it in
our grasp but realistically you knew that it never was. We had to
rely on a lot of other people having trouble. This year, you've
still got to have an awful lot of luck. Everything's got to go just
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin would like to be within 100 points of the lead going into
the last month of the season. Being 100 points ahead in the fall
would be better yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things are going right now, it looks like it will come
down to the last lap of the last race,'' Hamlin said.

ANNA SOSENKO, 90, SONGWRITER AND MANAGER OF THE CABARET STAR
HILDEGARDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ENID NEMY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anna Sosenko, the songwriter who wrote ``Darling, Je
Vous Aime Beaucoup,'' the manager of Hildegarde _ the legendary
cabaret personality who made the song famous _ and the impresario
of stage specials that featured such performers as Mary Martin and
Ethel Merman, died Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Sosenko lived, traveled and collected art with Hildegarde for 23
years, and when their partnership splintered in 1956, Sosenko went
on to produce star-studded theatrical events for the benefit of the
Friends of Theater and Music Collection of the Museum of the City
of New York. She was the force behind tributes celebrating Joshua
Logan, George Abbott, Dorothy Fields and Richard Rodgers and Oscar
Hammerstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do this because it means that once a year I get to work with
champions,'' she told The New York Times in 1979. ``I know more
about stars than anyone. When I produced `The Raleigh Room' on
radio, everybody worked for me. Alan Lerner was my chief writer. I
got Tallulah to sing. Do you know what the great stars were? They
were mysteries. They didn't spill their guts every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday. They had romance and allure. I wish we had
more of that today.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosenko began collecting letters and manuscripts of theatrical
and literary personalities early in her career. As the friend and
colleague of many international celebrities, she was also the
recipient of many such communications and eventually became a
leading dealer in the field. She gave up her small shop near
Lincoln Center some time before her death but continued to deal
privately from her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Sosenko donated a good part of her letter and manuscript
collection to the Library of Lincoln Center for the Performing
Arts, the theater archives of Georgia State University, and Rutgers
University. Her extensive archive of the business transactions of
George and Ira Gershwin was acquired by the Music Division of the
Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Sosenko was born in Camden, N.J., on June 13, 1909, the daughter
of Rebecca and Simon Sosenko. Sosenko's mother ran a restaurant,
and occasionally rented rooms, and that was how the
Hildegarde-Sosenko relationship began. Hildegarde was then
Hildegarde Sell, the daughter of German immigrants who had left her
native Milwaukee and was working as an accompanist to singers of
varying luster. She rented a room from Sosenko's mother, and soon
the young women became fast friends.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the pair made their respective ways to New York _
Hildegarde plugging some of Sosenko's songs (and not so
incidentally some written by Irving Berlin). Over the course of her
career, Sosenko wrote the music and lyrics for more than 15 songs,
among them ``I'll Be Yours,'' ``Ask Your Heart'' and ``Why Don't
They Leave Us Alone?'' and the English lyrics for ``J'attendrai.''
The idea for her most famous song, ``Darling, Je Vous Aime
Beaucoup,'' popped into her head one day, she said, when she and
Hildegarde were cycling in France and got their French and English
mixed up when they stopped to ask for directions.
</P>
<P>
   Sosenko created, packaged, promoted and managed Hildegarde, who
became one of the most celebrated cabaret stars of the 1930s and
'40s. Usually billed as The Incomparable Hildegarde, an orchid
bestowed on her by Walter Winchell, she was booked by Sosenko into
plush hotel cabaret rooms and supper clubs at least 45 weeks a
year. At one engagement in 1946, she was paid $17,500 a week and 50
percent of the gross over $80,000. She was on the cover of Life
magazine in 1939, had a Top 10 radio show and traveled with her own
orchestra and several dozen pieces of luggage. Her recordings of
such songs as ``Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup,'' ``The Last Time I
Saw Paris'' and ``Lili Marlene'' became worldwide hits. Revlon
introduced a Hildegarde shade of lipstick and nail polish, a
nursery named a rose for her, and a linen company, picking up on
the way she signed her autograph, introduced a ``Bless You''
handkerchief.
</P>
<P>
   Hildegarde's admirers ranged from enlisted men and officers
during World War II to King Gustaf of Sweden and the Prince of
Wales, later the Duke of Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Sosenko and Hildegarde were equal partners. They lived in a
10-room apartment in the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan and toured Europe
and America together. The two acquired an impressive art
collection, selected by Sosenko. She bought works by such artists
as Renoir, Manet, Mary Cassatt and Fernand Leger, and a black and
white charcoal study by Grant Wood done for his ``Daughters of the
American Revolution.'' The collection was sold in the mid-1950s at
what was then The Parke-Bernet Galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Sosenko was also a theater archivist and historian who in 1976
mounted an exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York of 75
years of the great stars who appeared on Broadway for the Shuberts
_ Lillian Russell, the Barrymores, Al Jolson, Josephine Baker, the
Marx Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   An intense, gregarious and outspoken woman, Sosenko was known
for her business acumen and did not suffer fools, gladly or
otherwise. She never hesitated to correct or contradict, and such
was the force of her personality that she was rarely challenged
even when, on occasion, she was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Sosenko, who is survived by a brother, Jay Jerome, and a sister,
Ruth Goodman, both of Cherry Hill, N.J., had no false modesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've probably had the biggest people in show business work for
me,'' Sosenko once said, referring to her benefits and the galaxy
of stars she enticed to participate, among them Julie Andrews, Rex
Harrison, Liza Minnelli, Sid Caesar, Natalia Makarova and Douglas
Fairbanks Jr. ``They know when I do a show, it's going to be a
great show because I only do great things,'' she said. ``If they're
not great, I'm not interested.''
</P>
<P>
   But she did have a sense of humor, of sorts. No one knows why
she and Hildegarde parted in the mid-1950s, but they eventually
made up. Two days after she turned 85, Hildegarde was performing at
the Russian Tea Room in 1991 and, of course, offered a rendition of
her 1934 signature song, ``Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup.'' She
observed that it was a song she never grew tired of singing.
Sosenko, who had composed it and was one of many friends and
well-wishers in the audience, brought down the house when she
countered, ``But I'm tired of it.''

One new survey gives Republican Bush a slight edge, 41 percent to
38 percent. The poll, conducted by Princeton Survey Research for
Bloomberg News, surveyed 1,208 adults between May 25 and June 4 and
has a margin of sampling error of 3 percentage points. A CNN-USA

   Both Democrats and Republicans have unveiled party-sponsored Web

last week, contain news articles along with a heavy dose of
promotional political materials. The Republican site, www.GOP.gov,

   Not all of the delegates for the upcoming Republican National
Convention are pleased with their Philadelphia hotel assignments.
Some, like those from Virginia, will stay in the same downtown
hotel as Bush, while Michigan delegates will be stuck in a Holiday
Inn at the edge of town. The Vermont delegation will stay 25 miles
away in Wilmington, Del., during the convention that runs from July
31 to Aug. 3. Convention planners on Friday announced the

   DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION COMMITTEE COURTING CASH
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Gore campaign are coming to the rescue of
the Los Angeles organizers of the Democratic National Convention,
who are $3 million short with two months left until the opening
gavel. President Clinton will hold a fundraising breakfast on June
24 at the home of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican
who has been working hard to raise money for the host committee.
Organizers hope Clinton's appearance will raise up to $6 million.
The host committee, L.A. Convention 2000, had agreed to raise $35
million before the convention opens Aug. 14, and has collected
about $31.5 million.

explained that taking the cash would betray his party's drive for a
minimal government with no national tax, no gun control laws, and
no anti-drug law enforcement programs.

SYRIAN LEADER ASSAD IS DEAD AT 69 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO _ Syria's enigmatic and autocratic leader, Hafez Assad,
died Saturday, leaving behind broken dreams of Arab unity and a
nation that is economically troubled and diplomatically isolated.
He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had grown increasingly frail as a result of diabetes and
heart problems that began with a heart attack in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Through nearly three decades of war and frustrating failures to
reach regional peace, President Assad's exacting and &UR;  &LR; ruthless
style of leadership made him a force in the region and earned him
the nickname, ``The Lion of Damascus.''
</P>
<P>
   But his death _ without seeing the return of the Golan Heights
he lost to Israel 33 years ago _ may lead to a leadership vacuum
and create new strategies among rivals and allies in the Arab
world. An interruption in Syrian force could disrupt neighboring
Lebanon, where Syria has been the de facto power for a decade, and
affect the standoff between Israel and Muslim guerrillas in
southern Lebanon, where Assad had restrained the ambitions of the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last six years, Assad carefully prepared a path for his
untested son, Bashar, to assume power. Just hours after Assad's
death Saturday, Syria's Parliament cleared the way for Bashar's
ascendancy with a nearly unanimous vote to lower the minimum age of
a head of state from 40 to 34, Bashar's age.
</P>
<P>
   Then Parliament ajourned until June 25, when it is expected to
begin the process of naming Assad's successor.
</P>
<P>
   After Syria's state television announced Assad's death, hundreds
of people gathered outside the presidential palace in Damascus,
chanting: ``With our souls, with our blood, we will protect you, O
Bashar!''
</P>
<P>
   For most Syrians, Assad was the only leader they had ever known.
Members of parliament wept. Stores closed, and the red-and-black
national flag was lowered to half-staff.
</P>
<P>
   He will be buried on Tuesday, with Secretary of State Madeleine
K. Albright representing the United States at the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   A new Syrian leader faces grave challenges as the nation comes
to a crossroads in the peace process with neighboring Israel.
Damascus also faces an economic and social stagnation if it does
not open its insular society to technology and globalization.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said it would be premature to speculate on
Syrian changes, adding: ``There will be a period of sorting out,
and the Syrian people will make the decisions and then we'll see
what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Assad, he noted: ``We had our differences, but I always
respected him. . . . He made a strategic choice for peace and we
worked together to achieve that goal. Throughout my contacts with
him, including our last meeting, he made clear Syria's continued
commitment to the path of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to working with Syria to achieve the goal of a
comprehensive peace,'' Clinton added during a visit to Northfield,
Minn., where he delivered the commencement address at Carleton
College.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian President Yasser Arafat declared three days of
mourning in Palestinian-run areas.
</P>
<P>
   Through more than three decades, Assad has insisted that Israel
must return the Golan Heights. Since 1991, Assad conducted
intermittent talks with Israel, remaining adamant about a complete
withdrawal. The talks broke down in January when Syria insisted
that Israel was trying to establish a framework for an agreement
that would not guarantee a complete withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, rumors of his death would periodically
circulate, but there had been no recent indication that his health
had declined sharply. Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said he had
spoken with Assad earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``His last words were: `Our destiny is to build a better future
for our countries' and then there was a silence and I knew
something happened,'' Lahoud said in a letter sent to Bashar and
read on Lebanon's state television.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar, a British-educated ophthalmologist, had this political
destiny thrust upon after his older brother, Bassil, who had long
been groomed for the succession, died in a 1994 car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar has never held office, but had taken on an
anti-corruption campaign in government that is widely popular in
the streets. The campaign deeply shook the aging circle of advisers
and ministers who surrounded his father.
</P>
<P>
   Considered awkward and shy compared to his icy, controlling
father, Bashar has made several official visits to Arab countries
and to France in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Until the end, however, Assad kept control of the difficult
negotiations with Israel. Many analysts felt Assad had
miscalculated again and again in failing to cut a deal for regional
peace with Israel, first in the early 1990s and again this year
when Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak aggressively sought to
strike a peace agreement with Syria and unilaterally ended Israel's
occupation of southern Lebanon. Just last week, Assad's foreign
minister said Syria was again open to peace discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's rule had been dominated by the Arab-Israeli conflict
through the humiliating defeat Arab nations suffered in 1967 and
the less humiliating defeat of 1973. Assad also mired Syria in
Lebanon's vicious 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's grasp on power seemed to depend in part on his ability
to keep enemies and allies guessing, and not being afraid to
reverse a diplomatic course when he saw an advantage in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   He also endured because he was willing to kill. In 1982, Assad
crushed an internal rebellion by ordering the massacre by the
Syrian Army of betwween 10,000 to 20,000 residents of the ancient
city of Hama.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's unpredictably and pragmatism was in display in his
decision to join the US-led coalition in the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
Although bitterly resistent to American intervention in the region
and long critical of Washington's strong support of Israel, Assad
sided with the US forces in ousting Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's
troops from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   For Assad, the decision paid off. He developed close ties to the
West just as Syria's longtime backer, the Soviet Union, was
collapsing. He also reaped financial benefits that included $2
billion from Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The involvement in the Gulf War also led to Assad's surprising
steps toward making peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assad did not want the political order in the Middle East
dominated by Israel,'' Assad's official biographer, Patrick Seale,
told CNN. ``He wanted a balance of power in order to keep the
peace. He felt an imbalance causes war because the stronger partner
always tries to impose his will on the weaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad, part of a military clique that gained power in the 1960s,
became leader in a bloodless coup in 1970. His tight grip on power
has been an extraordinary feat for a man who hails not only from a
peasant background but a minority Alawite Muslim sect in a
predominantly Sunni Muslim state.
</P>
<P>
   Assad often dreamed of a Saladin-like role as the unchallenged
leader of a united Arab front. It was a dream that died hard for
Assad.
</P>
<P>
   His regional ambitions were largely a faiure and often took
precedence over profound domestic concerns which had dragged Syria
into poverty and left his countrymen far behind in the age of
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Assad ruled through fear that emanated from a vast network of
spies, secret police and informers. According to human rights
groups, his government jailed thousands of political prisoners
without trial, and the US State Department regards Syria as
supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Syria still has some 30,000 troops stationed in Lebanon to
maintain its authority. The rationale given for Syrian presence has
long been the need to back up Lebanon while Israel occupied its
``security zone'' in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But Assad's intervention faced new scrutiny after Israel's
withdrawal of forces last month.

RULER'S DEATH FREEZES ISRAEL-SYRIA PEACE TALKS, ANALYSTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like many an iron-fisted ruler, Hafez Assad could
lead his people.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian president's death Saturday left an absence of the
strong leadership in Damascus that many analysts believe was a
necessary ingredient to complete an Israel-Syria peace deal in
President Clinton's last months in office.
</P>
<P>
   With Assad gone, most see the peace talks as frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Assad's son, Bashar, 34, appeared to be in line as his
successor, Syria faced the prospect of infighting and turmoil that
could easily push aside peace talks for another year or more,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israel-Syria peace process, which resumed earlier this year
only to become stalemated over the new border between the two
countries, faces new political uncertainties in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   There, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's attention is focused on
settling the troubles in his own volatile coalition. If he puts
together a new coalition and avoids early elections, Barak's first
order of business is not likely to be the Syrians, but a summit
sought by the Palestinians that would include Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, Clinton, and Barak himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Assad's death, the Israel-Syria situation was already
on ice anyway,'' said a US official, asking not to be identified.
``If Israel goes to early elections, that's another problem.''
</P>
<P>
   William Quandt, a Middle East scholar at the University of
Virginia who helped negotiate the 1978 Camp David accords between
Israel and Egypt, said Saturday he expected foreign affairs to take
a less prominent role in Damascus for the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks now like things are on hold for a while,'' he said.
``Assad's death throws a lot of new questions in the air. A lot
depends on the succession, and I don't think it's going to be clear
for quite a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Quandt said that Clinton must wish, now that Assad is gone, that
he had tried a little harder at the last summit to ``pin things
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months ago, Clinton met with Assad in Geneva in
hopes of surmounting the last major obstacle to a deal: control of
the Sea of Galilee's eastern shore. But Clinton brought no new
proposal and Assad stuck to his position of gaining back all land
lost to Israel in the 1967 war. Clinton then put the blame on
Assad, saying the next move was his.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts say they believe that Clinton still could try
to revive the talks, or Israel could turn toward Syria with a new
plan _ especially if the Israeli-Palestinian talks deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   But those scenarios depend on a receptive new leader in
Damascus, and one strong enough to forge a peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Syria's Parliament Saturday opened the way for
Bashar, 34, to be leader by amending the constitution to lower the
required age of a head of state, there is no guarantee of an easy
transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people with grudges and fears about
Bashar's succession at this point, and they are powerful people who
command real forces _ armed forces and political forces _ in the
country,'' said Helena Cobban, who recently wrote a book on the
history of Israel-Syria talks.
</P>
<P>
   An anticorruption campaign in Syria, which was linked to Bashar
Assad, reportedly played a role in the suicide of former prime
minister Mohammed Zu'bi earlier this year and the exit of Hikmet
Shihabi, a former chief of staff who met with Barak when he served
as chief of staff to the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Shihabi
is believed to be in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shakeout in Damascus has already begun,'' said Geoffrey
Aronson, head of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, a Washington
think tank. ``The domestic situation in Syria is going to be
unsettled for many months, if not longer.''
</P>
<P>
   While Assad brought stability to Syria, largely by instilling
fear in the citizenry who witnessed his ruthless handling of
dissenters, Aronson and others said that a new group of young
leaders may usher in another benefit: opening up the country to the
influence of a larger world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an assumption they will bring a new energy or
commitment to issues . . . that will help Syria find a place in the
global economic order,'' Aronson said.
</P>
<P>
   That commitment could set the conditions for a durable peace
deal with Israel, but Middle East specialists cautioned the
transition may take a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Assad dying, people must be scratching their heads now in
a lot of different places,'' Quandt said. ``As long as Assad was
there, in the back of my mind, I always thought there was a
possibility of Israel and Syria working something out. Now that is
not very tempting.''

KERMIT ROOSEVELT, 84, DIRECTOR OF CIA'S 1953 COUP IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kermit Roosevelt, who was a member of the famous
American political family but who made his contributions to the
nation in the shadowy world of spy craft, died on Thursday at a
retirement community in Cockeysville, Md., near Baltimore. He was
84.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt's best-known exploit was as director of the 1953 coup
that overthrew the leader of Iran, Prime Minister Mohammed
Mossadegh, a nationalist who concerned Washington because he was
supported by the Iranian Communists at the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Central Intelligence Agency's secret
history of the coup surfaced, providing a detailed account of the
overthrow, which brought Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi to power.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt, the chief of the CIA's Near East and Africa division,
spent much of his time in Tehran, trying to get the shah, depicted
in the history as a vacillating coward, to summon the courage to
dismiss Mossadegh.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Aug. 3rd,'' the secret history says, ``Roosevelt had a long
and inconclusive session with the shah,'' who ``stated that he was
not an adventurer, and hence, could not take the chances of one.''
</P>
<P>
   The history continued: ``Roosevelt pointed out that there was no
other way by which the government could be changed and the test was
now between Mossadegh and his force and the shah and the army,
which was still with him, but which would soon slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt told the shah that ``failure to act could lead only to
a communist Iran or to a second Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 16, fearing the coup had failed, the shah fled to
Baghdad and the CIA urged Roosevelt to leave Iran immediately. He
refused, insisting that there was still ``a slight remaining chance
of success.''
</P>
<P>
   After the tide started to turn against Mossadegh, Roosevelt got
one of the coup leaders, Gen. Fazlollah Zahedi, out of hiding and
he made a radio address to the nation that brought the forces over
to the shah's side.
</P>
<P>
   It was the CIA's first successful overthrow of a foreign
government, and the shah stayed in power until the Islamic
revolution of 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an operation to last 25 years is not so bad,'' one of
Roosevelt's CIA colleagues, Samuel Halpern, said on Saturday. ``It
fell apart. Every operation cannot go on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt was a grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt and a
distant cousin of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He was born
in Buenos Aires, where his father, also named Kermit, was a banker
and shipping line official, and he grew up in Oyster Bay, N.Y.,
near Theodore Roosevelt's Long Island home at Sagamore Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, Roosevelt graduated a year ahead of his class at
Harvard and married Mary Lowe Gaddis. Mrs. Roosevelt, who lived in
the retirement community with her husband, survives him, as do
their three sons, another Kermit, of Washington; Jonathan, of
Sudbury, Mass., and Mark, of Brookline, Mass.; a daughter, Anne
Mason of Chevy Chase, Md.; a brother, Joseph Willard Roosevelt, of
Orient, N.Y.; and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Kermit Roosevelt noted on Saturday that the
tradition of naming boys Kermit, without a differing middle name or
a Jr. or a Roman numeral, could be confusing. He added that
alternate Kermits were also known as Kim, and that was the case of
his spy father.
</P>
<P>
   That Kim Roosevelt dealt with the notorious Kim Philby when
Philby served in Washington as Britain's liaison to American
intelligence during the Cold War. Philby later turned up in Moscow,
escaping just as British counterintelligence was closing in on him
as a Soviet spy.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Roosevelt said on Saturday, ``Philby once said of my
father, `He was the last person you'd expect to be up to his neck
in dirty tricks.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Roosevelt added that her husband never told her what he had
done during World War II, when he was in the Office of Strategic
Services, the forerunner to the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was spook talk,'' she said. ``He didn't talk spooks to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   His son said on Saturday that he thought his father was involved
in planning the invasion of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Harvard, Mrs. Roosevelt said, her husband
``tried to teach history to the techy boys at Cal Tech,'' and then
entered the military during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Roosevelt stayed on in the intelligence agency
and wrote and edited the history of the Office of Strategic
Services. After leaving government, he represented American
companies in the Middle East and worked in Washington as a lobbyist
for foreign governments, including the shah's.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote ``Countercoup: The Struggle for the Control of Iran,''
published in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Frederic P. Hitz, the Weinberg Goldman Sachs Professor of
International Relations at Princeton University, said the book
``showed how covert actions were authorized in those days, without
oversight. It was just a group of people sitting around in an
office at the White House _ not the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the success of the Iranian coup, Hitz said, Roosevelt
``was offered the opportunity to overthrow the government of
Guatemala, and he turned it down.''
</P>
<P>
   John Waller, one of Roosevelt's intelligence colleagues, said on
Saturday that Winston Churchill had asked Roosevelt to discuss the
overthrow of Mossadegh and, with Waller paraphrasing, said, ``Kim,
if I were a young man again, I would have done anything to have
worked with you in that operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Waller said that Roosevelt had been brought up in what the
British called ``the great game,'' the secret rivalry between
Britain and Russia in the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim was in that Churchillian mode of a 19th-century warrior,''
Waller said. ``He was a man of the times and a good man to have
around during the Cold War.''

ANGELS' ANDERSON ALWAYS BELONGED IN THE BIG LEAGUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT MAGOLOFF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Garret Anderson patrols the outfield grass at
Edison Field with aplomb, displaying a certain swagger as he lopes
toward the ball to make a play.
</P>
<P>
   Whether playing in the Angels' home stadium or any other
major-league ballpark, Anderson has looked like he belongs ever
since he led Kennedy High of Granada Hills, Calif., to a City
Section championship at Dodger Stadium in 1989. It was the first
time his spikes had ever graced major-league turf.
</P>
<P>
   While signing some baseballs before the last game of the Angels'
three-game series with the Dodgers on June 4, Anderson, a five-year
veteran of the majors, was told the Cougars had made it back to the
finals and would play El Camino Real in two days. Kennedy would
defeat ECR 4-2 to win the City title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea (about the impending title game); I go back and
play in the alumni game at Kennedy every year,'' Anderson said.
``It was a great program long before I got there and it's nice to
know it's still doing well. ... It was real nice to do something of
that magnitude and that was a great bunch of guys on that (1989)
team too.''
</P>
<P>
   If Anderson found out about the possibility of another City
title for Kennedy on short notice, he didn't waste any time before
calling to wish coach Manny Alvarado good luck before the game.
Alvarado, in his 12th year at Kennedy, coached Anderson when he
played varsity his junior and senior seasons in 1989 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was an All-City selection in baseball both years and in
basketball his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very smooth. His nickname was `Cadillac' _ he made
everything look so easy,'' Alvarado said. ``When he started at
center field in 1989 at Dodger Stadium, he looked like he belonged
there.''
</P>
<P>
   So Anderson pursued a career in baseball. He wouldn't have
minded a basketball career, but he didn't receive any scholarship
offers. Fresno State offered Anderson a baseball scholarship but he
turned it down when the Angels made him a fourth-round draft choice
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his name turning up in trade rumors consistently
throughout his tenure with the Angels, Anderson's career average
entering this season was .300. Last year his .303 average matched a
career high and his 21 homers were a career best.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's power numbers are well ahead of his pace from last
year, when he drove in 80 runs. He's hit 14 homers and driven in 40
runs this year with four weeks to go before the All-Star break.
Despite his power surge, Anderson's average has rested around the
mid-.200s throughout the year (he was batting .251 as of Saturday's
game).
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's a .300 hitter and he'll be a .300 hitter,'' Angels
manager Mike Scioscia said. ``We need Garret to drive in the runs,
which he's been doing. We need Garret to get those clutch hits,
which he's been doing. This guy contributes what we need him to
contribute and that's RBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, on the Angels _ the only team in the majors with
five players who have at least 10 homers _ power numbers have
become almost expendable. Anderson said the trade rumors used to
get to him, but he's come to understand that baseball is a business
and it's nothing personal.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, the Santa Clarita resident would like to stay
where he is with his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   When Anderson was growing up in the North San Fernando Valley,
he idolized players like Eric Davis and Darryl Strawberry and would
often imitate them on the field. He demonstrates his maturation
after 10 years of pro baseball by saying young players should play
for themselves and establish their own niche.
</P>
<P>
   Youths, regardless of how much they may have been influenced by
him, should fight the inclination to do their best Garret Anderson
impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a kid, you always try to imitate people,''
Anderson said. ``I just always tried to have fun and tried not to
be like anybody too much. I know what kind of player I am and I
just try to stay within that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope a kid just tries to be himself and goes out and has
fun.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Braves shortstop nabbed on DUI charge
 &HT;    By John McCosh
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Braves shortstop Rafael Furcal was charged with DUI
and underage consumption of alcohol after damaging his car shortly
after 5 a.m Saturday near Mableton.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal, 19, was held at Cobb's Adult Detention Center after a
breath test set his blood alcohol level at 0.11. Georgia's laws
provide for a DUI conviction if the driver's blood alcohol level is
0.08, or 0.02 for drivers under the legal drinking age of 21. He
was released on bail posted by a friend of his agent a few hours
later.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's 3-year-old zero tolerance law mandates a six-month
license suspension for underage drinkers convicted of DUI.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after going 3-for-4 in the Braves' 6-4 victory over the
Red Sox, Furcal was driving when he ran into a raised median,
damaging the cover of his car's oil pan, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing the car was losing oil, Furcal drove to a nearby
grocery store, where he purchased oil and some razor blades,
according to Cobb police spokesman Dana Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Police investigating a report of a suspicious person in the
grocery store parking lot about 5:15 a.m. found Furcal attempting
to start his car.
</P>
<P>
   The damaged car left a trail of oil from the raised median of
the road to the grocery store parking lot, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal's agent, Paul Kinzer, said that after the Braves game
against the Boston Red Sox ended about 10:30 p.m. Friday, Furcal
headed to his Buckhead apartment with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his friends was over at his house and had a couple of
beers,'' Kinzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday Furcal drove home the friend. After dropping him
off, Furcal was apparently headed back to his apartment when he
struck the median. Kinzel said he was notified of Furcal's arrest
about 7 a.m. Saturday. Kinzer said Furcal didn't realize he was too
impaired to drive and that the arrest had left him shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he called me, he was a nervous wreck,'' Kinzer said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his Furcal grew up in a different country and is
learning a hard lesson about different attitudes toward drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's from a different culture, from the Dominican Republic,
where they don't have a drinking age,'' Kinzer said. ``There, a
15-year-old might drink a beer or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Furcal, who declined to comment, was out of the lineup on
Saturday night but manager Bobby Cox said he would be back in
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have just spoken with Rafael,'' general manager John
Schuerholz said. ``Andres Galarraga was in the room with me to be
certain that Raffy understood what I was saying and to reiterate
what I was saying. The most important thing is Raffy has apologized
for the incident and is very sorry that it happened and is very
sincere when he says that it will not happen again. We're satisfied
with that response. He realizes that he made a mistake, admits to
it and he's sorry for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people make mistakes,'' Galarraga said. ``I think
it's (not as big) a deal as a lot of people think. He's a beautiful
person, a great kid. He feels bad about it. I want to help him not
feel bad about it. Forget about what everybody says and play the
game, concentrate on what you're doing. He doesn't need any
negative comments right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are deferring any disciplinary action ``until after
whatever legal matters involved are concluded,'' Schuerholz said.

NO WALKER HAS BEEN NO PROBLEM FOR ROCKIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Colorado Rockies lost right fielder Larry Walker to an
injured elbow at a time when things weren't going well, and it
immediately turned things around.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of falling into oblivion in the National League West,
the Rockies won 15 of their first 20 with Walker on the disabled
list and entered Saturday in second place. They're 32-25, and 2{
games behind division-leading Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe (Walker's) injury is probably the worst thing
and best thing that has happened to us,'' Rockies manager Buddy
Bell said. ``The worst thing about it is obvious. The best thing is
we've had to come together as a team. A lot of guys don't have
numbers that are Walker-like, but over the course of this time he's
been out, they've all had huge hits, or made huge plays.''
</P>
<P>
   When Walker was injured, the Rockies were three games below
.500. Now, thanks to a 20-6 mark at home (Colorado is 12-19 away
from Coors Field), they're in the wild-card chase and general
manager Dan O'Dowd is thinking about how to better the club rather
than retool it.
</P>
<P>
   STOTTLEMYRE CONSIDERS SURGERY: Arizona right-hander Todd
Stottlemyre didn't want to have rotator cuff surgery that would end
his season, but he is thinking about having an operation after the
season to reposition a nerve in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre is on the disabled list with tendinitis in his
elbow, but he's hopeful to be activated to start Thursday against
the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre was diagnosed with a torn rotator cuff in May 1999,
but he opted to rehab the muscles around the shoulder rather than
have surgery that would have kept him out for a year. But with the
nerve operation, Stottlemyre could start throwing in eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is much more simple,'' he said. ``It's not near as
dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   LIFE WITHOUT ROCKER: Though the Atlanta Braves are thankful they
don't have to deal with the John Rocker circus anymore, his erratic
pitching and demotion to the minors does create a hole in the
pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, the Braves will go with a
closer-by-committee, using Kerry Ligtenberg as the primary closer
and Mike Remlinger and Rudy Seanez in set-up roles. But manager
Bobby Cox said he would change things around depending on matchups.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, we've put an awful lot of emphasis on the closer,'' Cox
said. ``Sometimes you can get carried away with it. The same guy
might help inthe seventh inning if the matchup's just right.''
</P>
<P>
   SAMMY'S STATS: Sammy Sosa's criticism of Chicago Cubs manager
Don Baylor, and subsequent apology, was the talk of baseball this
week, but a closer look at the stats suggest Sosa wasn't exactly
smacking the ball all over the place during the down times this
season. He is hitting .312 with 19 homers and 56 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs began the season 6-11, and Sosa hit .219 with four
homers and eight RBI in those 17 games. When Mark Grace landed on
the disabled list May 11 with a pulled hamstring, Sosa had a streak
of 11 games without a home run. The Cubs were 3-8 in that span and
Sosa batted .248.
</P>
<P>
   FOR PETE'S SAKE: When the Cincinnati Reds honored their 1975
World Series champions last weekend, Pete Rose wasn't allowed to
attend. But he wasn't forgotten, especially by the players.
Shortstop Barry Larkin placed a rose on third base before taking
his position in the first inning, and Aaron Boone left his glove at
third base during the National Anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right thing to do and I was happy to be a part of
it,'' Larkin said. ``It wasn't a protest. It was respect for a man
I grew up adoring. ... We just felt it was right to represent him
in some capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed respect for what Pete Rose has done. He's the
ultimate teamplayer. It's a shame he couldn't be here. But he was
here in spirit.I think everybody felt he should have been here. I
kept waiting for the helicopter to come and lower Pete into the
stadium.'' &QL;

SYRIAN LEADER ASSAD IS DEAD AT 69 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO _ Syria's enigmatic and autocratic leader, Hafez Assad,
died Saturday, leaving behind broken dreams of Arab unity and a
nation that is economically troubled and diplomatically isolated.
He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had grown increasingly frail as a result of diabetes and
heart problems that began with a heart attack in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Through nearly three decades of war and frustrating failures to
reach regional peace, President Assad's exacting and &UR;  &LR; ruthless
style of leadership made him a force in the region and earned him
the nickname, ``The Lion of Damascus.''
</P>
<P>
   But his death _ without seeing the return of the Golan Heights
he lost to Israel 33 years ago _ may lead to a leadership vacuum
and create new strategies among rivals and allies in the Arab
world. An interruption in Syrian force could disrupt neighboring
Lebanon, where Syria has been the de facto power for a decade, and
affect the standoff between Israel and Muslim guerrillas in
southern Lebanon, where Assad had restrained the ambitions of the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last six years, Assad carefully prepared a path for his
untested son, Bashar, to assume power.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after Assad's death Saturday, Syria's Parliament
cleared the way for Bashar's ascendancy with a nearly unanimous
vote to lower the minimum age of a head of state from 40 to 34,
Bashar's age.
</P>
<P>
   Then Parliament ajourned until June 25, when it is expected to
begin the process of naming Assad's successor.
</P>
<P>
   After Syria's state television announced Assad's death, hundreds
of people gathered outside the presidential palace in Damascus,
chanting: ``With our souls, with our blood, we will protect you, O
Bashar!''
</P>
<P>
   For most Syrians, Assad was the only leader they had ever known.
Members of parliament wept. Stores closed, and the red-and-black
national flag was lowered to half-staff.
</P>
<P>
   He will be buried on Tuesday, with Secretary of State Madeleine
K. Albright representing the United States at the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   A new Syrian leader faces grave challenges as the nation comes
to a crossroads in the peace process with neighboring Israel.
Damascus also faces an economic and social stagnation if it does
not open its insular society to technology and globalization.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said it would be premature to speculate on
Syrian changes, adding: ``There will be a period of sorting out,
and the Syrian people will make the decisions and then we'll see
what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Assad, he noted: ``We had our differences, but I always
respected him. . . . He made a strategic choice for peace and we
worked together to achieve that goal. Throughout my contacts with
him, including our last meeting, he made clear Syria's continued
commitment to the path of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to working with Syria to achieve the goal of a
comprehensive peace,'' Clinton added during a visit to Northfield,
Minn., where he delivered the commencement address at Carleton
College.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian President Yasser Arafat declared three days of
mourning in Palestinian-run areas.
</P>
<P>
   Through more than three decades, Assad has insisted that Israel
must return the Golan Heights. Since 1991, Assad conducted
intermittent talks with Israel, remaining adamant about a complete
withdrawal. The talks broke down in January when Syria insisted
that Israel was trying to establish a framework for an agreement
that would not guarantee a complete withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, rumors of his death would periodically
circulate, but there had been no recent indication that his health
had declined sharply. Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said he had
spoken with Assad earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``His last words were: `Our destiny is to build a better future
for our countries' and then there was a silence and I knew
something happened,'' Lahoud said in a letter sent to Bashar and
read on Lebanon's state television.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar, a British-educated ophthalmologist, had this political
destiny thrust upon after his older brother, Bassil, who had long
been groomed for the succession, died in a 1994 car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar has never held office, but had taken on an
anti-corruption campaign in government that is widely popular in
the streets. The campaign deeply shook the aging circle of advisers
and ministers who surrounded his father.
</P>
<P>
   Considered awkward and shy compared to his icy, controlling
father, Bashar has made several official visits to Arab countries
and to France in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Until the end, however, Assad kept control of the difficult
negotiations with Israel. Many analysts felt Assad had
miscalculated again and again in failing to cut a deal for regional
peace with Israel, first in the early 1990s and again this year
when Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak aggressively sought to
strike a peace agreement with Syria and unilaterally ended Israel's
occupation of southern Lebanon. Just last week, Assad's foreign
minister said Syria was again open to peace discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's rule had been dominated by the Arab-Israeli conflict
through the humiliating defeat Arab nations suffered in 1967 and
the less humiliating defeat of 1973. Assad also mired Syria in
Lebanon's vicious 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's grasp on power seemed to depend in part on his ability
to keep enemies and allies guessing, and not being afraid to
reverse a diplomatic course when he saw an advantage in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   He also endured because he was willing to kill. In 1982, Assad
crushed an internal rebellion by ordering the massacre by the
Syrian Army of betwween 10,000 to 20,000 residents of the ancient
city of Hama.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's unpredictably and pragmatism was in display in his
decision to join the US-led coalition in the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
Although bitterly resistent to American intervention in the region
and long critical of Washington's strong support of Israel, Assad
sided with the US forces in ousting Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's
troops from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   For Assad, the decision paid off. He developed close ties to the
West just as Syria's longtime backer, the Soviet Union, was
collapsing. He also reaped financial benefits that included $2
billion from Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The involvement in the Gulf War also led to Assad's surprising
steps toward making peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assad did not want the political order in the Middle East
dominated by Israel,'' Assad's official biographer, Patrick Seale,
told CNN. ``He wanted a balance of power in order to keep the
peace. He felt an imbalance causes war because the stronger partner
always tries to impose his will on the weaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad, part of a military clique that gained power in the 1960s,
became leader in a bloodless coup in 1970. His tight grip on power
has been an extraordinary feat for a man who hails not only from a
peasant background but a minority Alawite Muslim sect in a
predominantly Sunni Muslim state.
</P>
<P>
   Assad often dreamed of a Saladin-like role as the unchallenged
leader of a united Arab front. It was a dream that died hard for
Assad.
</P>
<P>
   His regional ambitions were largely a faiure and often took
precedence over profound domestic concerns which had dragged Syria
into poverty and left his countrymen far behind in the age of
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Assad ruled through fear that emanated from a vast network of
spies, secret police and informers. According to human rights
groups, his government jailed thousands of political prisoners
without trial, and the US State Department regards Syria as
supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Syria still has some 30,000 troops stationed in Lebanon to
maintain its authority. The rationale given for Syrian presence has
long been the need to back up Lebanon while Israel occupied its
``security zone'' in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But Assad's intervention faced new scrutiny after Israel's
withdrawal of forces last month.

SYRIANS SEE IN ASSAD'S HEIR THE POSSIBILITY OF PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Bashar Assad, the presumptive new president of Syria,
has waited in the wings of power for six years, nurturing a
reputation as an accessible and progressive man who wants to
satisfy the yearning of many Syrians to be part of the modern
world.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, 34, is poised to take on the autocratic powers of his
father, Hafez Assad, who died Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The machinery of the Syrian state _ a quiescent Parliament, the
ruling Baath Party and the state-controlled press _ has all but
anointed him as his father's successor to rule a country that has
spent most of the last 30 years as a heavily militarized socialist
state living in political and economic isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his father, who never spent more than a few days outside
of Syria in his life, the younger Assad knows something of the
outside world, and was educated in part in the West. So, for many
Syrians, the younger Assad is the antithesis of their
inward-looking past and the passing of power from father to son is
not only seen as an outgrowth of an authoritarian state, but also
as a welcome demonstration of much-cherished stability.
</P>
<P>
   Before the elder Assad seized power, Syria had undergone a
succession of military coups and social upheavals. Although he
represented a tiny religious minority group, the Alawites, and
brutally suppressed any political opposition, President Assad also
won grudging public acceptance as the ruler who could bring a
measure of calm to the fractious Syrian political scene.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1994, the heir apparent to the Assad dynasty was the
eldest son, Basil, a dashing sportsman and military officer. But in
January of that year, he died in a spectacular car crash. His
funeral was conducted as a state event, with his grieving father
shown on Arab television stations throughout the Middle East
receiving the condolences of heads of state from around the region.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after his elder brother's death, Bashar Assad, the
next oldest son, was summoned home from London, where he had lived
for two years while taking a course in ophthalmology, and set on a
track to accumulate the military and political honors seen as
necessary for the next leader of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Said by friends to be rather shy and apolitical at first, Assad
has slowly built a reputation for being all that his father was not
_ accessible, open and sophisticated in the ways of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Until very recently, however, he had not taken an active role in
foreign policy except as his father's representative in Lebanon. He
has traveled extensively in the Arab world in the past two years,
meeting with several of its key leaders. His debut on the
international stage outside the Middle East came in November on a
visit to France, where he had been invited by President Jacques
Chirac for his first official talks with a Western head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has been associated, in press reports and in the minds of
many Syrians, with a popular anticorruption drive that has already
forced a number of his father's longtime supporters out of office.
He is credited with hand-selecting many ministers in the new
cabinet, appointed in March and including a number of men
considered open to the idea of a free market economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do need a change today more than any time before,'' Assad
told the pan-Arab newspaper Al Hayat, based in London, just before
the new government was announced. He said the new government needed
``efficiency, honesty and administrative skills,'' adding, ``If
these three elements are available, we will have the government we
seek.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-anticipated changes in Syria's currency and investment
laws, finally put in place by presidential decree two months ago,
were also widely attributed to the influence of the younger Assad.
In the last year, Syrians have become more aware of Assad's kitchen
cabinet of advisers, which includes Western-educated economists,
young entrepreneurs from some of the traditional Damascus elite
families and newly rich scions of military figures.
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus, many businessmen and ordinary Syrians have told
visitors that they know _ although they have not necessarily
experienced it _ that Bashar Assad can be reached by phone or by
fax with any problem anyone has with Syrian bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   He is perhaps best known, however, as Syria's only public
advocate of computer literacy and the Internet. A group called the
Computer Society, which he heads, offers free computer courses in a
country where satellite television dishes are still outlawed and
mobile telephones have just been permitted on a limited basis this
year. With such restrictions, only the president's son could have
promoted information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Assad's success in developing an image as a modernizer,
he has had also to cultivate a reputation as a tough political
actor.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, he comes from the Alawite sect, a small
religious group that is regarded as heretical by many Sunni and
Shiite Muslim clerics, and will rule a country that is
predominantly Sunni Muslim. If he is to maintain his minority-led
government, Assad will need the skills of his father to play one
group of Syrians against another and instill fear in them.

PEDRO'S BEEN NEAR PERFECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Pedro Martinez is having a season like no other
pitcher in the history of the game, at least when his numbers are
compared to those of his peers.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's ERA is 0.95, when the next lowest in the American
League is James Baldwin's 3.07. No pitcher in baseball history has
finished with an ERA below 1.00. Bob Gibson (1.12 ERA in 1968)
holds the major-league record, and Walter Johnson (1.14 in 1913)
holds the American League record.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez allows an average of just 4.75 hits per nine innings,
when only 10 teams have an ERA below 4.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we'll not see in our lifetime again, so
enjoy it,'' Red Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   With eight shutout innings against the Indians in his last start
Thursday, Martinez extended his scoreless-innings streak to 22. Yet
he said he still hasn't recovered from the strained muscle in his
side that forced him to miss a start.
</P>
<P>
   Even more remarkable is that Martinez actually seems to turn it
up a notch when runners are in scoring position. Opposing hitters
are batting .044 (2 for 45) with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty of times I'm amazed,'' Red Sox catcher Jason
Varitek said. ``Especially crunch time. When teams have a good
opportunity to score a run, he doesn't make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez also seems to get up for road games _ his ERA in
visiting ballparks is 0.51. With 114 strikeouts, he's is on a pace
for 324.
</P>
<P>
   Said Martinez: ``I'm only a human being. I'm not anything
special. I don't have the greatest numbers ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   FLYING BIRDS: The Orioles had to fly home to Baltimore after
last Wednesday's game in New York against the Mets, only to fly
back to New York on Thursday morning to play a rainout make-up
game.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? There wasn't a hotel within 90 minutes of Shea
Stadium able to supply the 53 rooms needed. New York was in the
middle of one of its heaviest tourist and convention periods of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken, Brady Anderson and Charles Johnson found rooms in
New York and stayed, but the rest of the team had to fly home and
return within a 12-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stinks,'' pitcher Mike Mussina said.
</P>
<P>
   ROCKER BYE BABY? The Indians considered trading for Braves
pitcher John Rocker during the spring, and with closer Paul Shuey
out with an injury and the pitching staff as a whole riddled with
injuries, speculation that the Indians will trade for Rocker has
surfaced again.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that would mean the Indians would have put up with
the circus that surrounds him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the guy,'' left fielder David Justice said. ``He
might just need a change of scenery. But we don't want anyone to
come in here and ruin the chemistry on this ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   SHORT HOPS: Rickey Henderson has stolen a base in 40 different
ballparks in his career. With the Mariners at San Francisco's Pac
Bell Park this weekend, he has the opportunity for No. 41. ... No
Angels player has ever hit 40 home runs in a season, but it seems
the streak will be broken this year. It's just a matter of who gets
there first, Mo Vaughn or Troy Glaus. Both have 18 homers, a pace
for 48. ... The Chicago White Sox have the best record in the
American League, but have a big week in front of them. Starting
Monday, they play their next seven games against the Indians and
Yankees. &QL;

A DAY IN THE LIFE: BIG MO VS. BIG UNIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ It's 3:45 p.m. Friday afternoon, and Mo Vaughn arrives
at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn and his bodyguard/pal Kyle enter through the
administrative offices and are pointed back outside and in the
direction of Gate G, the players' entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle notes how hot it is, when in fact it's only 90 degrees,
about 15 degrees cooler than the day before. Vaughn changes the
subject: ``Hey, who's throwing for them?''
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me? Who's throwing for the Diamondbacks?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know?'' a reporter asks.
</P>
<P>
   With a big smile revealing a gold tooth that reflects the bright
sunlight, Kyle jumps in: ``It's Unit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Unit, otherwise known as Randy Johnson, is taking his
9-1 record, his 1.41 ERA and his 131 strikeouts in 95 innings to
the mound against the Angels. The same Randy Johnson that strikes
such fear into opposing hitters, particularly lefties, that even
All-Stars like Larry Walker opt to ride the bench when Johnson
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   And Vaughn, also a left-handed hitter, didn't know?
</P>
<P>
   ``I meant tomorrow,'' Vaughn says. ``Who's throwing for them
tomorrow?''
</P>
<P>
   Omar Daal.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn gets quiet, apparently deep in thought, as he approaches
Gate G. Is he thinking about Daal? Doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn isn't afraid of facing Johnson. In fact, he went into
Friday's game with a career average of .333 (8 for 24) with two
homers against him. Any secrets?
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucky,'' Vaughn said. ``No. ... What's so crazy about it is
early in my career in Boston, I played against him a lot. I was a
young guy trying to break in and they're giving other guys a day
off. So I always seemed to be playing against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not comfortable facing him, but I've been in the box
against him. It's not easy. He can make you look real bad.''
</P>
<P>
   4:15 p.m. ... Vaughn settles into a couch in the Angels
clubhouse and watches the College World Series on TV. He is
approached with the question: ``If you're a general manager, and
you have the choice of starting your team with Randy Johnson or
Pedro Martinez, who do you take?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it matter?'' Vaughn says. ``Flip a coin, you're
getting the same thing. Either way, you're all right.''
</P>
<P>
   7:09 p.m. ... Vaughn steps into the box in the bottom of the
first inning. Johnson has already struck out Darin Erstad and Kevin
Stocker. Johnson throws an 85-mph slider. Vaughn swings and misses.
Johnson throws another 85-mph slider. Vaughn swings and misses.
Johnson throws a 98-mph fastball. Vaughn takes strike three.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is what I like about it,'' Vaughn says of his
on-going rivalry with Johnson. ``There's always a certain amount of
respect because everybody sits down against him. We've always had
tremendous respect for each other. That's what it's all about.
Playing in the big leagues you can't play only against who you
want.''
</P>
<P>
   7:57 p.m. ... Vaughn leads off the fourth inning. He fouls off a
change-up, then takes two sliders out of the strike zone. On a 2-1
count, Johnson throws an 82-mph change-up that Vaughn hits into
right field for a single.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-10, Johnson appears to a batter to be close enough to
touch. Add that menacing glare and the intimidation factor is high.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of his makeup, part of his game,'' Vaughn says.
``Anything you can do to get an edge. He definitely uses
(intimidation). And he should use that.''
</P>
<P>
   8:50 p.m. ... The Angels are down 4-1 but have two on with one
out in the sixth inning and Vaughn represents the tying run at the
plate. With the count 2-2, Vaughn takes a 95-mph fastball for
strike three. The Angels don't score in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   After Vaughn signed with the Angels on Nov. 25, 1998, he called
Johnson and tried to convince him to sign with the Angels, too.
Johnson nearly did, but preferred to stay closer to his Paradise
Valley, Ariz., home.
</P>
<P>
   9:04 p.m. ... Johnson is lifted for a pinch hitter in the bottom
of the sixth inning. Even with Johnson out of the game, the Angels
don't score again and lose 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   10:52 p.m. ... Vaughn leaves the Angels clubhouse after going 1
for 3 against Johnson, his career average against him still at .333
(9 for 27). Despite the loss, another good night's work in the
books.
</P>
<P>
   (ital)Now(endital) he can start thinking about Daal. &QL;

SPARKS FLY TO FOURTH CONSECUTIVE WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Using their defense again to set the tone, the
Sparks remained the only undefeated team in the WNBA with a 76-57
rout Saturday afternoon of the Phoenix Mercury in front of 6,349 at
the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Mwadi Mabika and Tamecka Dixon combined to hold the Mercury's
top two scorers _ Brandy Reed and Tonya Edwards _ to nine points.
</P>
<P>
   Mabika held Reed to six points, 16 under her average, and Dixon
limited Edwards to three points, seven under average. The Sparks,
who held the Mercury (3-2) to 27 percent shooting, a franchise low,
hit 52 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just concentrating on defense, just play aggressive,
don't let her get the ball,'' said Mabika, who fouled out with four
points, five assists, three steals and a blocked shot. ``As long as
we're scoring and we're winning I don't really care. I wanted to
contribute to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said: ``My shots were just not falling, and you're going to
have games where that is going to happen. It was frustrating. In
the second half, the ball didn't bounce our way.''
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between these teams got personal with about four
minutes left when Sparks center Lisa Leslie and Mercury guard
Bridgett Pettis had to be separated and were each assessed
technicals. Pettis, taking offense to an elbow Leslie stopped short
of giving Mercury center Maria Stepanova under the basket, backed
Leslie off the court, bumping the 6-foot-5 center, who retaliated
with a push.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any reason to fight her,'' said Leslie, who had
16 points to go with 10 rebounds. ``I just tried to back away from
her. I don't know why she was upset with me. She didn't have any
reason to be. I just backed away as far as I could and said, `Don't
hit me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Later, inbounding the ball by the Mercury bench, Leslie and
Phoenix coach Cheryl Miller, who coached Leslie at USC in 1993 and
1994, exchanged words. Leslie said Miller called her one of the
dirtiest players in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Cheryl, you didn't have a problem when I was playing
for you and now all of a sudden you do,''' Leslie said.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the game was clearly under the Sparks' command.
</P>
<P>
   They set the tone early when DeLisha Milton scored the Sparks'
first eight points to build a 22-11 advantage. But Phoenix went
into a zone and came back to lead 31-30 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``They changed defense to change the tempo,'' Sparks coach
Michael Cooper said. ``That's a credit to Cheryl. It was a diamond
and one, with a one-one-one on Lisa. That zone caused us a lot of
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Sparks responded with a 13-2 run to start the second
half to build a 43-33 margin, and the Mercury came no closer the
rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a good defensive team, and once we broke out of our
offensive slump we were able to open up a lead. As long as we
continue to play solid defense we're gonna be just fine,'' Cooper
said.
</P>
<P>
   Between Mabika, Dixon (five assists), and Ukari Figgs (four
assists), the Sparks distributed the ball well, getting 22 assists
to the Mercury's nine.
</P>
<P>
   Figgs had her best offensive game, contributing a career-high 15
points on 3-of-5 shooting from the 3-point line. Milton had a
game-high 17 points and Clarisse Machanguana had 10 off the bench. &QL;

ANALYSIS: FOR U.S., UNCERTAINTY IN SYRIA MAKES PALESTINIAN TALKS
MORE URGENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., this story has been added to NYT Page 1, replacing
PUTIN-EUROPE which is now inside) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the Clinton administration, the death of
President Hafez Assad of Syria makes the possibility of brokering a
peace between the Israelis and Syrians even more remote and the
desire to help forge a peace agreement between Israelis and
Palestinians even more intense.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Syrian leader and President Clinton failed to come to
terms at a meeting in Geneva last March, the administration has
underscored the urgency of making peace between Israelis and
Palestinians. In Cairo on Wednesday, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright told Syrian and Egyptian officials that while the
administration was willing to make a final push for an
Israeli-Syrian peace, there was ``no higher foreign policy
priority'' for it than the peace talks between Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Those talks were about to resume in the Washington area on
Tuesday and the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, Yasser
Arafat, had been scheduled to meet with Clinton at the White House
on Wednesday. But it was not clear whether those meetings might be
delayed because of Assad's funeral, which is also scheduled for
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will not go to Syria for the funeral, his spokesman, Joe
Lockhart, said. Although attending the funeral would present the
president with a chance to greet Assad's son as he assumes power,
the United States will instead be represented by Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that they have compiled a thick
dossier on Bashar Assad but maintained only limited contacts with
him through the embassy in Damascus. A senior White House official
said that nothing Bashar Assad has said or done in recent months
has caused the United States to believe that he would radically
alter Syria's course internally or in regional relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton learned of Assad's death before he took the stage for a
commencement address at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn.
During the ceremony, an aide slipped the president a note saying
that Syrian television had reported the death. Clinton visibly
sighed and shook his head as he read the note.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards he told reporters that this was a time for
condolences to the Assad family and the people of Syria, not for
make predictions about the future of a Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we had our disagreements,'' Clinton said, ``I always
respected him because I felt that he was open and straightforward
with me, and because I felt he meant it when he said he had made a
strategic choice for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that that peace was not achieved in his lifetime,''
the president added, ``and I hope that it can still be achieved, in
no small measure because of the commitment he made.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions, Clinton said it was ``premature to
say'' whether Assad's death would delay progress toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a period of mourning in Syria,'' Clinton said,
``there will be a period of sorting out, and the Syrian people will
make some decisions, and then we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's view reflected the one that is prevalent among Middle
East experts in his administration: that Assad's death changes the
political landscape not only in Syria but also in the region in
ways that will become apparent only over time.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Assad's death, the momentum for the Clinton
administration to help close the gaps between Israel and Syria had
been lost. That message came through loud and clear during
Clinton's failed meeting with Assad in Geneva in March, when the
ailing Syrian leader lectured Clinton on the history of the border
between Israel and Syria and demanded that Israel surrender not
only the Golan Heights but also the northeastern shore and the
northeastern portion of the Sea of Galilee that had been Syria's
before the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Clinton washed his hands of the matter,
stating bluntly: ``The ball's in his court now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Syria's domestic politics and decision-making process is a
blind spot for the United States. In addition, Syria has long been
a frustrating negotiating partner and despite the official
pronouncements is still considered a significant obstacle to a
comprehensive Middle East peace arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The succession will require time, the one thing Clinton doesn't
have left. And there are other uncertainties, officials said:
whether radical factions may use the transition to incite violence
inside Syria or whether the combination of a change in the
leadership in Syria combined with the Israeli withdrawal from
Lebanon last month could spark new violence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, administration officials said they believe that Assad's
death gives the Syrian government an even greater incentive to
preserve calm and stability on the Israeli-Lebanese border and to
discourage attacks on Israel through proxies as a pressure tactic
designed to extract concessions from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Albright issued a statement Saturday that Assad ``made a
strategic choice for peace at Madrid in 1991,'' when Syria first
agreed to talk directly with Israel. ``In all of our talks, he
remained committed to that choice,'' she said. ``We strongly
believe that was the right choice and expect that Syria will
continue on the path to peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Clinton administration officials noted Assad
autocratically ruled Syria for nearly thirty years and was
unwilling or unable to take the steps necessary for peace; his son
might take years to gain such strength. Even if Bashar Assad wanted
to sit at the peace table with the Israelis, it is unclear they
would trust a new and untried leader from the minority Alawite
sect.
</P>
<P>
   A diplomat from the region in Washington said that the
apparently seamless transition from Assad to his son suggests that
the death was not unexpected or violent, but answers few other
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assad was not loved, but he was a known quantity and very much
in charge,'' he said. ``We all will be waiting to see if his son
has full control. Assad was very much a one-man regime. Will all
the forces who supported the father support the son? The current
reality in the Middle East is based on assumptions that are no
longer necessarily true.''

COMMENDABLE WINS AT BELMONT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ While the spirits of the missing superstars
Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet were hanging over the homestretch,
the 132nd Belmont Stakes was run Saturday with a cast of 11 horses
of far less magnitude. And the one who got there first was one of
the least likely: Commendable, 17th in the Kentucky Derby, without
a victory in six races since his debut last August at Del Mar and
an 18-1 long shot in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   If any touch of greatness rubbed off on Commendable, it probably
came through his trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, who won the Belmont for
the fourth time after losing it last year when Charismatic
fractured a leg in the homestretch and missed sweeping the Triple
Crown. It also was his 13th victory in a Triple Crown race, tying
him for the record with the late Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons.
</P>
<P>
   It also was a moment of success for his jockey, Pat Day, who won
the race for the third time, and for his owners, Beverly and Bob
Lewis of Los Angeles, who have won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness
with Silver Charm and Charismatic in the last four years before
those horses were thwarted in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, it was a case of the downtrodden rising up and
causing a mighty upset. Commendable, a son of Gone West, won his
first start 10 months ago but had not run better than fourth since
then. In the Derby, which Lukas faced without his customary stable
of stars, Commendable ran 26 lengths behind Fusaichi Pegasus. Then
he sat out the Preakness, which was won by Red Bullet with Pegasus
second. But Saturday, he found the winner's circle, outrunning the
favorite, Aptitude, by a length and a half with Unshaded another
length farther back in third place and Wheelaway six lengths back
in fourth.
</P>
<P>
   When Commendable and his 10 rivals appeared for the Belmont
Stakes before a crowd of 67,810 Saturday at Belmont Park, there was
no suspense about sweeping the Triple Crown. After three years of
racing drama, this was a year when three horses would win the three
classics. And the Belmont horses were suspected of being
second-tier types searching for a way to overtake Fusaichi Pegasus
and Red Bullet for honors in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Commendable was a long shot in a field of long shots,
paying $39.60 for a $2 bet to win after taking second place behind
Hugh Hefner at the start of the race and taking over the lead with
a quarter of a mile to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the head of the stretch, I hadn't asked him for anything,''
Day remembered, sounding as surprised as anyone. ``I wasn't even
sure how much he had left.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, declining to play down what his horse had achieved, said:
``My wife asked me this morning if we could win this thing. I
replied, `Absolutely.' You have to look at what you're up against
and the field you are faced with. We had a horse to fit this very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had a horse who had earned $88,470 in seven races before
the Belmont, and then went home with first prize of $600,000. Also,
no horse had ever won the Belmont without racing at least once
after the Kentucky Derby, and Commendable outran just two horses in
the Derby field of 19. As it was, when Commendable turned his trick
in the Belmont on a hot and sultry afternoon with the temperature
in the 90's, he ran the mile and a half in 2:31, a full seven
seconds slower than Secretariat did in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but Commendable lost his left front shoe in the
paddock on Saturday while being saddled. Lukas explained that the
hardened rubber brick matting tended to stick to horse shoes. When
Commendable turned in his stall, his shoe simply came off. But a
blacksmith was summoned, who restored shoe to hoof.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talked to Mr. Lukas before the race,'' Day said, ``he
thought the important thing was to have an energy-saving ride. We
knew Hugh Hefner would be going out to the lead, so my job was to
get Commendable into a comfortable spot tracking him.''
</P>
<P>
   Day did just that. Hugh Hefner, as expected, shot into the lead
coming out of the gate and held it with Commendable right on his
heels. They stayed in tandem through some very slow fractions: half
a mile in 49 1/5 seconds, one mile in 1:39. Then when they turned
for home, Hugh Hefner was done, fading to eighth. Commendable,
though, withstood late challenges from three well-regarded closers:
Aptitude, who ran second in the Derby; Unshaded, who skipped both
the Derby and Preakness; and Wheelaway, who ran fifth in the Derby
but skipped the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the eighth pole, I still thought I had a chance,'' said
Alex Solis, the rider on Aptitude. ``But Commendable had too easy a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   After they crossed the line, Shane Sellers leaped off Unshaded,
who was wobbling with heat exhaustion. Celeste Kunz, the track
veterinarian, said: ``He had a mild case of heat exhaustion, and we
mechanically lowered his body temperature by applying hoses and ice
water. He recovered quickly and walked back to his barn.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a day when several jockeys envisioned a trip to the
winner's circle that didn't materialize. Richard Migliore,
Wheelaway's rider, said: ``I was very calm because I thought I was
sitting on the winner. When I asked for more, he flattened out.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment, the only horse who ran in all three Triple Crown
races, finished third in the Derby and Preakness and fifth in the
Belmont. His trainer, Todd Pletcher, said: ``Our worst fears come
true. We didn't get the pace we needed. He made a nice run, but
couldn't close into those splits.''
</P>
<P>
   But the highest praise for Lukas came from his West Coast rival,
Bobby Frankel, the trainer of Aptitude, who said: ``Give Lukas
credit. I don't know how he did it.'' &QL;

WOMAN SHOT AT GAME IN KAUFFMAN STADIUM; ANOTHER SPECTATOR AVOIDS
BEING HIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD RRADLEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A 64-year-old
Haysville, Kan., woman was shot in the stomach and a second bullet
passed through another woman's seat as they watched the Royals play
the Pittsburgh Pirates on Friday night at Kauffman Stadium.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The women, part of a crowd of more than 30,000 people, were
sitting in different sections. Kansas City police said Saturday
that they were unsure whether the bullets had been fired from
inside or outside the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses reported hearing popping sounds, said Sgt.
Floyd Mitchell, a Police Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Haysville woman was hit about 10 p.m. as she sat in Section
138 in the plaza reserved level near the right field foul pole. The
bullet entered the right side of her abdomen, passed through her
left side and lodged in her left elbow, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing what had happened but feeling severe pain in her
stomach area, she walked to the stadium's first-aid station.
Medical workers discovered she had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses near the woman later told police that they had heard
pops at the time of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   An official for Metropolitan Ambulance Services Trust, which
took the woman to Truman Medical Center, said a medic watching the
game had heard what sounded like two or three gunshots coming from
the right field general admission section.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was treated at Truman and released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes after the Haysville woman was shot, another woman
sitting in the upper deck on the first base side of the infield
leaned forward in her seat in Section 416 just before a bullet
blasted through the seat and landed nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Police were investigating the trajectory of the bullets. They
would not comment on the type of weapon used or whether the slugs
had come from the same gun.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lachimia, a Royals spokesman, said he was told by police
late Friday that the bullets probably had come from outside the
stadium, from the direction of Interstate 70.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not been informed that police Saturday were
saying the shots could have come from inside the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the seriousness of this incident, we do believe this
was a random act. ...This woman (from Haysville) was not an
intended target,'' Lachimia said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting was the first of its kind at Kauffman Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals would not comment on security at any given game, but
Lachimia said the team would take steps for each game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, an event of this nature is difficult to protect
against.''

THIS 49ER REALLY PANNED OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All signs point to Steve Young announcing his retirement at the
49ers' Santa Clara, Calif., training site Monday, so the career of
the most proficient passer in the history of the game will come to
an end.
</P>
<P>
   Young's greatest accomplishment has to be that he took over for
Joe Montana, arguably the greatest quarterback of all time, and
somehow managed to not only continue the excellence but also become
a probable first-ballot Hall of Famer as well.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that. Montana had led the 49ers to four Super Bowl
titles. Imagine him excelling when the fans were constantly
comparing him with Montana. Imagine being able to carry the team to
another Super Bowl title in 1995, when fans were still angry that
Montana was allowed to leave for Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the 49er system. Maybe it was Bill Walsh. Maybe it
was the great coaching Mike Shanahan provided during the three
years he and Young were together in San Francisco or those early
days when Mike Holmgren was in charge of the offense. Or maybe it
was just an incredible athlete who had an equally incredible knack
for knowing what it took to win football games. Maybe Jerry Rice
and the other 49ers receivers played a significant role in making
Young great, but Young's ability to create with a smooth, fast, and
strong 6-foot-2-inch, 200-pound frame was unparalleled in
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Young, one of the fastest quarterbacks to play the game,
seemingly could have played football wearing a suit and carrying a
briefcase like the lawyer he had become off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Smart. Instinctive. Fluid.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for such athletes to leave the games they love,
especially when they're still performing at a high level, which
Young was, between concussions. It appeared Young was less
concerned than those around him about his head injuries, but in the
end, at age 38, he wanted to be known as a 49er, not a 49er who
ended his career with the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   He had the opportunity in Denver _ Shanahan had left a salary
cap spot open _ but Young's heart told him he should quit.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because he had persevered too long with the 49ers not to
have it end that way. Some Bay Area folks were skeptical when the
49ers pulled off an Auerbachian deal with the Buccaneers in April
1987, tossing a second- and fourth-round pick Tampa's way for
Young, who had not played well the previous season.
</P>
<P>
   In time, after Young was out of Montana's shadow, fans realized
it was one of the greatest deals in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the job was his for good in 1991, after Montana's
elbow problems had taken their toll, Young was already 28.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe thinks Young is making a good
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has nothing left to prove,'' said Bledsoe. ``He has
championship rings, he's one of the greatest quarterbacks of all
time and a first-ballot Hall of Famer. He'd be risking his health
to prove what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve is a smart guy who has a lot to look forward to after
football. He's not going to be lost in life when the game is over
for him. He has business and broadcast opportunities and he can
really have a full and enjoyable life.''
</P>
<P>
   Young got married in March and his wife, Barbara, is expecting
their first child in December.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe by visiting with Shanahan last week Young wanted an
endorsement that he should continue his career in Denver. Shanahan
did not give one. Though Shanahan was willing to hand the reins to
Young and tell Brian Griese and Gus Frerotte to step aside, it was
obvious that both Shanahan and Young weren't sure.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no reason to believe Young couldn't have pulled it
off. If he could replace Montana, why not John Elway? Somewhere in
his mind, he had to be thinking that.
</P>
<P>
   But Shanahan knew Young had reservations about putting on
another uniform, and that was all he needed to advise Young to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   Though reports indicate Young will move into the ``Monday Night
Football'' booth with Al Michaels, there's also the possibility
that he will eventually supplant Walsh and run the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Young and Walsh had a heated argument last week when Walsh
thought Young was going to Denver, but Young surprised Walsh by
deciding to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Young certainly has the intelligence to deal with salary caps,
evaluate players, and run an organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the brightest people not only in football, but in
life,'' said Bledsoe. ``He could do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that Young is retiring on his terms, that he wasn't
pressured into quitting because Walsh needs salary cap space or
because there's a feeling that it's time to begin the Jeff Garcia
era. Players like Young transcend that. Young's retirement will
save the 49ers about $3 million in salary cap space this year. For
a team that's had to trim its payroll by almost $30 million, that's
significant.
</P>
<P>
   As a parting gift, Walsh is giving Young a $1 million roster
bonus that was due on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   That's ironic. For a few years, there were stories of how Young
never cashed his paychecks because he didn't feel he earned his
money as a backup to Montana. One gets the feeling that after 13
years in San Francisco, after becoming the all-time completion
percentage leader (64.3), the career passer rating leader (96.8),
the second leading all-time rusher among quarterbacks (4,329
yards), a two-time league MVP, and the 1995 Super Bowl MVP, this is
one he'll cash, and enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bishop in check
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Michael Bishop fans. Patriots offensive coordinator
Charlie Weis said last week he has no plans to use Bishop in a
``Slash'' role. Therefore, his only chance to get on the field
would be if Bledsoe suffered a major injury. Of course, as Weis's
old boss, Bill Parcells once said, he reserves the right to change
his mind . . . Chad Eaton is trying to convince former
Browns/Ravens teammate Mike Frederick to join the Patriots'
defensive line. Frederick is hoping he can still return to
Tennessee. The Patriots made Frederick a minimum offer about a
month ago, but agent Brad Blank said he doesn't know whether the
offer is still on the table . . . Hindsight is a wonderful thing,
and an oft-used tool in sportswriting. So here we go. In having to
replace Curtis Martin, who left for the Jets with a six-year, $36
million deal (that's the simplest version of a complex contract),
the Patriots have since paid four running backs and on this day are
still searching for an adequate replacement. Robert Edwards, a No.
1 pick in 1998, was given a four-year, $4.2 million deal with a
$3.1 million signing bonus. After he went down, the Patriots signed
Terry Allen, whose one season cost them about $700,000, and drafted
Kevin Faulk, who got a five-year, $3.1 million deal with a $1
million signing bonus. The Patriots dumped Allen and drafted J.R.
Redmond, who hasn't signed yet but will likely receive a three-year
deal in the $1.2 million range. Redmond just had groin surgery and
will likely not set foot on the field until the midway point of the
exhibition season. The Patriots are now inquiring about Karim
Abdul-Jabbar . . . Please scream here. Are the Patriots still too
embarrassed to make Bruce Armstrong an offer, knowing it will be
low? As soon as Bill Belichick laid eyes on Armstrong and Ben
Coates last Tuesday, why didn't he head for Andy Wasynczuk's office
for contracts to re-sign both of them? Armstrong weighs about 290
and is in great shape while Coates is 245 and has never looked
better in his nine-year career. Teams have to make tough decisions
on veterans with high salaries, but such decisions haven't always
worked out for the Patriots. Martin is the key example, but there
are others such as Sam Gash, who went to two Pro Bowls after the
Patriots cut him, and Willie Clay, who was never adequately
replaced at free safety. Now we'll see whether the Patriots made
the right choice in letting Shawn Jefferson go and replacing him
with Tony Simmons . . . More hindsight: Clearly the worst thing
Armstrong did was play on one leg after he had torn his ACL halfway
through last season. The stat guys point to Armstrong allowing 12
1/2 sacks last year, third most in the league. All of them came
after he was injured. That's the part that doesn't appear in the
stats.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It starts with stopping him
</P>
<P>
   The single most important player in the AFC East might be Colts
quarterback Peyton Manning. How well other AFC East teams contain
him will go far in determining how the standings stack up. This is
where Belichick could be a huge factor. If he can find a way to
stop Manning, the Patriots could be a very good team. Last year,
teams couldn't find a way to disrupt Manning and get him off his
game. The Patriots' coaching staff is already working on some
offseason projects, and you can bet one of them involves Manning .
. . After Bledsoe takes his $6.446 million salary this season,
he'll have earned $34.4 million of the $42 million contract he
signed in October 1995. You'd find very few examples of a player
earning that much on one NFL contract. Long before that much has
been paid, deals usually are renegotiated. For those who believe
the Patriots are withholding a contract extension to ``motivate''
Bledsoe, I don't think that strategy would be effective. Not $34.4
million later. The Patriots haven't redone his deal because they
don't want to hand out a $15 million-$18 million signing bonus
while they're on the verge of breaking ground on a new stadium . .
. Weis didn't agree with some of the media experts who thought
rookie quarterback Tom Brady was throwing the ball poorly at
minicamp. Weis, in fact, was very impressed with Brady, who has
shown the poise of a kid who played under pressure at Michigan . .
. Bledsoe on his upcoming visit to a maximum security prison in
Orafino, Idaho, as part of his foundation's ``Parenting With
Dignity'' program: ``I'm a little nervous about it. I've heard it's
very intimidating and a tough place to visit. I hope I have fans in
there. I don't want them to not like me. It's going to be
interesting. We've got a great program, something we believe
strongly in. The goal is to put it to as many people as we can. We
need the exposure. The more people who know about it, the better.''
Drew's father, Mac, a former teacher who authored the program along
with his wife Barbara, said the nine-week parenting course has been
taught in the prison for two years with strong results. ``You get
to talking to those guys, and they know they've made a mistake, but
they want things to be different for their children,'' said Mac.
``When you give them a couple of tools to teach their children,
they eat it up. They want to be mentors to their own kids.'' The
last time Mac went to the prison, he spoke to more than 200
prisoners sitting in folding chairs on the baseball field,
surrounded by 20 guards armed with stun guns. Outside the grounds
are two 14-foot chain-link fences, with 10 yards of razor wire in
between. And on a hill beyond the fences are guards with scoped
rifles. ``It was one of the most intimidating things I'd ever
experienced,'' said Mac . . . The Patriots will give a bonus to the
player who does the most in the offseason program. The front-runner
is defensive end Greg Spires, who has had 100 percent attendance
and also volunteered for the rookie orientation camp back in April
even though he is a veteran . . . In addition to Frederick and
Abdul-Jabbar, the Patriots are waiting to hear back from center
Steve Everitt and lineman Anthony Pleasant on contract offers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tough turf
</P>
<P>
   The Lions are very concerned about Pro Bowl tight end David
Sloan's turf toe _ to the point where they will take a look at
Coates Monday in Detroit. Coates isn't fond of artificial turf and
would prefer to play on a grass field, but he also learned late
last week that the money has finally dried up in Washington and he
won't be going there . . . Agent Angelo Wright couldn't get the
Seahawks to bite on a deal that would pay wide receiver Sean
Dawkins $3.2 million up front and a minimum salary this year. So
the Seahawks cut Dawkins after their offer of a $1.5 million bonus
and $1.5 million average salary was refused. Dawkins has been a
pretty productive guy over the years. The Jets and Colts may have
some interest in him . . . Matt Beck, who had great credentials as
a Cal linebacker but didn't get drafted because of injuries, was
cut swiftly by the Patriots and Seahawks in his free agent tryouts
. . . The No. 1 Patriots fan of the South, Braves pitcher and
Billerica native Tom Glavine, said, ``It's a tough division but you
always have a chance to win when you have a Drew Bledsoe.'' Those
tossers of the ball stick together, don't they? . . . No offense to
capable UMass defensive coordinator Don Brown, whom Northeastern
hired to succeed Barry Gallup as football coach, but former Patriot
Steve Nelson has done a great job as head coach and athletic
director at Curry, and would have given the Huskies the visibility
and name recognition they sorely need in this area . . . Bobby Orr,
who runs Woolf Associates in Boston, said the firm has no plans to
revive the football end of its business. The Ricky Williams fiasco
_ it had Williams and then lost him _ left a bad taste, so Orr said
he will stick to baseball and hockey and keep away from what has
become a seedy business . . . Word is there wasn't complete
blessing given in Dallas for the team's signing of Randall
Cunningham. It was obviously a move by Jerry Jones to bring in a
high-profile player, but Cunningham has no experience with the Jack
Reilly-Ernie Zampese offense, which is why the team had signed Paul
Justin earlier in the offseason . . . Bobby Grier said he'll never
talk about it, but he's told friends that he felt blindsided when
Belichick fired him. He had felt completely involved in the
organization even after Belichick came aboard. And don't think that
Grier and Pete Carroll can't live in harmony again someday. Carroll
will likely be a candidate for the expansion Houston job,
especially if Jeff Fisher signs an extension in Tennessee . . . The
NFL is just kidding, right? No suspension for Ray Lewis because he
cut a deal on a double-murder rap and plea-bargained down to
obstruction of justice? So now he gets to play linebacker for the
Ravens again? Just like that? . . . Happy anniversary, Don Botieri.
For 50 years, he has cut hair and talked sports at Don's Barber
Shop in Hanson.

DINO DUVA BACK IN BUSINESS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dino Duva is back where he wants to be, but he's not back where
he was.
</P>
<P>
   The former president of Main Events, the promotional company
started up by his brother, Dan, that fell apart in a sad family
squabble after Dan's death, is back in boxing. Dino is back with
his father, legendary trainer Lou Duva, and back with his sister,
Donna. He's back promoting events around the country. All in all,
he's back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting over, but we're not in a new business,'' Dino
Duva said of his new promotional company, Duva Boxing. ``It's a lot
different from starting a new company from scratch because of all
the contacts we have in the business and the reputation we have.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not easy. It takes an investment to make an impact.
When you have a lot of stars, like we had at Main Events, it's a
lot easier to maintain yourself. It's harder to start from scratch
because you can't get things done the way you used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have fighters like Pernell Whitaker, Evander
Holyfield, and Lennox Lewis, it gives you power in the industry
that you can use to help your other fighters. We don't have that
now. That's been the hardest thing to deal with mentally. We can't
get things done the way we used to at Main Events. Leverage and
power are important in this business. When you don't have that, you
need breaks for your fighters and they're harder to come by.''
</P>
<P>
   The one break Duva never thought he'd see was the breakup of
Main Events, which also included fight manager Shelly Finkel. After
Dan Duva died of cancer at age 44 in 1996, Dino replaced him as
company president and for a time the business flourished.
</P>
<P>
   But squabbles developed over his way of doing business and that
of his sister-in-law, Kathy, and attorney Pat English, a friend of
his brother's who was on the board representing Dan Duva's family
trust.
</P>
<P>
   Bitterness arose and finally Dino, Lou, and Donna were forced
out in a power struggle that remains to be settled. Main Events has
moved but continues to be a major player in the industry with
Duva's sister-in-law in charge and former friend Gary Shaw running
the day-to-day operation.
</P>
<P>
   They retain promotional rights to some of the biggest names in
the sport, including Lewis, but their business has suffered from
the infighting, and neither side is what it was.
</P>
<P>
   The court battle may drag on for some time with the Duva family
arguing it was their business in the first place, and Dan's family
countering that they were employees who merely held a
profit-sharing interest. How it will be resolved is unclear, but
for the moment Duva Boxing fights on as it did years ago, when Lou
Duva was running tiny shows at a place called Ice World and his
kids ran the ticket booth and concessions.
</P>
<P>
   They were small-time fights for small-time money, but there was
no squabbling. That didn't come until the money and the big-time
fights, and Dan's death. Everything has changed since those days
for the Duvas, especially Dino, who is trying to make a comeback
like so many of the fighters he has handled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very stressful several years as president of Main
Events,'' he said. ``There were a lot of people undermining me and
some were stabbing me in the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family went through a major tragedy with my brother dying
and I became the point man for a lot of pain. I took a lot of heat,
but I thought I did a pretty good job. We made a lot of money in
those years, but it became a lousy situation for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I resent is the way some people in our own organization
acted and treated me. All I heard was, `Dan wouldn't have done it
that way.' It became personal, that's what I regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``A boxer promoter has to gamble. What's important is that you
win more than you lose. I did win more than I lost. Look at
Fernando Vargas, Zab Judah, and Vernon Forrest. They're some of the
best fighters in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm angry about a lot of things that happened, but I was angry
for a long time and I let it affect me. I'll never forget what some
people in my own organization did to me, but I sat home every day
for a long time doing nothing. There's still some bitterness inside
me, but you've got to move on in life. My family is back together
and we're back in boxing. That's enough for now.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Connecticut's Angel Vasquez is probably the best
fighter Duva has under contract and the problem he's had trying to
match him with Prince Naseem Hamed is an example of the leverage
problem his new organization faces.
</P>
<P>
   Duva had Vasquez on a list of three possible opponents for
Hamed's Aug. 19 HBO fight at Foxwoods, but the featherweight
champion ended up choosing Augie Sanchez, a Las Vegas-based boxer
of lesser note. In the old days, when Duva promoted some of the
sport's biggest names, he would have gotten his lesser-known
fighter that shot at a big fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't deny it's more exciting to work on big events, but
young fighters like we have are more humble,'' Duva said. ``They
appreciate things more. The hardest thing now is putting things in
financial perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Main Events, we could lose some money on small shows to try
and build a guy up. Now we have to try and make a profit on all our
shows because the losses build up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tough adjustment, but we have a great prospect in
Jermaine Fields (who is 19-0) and several other kids my father is
very high on. We've got a kid named Eric Kirkland who's 6-0 and is
a hell of a puncher from Ohio. He just knocked out a kid Cedric
(Kushner, a former Duva friend and rival promoter) was high on. You
never know.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Short jabs
</P>
<P>
   The odds on Oscar De La Hoya keep rising in Las Vegas, but don't
ask Shane Mosley why. ``I see myself, with a lot of speed, just
overwhelming him,'' the undefeated former lightweight champion said
of his fight Saturday night with De La Hoya. ``I have footage of a
sparring session we had just before Oscar went to the 1992
Olympics. He came to our gym because he needed some help sparring.
We threw a lot of jabs at each other. Looking at it now, it looks
like I could hit him whenever I wanted.'' Oh, really? . . . HBO
moved one step closer to making a De La Hoya-Trinidad rematch when
it announced last week a multifight deal with Trinidad, who had
previously fought for promoter Don King on Showtime. Trinidad will
make his HBO debut July 22 when he defends the World Boxing
Association super welterweight title he won March 3 from David Reid
against Mamadou Thiam (33-1, 30 KOs). In the last 18 months,
Trinidad has defeated three American gold medalists _ Whitaker, De
La Hoya, and Reid. With HBO now likely paying the lion's share of
the purse for De La Hoya-Trinidad and with both house fighters, the
likelihood of a rematch at a catch weight between 147 and 154
increases markedly if for no other reason than HBO now has nobody
to argue with but itself (and King) over the bout. And King knows
the only way he can get Trinidad the kind of money he wants is to
go back on pay-per-view with De La Hoya . . . David Tua's last
three fights have lasted less than eight minutes. He has gone
beyond the third round only once in his last seven fights, and 14
of his 35 victories (35-1, 31 KOs) have come in the first round.
Tua is ranked No. 1 by both the International Boxing Federation and
World Boxing Council and will get his mandatory with Lewis in
November. When he does, the bout will be on HBO, but Showtime will
retain its rights to his future fights. That's why it put on last
weekend's debacle with Obed Sullivan and will show him again next
month against Jorge Luis Gonzalez. ``You can draw your own
conclusions where he fights after he beats Lewis,'' Showtime
executive Jay Larkin said. ``It's not for any great humanitarian
reasons we're putting him on in two quick fights.'' . . . Mike
Tyson's trainers, Tommy Brooks and Jay Bright, insisted last week
their man will appear as scheduled June 24 in Glasgow, against Lou
Savarese. The fight has twice been postponed by Tyson, but his
people claim he is working hard in Phoenix and Las Vegas and
peeling off some of the reported 274 pounds he ballooned to since
his quick blowout of Julius Francis in February. The fight is
expected to attract nearly 60,000 to Hamden Park. ``Mike is very
excited about the crowd,'' Bright said. ``His experience in
Manchester (England) was rejuvenating for him. It took him back to
a time when the crowds in the US were so excited to see him. Mike
is ready to go. He's ready to vaporize anyone in front of him.'' .
. . Tyson remains on the antidepressant Zoloft, but although it
helps him control his mood swings, the British Board of Boxing
Control's chief medical officer has expressed concern that Tyson
might be taking ``tranquilizers.'' Bright said Tyson does not take
the medication in the weeks leading up to a fight, and it should
not be a problem. ``It's a serotonin uptake,'' Bright said. ``It
helps balance the chemicals in the brain. When something happens,
he reacts properly and doesn't lose his temper.'' That's good to
know . . . Savarese's trainer, Jesse Reid, said last week he
advised his fighter to be wary after the bell sounds to end a round
because Tyson likes to hit late. When told of this, Brooks had
another suggestion: ``Don't worry about after the bell. Worry about
the three minutes until the bell.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Around and around
</P>
<P>
   Although George Foreman has insisted he never paid anyone to
help get Axel Schulz rated so he could fight him for the IBF title,
promoter Bob Arum claims he was told by Foreman and his attorney,
Henry Holmes, that $250,000 had been paid to an IBF official
through another promoter, Butch Lewis. Arum says that is why he
delivered only $100,000 of a proposed $200,000 kickback to IBF
president Bob Lee for that purpose. One of Foreman's attorneys said
last week the money paid to Lewis was a consulting fee. ``George
never believed that money was a payoff and does not know if it went
to the IBF,'' said Lawrence Wechsler, another of Foreman's
attorneys. Foreman is on the prosecution witness list in the
federal trial of the IBF on bribery charges, but Lewis is not. Arum
testified Tuesday that he does not have an immunity deal, despite
reports to the contrary. He claims he came forward to testify
because ``it's time to do what I could to end the corruption in
boxing.'' What? Did he just notice it? . . . Play a sad song for
the passing of one of boxing's greatest publicists, Irving Rudd,
who died recently at 82. He showed his versatility by working for
both King and Arum, and handling King's public relations in 1977 in
the midst of the scandal-ridden ABC boxing tournament . . . The
only man who can save Julio Cesar Chavez from a birthday beating
against Kostya Tszyu July 29 is Holyfield. If Holyfield is ready to
go on that date, he would meet Chelsea heavyweight John Ruiz, but
it's more likely, according to Showtime sources, that the fight
will be Aug. 12. ``That's the logical date,'' a Showtime official
said. King is still looking for a site, with Caesars Palace in the
bidding but no longer a lock . . . Lowell's Micky Ward, the World
Boxing Union junior welterweight champion, fights on the
Hamed-Sanchez undercard Aug. 12 at Foxwoods against California's
Antonio Diaz. Diaz is the International Boxing Association
140-pound champion, but neither title will be at stake.

STEWART'S PRESENCE WILL BE FELT AT OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime in the next few days _ perhaps when the sun is bidding
farewell for another day or after the moon has assumed position to
sprinkle a soft glow over Carmel Bay _ he will walk quietly toward
the 18th hole at Pebble Beach Golf Links, the roar of the Pacific
Ocean continuous, breathtaking beauty stretching to the horizon. He
will carry a bottle of expensive champagne, priceless memories, and
an indescribable pain to the wall that protects one of golf's most
precious pieces of real estate from the fury of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Though the pomp and glitz of the 100th US Open will be all
around him, the moment on that wall will have nothing to do with
golf, but everything to do with the human spirit that we all too
often forget is part of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a day goes by that I don't remember him. He always treated
me great. He was a great friend and I loved him very much.''
</P>
<P>
   So, on that wall, Chuck Cook will raise a toast to Payne
Stewart, just as he promised he would in a tearful eulogy last
October in front of thousands of people jammed into First Baptist
Church in Orlando. ``How do you celebrate the life of the greatest
celebrator of life that you know?'' Cook had asked that warm fall
day, less than a week removed from the LearJet tragedy that killed
Stewart, 42, and five others.
</P>
<P>
   For Cook, the answer is: Quietly, in his own, personal
</P>
<P>
   way. Many people heard him talk about the wall at Pebble Beach,
but this will be a private moment for Cook, who lost ``a big part
of my life,'' that fateful October afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just go out there alone and sit on that wall. I'm not
telling anyone when,'' said Cook, the longtime swing coach, soul
mate, and traveling companion of the two-time US Open champion.
``I've had a hard time with it. It's been tough, tougher than I
thought it would be. But this (week) will be good for me. It will
be closure for me. After that, you know, life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, the US Open. And not just any US Open. A US Open at
Pebble Beach, arguably the most spectacular golf course in the
country, one that even veteran players get goose bumps thinking
about. That this week is all about the US Open, Pebble Beach, and
the memory of William Payne Stewart is an ironic mixture that is
not lost on colleagues who are usually focused on matters more
self-centered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he had won the AT&AMP;T, you know, at Pebble
Beach,'' said Hal Sutton, ``and the fact that he had won the US
Open in such dramatic fashion last year and that he's not going to
be there to defend his title is . . . well, it will be pretty hard
not to think about Payne Stewart.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's left to say?
</P>
<P>
   Paul Azinger wasn't thinking about Payne Stewart as he stood
over a 5-foot putt on the 72d hole of last summer's US Open at
Pinehurst No. 2. ``All I was thinking about was getting to Pebble
Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew he needed that putt to secure a top 15 finish, which
would bring an exemption into the next year's championship. Azinger
made the putt, but his vision of the stunning holes along the
Pacific aren't what they were following last summer's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``With what has happened since, Payne's death and everything,
the feeling is not quite as special,'' said Azinger. ``It's going
to be very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Azinger was perhaps Stewart's closest friend on Tour, and the
tragedy has scarred him emotionally more so than other PGA Tour
players because also killed were Robert Fraley and Van Ardan,
agents for both players. (Bruce Borland, a design associate with
Jack Nicklaus's course architecture company, and pilots Michael
King and Stephanie Bellegarrigue were also killed.)
</P>
<P>
   Azinger has been quiet most of the year when asked about
Stewart, but as Pebble Beach approaches, reporters have besieged
him. ``I'll do one press conference Tuesday and talk about it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Mike Hicks, don't know what more to say. He was
Stewart's caddie in 1991 when they defeated Scott Simpson in a
playoff at Hazeltine, then again in 1993, at Baltusrol, and 1998,
at The Olympic Club, when fourth-round US Open leads were
squandered to Lee Janzen. And, most definitely, he was there last
summer at Pinehurst No. 2 when Stewart rolled in the longest
72d-hole putt to clinch a US Open title.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks is the fellow in the memorable picture, the one leaping
into Stewart's arms, teammates in victory, friends in life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hicks works for Bob Estes. He has suffered, talked about
it, and suffered some more. He has said everything he wants to say,
so quietly he will spend this week at Pebble Beach by the side of
Estes, whose swing coach is Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has indicated that he's a little tired of talking about it
because it gets so emotional and he's tired of being put through
that all the time,'' said Estes of Hicks. ``It will be a difficult
week for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because Hicks, like Cook, knew Stewart as so much more
than the inside-the-ropes showbiz performer, the guy with the
knickers and cap who felt it was important to stand out from the
crowd. After he had won his second US Open _ and third major
championship _ on Father's Day last June, Stewart celebrated not
with Hollywood types, but with regular people at Hicks's home a few
hours from Pinehurst.
</P>
<P>
   They drove through the night in Hicks's truck, drank beers until
4:30 a.m., got a few hours sleep, then took part in a charity golf
tournament that the caddie had organized months earlier. Little did
they know that it would follow a US Open triumph, but with very
little fanfare, Stewart kept his commitment.
</P>
<P>
   He was, after all, a changed man.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Changing speeds
</P>
<P>
   The Payne Stewart who will be remembered so warmly during this
week's US Open was far different from the Payne Stewart who rubbed
colleagues the wrong way when he arrived on the PGA Tour scene in
1981. Fiercely competitive, Stewart was so cocky as to be
borderline arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1989 Nabisco Championship (now the Tour Championship),
Stewart let the event slip away and lost on the second hole of a
playoff to Tom Kite, one of the game's most admired players. Cook
was stunned to the point of embarrassment when he watched Stewart
storm off without shaking hands, the ultimate act of disrespect in
a game that prides itself on sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991, when he won the US Open, Payne wasn't an outgoing
guy, at least not warm to the USGA,'' said Tom Meeks, director of
rules and competitions for the ruling body of golf in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say that I only knew Payne Stewart through a
casual relationship before (the 1998 US Open). I'm sure he knew of
me through the USGA, but we were never friends.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time fate brought Meeks into close contact with Stewart
at The Olympic Club in 1998, an amazing transformation had come
over the sweet-swinging gallery darling who remained popular
despite just one win in the previous six years. Though his game had
slipped, Stewart had strengthened his ties to his wife and two
children, mostly through a spiritual rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one of the things I admired about him _ he became a
very special person, such a well-rounded, devoted family man,''
said Meeks. ``I looked forward to establishing a stronger
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and Meeks were an interlocked story at each of the last
two US Opens, the player in contention and the head rules guy whose
job it is to move along players. ``I keep telling Tom,'' said
Stewart during his celebratory soiree with the media last year at
Pinehurst, ``this is a golf tournament, not a track meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeks laughed when reminded of that statement, knowing full well
that it was vintage Stewart, always prodding, always trying to get
the edge.
</P>
<P>
   At both The Olympic Club in 1998 and Pinehurst No. 2 in 1999,
Stewart was the third-round leader and thus situated in the final
group. He was trying to hold together a shaky game two years ago
when he came upon a most unpleasant sight: His tee shot at the
short, par-4 12th had landed in a sand-filled divot.
</P>
<P>
   The old Payne Stewart most likely would have kicked dirt and
tossed a tantrum, but this Payne Stewart chomped on his gum and
almost snickered. He pondered the situation, changed clubs three or
four times, slapped his second shot into the bunker, made bogey,
and got put on the clock one hole later by Meeks for being out of
place.
</P>
<P>
   Six holes later, Stewart had lost a second US Open in six years
to Lee Janzen, but unlike 1993 at Baltusrol when he pouted, this
time he stood tall and told the media that he had blown the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't happy,'' said Meeks, ``but contrary to what people
may think, he did not have an ax to grind. He handled it very well.
He didn't blame me, didn't blame the USGA. He informed me that he
was in a sand-filled divot and explained that he took his time to
decide how to hit the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Meeks was in Orlando for a rules seminar
when he sneaked away for golf at Isleworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my friends said, `Hey, Tom, there's Payne Stewart on
the practice tee,' and I immediately walked toward him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to say that when he saw me, he walked toward me,
too. You never would have recognized him without the cap and
knickers. He had on Bermuda shorts. He said, `We have to talk,' and
I said, `That's exactly what I was hoping to hear you say.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, his seminar wrapped up, Meeks returned to
Isleworth to play a casual nine holes with Stewart, who brought
along his son, Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart kept on Meeks about sand-filled divots, how they should
be considered ``ground under repair,'' but the USGA official held
firm. Stewart may have felt he was leading the debate when Meeks
asked him if he had ever practiced shots out of a sand-filled
divot. Stewart was speechless, a rarity for him, though he offered
a sly smile, as if to concede that Meeks had scored.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drama at Pinehurst
</P>
<P>
   Their paths crossed in 1999, almost a carbon copy of The Olympic
Club. Only this time Stewart was not on the clock, though slow play
was at issue.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by the deja vu, the same man who had stumbled badly
down the stretch at The Olympic Club was near-spectacular in the
closing pressure-cooker of Pinehurst. He drained a 25-footer to
save par at the 16th, then a 3-footer for birdie at the par-3 17th
put him in the lead. The 18th? It's forever etched in golf folklore
_ a drive into the right rough, 9-iron layup, lob wedge to about 15
feet, one scintillating, dead-in-the-hole, major-winning putt, and
a knockout punch into the misty North Carolina air.
</P>
<P>
   It is the most vivid memory many people will carry of a golfer
who had ridden his talents to the top of his profession while
growing into a person of great character. Not Chuck Cook, though.
</P>
<P>
   He will sit on that wall at some point this week and remember a
guy with whom he saw the world, one golf course at a time, and all
the songs they sung in all the pubs they had visited after the
day's competition had ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of him as a US Open champ,'' said Cook. ``I
think of him as a friend. I think of all the people this had
affected _ his wife (Tracey) and children (Chelsea, 14, and Aaron,
11). Aaron is so much like Payne; he needs a father figure to take
him fishing and golfing. That's what hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears will flow when Cook sits on that wall, the same wall on
which he sat with Stewart in the spring of 1992. As reigning
champion, Stewart had been brought in for a media day to promote
that summer's US Open at Pebble Beach, returning the trophy, of
course, and taking along Cook. Well into the night, Stewart and
Cook drank champagne _ the really expensive stuff, Cristal _ and
toasted their friendship and good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   How fitting then, Stewart and Cook thought last June, that they
would again be returning to a US Open at Pebble Beach as reigning
champions. Indeed, they agreed to again sit on that wall, sip
champagne, listen to one crashing wave after another, and give
thanks.
</P>
<P>
   And so they shall.

DETECTIVES ASK FOR LETTERS ALLEGEDLY WRITTEN BY MISSING WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD ESPINOZA  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Detectives
investigating the deaths or disappearances of as many as eight
women and a baby have asked the mother of one woman for letters her
daughter purportedly mailed from Europe after she told relatives
she was going to work for John Edward Robinson Sr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beverly Bonner, who once lived in Cameron, Mo., has not been
seen since 1994, when she told relatives Robinson had found her a
job. The occasional typewritten letters with Bonner's signature
stopped arriving in January 1997. The last letter was dated in
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they wanted her letters so they might do the DNA on
the stamps and so forth,'' said the mother, who spoke to a reporter
Saturday on the condition that her name and location not be
published. She said she mailed the letters about the middle of last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner's mother asked a detective who called last week from
Lenexa whether her daughter was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their answer was that they needed proof, dental work or some
proof to confirm their thinking,'' the mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning police told Bonner's brother that the
confirmation had come through dental records, the mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Several investigators Saturday refused to say whether they
believed Bonner was dead, or whether they were looking into her
disappearance. They said only that they were continuing to try to
identify the bodies that were discovered in barrels on Robinson's
land outside La Cygne, Kan., and in a storage unit he rented in
Raymore.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to identify those bodies were ongoing this weekend, said
Johnson County, Kan., District Attorney Paul Morrison, whose office
is part of the investigations. ``Progress is being made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who has not been charged in connection with any of the
disappearances or deaths, has been held in the Johnson County Adult
Detention Center since June 2. A judge set a $5 million bond after
Robinson was charged with sexually assaulting two women who met him
for sadomasochistic sex and with stealing more than $700 worth of
sex toys from one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner first may have met Robinson when she worked in the
library of the Western Missouri Correctional Center in Cameron,
Mo., according to her second husband, William Bonner of Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was released in 1993. The next year, Bonner divorced
her husband, left Cameron and met up with Robinson, her family
said.
</P>
<P>
   At first Bonner told her mother that Robinson had found her work
with the overseas branch of a U.S. company that made perfume and
other products, but she could not say exactly what the job was or
where she would be stationed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her mail was always sent to a letter drop in Olathe, Kansas,
and then it was forwarded on to her. Her letters (home) never had a
return address,'' Bonner's mother said. ``She always said it was
information she couldn't divulge, and she said to trust her.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner's relatives were worried, but the letters they received
with postmarks from foreign countries where her family thought she
was living were sprinkled with details that made them believe she
was safe and happy with her mysterious job.
</P>
<P>
   The typed messages over the signature ``Love, Bev'' described
current events in Moscow when she was purportedly living there, and
a letter from Amsterdam, Netherlands, accurately described a street
her mother had seen before. And although they were typewritten,
Bonner's mother said, the words sounded like her daughter's.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives investigating Robinson have said they are looking
into his connection to Lisa Stasi, a 19-year-old woman who
disappeared from Overland Park, Kan., in 1985 after telling her
family that she had signed four blank sheets of paper for Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Stasi's family later received typewritten letters over her
signature that said she was leaving Overland Park, Kan., with her
5-month-old daughter and no longer wanted to be in touch with them.
</P>
<P>
   One of Stasi's relatives told a detective at the time that she
was suspicious because Stasi could not type and the words did not
sound like hers.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner wrote to her family that she was traveling to Australia
and different parts of Europe, and that she stopped in Amsterdam
many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (employees) seemed to come through Amsterdam, and that
seemed to be their headquarters where they went after each
assignment, if this is fact and not fiction,'' her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, Bonner's family received the last letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said that she'd be leaving Russia after the 5th of
December 1996, and they would be going to Amsterdam and they would
be going on to their next assignment, which was in China,''
Bonner's mother said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter ended, ``Remember that I love you, and I'll be in
touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner's mother worried after three months passed without word
from her daughter. Then six months went by, and then nine, and the
family knew they had to begin searching for their relative.
</P>
<P>
   The company Bonner claimed to be working for said she was not an
employee, the mother said. The family then turned to U.S. Rep.
Cliff Stearns, who represents Florida's 6th District, for help.
</P>
<P>
   They received a State Department letter from Stearns saying that
the U.S. government would keep an eye out for Bonner overseas, but
that they could not put her family in touch with her without her
permission, her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives also tried contacting banks but heard nothing about
Bonner's fate until police called from Lenexa.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner's mother said the news from police only confirmed what
she had come to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fact is a fact,'' she said. ``I had closure because she's
been missing for 3 years _ at least 3 years.''

LUKAS WINS WITH SLOW HAND 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Each year on Belmont Stakes Day, the New York Racing
Association does a favor for ABC and provides a dress rehearsal for
the big race.
</P>
<P>
   For the unknowing fan, it seems odd that the fourth race is
always run at 1 1/2 miles, a distance that usually attracts an
average collection of claiming and allowance horses. For that
unknowing fan, it is always a mystery just who in the motley
collection can run the distance seldom run on dirt in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But that race is not run for the fans, but for a television
network. The distance is the same as the Belmont distance and the
network gets to practice its camera angles at the starting gate,
its shots on the clubhouse turn, and its pans down the backstretch
to iron out any last glitches two hours before the big race.
</P>
<P>
   And once again Saturday, that fourth race was run at the Belmont
distance. It is not important who won, but what stands out _ in
light of what happened in the Belmont Stakes itself _ is the time
of the race run by the motley collection.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the motley crew ran 1 1/2 miles in 2 minutes 31.40
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, Commendable won the Belmont Stakes in 2:31.19,
a mere fifth of a second faster. Only once in the last 30 Belmonts
has a winner won in a time slower than 2:30, and that was Thunder
Gulch's 2:32 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called up Coach a couple of weeks ago,'' said Bob Lewis, who
owns Commendable with his wife Beverly, ``and I said, `Coach, you
sure we're doing the right thing' '' in running the horse in the
Belmont?
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach,'' of course is D. Wayne Lukas, the former basketball
coach and the trainer of Commendable. Lukas had spent hours
studying the field for Saturday's Belmont. Lukas's analysis was
confirmed: Commendable would be facing a most motley crew in this
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   And as Commendable's jockey Pat Day later would say, ``I've
learned over the years that you can't leave Mr. Lukas out in the
big races.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas surprised all when his reformed claiming horse,
Charismatic, won the 1999 Kentucky Derby and nearly pulled off a
Triple Crown, just as he surprised all when Cat Thief stole the
Breeders' Cup Classic last November. Over the years, Lukas has
pulled off this trick time and again; winning big races with horses
who either seem as if they don't belong, or seem off form.
</P>
<P>
   And the horses often pay big prices, much as Commendable's
$39.60 did Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people say, `You can't do something,' I feed off that and
my help feeds off that,'' said Lukas, whose win Saturday was his
fourth in the Belmont Stakes. ``I told Bob and Beverly Lewis an
hour before the race, `We do our best when it's least expected.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas seemed to take as much pride after Saturday's shocker that
his analysis of the race's talent (or lack thereof) was right on
the bull's-eye. With Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus and Preakness
winner Red Bullet out of the Belmont, all knew this would be a
Belmont Lite.
</P>
<P>
   But Lukas went further. ``I spent hours analyzing the other
horses in the race _ I mean, I did it personally, _ as far as the
opposition was concerned,'' said Lukas. ``And you have to go with
the cards you're dealt.''
</P>
<P>
   The slowness of the race proved that Lukas was on target. This
was the weakest Belmont in memory, and a comparison of the internal
splits of the times run by the motley crew in the fourth race and
the almost-as-motley crew in the Belmont confirmed it.
</P>
<P>
   The horses who'll never be remembered ran a half-mile in 48 1/5
seconds, compared with the slower 49 seconds in the Belmont. The
fourth race's time for 6 furlongs was 1:12 1/5, nearly two seconds
faster than the 1:14 of the Belmont. And the motley crew in the
fourth race ran their first mile in 1:38, compared with the slower
1:39.11 in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to look at what you're up against,'' said
Lukas. ``We didn't come into the race with any grandiose thoughts
that we could win the race, but maybe we were the only ones who
believed in the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Or knew how motley were the rest of the Belmont entries.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 67,810 fans flocked to Belmont on a 95-degree day even if
they sensed what Lukas knew in his head _ this was a most ordinary
field.
</P>
<P>
   And if any lessons are to be learned _ finally _ about D. Wayne
Lukas, it is these: the worse his horse looks on paper, the more
the horse should be feared. And Lukas always _ always _ has his
horses ready for the biggest races.

DUCKS PICK UP GOALIE GIGUERE FROM CALGARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Mighty Ducks general manager Pierre Gauthier usually
doesn't part with high draft choices. The player he gets in return,
he said, has to be ``pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier and the Anaheim scouting staff believed 23-year-old
goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere is good enough that the Ducks sent
their second-round choice in the 2000 NHL Entry draft to Calgary in
a deal completed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Giguere, a No.1 pick (13th overall) of Hartford in 1995, played
seven games with the Flames last season. He went 1-3-1 with a 2.73
goals-against average and a .914 save percentage.
</P>
<P>
   His only win came Dec. 29, 1999 against the Ducks. Giguere is
8-14-2 in 30 NHL appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know him well ... our goaltending is a lot better today
than it was yesterday,'' said Gauthier, who added top prospects
like Giguere are more readily available this year because teams
don't want to lose a goalie and get nothing in return in the
upcoming expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Hebert and backup Dominic Roussel had subpar 1999-2000
seasons, but Gauthier stressed the acquisition of Giguere shouldn't
be over-analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big-picture thing,'' said Gauthier.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to Hebert's age (33), Gauthier said, ``It's not just
about next season. Now we have two good young goalies in the system
(Giguere and Greg Naumenko, in addition to veteran Corey Hirsch).
It's certainly an improvement in our depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier refused to say where Giguere would fit into Anaheim's
plans next season, but he believes Hebert is capable of returning
to form.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know Guy is a better goalie,'' Gauthier said. ``He has
been a good goalie in the past and he will be again. But you need
more than one or two goalies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, you need three.'' &QL;

THIS RIVER LEADS TO SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. _ The Cooper River runs straight from here to
Sydney _ for some people. For others, it's a diversion to
Switzerland. These are the US Olympic rowing trials. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Some boats, like the unchallenged men's and women's eights, get
a free pass to this summer's Games. Others, like the men's pair and
women's single and double, still have to earn a berth at a special
qualifying regatta in Lucerne next month.
</P>
<P>
   But a few, like Aquil Abdullah, Worcester, Mass., attorney
Christine Collins and Boston-based Steve Tucker and Conal Groom,
can get their tickets here Sunday. And if Abdullah can nail down a
second victory Sunday morning in the best-of-three finals, he'll
become rowing's Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was Jackie Robinson's intention to become the
first black ballplayer in the major leagues,'' said the 26-year-old
sculler from Washington, D.C., who would be the first
African-American male rower to make an Olympic team. ``He just
wanted to play baseball. All I want to do is row. My goal is to go
to the Olympics. Everything else is gravy.''
</P>
<P>
   Once former world champion Jamie Koven switched back to sweep
rowing, the door was open for Abdullah, who put his first foot
through Saturday by outpulling Don Smith, last autumn's Head of the
Charles champion, by half a length. Now, he has two races to win
one.
</P>
<P>
   So do Henry Nuzum, last year's Harvard captain and partner Mike
Ferry, who handled David Gleeson and Chris Duffy by a length in the
men's double.
</P>
<P>
   History and form say that nearly all of Saturday's victors
should prevail Sunday. Collins and Sarah Garner, who breezed past
Angie Cummins and Whitney Post by open water in the women's
lightweight double, should win a medal in Sydney in September. So,
too, could Karen Kraft and Missy (Schwen) Ryan, who took silver in
the women's pair in Atlanta and dunked Lianne Nelson and Katie
Maloney by nearly 2 lengths Saturday. And Tucker and Groom, who
handled Bill Belden and Greg Ruckman by just under a length, figure
to make the Olympic final in the men's lightweight double.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody else gets a US jersey and a promissory note. Because
the men's pair, four, and quad and the women's single and double
didn't qualify for the Games at last year's world regatta in
Ontario, they'll have to do it overseas. ``I feel somewhat
responsible for that,'' said Carol Skricki of Norwood, Mass., who
missed the cut in the double with former partner Cindy Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   This year Skricki is teamed with Ruth Davidon, who made the
single final in Atlanta, retired to go to med school, then came
back for another shot at Olympus. If they hold off Elizabeth Smith
and Julia Chilicki again Sunday, they're off to Lucerne. Or, they
can turn down the spot and go in the quad, which has already
qualified and has a better medal chance Down Under. ``It's nice to
have a choice like that,'' said the 37-year-old Skricki, a former
rock musician who didn't begin rowing until she was 30.
</P>
<P>
   If Skricki and Davidon opt for Lucerne, they can get a group
rate. Monica Tranel-Michini will be going over if she beats world
lightweight medalist Lisa Schlenker in the women's single. So will
the Augusta, Ga., quad of Sean Hall, Jake Wetzel, Ian McGowan, and
Nick Peterson, if they can best the Princeton entry of Phil Henry,
Tom Murray, Ben Holbrook, and Cy Beasley (of Newburyport, Mass.).
As will the pair of West Newton's Ted Murphy and Sebastian Bea, who
squelched Adam Holland and Tom Bohrer by a length in a showdown of
old partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only thinking about one race,'' said Murphy, who rowed
in the eight in Atlanta and won a world bronze with Holland in
1997. ``We're going to try to finish this tomorrow.''

CLAMPETT, THE PLAYER, BACK AT PEBBLE BEACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a field of 150 players, there will be many wonderful tales
this week as the United States Golf Association conducts its 100th
Open championship. Unlike the weekly Tour events, the US Open is
special because it adds slices of life that are desperately lacking
week in and week out.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to tee it up at Pebble Beach are some amateurs who caught
lightning in their golf bags for a few days at sectional qualifying
and a splattering of club pros and mini-tour players who somehow
put it together after years of missing out. Great stories, all of
them, amid the glitz that surrounds golfers such as Tiger Woods and
David Duval. But no story is as personal as that of Bobby Clampett,
whose return to Pebble Beach as a competitor will be one of the
sidelights to this week's festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Clampett grew up in Monterey, Calif., and you can do a lot worse
in life than call Pebble Beach your ``home course.'' It is where he
won the Junior Tournament of Champions and went undefeated during
two marches to the California State Amateur. His first professional
win came there, and if not for a mental error, his first PGA Tour
win may have come in the Crosby Pro-Am.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1981, back when Clampett joined young guys named
Payne Stewart and Mark O'Meara, John Cook and Fred Couples, Hal
Sutton and Scott Hoch in chasing the professional golf life. It is
hard to believe that Clampett is now 40 and nearly seven years
retired from the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Familywise, it was stressful,'' said Clampett of his decision
to get off the PGA Tour in the early 1990s. His third child was
born just after Christmas 1991 and Clampett saw a picture that
needed better focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I wanted to be a dad to my kids and a husband to my
wife. My commitment to the game wasn't what it had to be to be
successful. I had cut back to 15 or 16 tournaments a year, but my
game wasn't good enough to stay exempt playing so little.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, his spot on the money list slipped from the security
of inside 100 to the anxiety of outside 125 to the nowhere world of
outside 150. Everywhere he looked, ``I saw young kids who were
hungry the way I used to be hungry,'' and that convinced him it was
time to get out. He traded in PGA for CBS, and has been part of the
network's golf coverage for six years now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incredible opportunity,'' said Clampett, ``something
I enjoy so much. Priorities in my life is what I wanted and this
has given me the chance for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pebble Beach being Pebble Beach, the lure of the 2000 US
Open was too strong to resist, so Clampett honed his game and
cashed in as one of the longest of long shots by making it into the
field. He is one of the few who can say he made it through local,
then sectional challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Clampett shot 68-67 at Woodmont CC's North and South courses
Monday to earn a berth in his seventh US Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been remarkable, a lot of well-wishers, just an
unbelievable feeling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His CBS friends have been his biggest boosters. Jim Nantz has
promised to walk every hole with him at Pebble Beach, and Ken
Venturi has gone a step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over dinner, I kiddingly asked him what I had to do to make
the Presidents Cup team,'' said Clampett. ``He said, `Win the
Open.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `If I win the Open, will I be on the Presidents Cup
team?' and he said, `That's a promise. You'll be on the Presidents
Cup team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's a wild, wonderful dream, one that probably will not come
true. Which is OK, because Clampett is quite proud of the one that
already has.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not one for the books
</P>
<P>
   In the months, weeks, and days leading up to the 1999 Ryder Cup,
Mark James often lent comic relief and a lighthearted perspective
to a mixture that was all too serious. But like all good things,
James's act had to end; now would someone kindly tell him to go
away? He has contributed something that the world does not need _
another golf book _ which, of course, is not a crime. What is a
sin, however, is that he felt compelled to drag private locker room
talk into the public domain and take cheap shots at a list of
people from US captain Ben Crenshaw to Tom Lehman to Nick Faldo.
The part of the book that stirred emotions overseas was James's
admission that he gleefully discarded a good-luck note sent by
Faldo, refusing to share it with the team. How utterly childish.
Like him or not, Faldo is the most accomplished Ryder Cup player in
history, one who poured his heart and soul into the event, and if
not for arguably the greatest wedge shot in the event's history _
Faldo's third shot to the 18th at Oak Hill in 1995 that set up a
crucial winning par against Curtis Strange _ the 1997 and 1999
matches may not have been what they were. Sure, Faldo offered
criticism of Colin Montgomerie for not challenging himself by
playing more in the US. So what? There was more than a grain of
truth to that comment, and, besides, Faldo had already squared
things with Montgomerie. James's act with Faldo's note was silly,
but nothing compared with his huge blunders as captain. First, he
should have had Bernhard Langer or Faldo on the team ahead of
Andrew Coltart. Second, he never should have burned out his top
nine players. It's hard to believe that James will survive as an
assistant to captain Sam Torrance for the 2001 event at The Belfry
. . . Brad Faxon did not get into the Masters field this year, but
he played Augusta National with some members before the club closed
in mid-May. ``I played the members' tees and felt like Tiger,''
said Faxon . . . Sutton is the latest to commit to the Greater
Hartford Open (June 29-July 2). He joins an already-rich field that
includes Davis Love, Justin Leonard, John Daly, Casey Martin, Mike
Weir, Paul Azinger, and Zoeller.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Check that list
</P>
<P>
   You thought we were done with all those lists when 1999 ended?
Not a chance. Golf Digest, as part of its 50th anniversary
celebration, has listed _ appropriately _ the top 50 golfers in
history. No surprise that Jack Nicklaus is No. 1, or, for that
matter, that Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, Bobby Jones, and Byron Nelson
fall in behind him. (Woods comes in at No. 12, behind No. 10 Mickey
Wright but ahead of No. 17 Babe Zaharias.) There are, however, some
very glaring entries and omissions. Ray Floyd (No. 21) and Greg
Norman (22d) seem awfully high, while Ben Crenshaw (44) would not
be on my ballot, despite his two green jackets. (Jose Maria
Olazabal has two green jackets, too. Where is he?) Two-time US Open
champs Strange (33) and Ernie Els (40) get the nod, but the
always-forgotten Henry Picard (Masters and PGA winner) doesn't. The
prejudice in favor of US Open champs is obvious when Tom Kite (42)
somehow finds his way onto the list, yet Denny Shute (two PGAs, one
British Open; twice a US Open runner-up), Jack Burke Jr. (Masters,
PGA), and Love (PGA) do not. Go figure. Then again, why bother?
After all, without a Tom Morris _ old or young, doesn't matter _
and my personal favorite, Tony Lema, the list is lacking . . .
Perhaps you noticed a familiar name in the British Amateur: Raul
Ballesteros, nephew of the once-magical Seve. He shot 72-74 to
easily qualify but was ousted in the third round. The son of
Baldomero Ballesteros attended school in England and, at 19, is
tall and slender, and though he very much resembles his famous
uncle, Raul said it was his father who inspired him to play. He
has, of course, played many times with his uncle . . . As for Seve,
a painful hip forced him to withdraw after eight holes of the Wales
Open Thursday. A triple-bogey on the first hole added to the pain,
no doubt . . . While Australian Open champion Aaron Baddeley takes
his struggling game into the US Open on a special exemption, his
colleague from the Victoria Institute of Sport, Brad Lamb, made
news in the British Amateur. During a match against medalist Tim
Rice of Ireland, Lamb was in his backswing in the fairway when he
noticed his ball move ever so slightly. Lamb called a one-shot
penalty on himself, halved the hole, then went 1-down at the 17th
on a Rice chip-in. Perhaps rewarded for his integrity, Lamb squared
the match at the 18th with a 25-foot putt and won at the 19th hole
when Rice made bogey. Lamb also lost in the third round.

   James Driscoll, fresh off his ninth-place finish in the NCAA
Championship, is back home after graduating from the University of
Virginia. Indeed, it seems so few days ago that Driscoll was
leaving Brookline High School for college. He came up short in US
Open sectional qualifying Monday at Woodmont CC in Rockville, Md.,
though his 70-71 effort in a field dominated by PGA Tour veterans
was admirable. There is the Sunnehanna Amateur this weekend, then
the Northeast Amateur June 22-25, before Driscoll treats himself to
some time off before pursuing a third State Amateur (July 10-14 at
Worcester CC). He is exempt into the US Amateur (Aug. 21-27 at
Baltusrol) via his quarterfinal effort a year ago when he lost to
eventual champ David Gossett . . . The Norfolk County Women's
Classic is on tap July 7, a four-ball competition open to any woman
with a handicap. The entry fee is $90 per team, with entries due
June 30. Defending champs are Jane Welch and Jane Heggie . . .
Finally, do be careful if a Lee Chi-ming arrives some day for a
round of golf at your club. It seems the gentleman from Hong Kong
has been labeled a menace, ``so incompetent that every time he
strikes the ball, there's an obvious risk for anyone in front of
him,'' according to a judge who heard a case in which Lee was being
sued by a female caddie. Chau Fung-yee was seeking damages after
being hit in the mouth by an errant shot struck by Lee. The
defendant ``should not have played golf at all because he exposed
people to danger,'' said the caddie's lawyer. Good gracious, it
sounds like a charge many of us are guilty of.

PIERCE BRINGS HOME FRENCH OPEN CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ They would forgive her anything, these citizens of
France. Mary Caroline Pierce couldn't get arrested in Paris if she
swiped Mona Lisa from the Louvre, spray-painted graffiti on the Arc
de Triomphe, or trampled flower beds in the Tuilleries Garden.
</P>
<P>
   She can do no wrong around here because she did so much right in
restoring to France the tennis championship of France, her adopted
post office box.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it took the French a while to overlook her abundant supply
of American blood, her high school French, and the fact that she
has always lived elsewhere. She made them uncomfortable, drove them
to tears and boos while failing, often miserably, during 10
previous shots at the French Open title.
</P>
<P>
   But that was all forgotten just before 5 p.m. Saturday when
Mighty Mary pounded a 93 mile-per-hour serve that handcuffed a
Spaniard who had beaten her here a year ago in the second round.
Conchita Martinez fought a pesky delaying action, and held chances
to go ahead, 3-0, in the second set, but it was Pierce and France's
day at Stade Roland Garros, 6-2, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   As Martinez's feckless last swing sent the yellow ball trickling
along the muddy-looking soil toward the net, the mob filling Court
Central exploded with the kind of roar that must have accompanied
the storming of the Bastille. One of the 15,166 stood up and
shrugged her shoulders joyfully. She was Francoise Durr, the most
recently crowned queen of France _ and that was 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, my shoulders feel lighter,'' she said with a laugh.
``I'm not carrying that around anymore. Now we have Mary and it's
wonderful. There is more attention now, more good players. I beat
an Australian, Lesley Turner. The stadium was smaller then, and it
wasn't full. We were amateurs in 1967, the year before prize money
began, and I received a voucher that I could exchange for $200 in
merchandise at a store. What did Mary get _ $575,000?''
</P>
<P>
   It's been 33 long, frustrating years (17 since Yannick Noah won
the men's title). This was a hungry crowd, starving for a champion
of their own _ so hungry they would have even eaten American food
if that were required to get it done. Instead, they were presented
with a magnum of half-and-half, and it went down splendidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is French, my father American. The reason this
tournament means so much to me, more special than my Australian
title in 1995, is my Frenchness,'' said Pierce. ``When my father
made the decision to play for France, I was 13. Twelve years ago. I
didn't like it because I had to leave my friends at school in
Treasure Island (Fla.). Other than that, you're 13 and your parents
make the decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted funding from the US Tennis Association, and I think
they were willing but didn't want my father involved. So my mother
contacted the French Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought me here to practice. I lived in a dorm room here
at Roland Garros for a while. I couldn't speak French. I was alone,
13. I cried myself to sleep every night. It was tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever had come up short so many times before becoming the
French champ. But 11 was Pierce's winning roll. She made the final
six years ago but was so tight and useless she could have
impersonated Venus de Milo. Arantxa Sanchez Vicario thought she was
up against a creation of Rodin.
</P>
<P>
   But lately Pierce has trained her emotions and nerves like a pet
dog: sit; be still; down. All the while, her strokes growl and
bite. Never had she attacked so forcefully and with such
self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the sluggish clay underfoot, she was looking to
charge at every opportunity, banging daring swinging volleys,
scoring sometimes from her shoe tops. She set up shop inside the
baseline and hammered her groundies ferociously, particularly the
double-barreled backhand.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was trying, countering with more spins than a White
House spokesman. Martinez, a wizard of swirl and angles, threw
every imaginable slice, topspin, chop, moonball, drop shot and
trajectory at Pierce. That kept proceedings moving, almost two
hours' worth, but couldn't short-circuit the firepowering Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   With one set in her purse, Pierce paused and faltered enough to
let Martinez breathe, grab the first two games of the second, and
twice have points with serve for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the important game,'' Pierce said. It stretched nine
minutes and four deuces, during which the sun momentarily pierced a
cold, oily sky, and concluded with Pierce goading Martinez to a
backhand error.
</P>
<P>
   Rugged backhands sank Martinez's serve to 6-5, and ``my dream,
this championship'' began to fill out. It was Pierce's turn to
serve. One game for the bundle, and it wasn't easy. The nerves
wouldn't entirely roll over and play dead.
</P>
<P>
   In Durr's year, 1967, a band called Procul Harum had a hit
called ``A Whiter Shade of Pale.'' The blond and fair Pierce fit
the title as she went to the line to serve. Another nine-minute
ordeal. She butchered two match points, was beached at deuce three
times, and Martinez even had a break point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was always my dream . . . and I never thought I'd do
it,'' said Pierce. ``I went through so many emotions here, so many
disappointments. Now I was so close. The third match point I got
fired up, and I was like, `OK, you've lost two. This is the third.
Usually the third is the good one. Let's try and win this one.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's valedictory serve was too much for Martinez, and the
color returned to her cheeks, the sparkle to eyes that soon dripped
tears.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce was the girl who had been pushed, and pushed around, by
her father, hired out to a foreign land where she wasn't really
wanted. She became the woman who won Australia _ and then was
dropped by famous coach Nick Bollettieri (as her ranking dropped to
No. 20) because ``she's out of shape and won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   She could identify with the Perils of Pauline. But Saturday it
was the Marvels of Mary. Maybe she hadn't always seemed sweet
French toast, but at last she was the toast of France.

COMMENDABLE EFFORT BY LUCKAS, DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Those who ignore trainer D. Wayne Lukas and jockey
Pat Day do so at their own peril. That was the lesson learned from
Saturday's 132d running of the Belmont Stakes, as racing's dynamic
duo combined to win with Commendable, an 18-1 ($39.60 to win) shot,
who, frankly, would have been sent away at much higher odds were it
not for the reputations of his conditioner and rider.
</P>
<P>
   Commendable, a son of Gone West, broke his maiden at Del Mar
last August, but had not finished better than fourth in his
following six starts before the Belmont, a streak which included a
dreadful 17th in the Kentucky Derby. Saturday, however, he stalked
hopeless front-runner Hugh Hefner, took over with ease on the turn,
and boldly held off late-charging 8-5 favorite Aptitude by 1 1/2
lengths in front of 67,810.
</P>
<P>
   Unshaded and Shane Sellers also rallied to gain the show, a
length back. The time for the 1 1/2 miles was a slow 2:31 on a fast
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evaluation to run in this race concerned not so much how
Commendable was doing because, obviously, he was doing very well,''
said Lukas, who had said before Wednesday's draw that he was only
50-50 to enter Commendable. ``The more I looked at the field, the
more confident I was that we could have an impact. I spent more
energy analyzing the other horses than training my own horse. I
didn't predict a win, but I knew, with Day up, we'd be in the
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the fourth Belmont victory for Lukas, and the third for
Day. Lukas teamed with Day to win the 1994 Belmont with Tabasco
Cat, and also tallied with Thunder Gulch ('95), and Editor's Note
('96). Day's other triumph came with Easy Goer in 1989. The other
members of Team Commendable are owners Bob and Beverly Lewis. The
Lewises won their first Belmont, after losing Triple Crown bids
with Silver Charm in 1997, and Charismatic last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was counting on Mr. Lukas's decision to run him,'' said Day.
``You can't count him out in one of these fixtures. Mr. Lukas asked
me to have an energy-saving trip. The horse was very relaxed. He
coasted along all the way. He took me to the lead on the turn. At
that point, I hadn't asked him to run, but I wasn't sure what I had
under me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I asked him, he responded. We didn't get to the bottom of
this horse today. I want to commend Mr. Lukas for his courage in
bringing him up here (Commendable is based at Churchill Downs) and
taking a shot. Last year, he was watching the way this horse got
over the ground and he said this was a Belmont horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lewises, the sport's top ambassadors, had won the Kentucky
Derby twice, and the Preakness three times (Timber Country in '95
being the other), but had suffered only frustration at Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was heartache in our previous Belmont runs with Silver
Charm (who just missed), and Charismatic (who broke down),'' said
Bob Lewis. ``A lot of that was erased today. I called Wayne on
Wednesday morning and asked, `Are we doing the right thing?' He
reassured me, and he and Pat brought us a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas was gracious in victory, but he couldn't resist a little
jab at the media, the majority of which gave Commendable no chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm told I can't do something, that drives our whole
organization,'' he said. ``We feed off that, and do our best work
when they don't expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Aptitude, who had run second in the Derby, was last early in the
11-horse field, and that's no way to win a Belmont. ``I was hoping
for more pace,'' said Alex Solis. ``He was spinning his wheels on
the first turn. He got better when we got to the mile pole. He got
in gear, and started running. At the eighth-pole, I still thought I
had a chance. But Commendable had too easy of a time.''
</P>
<P>
   The game gelding Unshaded, sent away at 5-1, tried hard even
though he was last after a mile. But he was overcome by heat
exhaustion past the wire, suffering in the 95-degree heat. It
looked bad for a moment, but he was quickly cooled off with ice and
cold water, and was able to walk off the track, even though the
horse ambulance had been called. Later, Unshaded walked briskly
around his barn, proving he was all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was patting myself on the back at the three-eighths pole,''
said Sellers. ``He really kicked in on the turn. I thought I was
home free. But, as we straightened out, he got the wobbles, and I
didn't know what was happening. It was a very gutty performance.
But every time you count Lukas out, he steps up. He's a tough
man.''

PACERS GETTING SHACKLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Larry Bird has done all of this before. He knows
about adversity in the NBA Finals. He knows the quirks of the 2-3-2
format. He knows about stopping unstoppable Lakers centers.
</P>
<P>
   He knows. But this time he's powerless to do much about it. Bird
can't put on a uniform, step into the paint, and bother Shaquille
O'Neal. And he can't make Reggie Miller shoot the way Larry Bird
shot in fourth quarters against the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA Finals resume Sunday night at Conseco Fieldhouse and
Bird's Pacers trail the Lakers, two games to none. In the first two
games in Los Angeles, Diesel Shaq scored 83 points while Miller
shot 25 percent (8 for 32). Meanwhile, Pacers center Rik Smits was
a cigar store Indian, bottoming out with a 16-minute, 4-point,
2-rebound no-show in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   What do you think, Larry? Time to call your players ``sissies,''
as you did after the Celtics were routed at the Forum in 1984? Time
for a Kevin McHale-like takedown of an unsuspecting Laker?
</P>
<P>
   ``What I believe is that they have to play hard,'' Bird said.
``When Shaq gets the ball underneath the basket, instead of going
up and trying to block his shot, which is almost impossible, they
have to take the hard foul and put him at the line. It's not to
hurt anyone, it's to try and save the 2 points and make him make
both.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the impact of McHale's play in '84. The Celtics had
lost two of the first three games _ and been outplayed in all three
_ when McHale's clothesline tackle of Kurt Rambis changed the
series (and the NBA rulebook).
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Maxwell said it best: ``Before that play, the Lakers were
like little kids just running across the street without looking.
But after that play, they would stop, press the `walk' button, wait
for the light to turn, then look both ways before walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Game 3 is the proverbial ``must game'' for the Pacers,
and Bird knows it. His team is in danger of being swept out of the
Finals, and only a Game 3 win will put a scare into Shaq and the LA
Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers may be without sparkling young guard Kobe Bryant, but
it hardly mattered Friday when Bryant rolled his ankle in the first
quarter and never returned. The estimable Ron Harper charged the
basket and Bryant was hardly missed. Bryant is not the problem for
the Pacers. Shaq is the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Bird went against his pledge Friday and ordered the Hack-a-Shaq
defense. It got so bad that O'Neal was actually fouled once while
he was standing out of bounds. The Big Fella took a Finals-record
39 free throws, making 18. It made for dreadful viewing as the
fourth quarter took 48 minutes. Bird was asked how this might
affect TV ratings and responded as you knew he would.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't worry about ratings,'' said the man who shot
ratings to new heights when he played. ``I'm trying to win a
ballgame right now. Whatever it takes to win a ballgame, we're
going to do it. If it takes a four-hour game, that's what we have
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the effectiveness of Hack-a-Shaq, Bird conceded, ``The
more you put him at the line, the better he gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Fred Hickman (a.k.a. the George King of NBA MVP voters),
Shaquille O'Neal is MVP of the roundball universe in 2000. There is
no second-, third-, or fourth-place finisher. He is Wilt
Chamberlain in a league that has no Bill Russell answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played as hard as we could,'' said Bird after Game 2, ``but
tonight I just thought Shaq was better than he was the other
night.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's coach, Phil Jackson, a man who played against Wilt and
Russell, said, ``His ability to dominate the game compares
favorably to Chamberlain, who could dominate both ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaq has already done something Chamberlain never did: score 40
or more points in consecutive Finals games. Only Michael Jordan,
Rick Barry, and Jerry West performed the feat.
</P>
<P>
   Pacers guard Mark Jackson, who is old enough to have seen Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar joust with Bird and the Celtics, said of Shaq, ``He is
still the best center who's ever played the game. I've seen the
best centers and he truly is a step above any other center who ever
played. He's just unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the right place at the right time,'' said O'Neal.
``I've listened and things are falling into place for me. When Kobe
went out, we felt that we had to pick it up. So I took it upon
myself to get position and take the high-percentage shots.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the Lakers and Trail Blazers were battling for the
right to play Indiana in the Finals. Shaq was largely invisible for
three quarters against Portland and one-time great center Bill
Walton (now a TV guy) was questioning O'Neal's status as a dominant
big man.
</P>
<P>
   Everything changed in that fourth quarter against the Blazers at
Staples Center and it could not have worked out worse for Larry
Bird and the Pacers. The coach and his players have no answer for
O'Neal. If they don't do something soon, the next big event at
Staples Center will be the Democratic National Convention in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Larry knows this. He just can't do anything about it.

JORDAN FINALLY AT A LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ It's a good thing for Phil Jackson that Michael
Jordan didn't have as much trouble closing games as he does
coaching deals.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan again has run into trouble simply trying to get a coach
for the Wizards. The reason is not that no one wants the job,
although that probably should suffice. This time, it's that
Jordan's newest best friend, Leonard Hamilton, has this little
buyout clause in the seven-year deal he signed two months ago to
stay at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving moral obligations aside _ we wonder what top recruit
Darius Rice may be thinking _ the situation again underscores the
folly of Jordan's position. Why is he scouring the college ranks
for an unproven pro coach when (a) his team already is paying off
two dismissed coaches and (b) he has a coach ready, willing, able,
and, most important, who understands that he's going to lose 50
games a year for the next two years?
</P>
<P>
   That person is, of course, Darrell Walker. He's one of Mike's
guys. He knows the drill. He knows he's got a bad team, as does
Mike. He would do it on the cheap for a couple years and give
Jordan the time to reconstruct the roster. Then, Jordan could
either keep him or bring in a coach to deal with the new roster.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of doing the smart thing, Jordan is reaching out to
the college ranks. Why? To have his ``own'' man? He already has a
few. To put a ``new face'' on the old product? Sorry, but coaches
don't sell tickets; just ask us in Boston. To placate the players?
Why? John Wooden couldn't get the Wizards into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is in a tough situation,'' Magic Johnson said.
``Nobody in this league wants to help him because he beat them most
of the time. No one is going to say, `I'll take Juwan (Howard), or
Rod (Strickland), or Ike Austin. Nobody wanted to help us (the
Lakers), either. That's the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to see him lose. They're smiling because he
has no cap room. But he'll break through. He has to remember it's a
business. That as much as everyone loves him, it's still a
business. It's like when I walked into a guy's office. He said,
`Magic, I love you. But how are you going to make me money?' It's
the same. Everyone loves him. Once he gets his coach, he'll be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he will be fine. But his coach will get chewed up and his
team will still stink. By then, however, he will be in a position
to rebuild and that's when he should get a new coach involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were him, I would be frustrated, too,'' Johnson said.
``But Michael will survive. He's a survivor, a champion, a winner.
It's going to take time. It's just that when we were playing, it
didn't take any time. We just went out and did it.''
</P>
<P>
   How true.

   Another bomb was dropped on the reeling Raptors last week and,
for a change, it didn't come from coach Butch Carter. It came from
Toronto's prize free agent, Tracy McGrady, who said it would be
``real tough'' for him to re-sign. It's no secret McGrady was a
lock to sign elsewhere _ Chicago seems to be the choice du jour _
but he never put it in such clear terms. McGrady said he wants to
continue playing with the Toronto veterans, all of whom ripped
Carter recently for one of the coach's many bumbling moves. McGrady
also moved away from Vince Carter in the great debate, isolating
his more celebrated teammate as the only pro-Butch voice of
consequence on the club. This is not good news for the Raptors. But
if McGrady wants to play with those players, he won't get to do so
in Chicago, Orlando, or, probably, anywhere else. So far, the
Raptors are still (publicly) committed to Butch Carter, although a
poll in the Toronto Sun had 83 percent urging the franchise to give
him the pink slip. Something's got to give. Unless there's a
coaching change, Charles Oakley probably will be moved, Dee Brown
is definitely gone, Antonio Davis has the opportunity to leave at
the end of next season, and Doug Christie wants to go. But they
still have Michael Stewart . . . The news on Jayson Williams is not
encouraging. His agent may have been floating a trial balloon or it
could be that Williams is, indeed, finished. According to agent Sal
DiFazio, if Williams can't play this season, the Nets would get
some cap relief (8 percent above the league's average salary, or
around $4 million) and then the final three years of Williams's
six-year, $85 million deal would come off the Jersey cap after the
2000-01 season . . . The Celtics are scheduled to get an
up-close-and-personal look at one of the more intriguing players in
the June 28 draft, 6-foot-10-inch Olumide Oyedeji. He's rocketed
into lottery contention after a standout performance at the Nike
Hoop Summit in April during Final Four weekend. The consensus is
that the Mavericks have the hots for him at No. 12, which makes
sense, given that Don Nelson and son Donnie love foreign players.
The Mavericks already have worked out Oyedeji and Donnie Nelson did
a clinic in Nigeria, the 19-year-old's native land. This past
season, Oyedeji played in Germany for the same team Mavericks
forward Dirk Nowitzki played for a couple of seasons ago. He would
be the third Nigerian to play in the NBA after Hakeem Olajuwon and
Obinna Ekezie (who played at Worcester Academy and the University
of Maryland). Oyedeji won't be the only foreigner the Celtics will
check out next week. Also scheduled for a visit is Hidayet
Turkoglou, a 6-8 swingman who played for Efes Pilsen in Turkey.
Unlike Oyedeji, who is free to sign with an NBA team, Turkoglou has
a buyout clause in his long-term deal with Efes Pilsen . . . Shot
Across The Bow Dept.: AEK Athens has notified the NBA it will not
sit by idly if Iakovos ``Jake'' Tsakalidis continues to insist he
is a free agent and can immediately join an NBA team after the
draft. The big Georgian (as in former USSR) has a long-term deal
with his Greek team and there is some dispute _ as there always
seems to be in these cases _ over his contract. AEK insists it
holds Tsakalidis's rights and last week, the team's coach, Dusan
Ivkovic, said he was upset that no one contacted him about the
possibility of Tsakalidis leaving for the NBA. ``Even Drazen
Petrovic or Vlade Divac asked for my permission before looking for
an NBA career,'' Ivkovic said. ``It seems there's someone behind
the entire affair. As far as I know, he's still under contract with
AEK and the management should do what is needed to protect the
team.'' Tsakalidis's agents were in Chicago at the predraft camp
assuring prospective drafters the contract was no big deal, which
is what you would expect them to say. One interesting twist is that
if there is a buyout clause, an NBA team that is over the cap and
drafts Tsakalidis (as would be the case for just about any team)
could pay no more than $350,000 to secure the 7-2 center's release.
Tsakalidis already has worked out for Vancouver, which holds the
second pick but may be willing to move down. Both Chicago and
Orlando hold multiple lottery picks and would be willing to move up
because it (a) would give them a better player and (b) would free
up cap room . . . Speaking of Chicago, can we believe reports that
the Bulls were not pleased with Chris Mihm? GM Jerry Krause never
says a thing about such matters, so could it be that the man they
call ``The Sleuth'' (among other things) purposely leaked it so
Chicago might be able to get Mihm at No. 4? Meanwhile, Marcus Fizer
may be one of those players who could really mess things up. The
word is he's measuring in at 6-6. He is not expected to go No. 1 or
No. 2 and, if the Clippers don't take him at No. 3, he could drop.
Chicago (Nos. 4 and 7) wouldn't need him with Elton Brand around,
although it might be hard for Tim Floyd to pass up the guy he
basically discovered and brought to Iowa State. The Hawks (No. 6)
already have Alan Henderson and Lorenzen Wright at the position. If
Orlando passes at No. 5, Fizer could drop to Houston (No. 9). But
that's a reach. And, in addition, in the words of one scout at
Chicago, ``He's the only guy in the draft who can draw a
double-team.''

   A floor plan
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, more than 40 bids had been entered for the 21
items of the famed parquet floor that are being auctioned online.
The top bid so far: $101,000 for the center-court piece, complete
with the leprechaun. The next-highest bid was $30,000 for a piece
that had autographs of retired players. That item had drawn the
most interest: eight bids. Someone is willing to pay $15,000 for
the panel on which John Havlicek stole the ball in 1965, but only
one bid of $5,000 has been offered for the panel on which Gerald
Henderson stole the ball in the 1984 Finals. Seven items had not
drawn any bids . . . There also are 95 items available via online
bidding from the estate of Wilt Chamberlain. The biggest seller so
far are the sneakers Chamberlain wore the night he scored 100
points. (We are presuming these are the real deal, unlike the
basketball from that game.) Someone has bid $40,000 for the
sneakers. Someone also bid $75 for Wilt's ice skates and $151 for
his lunchbox and thermos, $150 for Wilt's bowling ball, bowling
bag, bowling shoes, and bowling trophies, and a $400 bid for his
1964 passport. Bidding runs through Tuesday . . . If you've paid
attention, you may have noticed longtime referee Jess Kersey was
nowhere to be seen in the last few rounds of the playoffs. He
missed several weeks of the season because of an ailment. The
league felt it was unfair to give Kersey the plum playoff
assignments because he missed so much of the regular season . . .
The Hawks are still looking for that so-called ``veteran
assistant'' to help guide new coach Lon Kruger through his first
NBA season. They already hired Eric Musselman and Rick Mahorn, but
they need a guy who has been around the loop once or twice. The
names being mentioned include Don Chaney, Mike D'Antoni, and Jim
Lynam. Also, among those expected to interview with New Jersey is
former Grizzlies head coach Lionel Hollins. Meanwhile, the Clippers
brought in John Lucas for an interview, and he seems like a good
fit . . . The NBA Coaches Association may have its top two
executives out of work next season. President Lenny Wilkens (fired
by the Hawks) was kept on and Don Casey (let go by the Nets) is in
as the vice president from the East. (Bill Bertka is the veep from
the West.) The group has decided to add four members to its
executive committee, one per division, and three already have been
decided: Dave Wohl (Atlantic), Brian Winters (Pacific), and Phil
Johnson (Midwest) . . . Dikembe Mutombo will be honored Tuesday at
the White House for his work in his native country, the former
Zaire. Mutombo has given $3 million to help build a hospital in
Kinshasa and also is leading a fund-raising effort to raise another
$12 million to finish the project. He is involved in the country's
efforts to vaccinate the approximately 10 million children under
the age of 5 . . . And, finally, this miracles-never-cease item:
NBA.com asked readers to select the most dominant player in the
first game of the NBA Finals. You know, the one the Lakers won,
104-87, propelled by a 43-point, 19-rebound effort by Shaquille
O'Neal. More than 30,000 votes were registered and Shaq got
``only'' 89.8 percent. The rest were split among Austin Croshere,
Rick Fox, Ron Harper, and Mark Jackson. Fred Hickman denies doing
the voting.

YES, THAT'S ANOTHER COLD DRAFT YOU FEEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The NHL expansion draft _ hopefully the final one of
the millennium _ will be held June 23 in Calgary. By late
afternoon, the Columbus Blue Jackets and Minnesota Wild officially
will be members of the Original 30.
</P>
<P>
   NHL clubs turn inside-out in preparation for this event, perhaps
best known as Castaway Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, why do they worry?
</P>
<P>
   The going rate in the last phases of expansion has been $75
million-$80 million, a steep initiation fee for the right to pick
over a bunch of goalies, defensemen, and forwards who, for the most
part, are destined to remain as anonymous with their new clubs as
they were with their old ones.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the players who remain with their clubs from the last
two expansion drafts:
</P>
<P>
   Nashville (June '98): Gs Mike Dunham and Tomas Vokoun, and Fs
Greg Johnson and Scott Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (June '99): G Norm Maracle, Ds Petr Buzek, David
Harlock, Maxim Galanov, Steve Staios, and Yannick Tremblay, and Fs
Johan Garpenlov, Matt Johnson, and Mike Stapleton.
</P>
<P>
   The only good news is that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman sounded
sincere last week when he dismissed thoughts of Houston as an
expansion franchise. Adding teams, said Bettman, ``isn't on our
radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
   And if history holds, the names chosen June 23 quickly will
disappear from the screen, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anonymous GM
</P>
<P>
   The Flames surprised everybody last week by hiring 37-year-old
Craig Button as general manager. Button has front office
experience, formerly with the Dallas Stars, but the leading
candidates were Mike Murphy, Jim Nill, and Les Jackson. No one
knows whether the Flames will still be in Calgary when the puck
drops in October. The franchise could be sold, likely to Paul Allen
in Portland, Ore., if the season-ticket level (currently a little
more than 11,000) don't reach 14,000 in the next 19 days. Button
probably came at a cheaper price than Mssrs. Murphy, Nill, or
Jackson, which would make it easier for a new owner to place his
own guy in the GM's job . . . Ray Bourque's agent, Steve Freyer,
says he has had only brief conversations with Colorado GM Pierre
Lacroix about Bourque's future with the Avalanche. Bourque becomes
an unrestricted free agent July 1 and said repeatedly during the
playoffs that he: 1. would play again and 2. would like it to be in
Denver. The bet here: Look for Lacroix to wheel defenseman Sandis
Ozolinsh and re-sign Bourque to a one- or two-year deal. Ozolinsh
disappeared during the Western Conference finals (with Joe Sakic in
the sidecar) and the Avalanche won't want him back at $4
million-plus. The Avalanche have a better shot at signing Bourque
now, before Detroit, Philadelphia, and New Jersey boost the bidding
when the free agent gate opens . . . Still no word from Montreal
about the future of GM Rejean Houle. One possible scenario, if
Houle gets the gate: Guy Carbonneau (still with the Stars) will
assume the job, with the Habs adding a front office lawyer or two
to work the contracts . . . It gets nastier by the hour in Philly.
GM Bob Clarke said he would welcome back Eric Lindros, but not
unless L'Enfant Terrible dropped his two backstage wingers, agents
Carl (dad) and Bonnie (mom). Now with six concussions in 27 months,
the 27-year-old Lindros is suggesting he might take a year off to
get his head together. Meanwhile, Lindros becomes a free agent if
the Flyers don't make him an $8 million-plus qualifying offer . . .
Ex-Bruin Phil Esposito, working the Cup finals for Fox, still wears
his 1970 Cup ring every day and keeps the '72 version at home. Phil
gave the '70 ring to his father, Pat, soon after the Bruins won in
'72. ``Then, about 10 days before he passed away (in 1984), he said
to me, `Look, Phil, I want you to have the ring back . . . when I
die, I don't want to be in the casket with your ring,' '' Esposito
said. ``And I said, `Ah, c'mon . . . I don't want to talk about
that.' But he was adamant. He said, `Listen, take the ring, but
I'll keep the All-Star watch, because you've got plenty of those.'
'' Just as Phil said his farewell, he slipped the ring from his
father's finger and closed the casket.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another aide for Gretzky?
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky, his ownership role (managing partner in charge of
hockey operations) still ambiguous in Phoenix, has not dismissed
the chance of longtime pal Mike Barnett joining the Coyotes
operation. Barnett, head of IMG's hockey division, would have to
leave his current job _ just as Lacroix relinquished his job to
become the Nordiques/Avalanche GM. ``He has been my right arm for
20 years,'' said the Great One. ``I hope he will be my left arm for
20 years.'' Gretzky also said he had frequent conversations with
former Bruin Rick Tocchet, who is very familiar with the Phoenix
roster, before deciding to invest in the Desert Dogs . . . Look for
Glen Sather, now running the show on Broadway, to swing a deal that
would bring Doug Weight back to the Rangers. Slats stole Weight in
'93 in a swap for Esa Tikkanen. Weight will make a minimum $4.2
million in 2000-01. Sather's biggest obstacle will be finding ways
to clear the financial clutter tied up in the likes of Theo Fleury,
Stephane Quintal, Valeri Kamensky, and Sylvain Lefebvre . . . Once
again, if you're making your list and counting it twice, clubs have
two options in the expansion draft. No. 1: protect two goalies,
three defensemen, and seven forwards, or No. 2: protect one goalie,
five forwards, and nine defensemen. The Bruins, at the moment, will
go with the 2-3-7 formula, protecting Byron Dafoe and John Grahame
in net . . . Word around Nashville is the Predators could have a
keen interest in BU netminder Rick DiPietro, if he slips to No. 6.
That could make things interesting for the Bruins, who own the
seventh pick. If DiPietro is still there when Nashville picks, look
for the Bruins to make Nashville GM David Poile an offer that would
include the No. 7, at least one roster player, and perhaps another
pick or two . . . Perhaps the biggest surprise of unsigned 1998
draft picks was junior netminder Mathieu Chouinard, whom the
Senators selected No. 15 overall. Chouinard goes back into the pool
as a 20-year-old and, following two mediocre years in the juniors,
he may fall to the second round. The Senators were offering
guaranteed money of around $1.5 million on a three-year deal but
Chouinard was looking for about twice that . . . The Islanders did
not send a representative to the draft lottery. When the Islanders
were announced the winners, Atlanta GM Don Waddell, whose team had
the best odds to win, immediately said, ``Winner must be present!''
The last time the Islanders had the No. 1 pick was '73, when GM
Bill Torrey resisted offers from Montreal GM Sam Pollock and picked
Denis Potvin. To this day, Torrey won't reveal Pollock's bait.
``Boy did Sam try,'' said Torrey, recalling the draft that year in
Montreal. ``We took two slow walks around the Queen Elizabeth
Hotel, and Sam kept trying, but I wouldn't budge.'' Other notable
first-rounders in 1973: No. 5 John Davidson (St. Louis), No. 8 Bob
Gainey (Montreal), and No. 14 Rick Middleton (Rangers) . . . TV
isn't everything (didn't they say that about money in the 20th
century?), but the 2.8 average rating the NHL pulled down on ABC
for Games 3 and 4 of the Cup finals is, at best, extremely
underwhelming. Bettman kept a stiff upper lip, saying he's sure
ratings will increase over the years. Perhaps. But not until there
is a monumental cultural shift among owners and players, aimed at
the athletes being more accessible to the media during the game's
showcase event, and throughout the season. If the league and the
players don't agree to do their best to market the sport and
continue to equate media coverage with root canals, even these low
ratings will atrophy and the major news outlets _ print and
electronic _ ultimately will ignore the sport. There are just too
many other sports that thirst for the opportunity that many in the
league, players included, now view with disdain.

   Olympian effort
</P>
<P>
   Ex-NHL coach Harry Neale, now a CBC-TV analyst, would like to
see the 2002 Olympic hockey teams select their squads in the summer
of 2001 and bring them together for mini-training camps in
September. ``It would give the coaches a few days to get a feel for
their rosters,'' said Neale. ``And it would add some real hype
through the season and into the Olympics in 2002.'' Neale envisions
the US squad training at Lake Placid, N.Y., the Canadians in
Calgary, and the European squads in their respective countries . .
. The Oilers are likely to dump Roman Hamrlik and/or ex-BC Eagle
Bill Guerin over the summer _ perhaps as early as the draft two
weeks from now. Both are making big money ($2 million-plus) in the
Edmonton scheme of things. Guerin, who turns 30 in November, was
the fifth pick in the 1989 draft and could be worth a late
first-rounder. Guerin will be an unrestricted free agent July 1,
2002 . . . Scotty Bowman is expected to tell the Red Wings this
week whether he'll return. He said he'd be in Calgary for the
draft, a sure sign he'll be back for at least one more season . . .
Ex-Bruin Trent McCleary, who nearly died when struck in the throat
by a slap shot last season, has regained full strength and is
expected back with Montreal next season . . . Just wondering, but
what does it tell us when the Bruins' AHL affiliate in Providence
wins the Calder Cup in '99 and Boston misses the 2000 playoffs, and
the Rangers, without a playoff berth since '97, watch their
Hartford WolfPack win the Calder Cup this spring? The AHL club is
supposed to develop players for the NHL, but somehow the paradigm
got turned inside-out . . . Tampa Bay GM Rick Dudley, with 15 picks
in nine rounds, will be the busiest shopper at the draft.
Admittedly, five of those picks are in the seventh round, but
Dudley has the chance to land blue-chippers with the fifth and
eighth picks _ or deal for an impact player . . . Devils center
Bobby Holik, raised in the Czech Republic, reminded teammates to
give it their best in the finals because his father, Jaroslav, was
back home in Prague, providing color commentary for the
Devils-Stars series. The senior Holik recently coached the Czech
Republic squad in the World Junior tournament. ``He just does the
TV thing for fun,'' said Holik, the games starting at 3 a.m., Czech
time. ``He doesn't want to do anything full-time anymore, except
maybe play with his grandchildren and watch some hockey.''

USC HOLDS OFF FLORIDA STATE AT CWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ USC shortstop Seth Davidson jumped in the air and
took a stab at the line drive. Unsure he caught it, he carefully
turned his glove upside down before checking so the ball could not
fall out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it burned a hole in my glove,'' Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   The ball stayed in his mitt, however, and Davidson easily picked
a disbelieving Florida State runner off second for a game-ending
double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have been a little divine intervention,'' relief
pitcher Ronald Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's just typical of the way things are going for the
streaking Trojans, who defeated Florida State 6-4 in front of
19,516 at Rosenblatt Stadium on Saturday in the College World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   USC has won 16 straight games, with its last loss April 28. More
importantly, the Trojans won a College World Series opener for the
first time since 1978. In USC coach Mike Gillespie's two other CWS
appearances (1995, '98), the Trojans lost their opener and had to
play out of the losers' bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Without Davidson, they might have lost another opener. The
Trojans were nursing a two-run lead with one out in the ninth
inning, and the fifth-ranked Seminoles had runners at first and
second.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's Blair McCaleb then ripped a Flores pitch toward
left field before Davidson snatched the ball out of the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `How are we going to get out of this game with
a 6-5 lead, runners at first and third, and only one out?''' Flores
said, after watching the ball leave McCaleb's bat.
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, Florida State coach Mike Martin assumed the ball
would head toward the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was over the shortstop's head,'' Martin said.
``He had a little yeast. He went up there and got that ball.''
</P>
<P>
   By winning, fourth-ranked USC (44-18) did not waste an
impressive performance by starting pitcher Rik Currier, who allowed
four runs and six hits in 72/3 innings and improved his record to
15-3.
</P>
<P>
   Currier kept the Seminoles off the bases, with their first three
hitters going 1 for 12. And he escaped a major meltdown in the
second inning, with the bases loaded and no outs. After getting
Brett Groves to pop up, Currier walked Michael Futrell to score a
run.
</P>
<P>
   But he then struck out McCaleb and Chris Smith to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't give us anything in that situation,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a demonstration of USC's ability to keep cool under
adversity in the postseason. Florida State (51-18) led 2-0 after
three innings, the fourth team in the playoffs to open a two-run
advantage on the Trojans. USC has won all of those games.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans erased the deficit by scoring three runs in the
fourth inning and two in the fifth, as Anthony Lunetta and Beau
Craig homered and Abel Montanez, Davidson and Alberto Concepcion
added run-scoring singles for a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson picked up his second RBI with a sacrifice fly in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Currier's one nemesis was first baseman Ryan Barthelemy, who
went 4 for 4 with two home runs and three RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans play Louisiana State at noon PDT Monday in a
winners' bracket game.
</P>
<P>
   USC might be the hottest team in college baseball at the moment,
but the Trojans claim they are unaffected by their winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing because everyone asks about the streak and I can
see why, but we don't think about it,'' Davidson said. ``We're not
the Lakers. We're not gods. We have to scrape for everything. We're
a feisty team.'' &QL;

LUNETTA HAD JUST WHAT DOCTOR ORDERED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ Doctors told USC second baseman Anthony Lunetta
that he had strep throat, but the freshman looked like the
healthiest Trojan on the field during Saturday's 6-4 victory over
Florida State at Rosenblatt Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And despite playing in his first College World Series, he didn't
have a trace of nerves either.
</P>
<P>
   Lunetta singled in his first at-bat, homered in his second and
sharply lined out to shortstop. He scored two runs, drove in
another and cleanly fielded eight grounders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wasn't nervous. I don't know why. I think I should
have been,'' Lunetta said. ``Maybe the sickness had something to do
with it. I felt like I was feeling better, but I didn't know what
to expect. I guess it turned out all right.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his offensive prowess, Lunetta was also part of the
prettiest defensive play of the day.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning, he fielded a ground ball that forced his
momentum toward second base, and calmly tossed it over to shortstop
Seth Davidson, who spun and threw Florida State's Blair McCaleb out
at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the ball and heard (Davidson) say `Flip, flip, flip' and
we got him out,'' Lunetta said.
</P>
<P>
   The play is actually encouraged by USC coach Mike Gillespie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We practice that every day. We talk about that all the time,''
Davidson said. ``I think coach has been waiting for a long time for
that to happen. He actually gets mad and says `Hey, why don't you
guys flip it?' We can't believe that it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   FAMILIAR FOE: Florida State coach Mike Martin had one question
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many Flores do they have at USC?''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Flores picked up his fifth save of the season in
Saturday's victory over the Seminoles, and his brother Randy, USC's
all-time wins leader, was on the Trojan team that defeated Florida
State in the 1995 College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Flores is currently pitching in Norwich, Conn., with the
Yankees' Double-A team, and he watched Saturday's victory on TV
before starting that evening's contest for his own club.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother left a message for me,'' Ronald Flores said. ``He
was jazzed.''
</P>
<P>
   STAT OF THE DAY: One troubling sign for the Trojans, despite the
victory, was going 3 for 16 with runners in scoring position. USC
stranded 14 baserunners, which tied a season high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was frustrated,'' Gillespie said. ``I think we all were with
the number of opportunities we had.'' &QL;

BRYANT WILL MAKE THE CALL ABOUT ANKLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The electrodes and trainer's tape attached to
Kobe Bryant's left ankle said more than anyone else could Saturday:
The Lakers' All-Star guard was in no condition to play, and might
not be this evening in Game 3 of the NBA Finals against the Indiana
Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers have an opportunity to push their series lead to
a commanding 3-0 with a win at Conseco Fieldhouse, and they will do
whatever necessary. Even play Bryant with a sprained ankle, so long
as the pain is negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't give any games away in this business,'' said coach
Phil Jackson, ``and you're certainly not going to pull any punches
just to have him there. If he can play, he'll play regardless. If
he's not at least 90 percent of his capabilities, or 85 percent is
a realistic number, then he won't be capable of putting up with
what he has to do to be a competitor in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe's got to make the decision,'' Jackson said. ``He hasn't
got anything wrong with his foot except for swelling and pain or
whatever, so he ultimately can make the decision, but the doctor
will have a big influence on what we say or how we go about doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was still on crutches Saturday, less than 24 hours after
suffering the injury in the first quarter of Game 2. But he said
he's noticed improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as bad as we thought it would be,'' Bryant said.
``I'm able to put pressure on it. Yesterday I couldn't put any
pressure on it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bryant takes today off, he'll have four full days of rest
before Game 4 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bryant said ``there's no need to rush'' back, he knows
his scoring, defense and playmaking are irreplaceable assets. And
he's not worried about risking further injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could rest my foot in the summertime,'' he said. ``I mean,
you have to be smart. As I said, the doctors are going to know
best. They're going to be able to judge my foot better than I can,
because I'll probably just react off of sheer emotion and sheer
competitiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if left up to him, ``I'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   ON DECK: Brian Shaw started the second half Friday, but Jackson
said he's still weighing whether to start Shaw or Derek Fisher if
needed today.
</P>
<P>
   Bet on Shaw. At 6-foot-6, Shaw gives the Lakers the tall
backcourt Jackson prefers, and leaves the 6-1 Fisher available to
come in when the Pacers bring 5-11 Travis Best off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   EASYGOING: The Lakers have had series leads of 2-0 and 3-0 in
these playoffs, only to run into trouble. But even with three road
games ahead _ in a building where the Pacers went 36-5 this season
_ they are feeling cautiously confident.
</P>
<P>
   One win this week sends them back to L.A. for two chances to
close out the series. Two wins here, and they are champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we can definitely get one win out of three,''
Fisher said, ``but we aren't really looking past (today). I think
we're really going to come out and play (this) game as if it was a
Game 7 really. I mean, we really feel like (this) game kind of sets
the tone for the rest of the series. I mean, if they win basically
you can say it's a new series. It's 2-1 and then they have two more
games here. But if we win, it's a totally different thing. So we're
putting a lot of focus on (today's game).'' &QL;

SHAQ MIGHT HAVE TO CARRY LAKERS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ If a city's faith, a team's hopes and a
franchise's pride can be summed up in a singular image, it is this
one: Kobe Bryant, arriving at practice Saturday afternoon, riding
piggyback on Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   No master's degree in English is needed, no Cliffs Notes
necessary to grasp the obvious symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, eyeing their first championship in 12 years, have a
comfortable 2-0 lead in the NBA Finals. ...
</P>
<P>
   And a very uncomfortable All-Star shooting guard, nursing a
sprained left ankle. ...
</P>
<P>
   But a very sturdy MVP, on whose shoulders everything could rest
when the series resumes this evening with Game 3 at Conseco
Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   So O'Neal carried Bryant _ his status today very much in doubt _
off the team bus. And today, he might need to make room on that
broad back for the rest of the roster and the entire population of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want him to walk on his own,'' O'Neal said. So,
someone surmised, he carried him like he has all year? ``Something
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Bryant is a gametime decision, but was still on
crutches and the Lakers are planning for Game 3 as if he will not
be available. That means a heavier burden for O'Neal, averaging
41.5 points in the series.
</P>
<P>
   But it also means another opportunity for the league's best
third option: Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Rice scored 21 points Friday night when Bryant went down in the
first quarter, helping the Lakers secure a 111-104 victory. Once
one of the league's top scorers, Rice has often been an
afterthought in the Shaq &AMP; Kobe Show, averaging 15.9 points in the
regular season, 12.6 in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But when an All-Star falters or is felled, Rice has made it
clear that he remains a deadly shooter. Witness the month of
November when, with Bryant recovering from a broken right hand,
Rice averaged 17.9 points andshot 45.7 percent (compared to 15.4
and 42.3 the rest of the season).
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers can afford a Kobe-less loss today, but they can also
be confident that a 3-0 lead is possible with Rice picking up the
slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen's been great as far as just being patient, and when the
challenge is there and the moment comes, he steps up. He's
responded,'' Bryant said. ``I don't think people truly understand
the sacrifice that Glen Rice had to make. I don't think people
realize what kind of player he was in Charlotte. He put points up
on the board, man. And to come here and be able to give that up is
sacrificing. Plus the demands that we have for him defensively.
Glen's been terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of incentive for Rice to deliver another
clutch performance.
</P>
<P>
   He is seeking his first championship ring, in his 11th pro
campaign. He is seeking a reward for subverting his ego and his
game the last two seasons following his trade to the Lakers. And
ultimately, as a free agent this summer, he can use any opportunity
to reassure 29 NBA executives that, at 33, he's still an elite
player worthy of one last big contract.
</P>
<P>
   Rice has delicately steered clear of those issues, preferring to
focus on the task at hand, and that task today is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely realize I've got to take advantage of (Bryant's
absence),'' he said. ``(Today's) game we're going to be short one
key guy on this ballclub. It's a must that I step my game up.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bryant is out, coach Phil Jackson will mix a few ``specials''
_ plays run specifically for Rice _ into the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called Glen's number a couple of times (Friday) night and
he came through for us,'' Jackson said. ``We ran some things (out
of) timeouts and he was there. But he's going to have to find his
way in the game andhave a nose for it, so to speak. Usually, if a
player gets on a roll, it'll happen for him.''
</P>
<P>
   It did in Game 2, as Rice went 7 for 15 from the field, making 5
of 6 3-pointers. He has quietly contributed all season, despite the
offseason uncertainty and even early season speculation he would be
traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen's handled this situation now about as much as a
professional as anybody could,'' said teammate Derek Fisher. ``And
being the third option on a team where he's definitely capable of
being much more than that. And he just bides his time and waits his
turn. And if Kobe doesn't get a chance to play (today), I think all
eyes will be on him to see how heperforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Said O'Neal, ``I'm sure Glen's going to step up, especially if
Kobe doesn't play, he'll get a whole bunch more shots. ... He's
been a vital part to this offense. Even though he hasn't scored a
lot of points, he's hit a lot of big baskets for us, a lot of big
3s for us. So I'm glad he's here. A big man always wants a shooter
around.'' &QL;

ADOPTED HOOSIER MAKES GOOD

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Lakers forward Rick Fox tells a story that blows
``Hoosiers'' out of the cornfields.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with a kindly coach from a small Christian college in
north central Indiana who travels to the Bahamas one summer and
strikes oil. He discovers a boy with raw basketball skills just
waiting to be refined.
</P>
<P>
   The man returns to the States but can't shake the image of the
tall, talented player he left behind. At length, he arranges it so
the boy can come to America's heartland _ and basketball's ground
zero _ for his final three years of high school. He places the boy
with a family that worships the triangle offense as run by the
Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The grounded boy and the God-fearing family hit it off
immediately. The boy feels right at home, even if the frigid
winters and flaxen fields take some getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   He blossoms as a basketball player, grows as a person and goes
on to grace one of the most glamorous college basketball programs,
marry one of the most glamorous women on the planet and play for
the most glamorous team in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Fox never tires of telling the story because, well, it is his
own.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fanciful, full circle Fox has circumnavigated, from a
star turn at Warsaw (Ind.) Community High to an NBA Finals
appearance today in his adopted home state in Game 3 of the
best-of-seven championship series between the Lakers and the
Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole experience (of attending high school in
Indiana) was quite miraculous when you look back on it,'' Fox says
Saturday after a short shootaround at Conseco Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``A kid comes from the sand and surf of the Bahamas to the snow
drifts and cornfields of Indiana, gets an opportunity to play
organized basketball for the first time and winds up back in
Indiana years later playing for an NBA championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Fox, who majored in Radio, Televison and Motion
Pictures at the University of North Carolina, shakes his head. He
was schooled to appreciate how hard it would be to sell the
screenplay he just described. He agrees it is way too sappy.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, sometimes the truth is sweeter than fiction.
Ironically, despite Fox's Hollywood connections, it was a high
school teammate of his who appeared in the movie ``Hoosiers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way I can explain Rick coming into our lives is that
it is a miracle from God,'' Eugene Gossman said. He is speaking
from Warsaw, Ind., on the day before he is due to make the
two-and-a-half-hour drive here with his wife and son to watch Fox
and the rest of the Lakers try to back the Pacers into a 3-0
corner.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, when Fox dropped into the Gossmans' home as if sent
second-day air from Above, Gossman was teaching math at Warsaw
Community High. He and his wife had recently seen their daughter
married. Their youngest child, Doug, was starting his freshman year
at his father's alma mater, Grace College.
</P>
<P>
   The Gossmans had an extra bedroom and a vacancy in their lives.
To that point, they had led rather insular lives revolving around
their religion. But their hearts were open when the Grace College
coach approached Gossman about billeting this basketball player
from the Bahamas who needed this outlet pass to get a jump on his
oh-so-promising future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never met the young man, we didn't know anything about his
family,'' Gossman says. ``You have to know our family. We're not
socialites. We keep to ourselves. But we prayed about it and felt
like we should give this young man a chance. And then Rick came
into our home, and it was like he was one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox came for a one-week feeling-out period and stayed three
years. The Gossmans were grand surrogates for his parents, Ulrick
and Dianne. They attended all his basketball games (Fox played one
game for the junior varsity team as a sophomore before he was
promoted to the varsity, where he stayed and eventually starred).
They sat with him in their living room and entertained college
coaches who came courting him in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to commit, the Gossmans sat down with Fox, who
then got both his parents on the telephone, and together the five
of them whittled his choices down to Dean Smith's Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   The Gossmans were at the RCA Dome in 1991 when Fox's collegiate
career ended with a disappointing loss to Kansas in an NCAA
Tournament semifinal. Fox, the Tar Heel who had come so far, was
despondent. He had tried too hard and ended up doing too little.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since then, Fox says, he has been plotting his vindication.
It took nine years, but his V-day finally arrived last week, when
the Lakers wrested the Western Conference crown from Portland, and
with it, the right to beat up (so far) Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself at least once a week that when I got another
opportunity to play for a championship, I was going to be prepared,
calm and confident,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games, the 6-foot-7 forward (and husband of
former Miss America Vanessa Williams) has been as good as his word,
averaging 8.5 points and 19.5 minutes off the bench. Gossman, for
one, couldn't be prouder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see a little deja vu in Rick (in these NBA Finals),''
Gossman said. ``I can see Rick has learned to keep his emotions in
control and not overplay.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, it'll be hard to keep emotions in check. Fox and the
Gossmans, after all, have traveled far together. &QL;

COWBOYS PUT MONEY ON OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ In his quest to reach another Super Bowl, Dallas
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is hopeful that offense can replace the
``entertainment value'' gone with Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we had to take both the present and the future into
account, and we just couldn't take the risk at this stage of
Deion's career,'' said Jones, explaining the logic beyond releasing
a perennial Pro Bowl cornerback. Sanders signed with the NFC East
rival Washington Redskins three days after his June 2 release.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big franchise decision when you're talking about
those kind of dollars,'' Jones said. ``We just couldn't make that
decision. What it would've taken to sign Deion, we put into our
receivers instead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have arguably the NFL's fastest wide-receiver tandem
in Joey Galloway and Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail, acquiring Galloway
from Seattle for two first-round picks and signed him to a
seven-year, $42 million deal with a $12.5 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway's contract with the Cowboys is $14 million less than
Sanders' seven-year, $56 million contract with the Redskins,
although both deals are heavily backloaded, which means both more
than likely will be redone for salary-cap purposes after two or
three seasons. Galloway's signing bonus was $12.5 million, Sanders'
$8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jones understands the entertainment side of the NFL as well as
any owner in professional sports. He admits he will miss that part
of Prime Time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deion adds an entertainment value that only someone who can
play at that level can add,'' Jones said. ``He's exciting,
entertaining, controversial ... and sometimes controversial isn't
all bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones had a top Hollywood executive once tell him that Sanders
possessed star power that easily could transfer to the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deion Sanders can look into the camera and speak to you
without saying a word,'' Jones said he was told.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as Jones likes entertainment value, he values
winning more. The Cowboys ranked 17th in the NFL in touchdown
passes (20) last season, finishing 8-8 and making a first-round
exit from the playoffs for the second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a .500 team the last three years with Deion,''
Jones said. ``Principally because of his (toe and leg) injuries,
teams went after him the last couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question mark for the Cowboys remains at cornerback.
Kevin Smith is coming off an injury-plagued season, and Ryan McNeil
is a 29-year-old free agent being asked to learn a new system. The
Cowboys also spent three of their top four draft picks on
cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to go with the idea that Deion wouldn't be back,''
coach Dave Campo said. ``But I feel very comfortable with the
players we've got there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we'll still be sound in the secondary,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   As for entertainment value, Jones now must turn to Galloway and
Ismail streaking downfield to haul in passes from Troy Aikman or
his new backup, Randall Cunningham. Pass-catching tight end Jackie
Harris also has been added to an offense that will utilize Emmitt
Smith more in the passing game again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFC East is definitely a defensive division,'' new
offensive coordinator Jack Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was time for the Cowboys to put the ``entertainment
value'' back on the offensive side of the ball.

ONCE AGAIN, MAGIC AND BIRD ON OPPOSITE SIDES IN FINALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ It remains their stage, though they are no longer
the leading actors.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years after they last met in the NBA Finals, Larry Bird
and Magic Johnson are together on stage again as opponents. Bird
coaches the Pacers, who trail Magic's Lakers in the best-of-seven
NBA Finals, 2-0. Game 3 is at 6:30 p.m. Sunday at Conseco
Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But just because they are not playing on the court doesn't mean
Johnson and Bird are any less intense about this series than
Shaquille O'Neal or Reggie Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man, I wish we could go at it again like we did in the old
days,'' said Johnson, a Lakers co-owner and vice president. ``Those
were the good old days when the Lakers and Celtics used to battle
it out like cats and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was basketball at its best during a time when the NBA was
struggling. But I think I brought out the best in Bird and he
brought out the best in me.''
</P>
<P>
   While Magic appears excited about the matchup, Bird avoids
revisiting the Bird-Magic rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy now for Magic to do all the talking,'' Bird said.
``He doesn't have to coach the Lakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Magic might not be coaching the Lakers, but it was Magic who
convinced guard Kobe Bryant not to return for the second half of
Friday night's Game 2 of the NBA Finals after Bryant suffered a
sprained left ankle in the first period. Magic sits near the
Lakers' bench, and often keeps close tabs on the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they're going to be talked about a lot in their
matchups,'' Pacers forward Derrick McKey said. ``We just hope we
can have that type of battle out on the court that they had back in
their day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to put on a good show for the people _ as they did.''
</P>
<P>
   They put on such a good show. In fact, a case can be made that
they saved the NBA. The two players entered the league in 1979,
after Johnson's Michigan State team beat Bird's Indiana State team
in the NCAA championship game. The NBA was awash with problems,
from drug use among players to diminished fan interest. The NBA
Finals weren't even televised live; they were broadcast on a
tape-delay basis.
</P>
<P>
   But Magic and Bird transformed the NBA with their ability and
enthusiasm, Magic with the Los Angeles Lakers and Bird with the
Boston Celtics. In a short time, their rivalry defined the surging
NBA, which has become an billion-dollar operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were two of the guys responsible for the heights that the
league is at this point,'' Indiana Pacers president Donnie Walsh
said. ``That was one of the great rivalries of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And even though it was the Lakers and Celtics, it focused on
Bird and Magic, because they were the ones who brought that to the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex English, who played briefly for the Mavericks in the early
1990s, said it's difficult to discuss this series without
mentioning Magic-Bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great thing that they're both back here in the
Finals,'' said English, who works for NBATV.com. ``These guys set
lot of records. They've set the pace for this group that's here
now, and they gave them the goals that they've set for themselves
to reach for.''
</P>
<P>
   English said when Bird and Magic broke into the NBA, no one knew
how significant that would become, and how indelible their mark
would be on this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were great individuals,'' English said. ``But what made
them so great was they were great team players. They knew the game
and saw the floor so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you really didn't know how good they were going to be
until after you played them and you see how they meshed.''
</P>
<P>
   They dominated the 1980s, winning eight championships _ Magic
and the Lakers in '80, '82, '85, '87 and '88; Bird and the Celtics
in '81, '84 and '86. The Lakers beat the Celtics in two of their
three championship meetings, including the 1987 NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Although Magic has more NBA titles than Bird, Bird is the first
person to coach in the NBA Finals while enshrined in the Basketball
Hall of Fame. He also has been the more successful coach, leading
the Pacers to their first NBA Finals. The Lakers went 5-11 at the
end of the 1993-94 season with Johnson as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Both were fiery competitors, but Walsh said Bird has been
unfairly perceived as a subpar bench coach because he doesn't rant
and rave on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he recognizes he's dealing with men, and he doesn't
have to scream and yell,'' Walsh said. ``He knows they're supposed
to do their job, and they know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a great player's coach, and I think more NBA
coaches will coach like Larry Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bird is right, Magic does have it easier these days, and not
just because of his team's 2-0 series lead. Bird, the coach, is
concerned with stopping Shaquille O'Neal, who has scored 43 and 40
points in the first two Finals games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about (TV) ratings,'' Bird said. ``I'm trying to
win a ballgame right now.'' nn

RAIN WON'T GO AWAY, SO RACE IS POSTPONED
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Rain ruled again at Texas Motor Speedway on
Saturday, forcing postponement of the Indy Racing League's Casino
Magic 500 from Saturday night to noon Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Intermittent showers played havoc with Saturday's race-day
schedule, washing out a final half-hour practice scheduled for 3:45
p.m., and ultimately prompting IRL officials to postpone a race
originally scheduled for 7 p.m. and move it to Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made at 6:10 p.m., shortly after a
``window'' of dry weather opened and TMS crews began the task of
drying the 1.5-mile quadoval. Brian Barnhart, the IRL's director of
racing operations, delivered the decision to the drivers and crews
during a meeting in the track's Victory Theater but also advised
the teams to stick around. Looking to dry the track by a reasonable
hour, IRL officials were hoping to run a 30-minute final practice
Saturday night under full-tank conditions. But that idea was
scrapped at 9 p.m., when attempts to fully dry the surface proved
futile.
</P>
<P>
   The final practice has been rescheduled for 9 a.m. Sunday. Live
telecast of the race has been switched from ESPN to ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Barnhart said the decision to postpone the race was made in the
best interests of all involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much drying that's going to be necessary on the racetrack,
I don't want to start the thing at 10:45 or 11 o'clock,'' Barnhart
said. ``The concentration level the guys need, I'm not going to
race from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   This became only the second event in the IRL's five-year history
to be postponed at least one day by rain. The first was the 1997
Indianapolis 500, which was rained out on its original May 25 date,
started May 26 but halted by rain after 15 laps, and completed May
27. No one in the TMS garage area, or any of the anticipated crowd
of 70,000, wants a repeat of that marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we'll get a window (Sunday) and get the thing in,''
said Barnhart, referring to the scheduled distance of 312 miles/208
laps. ``We'd love to go full-distance, obviously. We need
half-distance for an official race, but if we can get it in
(Sunday) we will. If not, we'll probably pick a hole in our
schedule somewhere. In August and September we have some time in
there, and we'll come back and run again.''
</P>
<P>
   The down time allowed drivers to mingle with fans in the garage
area, while crews continued to work on the open-wheel cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have much to complain about,'' said Scott
Goodyear, the winner of this event last June and driver of the No.
4 Pennzoil Panther Dallara/Aurora. ``It's nothing like 1997 at the
Indianapolis 500, where we had the cars on the grid every day.
Again, I trust the IRL and TMS officials made the right call by
delaying it. The decision was smart and fully endorsed by all the
drivers and teams. When the cars run, it doesn't matter. You just
want to get the full show in, and this gives us the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnhart has been revising the schedule since Thursday, when
Davey Hamilton and Jimmy Kite crashed in Turn 4 in separate
incidents during practice. Citing a possible problem with right
rear pushrods in the 2000 G Force chassis and a bump in the racing
groove of Turn 4, IRL and TMS officials canceled the second
practice to allow teams to modify suspensions overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen of the 27-car field had made successful qualifying
attempts Friday afternoon when the rains came, prompting officials
to scrub the session and revert to 2000 entrant points to set the
starting grid.
</P>
<P>
   Plano's Greg Ray, the reigning IRL champion, said he felt it was
fair to give all the teams a chance to run on full tanks before
taking the green flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of teams that have fresh motors in, maybe some
teams that haven't run on full tanks,'' said Ray, who will start a
season's-worst 17th in the No. 1 Conseco Dallara/Aurora. ``It's
only fair to give teams that opportunity, because they're expecting
it _ to do a simple leak check, make sure the gearboxes are OK, do
any last-minute changes on the race car. Just as a matter of
safety, you should afford that.''
</P>
<P>
   John Lopes, team manager of Rockwall-based TeamExtreme, noted
this weekend's scenario was a repeat of the season-opening race at
Walt Disney World Speedway in Orlando, Fla., in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no qualifying, and we didn't do full-tank runs, and
we raced,'' said Lopes, whose driver lineup is Hamilton and rookie
Airton Dare. ``But there's other issues here. These cars _ low to
the ground, heavy, with that bump (in Turn 4) _ they probably want
everybody to get a feel that they've got the right springs, the
right shocks. They want a safe race. Most of the cars have been in
qualifying trim in practice, and they haven't done full tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   And speaking as unofficial ``host team'' for the race, Lopes
issued this rejoinder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't take blame for the weather,'' Lopes said. ``They
brought this weather from Indianapolis.'' nn

RANGERS PITCHER ROGERS SUCCEEDS WITH `NOTHING'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Kenny Rogers felt lousy warming up in the bullpen
before Friday's game. His back was killing him, and he had nothing
on his pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Rangers pitching coach Dick Bosman tried to convince him
he had good stuff and was ready to go, but Rogers wasn't buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `Come on Bozzy. I'm not a rookie,''' Rogers said.
``I knew I had nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullpen catcher Ken Guthrie jokingly told Rogers he'd get long
reliever Matt Perisho warmed up right away. Rogers didn't laugh,
because he thought it could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I'd get out of the first inning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers not only got out of the first, he cruised through the
next six. In a remarkable pitching performance in the high altitude
of Coors Field, the Rangers left-handed gave up just one run on
three hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers lost, 3-2, when the Rockies scored two runs in the
12th inning off reliever John Wetteland, but Rogers still was
pleased with his outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a really good day,'' he said. ``I wish we'd have won
it, first and foremost, but I was really happy with what I did. I
really didn't expect that. I expected to have to struggle, because
I didn't feel great. Colorado and not feeling great is not a good
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   He might have won it if he'd spaced the three hits a little
better. Instead, two of them came in the second inning and gave the
Rockies their only run against Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   He retired the next 14 batters after the run, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to find a way to get through each inning,'' he
said. ``I didn't have any long innings or any major mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' good day even included a sacrifice bunt in the second
and a single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single was nice, but I really didn't expect to get a
hit,'' he said. ``I was really thinking about not even swinging the
bat the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because his back was hurting so much, which was the one
damper on Rogers' day. He's been taking treatment for a stiff lower
back, but so far there's no improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, though, was able to succeed anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed speeds well,'' Bosman said. ``He had a good
curveball to go along with a very effective sinker and changeup.
He's creative. Over the years he's learned how to use what he's
got, and that's so key.'' nn

WHO IS JOHN E. ROBINSON SR.? 
</HEADLINE>
 2ND TAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY, MARK MORRIS AND DIANE CARROLL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (into it)
 &LR; brk:Chips and checks  &LR; tx:The next decade was even more turbulent.
His wife filed for divorce in 1980 but reconsidered after
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson took a job in Liberty at Guy's Foods, a large
manufacturer of potato chips and other snacks.
</P>
<P>
   James Caldwell, now operations manager at Guy's, remembers the
period as a chaotic time. The firm recently had been sold. In the
confusion, no one ran a background check on Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Robinson) was our director of personnel,'' Caldwell said.
``Most of those are outgoing, friendly people, and that's what he
was. Then this money went missing.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 17, 1980, Robinson took a $6,000 company check and put
it in a new bank account disguised to look like a legitimate Guy's
corporate account.
</P>
<P>
   He faced felony stealing charges six months later. But the full
extent of Robinson's work at Guy's was only beginning to become
clear. ``It was the tip of the iceberg,'' Caldwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The company soon filed a civil lawsuit alleging Robinson had
submitted false vouchers and forged checks.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson ultimately paid more than $41,000 in restitution in the
civil case and faced up to seven years on the criminal charge. He
was handed five years of probation after serving 60 days of ``shock
time'' at the Clay County jail.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't seem to learn much from the experience, area records
show.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1984, a mutual friend introduced him to a Kansas City
woman who was looking for a divorce lawyer, records show. A
transcript of a later law enforcement interview with the woman
suggests Robinson assumed the role of divorce lawyer. In addition
to her marriage license and birth certificate, Robinson also took
the title to her car and promised to finish work on her case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm divorced,'' the woman complained to
investigators. ``He keeps telling me I'm divorced, go out get
married. He said I can go and do what I wanted to do and I didn't
need a copy of divorce papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Confronted by his probation officer, Robinson denied everything,
saying he promised only to help the woman find her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Court records reflect no action on the complaint. But Robinson's
conviction in the Guy's case would dog him for years into the
future.
 &LR; brk:`An answer for everything'  &LR; tx:In mid-December 1984, Steve
Haymes, Robinson's probation officer, took a phone call from Ann
Smith at Birthright, a nonprofit group that assists young women
wishing to complete their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The call came just three months after 19-year-old Paula Godfrey
was reported missing in Overland Park, but no one had yet linked
Robinson to her disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Smith told Haymes that Robinson had been paying her visits at
the office, according to notes Haymes later compiled for the
court's consideration. Robinson allegedly told Smith he was
affiliated with the First Presbyterian Church of Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stated that the church was in the process of developing a
program to help young women who had just delivered babies,'' Haymes
wrote. ``He stated that the church wished to place these young
mothers in a duplex in Olathe and pay their expenses while the
young mother got on her feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The smooth stranger spoke of big plans _ even of a ``Trans
Tech'' school in Texas that would teach young mothers skills, cover
$800-a-month living expenses and provide baby-sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Smith called the Stanley church, which knew nothing of the
program. She then phoned an Olathe, Kan., bank, which rebutted the
man's claim of serving on its board of directors, according to
court records.
</P>
<P>
   A few more checks led her to the Missouri Division of Probation
and Parole and Haymes.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Robinson had created Equi-II, an umbrella outfit _
ostensibly a management consulting firm _ that he invoked in a
broad variety of ventures, both commercial and philanthropic.
</P>
<P>
   Making the rounds at several places that served struggling young
mothers, Robinson allegedly produced a fact sheet on the ``Kansas
City Outreach Program...sponsored by Equi-II.'' It came with an
application form and a list of questions such as: ``What are your
goals, what would you like to be doing 2 years from now?''
</P>
<P>
   At Truman Medical Center he claimed to represent a group of
Overland Park businesspeople wishing ``to give back to the
community for the successes they had'' in life, said Karen Gaddis,
then a social worker for the hospital's obstetrics unit.
</P>
<P>
   She said Robinson told her he was working closely with Catholic
Charities. When he spoke of social-service groups in the region,
Gaddis said, ``he knew everything he needed to now. He knew names,
he knew agencies....He had an answer for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   His approach was so convincing, many agencies failed to verify
his stories with one another, she told /{The Star/} last week.
 &LR; brk:Nice `Mr. Osborne'  &LR; tx:About Christmas 1984, Gaddis grew
suspicious when Robinson showed less enthusiasm for potential black
candidates for his program than for white candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd say, `You know, I don't really care about this, but can
you tell me: Is the mother white or black?,' '' Gaddis recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy white infants, social workers knew, could be worth a
small fortune in the black-market adoption trade.
</P>
<P>
   Since a disproportionate share of maternity patients at the
publicly funded Truman are black, ``he didn't take any of ours,''
said Gaddis, who had worked at the hospital several years.
</P>
<P>
   Court records, however, suggest that Robinson did locate one
white woman who had recently delivered at Truman. She was Lisa
Stasi, 19. She was staying that Christmas at the Hope House shelter
for battered women.
</P>
<P>
   By Jan. 9, 1985, she and her 5-month-old daughter, Tiffany, were
staying in Room 131 at the Overland Park Rodeway Inn, where a man
she knew only as ``Mr. Osborne'' had checked her in. She had told
relatives that she was enlisting in a program sponsored by area
businessmen who could help her get a job and high-school
equivalency degree.
</P>
<P>
   Stasi and her daughter checked out the morning of Jan. 10, never
to be seen again.
</P>
<P>
   Stasi's sister-in-law, Kathy Klinginsmith, phoned Overland Park
police the next day to report the disappearance and that a Mr.
Robinson had paid for the room with an Equi-II company credit card.
That afternoon Klinginsmith's husband, David, tracked down
Equi-II's offices at 98th Street and Metcalf Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   An Overland Park police report stated: ``Mr. Klinginsmith
advised that while there, he spoke to an unknown gentleman who
became very upset and pushed him out of the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Probation officer Haymes had spent about a month interviewing
social workers about Robinson's alleged activities _ and trying to
reach Robinson, without success _ when he decided to call the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   An agent told him, records state, that ``they were aware of John
Robinson but that they were not currently investigating him (and)
they were not aware of any baby-selling ring operating.''
</P>
<P>
   The same day _ Jan. 24, 1985 _ Robinson showed up at Haymes'
office, two weeks after Haymes had requested that he appear.
</P>
<P>
   Haymes asked him about the Kansas City Outreach Program. He came
forth with details about an apartment, No. 313, at 8110 Troost
Ave., which Robinson said he and some local businessmen had rented
to house young families in need. Robinson told Haymes ``he was
simply getting the satisfaction of being a help to the community
and (to) people less fortunate than himself,'' Haymes' notes state.
</P>
<P>
   Haymes didn't buy it. And after Stasi and her baby turned up
missing, neither did the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1985 a message from Robinson reached the Overland Park
Police Department: Stasi recently had done some baby-sitting for a
local girl. Stasi had told the girl she didn't want any contact
with her family.
</P>
<P>
   Police immediately interviewed the girl and got a very different
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The girl) has stated to all three agencies that she was told
to tell this story by Robinson as she owed him $900 and he had
taken nude pictures of her,'' Haymes wrote in a report. ``(The
girl) states she does not know, nor has she ever seen, Lisa Stasi
or her daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   As suspicions heightened, Gaddis said, the FBI even considered
placing a young undercover agent, posing as an unwed mother, in
Robinson's program. But another woman _ who ultimately would
cooperate with the FBI _ soon appeared in Robinson's orbit.  &LR; brk:A
tough customer  &LR; tx:Theresa L. Williams had come to Kansas City in
1984 and worked odd jobs at a Kmart and a self-service laundry.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting Robinson at a McDonald's restaurant, she agreed to
become his mistress in May 1985 and to move into the Troost
apartment, according to her testimony in Clay County Circuit Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he could take care of me, and I wouldn't have to worry
about working, about anything,'' Williams testified.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, though Robinson denied it, Williams contended he
provided her with marijuana, which would have been a violation of
his Missouri probation.
</P>
<P>
   Her stay on Troost was brief, only two months, but it was framed
by two frightening incidents.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Robinson introduced her to ``a customer Mr.
Robinson had lined up for you to...provide sex for,'' as described
by an assistant Clay County prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the customer would pay $1,200. She was blindfolded
in the customer's car as they drove around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a certain man who needed brutality and who paid for
it,'' Williams testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what Mr. Robinson told you, what was to happen for
the money?'' the prosecutor asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would let him do things to me,'' Williams replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of things generally?'' the prosecutor followed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brutality and other unnatural sex acts,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The next incident took her completely by surprise. Early one
morning, Williams testified, she awoke to find Robinson in her
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He woke me up and started pulling my hair,'' Williams
testified. ``I started screaming. And then he took the gun out, put
it to my head and said, ``if you don't shut up, I'll blow your
brains out.''
</P>
<P>
   She then alleged he sexually assaulted her with the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Haymes and two FBI agents soon interviewed Williams and within
hours moved her out of the Troost Avenue apartment so quickly that
they inadvertently took a TV set that belonged to the landlord.
Eventually they put her in hiding out of state.
</P>
<P>
   When Haymes moved to suspend Robinson's probation based on
Williams' story of drugs and guns, his lawyer demanded the right to
interview her before the revocation hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI refused to produce her for the deposition. Clay County
Circuit Court Judge John Hutcherson, concerned by Robinson's
behavior, revoked his bond based on her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Court of Appeals reversed Hutcherson's decision,
ruling that authorities violated his constitutional right to
confront his accuser.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Williams lives out of state.  &LR; brk:Limited partners
 &LR; tx:Even as Robinson parried the federal baby-selling
investigation, he was soaking up attention for his business
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1985, just days after his probation revocation hearing
concluded, he was featured in a /{Farm Journal/} cover story,
touting Equi-II as a farm management consulting firm and advising
ranchers on the tax benefits of limited partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Robinson portrayed himself as the enthusiastic expert.
The lingo sounded just right.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every dollar the limited partner invests, he gets $2 to $4
in tax write-offs, along with a return of 25 percent to 50 percent
on his investment over the life of the partnership,'' Robinson told
the writers.
</P>
<P>
   The writers also quoted Sam Brownback, then a Kansas State
University agricultural law professor and currently a U.S. senator,
about the advantages of the limited partnerships in beef
operations. (Brownback said Saturday he never met or spoke to
Robinson.)
</P>
<P>
   Robinson pointed to the $2.2 million partnership set up by one
of his clients as a model for others; the program was new and had
not yet shown a long-term profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more (the client) makes for the investors, the more he
takes home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't turn out that way for at least one rancher, Bob
Lowrey of Norwich, Kan. He and his partner, Bill Mills, each lost
$10,000 in Robinson's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paid him and so did my partner, and we never saw anything
come out of all the talk,'' said Lowrey said. ``I questioned it at
the time, but Billy did visit with the man....He was certain he was
an honest person.''
</P>
<P>
   In that busy summer of 1985, Robinson's luck in avoiding jail
time was about to run out.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County authorities had been investigating him for months
about his relationship with a business called Back Care Systems.
Back Care Systems hired his Equi Plus to market its program of
providing backache seminars at industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
   Equi Plus agreed to prepare a marketing plan, printed materials,
a video and slide presentation and other services. But Back Care
started getting invoices for work not done.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 30, 1986, a jury found him guilty, agreeing that
Robinson had submitted false invoices totaling $3,600 to Back Care.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Obermeier, the assistant district attorney who prosecuted
the case, asked Johnson County District Judge Herbert W. Walton to
apply the Habitual Criminal Act in sentencing Robinson in light of
Robinson's previous convictions. Walton did so, ordering five to 14
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Then in July, Johnson County charged Robinson with more fraud
and theft counts. This time he was accused of pocketing $50,000
while serving as a middleman in the sale of condominium property in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had talked an Overland Park man into investing $150,000
in the project in Page, Ariz., records state. He then told the
Arizona landowner spearheading the project that the Kansas investor
had put up only $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was convicted of making a false writing. Now he faced
an overall sentence of six to 19 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But Haymes, the Missouri probation officer, told /{The Star/} in
1987 that he didn't expect time behind bars to change Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never gives up,'' he said. ``He's like one of those toys
that runs into a wall and goes on.''

WHO IS JOHN E. ROBINSON SR. 
</HEADLINE>
 3 TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By By RICK MONTGOMERY, MARK MORRIS and DIANE CARROLL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Go back to 1985 to understand how John E. Robinson
Sr. became the man he is today, a career con man turned suspected
serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   That year he and his consulting company, Equi-II, seemed to be
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   A three-page spread in the August 1985 /{Farm Journal/} quoted
Robinson among other experts on the benefits of limited
partnerships for ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   Always nattily dressed, Robinson also was lining up investors
for some six-figure condominium deals. And he was telling people
about Equi-II's good Samaritan side, how it helped social-service
groups find homes for young mothers in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   He made a great impression that year: well-spoken, enthusiastic,
family man, polite, with just a hint of superiority.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy presented himself as if he was the president of the
Jaycees,'' said Karen Gaddis, a hospital social worker who had met
Robinson about that time.
</P>
<P>
   Equi-II, however, had another side. So did its creator.
</P>
<P>
   As 1985 clicked on, the FBI and officials in Missouri grew
concerned that the company was a front for black-market baby
selling. One young mother and her daughter had disappeared in
January after meeting with Robinson. By June, another witness
alleged that Robinson had sexually assaulted her with a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly addicted to theft, Robinson would turn out to have a
scam for everyone. To one woman he posed as a divorce lawyer; to
potential investors he boasted of having a hand in making ``First
Blood,'' the Sylvester Stallone film; to employers he struck an
earnest pose while swiping company checks, even postage stamps.
</P>
<P>
   And later, after the law had finally caught up with him and put
him behind bars for a few years, he still charmed. He worked his
cons first on the prison doctors, who recommended his early
release, and perhaps tragically on a prison librarian.
</P>
<P>
   The dangerous dimension to this pudgy con man surfaced with a
vengeance last week when barrels with the remains of five women
came out of a rural Kansas field and a Missouri storage locker.
</P>
<P>
   Now, investigators sort through Robinson's past while he sits in
the Johnson County Jail on a $5 million bond: businesses mostly on
paper, a ``Slavemaster'' presence on the Internet, and a growing
count of dead or missing persons that may have reached as many as
nine.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say they plan to file murder charges. If Robinson is
indeed a serial murderer, /{The Kansas City Star/} has found that
his profile reads unlike any other's.  &LR; hd:A kiss from Judy Garland
 &LR; tx:Of all the bizarre stories that would surround Robinson in his
56 years, perhaps the most unbelievable was that, as an Eagle
Scout, he sang for the Queen of England.
</P>
<P>
   Except that one's true.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson achieved the rank of Eagle Scout on Nov. 3, 1957. He
was 13 and senior patrol leader of Boy Scout Troop 259, which was
sponsored by the Holy Name Society of Mary Queen of Heaven Roman
Catholic Church in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like the youngest Eagle Scouts ever made,'' recalled
James Krcmarik, who made Eagle with Robinson. ``He wasn't a big
guy. He was a little guy. He was kind of quiet and nondescript.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven days later, Robinson flew to London to appear in the
chorus of a popular variety Boy Scout act called ``The Gang Show.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a /{Chicago Tribune/} article, Robinson _ a
freshman at Quigley Preparatory Seminary _ was selected ``because
of his scholastic ability, scouting experience and poise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He sings, too, in Holy Name Cathedral with the Quigley
choir,'' the article said. ``He also has an engaging smile.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``all-around Chicago school boy'' led 120 Scouts onto the
stage of the Palladium theater for a royal command performance Nov.
18, 1957.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper article described him as the first American boy
ever to appear before Queen Elizabeth at the annual royal command
variety performance.
</P>
<P>
   He met Judy Garland backstage. When he told a reporter that ``We
Americans gotta stick together,'' the actress kissed him and said,
``You're right.''
</P>
<P>
   He told British actress Gracie Fields that when he finished at
the Quigley Preparatory Seminary in Chicago he planned to study for
the priesthood and would certainly come to Rome some time.
</P>
<P>
   Like many aspects of Robinson's life, the event marked an
incredible, strange-but-true chapter cast against a childhood that
otherwise appeared rather bland.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Dec. 27, 1943, the middle child of five in a
blue-collar Cicero, Ill., family. His father, Henry Robinson, at
one time was a machinist for Western Electric. Decades later, among
the things John Robinson would tell Kansas Department of
Corrections psychiatric evaluators was that his father was a binge
drinker and that his mother, Alberta, was the disciplinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Cicero, the neighborhood where Robinson grew up, is an enclave
with its own city government on the western edge of Chicago. Those
living in the surrounding well-kept, lower-middle-class homes
around 4916 W. 32nd St. did not recall the Robinson family.
</P>
<P>
   He attended the cathedrallike Quigley in the heart of downtown
Chicago, a few blocks from the city's landmark Water Tower. At the
time Robinson attended, it was a popular five-year academy for
young Catholic boys wanting a good education and interested in the
priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson entered in the fall of 1957. In the 1958 edition of Le
Petit Seminaire, the Quigley yearbook, he looks like a bubbly
13-year-old choir boy with a cherubic smile. He does not appear in
yearbooks beyond the 1958 edition.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shotke, former public relations director for Chicago Boy
Scouts, said Robinson was ``a good kid...an above-average student,
but not brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't talk a great deal, but when he did talk, it was to
produce an effect that he wanted,'' Shotke said. ``He was shrewd.
He was aspiring to more than he was capable of, quite frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 years later a Kansas Department of Corrections
clinical evaluation noted that he graduated with average grades,
with high marks in science but not in math.
</P>
<P>
   The report goes on to say that Robinson attended Morton Junior
College in Cicero in 1961 and trained as a medical X-ray
technician. He also said he worked at a hospital in that capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is thought to have moved to the Kansas City area about
1964, the year he married. He and Nancy Jo Robinson would raise
four children and stay together long after women with ties to John
Robinson began disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson lived his first five years in Kansas City without a
blot on his record, according to area court files. But then he
started stealing, again and again.  &LR; brk:Penny-ante professional
 &LR; tx:Right from the start of Robinson's scamming days, nobody was
too prominent to bilk.
</P>
<P>
   He began in the office of Wallace H. Graham _ Harry S. Truman's
personal physician. After a stint as office manager, Robinson was
convicted of embezzling money from Graham in August 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, then 25, was put on three years probation.
</P>
<P>
   He found a new job as a systems analyst at the Kansas City
office of Mobile Oil Corp. In September 1970, police charged
Robinson with stealing 6,200 postage stamps from the company,
valued at $372.
</P>
<P>
   He paid restitution.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, having moved back to Chicago, Robinson was
charged with embezzling $5,586 from his employer, the R.B. Jones
Co. He paid full restitution and the prosecution dismissed the
case.
</P>
<P>
   He came back to Kansas City and established Professional
Services Association Inc., a medical consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   One day he asked his secretary to prepare letters dated 1973 for
prospective clients saying that the Board of Regents of the
University of Missouri-Kansas City ``had voted (Robinson) the full
rights and privileges of professor'' at the School of Dentistry.
</P>
<P>
   Not true.
</P>
<P>
   First, UMKC didn't have a ``Board of Regents.'' Second, the
signature of the dental school's dean was forged, according to
court documents.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in Missouri returned a four-count
indictment against Robinson and his Professional Services
Association in 1975 for securities fraud and mail fraud. The
damning evidence was another letter distributed to potential
investors.
</P>
<P>
   It suggested that pharmaceutical maker Marion Laboratories was
negotiating with Robinson to acquire Professional Services
Association and to purchase $364,000 worth of training manuals.
</P>
<P>
   A Marion executive, John E. Hartlein, supposedly signed the
letter. One problem: his name was misspelled ``Hartlin.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mac Cahal of Prairie Village received the letter, he
contacted his good friend Ewing M. Kauffman _ founder of Marion
Labs. ``Ewing hit the ceiling,'' Cahal recalled last week.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge fined Robinson $2,500 and placed him on three
years probation.  &LR; brk:A good impression  &LR; tx:Jack Walker of Overland
Park, Kan., a retired physician, said he hired John Robinson in the
mid-1970s to serve as a business consultant for the Family Practice
Department at the University of Kansas Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Walker at the time was department chairman and mayor of Overland
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was hired by a corporation formed by the department's
doctors, Walker said, so state funds were never involved in paying
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came and presented himself to me as an expert as a
physician's professional consultant,'' a service that a lot of
doctors were beginning to use, Walker told /{The Star/}.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a very good impression: well-dressed, nice-looking,
late 20s, seemed to know a lot, very glib, good speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he brought Robinson to a staff meeting and ``our
people all liked him so we hired him.''
</P>
<P>
   After only a few months, doctors in the orthopedic surgery
department, which also had hired Robinson, advised him they were
letting Robinson go, he said, because of ``doubts about his
handling of our financial affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Walker said, Robinson told him that he needed the
corporation's checkbook. The corporation's bookkeeper objected.
After hearing other troubling reports, Walker dismissed Robinson.
 &LR; brk:Money leaks away  &LR; tx:In July 1977 he moved his family into a
new home at 15500 Arapaho in a budding Stanley subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   And he had a new venture: hydroponics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If It Grows It Grows Better Hydroponically,'' pitched
Robinson's Hydro-Gro Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A booklet he published featured water-based home-gardening
products that would allow families to grow tomatoes, cucumbers and
other vegetables ``in a minimum space, in the corner of your
home.'' One page featured a photograph of Robinson's 5-year-old
twins grinning in their ``Grow Your Own'' T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that as you read this book,'' said the section about
the author, Robinson, ``you will form an acquaintance with John
Robinson as a sensitive and stimulating human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people viewed him that way.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Rickard, now 47, said she first met Robinson when her
father, Brooks, agreed to invest in Hydro-Gro. Her mother, Beth,
was dying of cancer and her father, who was recently retired, was
under a lot of stress to keep up with the mounting medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Nancy Rickard was a young, aspiring artist, and
Robinson allowed her to illustrate his how-to gardening booklet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very nice to me, very encouraging,'' she said last
week. ``He coached me through it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Brooks Rickard and some of his children had invested
more than $5,000 in the Hydro-Gro venture. An aunt had invested
about $20,000, another relative said.
</P>
<P>
   They lost it all.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor remembers Robinson as more gruff than sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was condescending to other people in the neighborhood. The
guy was intense. He wasn't someone you'd joke with, '' said
Margaret Adams, whose family lived next door for eight years. The
Robinson children baby-sat the Adamses' pets.
</P>
<P>
   Adams first met Robinson in 1978 at a trade show where she
watched him demonstrate his hydroponic unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we moved out here I learned that he lived next door. So
I went over and asked him about hydroponics and that unit he was
selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was nice as can be as he was explaining it to me, but when
he told me the price _ between two and three thousand dollars _ I
said that would be too expensive for me to grow tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was furious, telling me that he had wasted his time and he
shouldn't be dealing with people who were small time.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams remembers that Robinson once took a swing at a neighbor
and was verbally abusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear him yelling at the kids and her and anyone. Our
lots are 4 acres apiece, but we're down in the valley and sound
carries.''  &LR; brk:`He'll stop at nothing'  &LR; tx:Not all of Robinson's
schemes were aimed at fattening his wallet. At least one was
designed to gratify his ego.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1977 he was honored as ``Man of the Year'' at a
luncheon sponsored by a local sheltered workshop association and
attended by then state Sen. Mary Gant.
</P>
<P>
   After the luncheon, at which Robinson received a plaque that he
had ordered, details emerged that suggested Robinson had engineered
the award for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Letters to the mayor's office asking for the proclamation
purportedly were signed by Paul Reiff, then the director of a
sheltered workshop on Truman Road in Kansas City. Two weeks after
the luncheon, Reiff told /{The Star/} he never signed such letters.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Reiff remembered the profound embarrassment he felt as
Robinson rose to accept the award. Robinson had only been on the
board of the workshop for a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me he was trying to fake surprise,'' Reiff said
recently. ``I thought, this guy is bad news. If he'll use an
organization that's trying to help the disabled to his personal
advantage, he'll stop at nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the luncheon, /{The Star/} also received a six-page
typewritten press release profiling Robinson, which was purportedly
prepared by Robert G. O'Bryant, former president of a sheltered
workshop.
</P>
<P>
   Again, O'Bryant told the paper he knew nothing of the profile.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few weeks of the deception becoming known, Robinson
resigned from the board of the sheltered workshop association.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's pattern was clear to one of his defense attorneys,
Bruce Houdek.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a small-time, penny-ante con guy,'' Houdek said. ``He
worked harder getting out of trouble than getting into it.''

<P>
   (goes on.'')
 &LR; brk:`Docile, nonviolent'  &LR; tx:In 1987, Catherine Clampitt, 27,
tried to escape a life of drugs and drinking in Wichita Falls,
Texas, by moving in with her brother and sister-in-law in Overland
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Soon she told them she found work at a company called Equi-II,
which apparently was still operating while Robinson was appealing
his convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson finally lost. His Kansas prison sentence began on May
16, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The following month, Clampitt was reported missing by her
brother who had not seen her for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Inmate Robinson showed exemplary behavior in the four years
Kansas had him. In fact, when he was office coordinator for the
prison maintenance operations at the Hutchinson Correctional
Facility, Robinson developed computer programs that would help the
state save up to $100,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when he leaves,'' wrote physical plant supervisor Jim
Jestes in 1989, ``this office should function well.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally impressed were the medical and psychiatric professionals
who examined Robinson in late 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Although Robinson by that time had suffered a series of strokes
that left slackness in the right side of his face, ``his verbal
skills (were measured) in the high average range, performance
skills in the very superior range.''
</P>
<P>
   The clinical team concluded:
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a docile, nonviolent individual who does not pose a
threat to society....we recommend his immediate release on
parole.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas paroled Robinson in January 1991, but he was not free.
His Johnson County troubles occurred while he was still on
probation for the Guy's Foods theft 10 years earlier. He faced more
years behind Missouri bars.
</P>
<P>
   From the Moberly Correctional Center, Robinson wrote to a Clay
County Circuit Judge in May 1991, begging for an early release:
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this what is considered proportionate punishment for my
crime in Missouri? I taught my children to believe in the basic
fairness of our system of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   A Missouri prison physician, Fred L. King, examined Robinson and
considered him so sick and frail from strokes he wrote that ``this
inmate should be released without delay.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Missouri parole board made Robinson stay another two
years. Eventually he wound up at the Western Missouri Correctional
Center in Cameron, where the prison library was staffed by a
middle-aged woman named Beverly Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   The two got to know each other, Bonner's former husband said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson remained imprisoned in Cameron until the spring of
1993. At 49 he was a free man again.
</P>
<P>
   A year later librarian Bonner would seek another kind of
freedom. She divorced and moved to Kansas City. She told friends
that she had a wonderful job lined up, one that involved foreign
travel.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later she dropped out of sight.
 &LR; brk:New beginnings  &LR; tx:While Robinson was in Hutchinson, his wife
had sold their longtime Stanley home to Gene Clark in January 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Robinson ``was living with the twins then and was forced
to sell the house because he'd gotten them so far in debt with all
his shenanigans,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   He never did meet John Robinson, but knew of his reputation and
stories of missing women from friends on the Overland Park police
force. ``They'd been watching him for some time,'' he said. ``But
they couldn't do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Robinson got out of Missouri prison, he moved back in with
his wife, who was managing the Southfork Mobile Home Community in
Belton. They lived in a unit at 464 Valeen Lane.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1993, Robinson rented a Stor-Mor unit in Raymore. His
wife had rented two before that in November 1992, one in her name
and the other in her husband's name.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1995, Robinson and his wife bought a house on Big
Pine Key in Florida. Their oldest son moved into the house, for
which his parents paid about $95,000, according to Florida
assessment records. The Florida home would be sold in early 1999,
and the couple would then buy 16.5 acres, complete with mobile home
and pond, in rural Linn County, about an hour drive south of Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Robinson's probation ended in 1996, about the time he
and Nancy moved their trailer home to 36 Monterey Lane in Olathe.
There, Nancy began managing the Santa Barbara Estates park of 484
mobile homes.
</P>
<P>
   While she spent her days at the park office, residents often saw
her husband watering flowers on the boulevard or coming and going
in his white pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Clara Pulley, 79, said Robinson was helpful on more than one
occasion. As she worked out in the yard, she said: ``He'd stop by
and say, `Don't you think you've worked a little too long in the
heat?' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Timmons, 79, who lived next to the Robinsons on Monterey
Lane, added: ``He always seemed to be in a hurry. He never had time
for long conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Timmons said Robinson put out ``marvelous decorations'' for all
the holidays and kept his yard in immaculate shape.
</P>
<P>
   But the tidiness of the Robinson marriage was a matter of
question.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, one ``John Anthony Robinson'' applied for a
marriage license to Izabela K. Lewicka, a Polish immigrant who had
moved to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   She has not been seen since last fall, prosecutors note.
 &LR; brk:Still selling  &LR; tx:In the mid-90s, John Robinson began a free
publication about mobile homes. The trade magazine, /{Manufactured
Modular Living/} resembled another magazine published by John
Woolfolk of Prairie Village.
</P>
<P>
   It was so similar that Woolfolk sent a ``cease and desist''
letter to Robinson ``but he just ignored it,'' said Woolfolk, who
stopped publishing in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like he just lifted everything from my magazine,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Word spread in the mobile-home trade that Robinson's magazine
was one to avoid. ``That man was a constant black eye to us in the
industry,'' said Tom Hagar, president of Mid-America Home Center
Inc., in Lee's Summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``His articles would give suggestions to home owners that ran
against all the standards in the industry. He didn't care. When
anyone confronted him on what he was saying, he'd tell them it was
a free country.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet still, as always, Robinson maintained a smooth charm _ some
called it arrogance _ as he visited trailer parks and retail
centers trying to sell ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was extremely friendly, jovial even,'' said Debbie Adriano,
from Mid-America Discount Homes in Gardner. ``He always dressed
preppy, with khaki pants, loafers and a nice golf shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   To others _ such as Robinson's neighbor, Joy Friedemann, 43 _ he
seemed like ``a dirty old man.''
</P>
<P>
   She said he repeatedly tried to lure her into having sex. He'd
drop by to flirt with the married mother and ask if her husband was
at work all day. Sometimes, Robinson would just stare at her and
say, ``Today?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I said, I'm going to tell your wife,'' Friedemann
told Robinson last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She don't care,'' Robinson supposedly shot back, but the
harassment stopped.  &LR; brk:Going online  &LR; tx:Just three months ago,
Robinson introduced himself to a local Web site designer, Steve
Gwartney, and asked him to develop an online version of the
modular-homes magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Gwartney produced a Web site _ www.mmhl.com _ tailored to
Robinson's precise specifications. A click of the mouse could link
browsers to various modular-home trade associations and retailers.
Another click, and ``J.R.'s Comments'' would flash on the screen,
with a line sketch of a grinning Robinson in the upper corner.
</P>
<P>
   His editorial for the May 2000 edition was headlined:
``Manufactured Homes Hold Their Value.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwartney, who said he was still owed about $1,000 for his work,
said his client appeared to have little Web expertise. He had no
idea that Robinson was also using an online identity
``Slavemaster'' to seek out women interested in engaging in
sadomasochistic sex.
</P>
<P>
   Two women he encountered in cyberspace met him in separate
Johnson County hotels this spring to act as his ``sex slaves,'' as
authorities later put it.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the women talked to authorities after their encounters.
They said Robinson had brutalized them in a way that went beyond
what they had intended.
</P>
<P>
   Their reports prompted police to file sexual assault charges
against Robinson and to launch yet another investigation.
</P>
<P>
   This time they found bodies. Two were discovered in barrels in
Linn County, Kan., and three more were found in barrels in the
storage facility the Robinsons had rented years ago in Raymore. All
appeared to have suffered blows to the head.
</P>
<P>
   No murder charges have been filed.
 &LR; brk:Geraniums and mum  &LR; tx:``He was a model neighbor,'' neighbor
Timmons said. ``We were really shocked to see all these charges
against him.''
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m. on June 2, Timmons stepped outside his trailer to
take a walk and saw plainclothes detectives escorting John Robinson
out of his trailer in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Nine or 10 unmarked police cars were parked around the Robinson
property. Officers stayed until 3 p.m. going through the trailer's
contents. Timmons said he saw them carry out a computer, fax
machine and cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a surreal scene there amid the potted pink geraniums that
decorated the Robinsons' patio out front, and the religious statue
in the flower bed. What on earth, Timmons wondered, could that nice
man who lived in one of the prettiest trailers in the park done to
bring out all those cops?
</P>
<P>
   When the police searching was complete _ after they hauled
Robinson's pickup away the following night _ Timmons remembered how
silent and stoic Robinson seemed, staring straight ahead, as the
authorities escorted him away.
</P>
<P>
   For once, John Robinson had nothing to say.  &LR; tag1:Staff writers

WASHBURN DOES IT ALL FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Jarrod Washburn smiled on the basepaths. He smiled in
the dugout. And he was smiling in the clubhouse after his
performance both on the mound and at the plate keyed the Angels'
10-3 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks Saturday afternoon in
front of 35,213 at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn (2-1) gave up one run and five hits in seven innings to
earn the win, but what had everybody talking after the game was his
performance at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn drew a two-out, bases-loaded walk in the second inning
to drive in the first run of the game. It also allowed Darin Erstad
a chance to bat in the inning, and Erstad drove in two runs with a
double.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Washburn got his first major-league hit, a
blooper that landed just inside the left-field foul line that drove
in another run. And in both the fifth and seventh innings, Washburn
laid down successful sacrifice bunts.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia called for the baseball after
Washburn's hit, and Washburn broke into an ear-to-ear grin while
standing on first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was laughing because I couldn't believe I got a hit,'' said
Washburn, whose last hit was in high school. ``I was a pretty good
hitter in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys (Angels pitchers) have worked hard the last 2{
weeks offensively,'' Scioscia said. ``You couldn't have any better
day than Washburn had. The pitchers take a lot of pride in their
hitting. The first two at-bats were huge in this ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game was the Angels' second this season in a National
League ballpark, meaning there is no designated hitter and the
pitchers must bat. In Friday's game, pitcher Brian Cooper got one
at-bat and struck out. Of course, he was facing Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks pitcher Omar Daal (2-7) had given up a two-out
double to Matt Walbeck that gave the Angels runners at second and
third in the second inning. But Daal intentionally walked No.8
hitter Adam Kennedy to load the bases and get to Washburn.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn walked on a 3-1 pitch that could have been called a
strike. Instead, it forced home Garret Anderson with the first run
of the game. Erstad followed with his two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, the Angels had already scored twice on RBI
singles by Walbeck and Kennedy when Washburn lifted a little pop-up
behind third and down the line. It fell in and gave the Angels a
6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, Benji Gil homered and Tim Salmon hit a
two-run homer for a 9-0 lead. Anderson homered in the sixth to put
the Angels up 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   The rest was up to Washburn, who threw six scoreless innings
before giving up a leadoff homer to Luis Gonzalez in the seventh.
He was replaced by Lou Pote to start the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best pitches he made were his fastball, locating his
fastball,'' Scioscia said. ``He never got into huge trouble, but he
was able to prevent trouble by making pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After my last start (seven runs in 5 innings vs. the Dodgers)
I needed to get my command back,'' Washburn said. ``This was the
first time I didn't have any walks. I put the ball over the plate
and made 'em put the ball in play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had a typical day at the plate, getting 13 hits,
including three by Kennedy and two each by Salmon, Anderson and
Walbeck. Salmon raised his batting average to .284, which doesn't
like seem much unless one considers he was hitting only .242 as
late as May 21.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting .217 in April, Salmon hit .330 in May and is
hitting .345 in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it seems I've got to get down so low, there's nowhere
else to go,'' Salmon said. ``It seems like I get down to
ground-zero and build myself up. I refine my swing and get it
going. This is pretty typical for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also enjoyed winning a game by seven runs, when so
many have come down to the final inning or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have our share of tight games and blowouts,''
Scioscia said. ``This is a club that grinds it out. We're the type
of club that knows we can get back into any game, or put a team
away. But it's good to see us win a game by getting out in front
and playing well from start to finish.'' &QL;

IT'S ALWAYS BEEN HIP TO BE `HICK'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The New York papers headlined the Eastern
Conference finals ``Knicks vs. Hicks.'' After the Indiana Pacers
advanced to the NBA Finals to face the Lakers, a fan in Los Angeles
waved a sign reading, ``Bring on the Hicks.''
</P>
<P>
   And I guess they might be right about the Pacers and their
public. But only if their definition of ``hicks'' is broad enough
to account for the coolest arena in pro basketball, the hippest
franchise history in pro basketball, and the loyalty of a citified
Hoosier named David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, in a studio-audience quiz segment, Letterman cajoled a
woman into choosing a category called ``Know Your ABA Indiana
Pacers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What was Bob Netolicky's nickname?'' was one question.
(``Netto!'' the woman was allowed to read off Letterman's cue card,
as the screen showed a mugshot of the toothy forward of the 1960s
and '70s, a high-living young man who kept a pet ocelot and lioness
and styled himself as the Joe Namath of Indianapolis.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Who had the ABA's best hairdo?'' was the next question.
(``Darrell Hillman!'' the woman read, before Letterman pointed out
the name was in fact Darnell, and we saw a picture of the man with
the biggest Afro in the ABA.)
</P>
<P>
   OK, Letterman seemed to be laughing (ital) at (endital) the old
Pacers, not with them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, evoking the memory of those Pacers of the bell-bottoms
era, of a hard-drinking and brawling coach named Slick Leonard and
players who followed him to the bar and beyond, of the American
Basketball Association and its trend-setting 3-point arc, slam-dunk
contests and bikinied ball girls, served as a humbling reminder to
Californians tempted to look down our sunburned noses at the ...
hicks.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers don't have the corner on cool in this NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers definitely don't have the corner on history.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, with six NBA championships in Los Angeles, will
never lay down roots as deep in their home region as the Pacers,
with no NBA titles, have grown in theirs.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly needs to be said that basketball in Indiana is like
celluloid in Hollywood, the substance of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back there maybe this isn't the right term _ but it seems like
it's almost a religion,'' said Bill Sharman, the former Lakers
coach and longtime club executive. ``It seems like those people (in
Indiana) go to church and basketball games, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the basketball party that begins here with tonight's Game 3
at Conseco Fieldhouse, it's not the ``hicks'' who should feel ill
at ease, it's the L.A. types.
</P>
<P>
   I'll bet you've forgotten, if you're old enough to have ever
known, that this isn't the first time the Pacers have faced Los
Angeles in a championship final. The first time was in May 1970,
when the Pacers and the Los Angeles Stars played for the ABA title.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, in the shadow of the Lakers in a city with a limited
basketball appetite, typically drew 3,000 a game to the Sports
Arena. The Pacers drew 10,000 every night.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Brown dropped 53-, 39- and 45-point games on Willie Wise,
and the Pacers won that series in six to take home the first of
their three trophies in the red-white-and-blue-ball league.
</P>
<P>
   Sharman and Leonard were the respective coaches of the Stars and
Pacers. Sharman remembers Bill Cosby showing up for one of the
games in Los Angeles, but that was it for actual star power. The
next season, the Stars moved to Utah and won the ABA title after
turning back Indiana in the finals of the reconfigured Western
Division.
</P>
<P>
   Those Pacers rosters boasted not just the free-wheeling Brown
and the flamboyant Hillman and Netolicky, but two-time ABA MVP Mel
Daniels, 3-point ace Billy Keller, Indiana favorite Rick Mount and
early George McGinnis, the Karl Malone of his day.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of them could have made it in the NBA, and McGinnis
did with the Philadelphia 76ers. Unfortunately, most were ex-Pacers
by the time the ABA folded and the team joined the establishment
league in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers endured a long down cycle in which they missed the
NBA playoffs 11 times in 13 seasons. Thus the franchise and its
fans acquired something else the Lakers are missing: grit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lakers had the great years (but) they've never had a
struggling franchise. They've never had to go through that,'' said
Leonard, a former Minneapolis and L.A. Lakers player who, since his
Pacers coaching days, has been a Pacers radio man. ``Now, they've
had some ballclubs that weren't that good, and I know it's been a
while since they won a championship. But they really never had to
struggle the way the Pacer franchise had to struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these years, and all the loyalty dating back to when
the franchise started, this (first NBA Finals appearance) gives
everybody a great deal of satisfaction. Everybody feels a part of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who walks into Conseco Fieldhouse in downtown
Indianapolis feels a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   The first-year arena, properly described as the first ``retro''
basketball building, the sport's Camden Yards, captures Indiana
hoops history in its exhibit cases and its ambiance.
</P>
<P>
   It is the anti-Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've seen `Hoosiers,' it's like that,'' Pacers
forward-center Sam Perkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ```Fieldhouse' says it all,'' Pacers guard Travis Best said.
``You're not going to get all the glitz and glamour.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, in some circles, glitz and glamour equal cool while the
celebration of home-grown history is for hicks.
</P>
<P>
   But not here. Not this week. The hicks are hip.
</P>
<P>
   I like what Sharman had in mind when he said of the Pacers, ``If
they weren't playing us, I could root for them very easily.'' &QL;

ERSTAD GETS HIT NO. 100
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Darin Erstad's second-inning double Saturday afternoon
was his 100th hit of the season. He did it in 61 games, the fastest
to 100 since Heinie Manush got 100 in 60 games for the Washington
Senators in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad's reaction when informed of his achievement: ``So? ...
People can talk all you want about what you're doing now. But at
the end of the season is when it really counts. Every day's
important, but you have to keep it in perspective. There's a lot of
baseball left.''
</P>
<P>
   If he continues his current pace, Erstad would finish the season
with 265 hits. The major-league record for one season is 257, set
by George Sisler in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, Erstad has been sensational,'' manager Mike
Scioscia said. ``He's been as consistent as any ballplayer I've
seen over as long a stretch as I've seen. It's not like he's on a
hot streak. It's been going on for over a third of the season. He's
been as good as you can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, though, said it's not as easy as he's made it look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I battle to get myself in position to get ready to
play,'' he said. ``It's not like it's easy. You try to put a good
swing on the ball. Sometimes they fall, sometimes they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad admitted he never heard of Manush. ``I know my baseball
history, but I'm not that deep. If somebody breaks it 70 years from
now, I'm sure they'll say `Who the hell was Darin Erstad?'''
</P>
<P>
   REHAB REPORT: Tim Belcher and Ken Hill both made rehab starts
Saturday night, Belcher at Triple-A Edmonton and Hill at Single-A
Lake Elsinore. For Belcher, the start was his second on the current
rehab assignment. The goal was to get him up to about 75 pitches,
then have him join the starting rotation and start Saturday's game
in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   For Hill, the start is his first since he strained a rib-cage
muscle May 9. He'll need to make at least one more rehab start
before he can rejoin the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Dickson (strained hip) is scheduled to make a rehab start
for Edmonton today.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Mark Petkovsek threw 38 pitches in 1 innings Friday
night for Lake Elsinore and is expected to rejoin the team Monday.
Petkovsek has been out since May 17 after coming down with a viral
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   GOING WITH FOUR: Because of off days this week, the Angels don't
need a fifth starter until Saturday. Until then, they will continue
with a four-man rotation that consists of Seth Etherton (age 23),
Scott Schoeneweis (26), Jarrod Washburn (25) and Brian Cooper (25).
</P>
<P>
   ``As a group, they're holding their own,'' Scioscia said. ``They
are young and will make mistakes that cost runs, but their poise
has been so good. We're confident they're going to continue to keep
us in ballgames, when we're looking for the offense to take control
of games. But we want to see them be aggressive and put up zeroes
early in the game, so we don't have to come back so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Combined, Etherton, Schoeneweis, Cooper and Washburn are 9-7
with a 4.74 ERA. By comparison, the American League average ERA is
4.88. &QL;

INCOME-TAX _ A citizens group has been amassing signatures to place
on the November ballot a proposal to abolish Arizona's state income
tax. The movement has state leaders so alarmed that they have
launched an all-out, largely behind-the-scenes assault on the
supporters behind the plan, hoping to hobble the measure from

SHOOTING _ Within a 72-hour period last February, Bricie Tribble
went from a puzzling victim to hero to suspect in a murder
conspiracy. Four months later, Apache Junction police are still
unraveling a case that includes a killing that may or may not have
been self-defense, a dead man with no traceable past, a mysterious
package filled with potentially incriminating evidence, and notes
on a corpse that ended Tribble's brief status as a National Rifle
