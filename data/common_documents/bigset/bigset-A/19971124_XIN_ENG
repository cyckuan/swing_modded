<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said here today that Vietnam is Russia's close
partner.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Argentine Allegation of Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran today strongly rejected
the allegation raised by an Argentine official that Tehran was
possibly behind a terrorist bombing in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi urged the Argentine
government to "watch for the conspiracies now jeopardizing the
interests of Iran and Argentina."
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said an anti-Iran propaganda campaign has been
launched by certain circles in Argentina to please the Zionist
regime (Israel).
</P>
<P>
Media reports said an Argentine official stated Saturday that
Argentina was examining the evidences to determine if Iran had
been involved in the bomb blast of a Jewish center in Buenos Aires
on July 18, 1994, which killed some 88 people and injured 159
others.
</P>
<P>
Manouchehr Motamer, an Iranian national, offered some
information to the Argentine judicial authorities that four
Iranian diplomats were involved in the bomb blast. However,
during the past three years no enough evidence was found to prove
Iran's involvement in the bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the propaganda campaign against Iran aimed
to make up for the political setbacks suffered by Israel and the
United States at the recent Doha regional economic conference and
in the so-called Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. which failed to array its European allies
against Iran has now launched an anti-Iran propaganda campaign
in Argentina, adding that the U.S. and Israel have embarked on a
new wave of propaganda campaign against Iran to divert the
public opinion from their repeated defeats in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The investigations launched by the Argentine government over
the past three years have indicated that Iran had not been
involved in the bomb blast, he said.
</P>
<P>
Any reference to the baseless allegation raised by an Iranian
fugitive with records of embezzlement and collaboration with the
U.S. intelligence service and who has been condemned by a
U.S. court on charge of shop-lifting is a suspicious move, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He warned the argentine officials to keep close eyes on the
conspiracy which is aimed at damaging the interests of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
One week ago, Iran and the European Union has resolved their
seven-month-long diplomatic row which was triggered by a Berlin
court verdict accusing Tehran of sponsoring terrorist
assassination of four Iranian Kurdish leaders in Berlin in
1992. Now all 15 EU countries' envoys have returned to Tehran
after Iran reached a compromise with the EU on November 13.

<HEADLINE> Crooked Accounting Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Fiance
Minister Daniel Yona has expressed concern over dishonest and
unscrupulous accountants and auditors, calling for their removal
in the profession to restore credibility, press reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the 19th National Board of Accountants and
Auditors (NBAA) graduation ceremony in Dar es Salaam Saturday,
Yona said auditors and accountants need to be in the forefront in
the fighting against fiscal mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
"Accountants and auditors are supposed to be watchdogs but
unfortunately the game wardens have now become the poachers," he
said at the ceremony, which was officiated by President Benjamin
Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
It has become commonplace nowadays to hear a cashier, a book
keeper, an accountant clerk or even a Financial Controller
stealing from a firm. "We have been making losses for years," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The financial minister called on the accountants and auditors
to improve professional ethics and help the government in
fighting financial mismanagement and graft practices at their
workplaces.
</P>
<P>
"You should strive to eliminate fake accounts so as to boost the
status of your profession," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nearly Half Nigerians in Poverty, Says Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian, once boasting an
annual gross national product of 1,000 U.S. Dollars per capita at
the oil boom in the 70s, is facing the hard fact that nearly half
of its people are living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the outcome of a nationwide consumer survey
conducted by the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS), which covers
the period between April 1996 and March 1997.
</P>
<P>
Taking poverty level as 657.69 Naira (one U.S. Dollars equals
to about 83 Naira currently) which is two-thirds of the weighted
mean per capita monthly expenditure, FOS found that 42.9 percent
of the total urban households are below the poverty line. The
figure for the rural area is 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Those below poverty line in the northeastern zone account for
55.9 percent of the total households sampled in the north, while
37.3 percent was below poverty line in the total households in
the southeastern zone.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, which sampled 13,801 households
nationwide, more than 75 percent of their monthly income is spent
on household needs.
</P>
<P>
Of the average income of 5,383 Naira, 4,058 Naira goes to such
basic household needs as hood, accommodation, fuel and light,
drinks and tobacco, household goods, transport, clothing and
other essential items.
</P>
<P>
In its preliminary report of the National Consumer Survey, FOS
said household income per month is higher in the south and
central zones than in the northern zone.
</P>
<P>
The highest income (7,213 Naira) is recorded in the
southeastern zone, the country's oil production base, while the
lowest comes from the northwest, where most people are engaged in
farming.
</P>
<P>
People in the two zones, consequently, spend the most and the
least on household items, which stands at 5,194 and 2,941 Naira
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The effect of urbanization reflects in the income pattern.
</P>
<P>
Whereas the income level of an average urban dweller is 6,490
Naira, that of rural dweller is 5,066 Naira.
</P>
<P>
The household expenditure under survey does not take into
account school fees and medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
The survey does not reveal much difference in the size of
households in urban and rural areas. Whereas the urban households
have averagely 4.4 members, the rural ones have that of 4.7.
</P>
<P>
Of the 13,801 households sampled, 1,863 or 13.5 percent are
headed by females, mainly in the southern and central zones.
</P>
<P>
The national average age of the head of the household is 44.6
years, 45 years for the rural area and 43.5 for the urban area.
Female heads of households have an average age of 48 years, while
their male counterparts recorded an average of 44 years.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, west and southeast zones have a slightly higher
average for the age of the head of households than the other
regions. The report attributes the differences to early marriage
in some parts of the country than in others.

PARIS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- France will separate for the
first time in the year-book of magistrature the names of the
judges who served the Vichy regime under Marshal Philippe Petain
from those who joined resistance against German occupation, said
the daily Le Monde today.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Rules Out Dialog With Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today ruled out the possibility of holding any dialog with the
terrorists that have been fighting a five-year war against his
secular government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the opening of the Nubia Museum in the
Upper Egyptian city of Aswan, the president said that he has
learned from the past and from the dialog with the terrorists in
the 1980s, during the rule of late president Anwar Sadat, that this
kind of approach only makes the terrorists get stronger.
</P>
<P>
Aswan, about 800 kilometers south of Cairo, is about 300
kilometers down from Luxor, which on Monday witnessed a bloodbath
when Islamic militants gunned down 62 people.
</P>
<P>
"The matter would be like a dialog with the blind and the
deaf," Mubarak said, adding that any dialog with the terrorists
would be useless now that they have resorted to arms.
</P>
<P>
The government has rejected several ceasefire calls made since
July by some jailed leaders of Jihad and the Gamaa Islamiya,
Egypt's ultra-radical groups.
</P>
<P>
It has consistently rejected any talks with the militants with
one exception, which took place in 1993 when former Interior
Minister Mohamed Abdel-Halim Moussa conducted negotiations with
the militant groups via a mediation committee. The negotiations
proved unsuccessful and cost Moussa his job.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Egypt is doing its best to guarantee
the safety of tourists to prevent the recurrence of such terrorist
attacks and called upon all countries to muster efforts to fight
this global ailment. But he declined to dislose the results of
investigations into the November 17 attack.
</P>
<P>
The six terrorists who carried out the attack on tourists in
front of Luxor's Hatshepsut Temple were all killed, according to
Egyptian Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Before addressing reporters, amid tight security, Mubarak, his
ministers and a host of world leaders were shown around the giant
60-million-Egyptian pound (nearly 18-million-U.S.-dollar) museum,
built on a rocky hilltop in Aswan.
</P>
<P>
Egypt opened the museum less than a week after the savage
massacre in Luxor to show the government's resolve to revive
tourism, a 3-billion-dollar-per-year industry for the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Before the incident, Aswan and Luxor, the two most brilliant
archeological pearls in Upper Egypt, had been largely free from
Islamic militant insurgency, which in the past five years has
claimed 1,300 lives.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, angered by the laxity of security at major tourist
sites, has sacked his interior minister. The new security chief
immediately revamped the security leaderships and vowed to
fight terrorists across the country.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Starts Visit in Guiana One Year After Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today began a three-day visit to France's overseas department of
Guiana in the Amazon region of South America, one year after high
school students staged riots in its capital Cayenne.
</P>
<P>
Chirac is accompanied by the State Secretary for Overseas
Departments and Territories, Jean-Jack Queyranne, and the Minister
of National Education, Claude Allegre.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will send a message of hope to the youth of the overseas
department, who make up half of the local population, insisting on
the importance of Guiana for France and the will of the government
to develop the territory, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
The European space center for sending Ariane rockets is based
in Kourou, in Guiana.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will also meet with Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso on Tuesday in Saint-Georges at the Oyapock River
along the border between Guiana and Brazil. Immigration of
Brazilians into Guiana is expected to be the center of their
talks.
</P>
<P>
The visit took place after a government report said recently
that Guiana is faced with three crises: crisis of development,
crisis of political confidence and crisis of culture and identity.
</P>
<P>
Government officials suggested a plan to improve conditions of
public equipments and public services, to improve territorial
management and to control settlement of people in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Guiana is faced with a large number of immigrants mainly from
Brazil, Haiti and Surinam, while the local Creole community can no
longer absorb new-comers because of dense population rate
concentrated along the coast area of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Diarrhea Breaks out in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Severe diarrhoea has broken
out in the Somali capital Mogadishu, following the heavy rains
that hit southern Somalia for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in Mogadishu said at least five children die everyday
for what is termed as "acute watery diarrhoea".
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the main Paediatric Hospital of Mogadishu which is
run by SOS-Austria said, more than 400 cases of acute diarrhoea
were registered in the out-patient department of the hospital
during the the past nine days.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Mohamed Ibrahim, administrator of the hospital, said an
average of 40 children, most of them under five, are being
received every 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
He added that 50 percent of the children are those deported
from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, while other 20 percent are from
the flood-displaced families in the southern regions of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Eleven children have died of diarrhoea in SOS hospital in the
past three days, among whom were three male infants who died as
they arrived in the hospital, he said, adding that other
considerable number of children affected by the disease die
before making to the hospitals every day.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rains that hit the capital have worsened the already
poor sanitation situation thus spreading the contagious diseases.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mohamed Mohamud Fuje from Dr Hassan Jiis Memorial Hospital
told the press that lack of public awareness and water
chlorination program in the city have also contributed to the
speedy spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
"Many people do not even know what to do and where to go when
they are hit by the diarrhoea and their body resistance is very
weak," Fuje said.
</P>
<P>
Aid agencies have focused only on the flood-affected regions
of southern Somalia, and "they don't consider Mogadishu as a
flood-affected area," he added.
</P>
<P>
The huge influx of diarrhoea victims have stormed the SOS
hospital which has only 120 beds. The six qualified doctors and
14 nurses are all attending the patients during the hectic hour
of the day today.
</P>
<P>
Parents of the young patients who were stranded in the
hospital gardens with infusions hanging on with their children
under the trees, asked for more infusions and antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
"We used to spend maximum 100 infusions per day, and now are
exceeding 600 pieces," said Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
Rahma Hassan, 35 and a mother of four children under five who
were all affected by the diarrhoea, said three of her children
have recovered while one more still remained in the hospital
gardens.
</P>
<P>
Rahma who is one of the deportee from Saudi Arabia, blamed the
change of tDiarrhoeahe weather and water for the cause of the
disease, saying, "In Saudi Arabia, my children drank clean water,
but here we're using non-chlorinated water brought on donkey
driven carts from open shallow well."
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people are deported from Saudi Arabia every week
as part of their campaign against illegal foreigners in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Monument Erected in Greece to Commemorate Killed Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos today unveiled a monument in the northern Greek
city of Thessaloniki to commemorate the city's 50,000 Jews killed
by the Nazi occupation forces in concentration camps in eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the unveiling ceremony attended by government
officials from Greece, Israel, the U.S. and representatives of
Jewish communities from around the world, Stephanopoulos said that
the Greek people had not, all these years, forgotten the victims
of the Nazi barbarity.
</P>
<P>
For the Greek people, He said, the memory of the genocide of
the Jews would always hurt. He called on everyone to never again
allow evil to take root in the world.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the ceremony, Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis said that in honoring the memory of the Jews of
Thessaloniki and once again condemning the Nazi atrocities, they
might hope that the present and future generations would learn
from this bitter lesson.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a message that
the Thessaloniki monument would stand as a reminder of the past
evil but also as an inspiration for future good.
</P>
<P>
The monument, which shows a tangle of human skeletons beneath a
burning menora, the candelabra used in Jewish worship, was crafted
by Yugoslav Jew sculptor Nador Gild, who created similar holocaust
memorials in Jerusalem, Belgrade and the Nazi concentration camp
Dachau.
</P>
<P>
Israel Saturday welcomed the Greek government's establishment
of such a monument.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin: Economic Drop Stopped in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Economic recession has stopped
for the first time over the period of reforms in Russia this year,
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a Russian-American forum of business elite held in Moscow
Chernomyrdin said that over the first 10 months of this year the
Russian GDP totalled 100.3 percent compared with last year's GDP,
production growth was up 1.6 percent and is expected to be up 1.8
percent by the end of the year, and annual inflation is expected
to be 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the premier, more than 75 percent of GDP came from
non-state companies. "Much has been said about whether our
privatization has gone right or wrong, but there has been no other
way for us," Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged mistakes had been made, but said that
privatization of big companies will be continued. Russia "intends
to do all it can to join the World Trade Organization by the end
of 1998," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He meanwhile called on foreign investment in Russian economy,
stressing that the Russian economy will be unable to develop
without investments.
</P>
<P>
The first major Russian-American business forum, held in Moscow
on November 22-23, is the first meeting of such magnitude between
business elite representatives of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The topics of the forum are bilateral contacts, international
financial markets and prospects for regional and international
integration.
</P>
<P>
The forum was being attended by representatives of leading
Russian and American companies, banks and financial groups.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Strongly Denies Making Promise to Freeze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Countering local media
reports, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vehemently
denied today having made any promise to the U.S. government over
freezing settlement construction.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that U.S President Bill Clinton told
former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres Friday that Netanyahu
had committed to a time-out of settlement construction in the
West Bank. In his reaction, Netanyahu told today's weekly Cabinet
meeting that he had never made such statements or commitments to
freeze settlement construction.
</P>
<P>
A Cabinet statement quoted Netanyahu as saying Israel made no
promise on settlements, neither in his meeting with U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright in London nine days ago nor in the
meetings held in Washington by Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy with Palestinian negotiators early this month.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Israel has made it clear that freezing
settlements is outside the bands of the agreement. He stressed
that if the Palestinian side wants Israel to further pull back
from the West Bank, it should make progress on living up to their
security commitments.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu today held extensive consultations with senior
ministers in the inner Cabinet Levy, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky on
current security situation and the stalemated peace process.
</P>
<P>
Local television and newspapers reported today that during
Clinton's meeting with Peres, who is a leading architect of the
Israeli-Arab peace process, the U.S. president reportedly said it
is difficult to have faith in Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
In a public speech in the same day, Clinton called bluntly on
both Israeli and Palestinian sides to advance the peace process,
warning that "the window of progress will become smaller with
time."
</P>
<P>
In reaction to media reports on the Clinton-Peres meeting,
Israeli Prime Minister's Office today strongly denounced the
leaking of the meeting to the press by Peres' aides as
"shameful." The office said that no meeting has been arranged
between Peres and Netanyahu to allow the former to brief on his
talks with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, European Union (EU) special envoy Miguel Moratinos
held talks here today with senior Israeli officials to discuss
the EU initiative on formulating the so-called code of conduct
for the Israeli-Palestinian permanent talks which have not yet
begun.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos told Israel Radio that he believes an agreement on
the EU initiative will be signed by the end of the month. He said
neither sides are creating difficulty in formulating the code of
conduct, which calls on both sides to refrain from taking
unilateral steps.
</P>
<P>
The code also demanded both sides to promote security
cooperation in order to prevent further violence and terrorist
attacks. Specifically, the sides will set up a permanent security
council to deal with security issues.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said he is working to finalize the remaining 10
percent of the code of conduct. Israel Radio reported that under
the code of conduct, Israel is not committing itself to freezing
settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side is reportedly opposed to the idea of
referring mutual disputes to the international community, a
position cited by Israel as proof that the Palestinians intend to
continue creating troubles for Israel in the international
arena.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu's Senior Assistant Resigns over Likud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister's
office Director-General Avidor Lieberman has resigned over the
crisis in the ruling Likud party caused by a controversial party
convention on the internal election primaries.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Channel 2 Television reported today that the Prime
Minister's office has refused to comment on Lieberman's
resignation, who was widely considered Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's right-hand man and has been the focus figure in the
recent crisis.
</P>
<P>
Likud has been mired in the crisis since its central committee
decided on the November 12 convention to scrap the election
primary system, which has conferred upon the Likud high-ups
considerable advantage in the choice of the party's candidates for
the Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Likud's ministers and Knesset members, who hotly oppose the
decision and are critical of its proceedings, have demanded
Netanyahu to sack Lieberman for his "improper activities" during
the convention.
</P>
<P>
They charged that Lieberman had managed the Likud convention
via remote control and had his opponents clandestinely
videotaped at the event.
</P>
<P>
In response, Netanyahu decided Thursday to set up an inquiry
committee to probe all complaints regarding the convention and he
vowed that he would abide by any recommendation the committee
makes.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would not tolerate any impropriety in the
convention vote, but he also made it clear that there would be no
question of sacking Lieberman before the probe was carried out.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the report said that Likud central
committee will meet Monday to voice their opposition to
Netanyahu's another proposal to hold party's referendum on the
primary system, which may pave the way for the return of the
primaries.

<HEADLINE> Israeli MP Urges Withdrawal from S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 23 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli Member of the
Knesset (parliament) today urged the government to pull out the
Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) from South Lebanon, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the military conflicts occurred Saturday evening
and today in South Lebanon, Yossi Beilin, a Labor member of the
parliament, said in Tel Aviv that the latest developments there
again proved that the security zone does not protect the security
of north Israel.
</P>
<P>
Only after the IDF withdraws from South Lebanon, can real peace
be achieved between north Israel and South Lebanon, he added.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Israeli government and military to take positive
attitude in seeking agreements with the Lebanese side on the IDF
withdrawal from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
According to the IDF, rockets fired from South Lebanon hit
several villages in the southern part of the security zone
Saturday evening which caused heavy damages to the villagers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jet fighters bombed twice this morning some positions
of the Shiite Amal movement in South Lebanon in retaliation for
their shelling again earlier this morning of several villages in
the security zone, in which nine Lebanese civilians, including
four children, were killed.
</P>
<P>
The bombing led to more Katyusha shelling of the southern part
of the security zone and three of the shells landed within Israeli
territory, but caused no damage.
</P>
<P>
Micha Goldman, another Labor member of the parliament, today
visited the area hit by the Katyusha in north Israel. He urged
both the IDF and the Lebanese army to refrain from shelling each
other and solve the disputes through consultations.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent more blood shedding in South Lebanon,
Beilin formed on November 9 a movement to lobby for the IDF to
pull out from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the 1,100-square-kilometer security zone in
South Lebanon in 1985 to protect its northern towns from across
the border attack. Since then, the IDF there have been facing
strong resistance from the Lebanese army, particularly from the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges US to Pressure Israel to Halt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat today urged the United
States to pressure Israel to halt its settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from India to Gaza, Arafat said that the
continuation of the Israeli settlement activities in the PNA
territories is a violation of the agreements signed between PNA
and Israel, according to the Palestinian Radio VOP.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the United states to pressure Israel to
implement the agreements reached by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nabil Abu Rdeineh, advisor to Arafat, said in Gaza
today that the latest positive change in the U.S. diplomatic
position began to be differentiated from the Israeli position,
and the U.S. should pressure the Israeli government to halt
settlement activities and implement the agreements.
</P>
<P>
Nabil's remarks were apparently related to U.S. President Bill
Clinton's Friday speech in Washington, in which Clinton called on
Israel and the PNA to intensively tackle the next set of issues to
move the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Clinton Friday received the 1997 Man of Peace Award from a
foundation established in honor of the late Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and his successor Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the receiving ceremony at the White House, Clinton
asked Israel and the PNA to speed up talks on the four-part agenda
that the U.S. identified in September: security cooperation, the
Israeli troops' required redeployment, a time-out of the
settlement activities, and moving to final-status peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But on the settlement issue, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu told his cabinet today that he has never promised to
Clinton that Israel is to halt settlement activities in the near
future.

PARIS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement today called for the integration of Islam
into the French society, where live four million Muslims, most of
them North African immigrants.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with representatives of Christian churches,
Judaism and Muslims in France today in Strasbourg, Chevenement
said that taking into account the large number of Muslims in
France, Islam should have a "legitimate speaker" in the country.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac refused to grant an audience to
Muslim leaders at the new year's good wish ceremony this year,
causing widespread dismay among the Muslims in France.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Learn Democracy Through Self-Governance (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the view of civil affairs officials, who are in charge of
rural democracy, a complete system of farmers' self-governance
should consist of "four democracies."
</P>
<P>
Besides the democratic election (of the villagers' committee),
the other three democracies refer to democratic decision-making
(in village management), democratic management (of village
affairs) and democratic supervision (by the villagers over the
village leadership).
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the necessary measures to guarantee democratic
rights to these farmers' include formulating methods for the
election of villagers' committees, setting up a system of
villagers' council or villagers' congress, enacting a village
constitution and making public all village affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China, convened two months ago in Beijing, once
again showed the Party's determination to expand grassroots
democracy throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin said in the report to the Party
Congress that "expanding grassroots democracy and guaranteeing the
people's direct exercise of their democratic rights" represent the
"most widespread practice of socialist democracy".
</P>
<P>
"This assertion has lighted the way for the practice of
villagers' self-governance and the building of grassroots
democratic politics in the rural areas to advance into the next
century," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the coming year a dozen provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities would usher in a new round
of elections of villagers' committees.
</P>
<P>
"The civil affairs departments across the country will focus on
improving the legal system related to farmers' self-governance and
increasing the democracy and transparency in village management
after a democratic election," he added.

<HEADLINE> South China Province Cracks Drug-Production Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Five suspected criminals have
been arrested for producing and processing a kind of drug called
"head-rocking pill" in China, the local police department
announced today in Nanning, capital of the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
A total of 25.33 kilograms has been confiscated, together with
7.91 kilograms of compound drugs and a group of drug-producing
instruments, police said.
</P>
<P>
Mo Guanchang, the first suspect, was a salesman for a medicine
manufacturer in Guizhou. Police said the interrogation of Mo led
to the discovery of the key suspects of the case: Yu Hongji and
his niece, Yu Guangqing, both of whom are residents of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The two were arrested in mid-October in Guangzhou, capital of
Guangdong Province. Police also destroyed an underground
drug-processing plant in Guangzhou, confiscating 23,000 pills and
many compound drugs.
</P>
<P>
Yu and his niece told police they had produced more than
250,000 pills since 1996. They brought raw materials into China's
inland areas, then processed them in two medicine manufacturing
plants in Nanning under the guise of producing animal medicine.
</P>
<P>
No information was available on the other two suspects arrested
in the case.
</P>
<P>
The head-rocking pill, so named because it can make abusers
rock their heads constantly, has been identified by doctors as
inflicting severe damage to the abusers' bodies. The drug
reportedly was first used by Westerners, but its consumption has
been on an increase in China's inland areas in recent years.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Olympic figure skating
champion Alexei Urmanov has returned to the ice for the first time
since March but failed to quell doubts he will be fit for the
Winter Games in Nagano, according to reports from St Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
Urmanov's exibition performance on Sunday, the final day of the
Cup of Russia competition in St Petersburg, was his first public
appearance since he withdrew from the world championships in
Lausanne with a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
The Rusian national championships, scheduled to be held in
mid-December to choose the Olympic team for next February, will
decide on Urmanov's skating future.
</P>
<P>
Urmanov said he still feels pain from his old injury when he
tries to perform the jumps. "I still can't do the most difficult
jumps," he said.
</P>
<P>
If Urmanov cannot compete in Nagano, two other skaters coached
by Alexei Mishin are ready to step in -- this year's world bronze
medallist Alexei Yagudin, 17, and world junior champion Yevgeny
Plushchenko, who is only 15.
</P>
<P>
Former European champion Ilya Kulik, who trains with coach
Tatyana Tarasova in the United States, is also in the running for
a place in the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
Mishin said: "Urmanov is still my number one skater, although
now I pay the same attention to all three of them."

<HEADLINE> Turkey Reiterates Position on Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today reiterated that
its military operation in northern Iraq is simply aimed at
wiping out the outlawed Kurdish militants there.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly news briefing, Turkish Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that Turkey always respects the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"As we said many times, we don't envisage a permanent
military presence in northern Iraq," Atacanli said, adding that
"Turkish troops will be withdrawn from Iraq as soon as their
objectives are achieved."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly launched cross-border incursions in
northern Iraq to strike the rebels of the Kurdish Workers Party
(PKK) stationed there.
</P>
<P>
In this year's largest operation in May, around 50,000 Turkish
troops entered northern Iraq in a hot pursuit of the PKK rebels,
leading to strong protests from Iran and the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Some units are left in northern Iraq although the Turkish
government announced a withdrawal of troops from the region.
</P>
<P>
As for the continued fighting with the PKK rebels, Atacanli
said that this is the day-to-day operation by the Turkish
military in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry earlier denied the press reports
that Turkey has a plan to build a security zone in northern Iraq in
order to block the infiltration of the PKK militants.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting for the establishment of an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey since 1984.

<HEADLINE> New Radar Air-Control System for Capital Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Capital
International Airport next month will introduce a radar air
control system to reduce flight delays.
</P>
<P>
At present, a kind of artificial program control is used to
supervise flights, mainly on the basis of reports from air traffic
controllers. The system has been criticized for its low speed and
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
The existing system can only handle 500 airplanes per day,
accounting for one-tenth that of developed countries, which puts
aircraft too close to each other.
</P>
<P>
The new radar system will provide accurate locations of
aircrafts and easier access to pilots for distance
adjustments. This should greatly increase the aircraft capacity
and ensure flight safety, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Duan Shili, deputy director of the North China Air Control
Bureau of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), said
that the effort signals an important transfer in the history of
Chinese civil aviation, and will play an active and far-reaching
role in air transport.

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indian rupee nose-dived
to a historic low of 38.50/55 against the U.S. dollar during
trading at the interbank foreign exchange market in Bombay
following frenzied demand for the U.S. unit in the wake of
political uncertainty in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, aggressive dollar selling by the Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) initially in the futures segment and later in the spot
market partly calmed the volatile market, and the rupee attempted
a smart rally.
</P>
<P>
The Indian currency closed at 38.07/13 rupees against the
dollar, an all-time low for a closing quote, steeply lower from
the opening of 37.80/85 and last weekend's finish of 37.75/80.
</P>
<P>
The rupee touched a record low of 38.20/40 rupees for the
dollar in intra-day trade on February 6, 1996. Last Friday, the
local currency dipped to a 21-month low at 37.80, and since then
it has showed a steep downtrend on persistent heavy corporate
dollar purchases.

HONG KONG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The latest visitor arrival

<HEADLINE> Iranian Judiciary Urged Not to be Involved in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian judiciary bodies
were urged not to be involved in the political struggles among
the country's various factions, local daily Iran News reported
today.
</P>
<P>
"As a citizen, I expect the Judiciary to fulfill its duties
while demonstrating that it does not follow any particular
political line," Iranian Vice President for Legal and
Parliamentary Affairs Seyed Abdolvahed Musavi Lari said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Iran News published today, Lari blamed
the country's judiciary bodies for their manners in dealing
with the cases of Tehran municipality.
</P>
<P>
He doubted that political factors were taken into consideration
by the Judiciary when dealing with certain cases, he said, adding
that the judiciary officials must prove that the cases of Tehran
municipality are not politically motivated, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi was charged with being
involved in some embezzlement cases. Some of his subordinates have
been arrested.
</P>
<P>
According to the judicial procedures, proof of the crime must
be established before any accusations are made and then the
suspect is informed of the accusations, Lari said.
</P>
<P>
But when dealing with these cases, the Judiciary's performance
was questioned because people were first arrested and asked to make
certain confessions before their crimes were proven, Lari noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Judiciary must deal with the Tehran
municipality cases according to the judicial procedures, saying
that "if proper procedures are ignored, the whole process will
become questionable."
</P>
<P>
According to the law, the vice president said, all the accused
must be released from solitary confinement and be tried at open
courts and the judge must investigate the files in a free
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian conservative factions suffered a disgraceful defeat
in the May presidential elections during which Mohammad Khatami
won a slide victory.
</P>
<P>
The leftist groups accused the conservatives of taking
retaliation to the defeat while dealing with the cases of Tehran
municipality.

<HEADLINE> Political Crisis in India Deepens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The current political crisis
in India triggered by the release of an investigative report on
the assassination of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi deepened
today as the ruling United Front refused to punish one of its
constituents allegedly linked to the killing.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Jain Commission report, tabled in the parliament
on November 20, has indicted the Dravida Munnetra Kazagham (DMK),
a major constituent of the United Front, in the assassination of
Rajiv Gandhi in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral a few days
ago, Congress Party President Sitaram Kesri requested the United
Front to remove the three DMK ministers from its government,
saying that the Congress party will otherwise have to withdraw
support for the 17-month-old minority government.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India, Prime Minister Gujral
tonight formally rejected the Congress party's demand.
</P>
<P>
In a letter delivered to Kesri, Gujral said there was no
question of punishing any party or individual in the wake of the
Jain Commission report.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said it was wrong to link the DMK with the
assassination because none of the 41 people so far prosecuted in
the case was ever connected with the regional party in Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Congress party earlier today demanded a formal
reply from Gujral to Kesri's letter, saying that the party will
decide its future course of action after receiving a formal
response.

NICOSIA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The countries in the Middle
East and Mediterranean region have been called upon to integrate
the goals of environmental protection into their economic and

</P>
<P>
The call was made today by Cypriot Minister of Agriculture,
Natural Resources and Environment Andreas Mantovanis at the
opening of a regional workshop on "Sustainable Agriculture for
the Middle East and Mediterranean Countries".
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Israel, Greece, Italy, Egypt, Morocco, Yemen,
and Tunisia participated in the workshop, which is co-organized by
Cypriot Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and
Environment, and the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Mantovanis said Cyprus fully shares the concern that the
prevailing trends in the global food production and trade are
creating enormous stress and destruction to ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
If these developments are not put under control, they will
have irreversible consequences on natural resources, on which
agriculture relies, Mantovanis pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, we have to endorse the principles of sustainable
development, and to set in motion processes to integrate the
goals of environment conservation, into those of our economic and
social policy," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is part of the existing cooperation program on
agriculture between Cyprus and Israel.

<P>
On Nov. 20, polling day, Zhao was among voters who gathered to
elect deputies to the county people's congress in Langxi County in
east China's Anhui Province.

Zhao, 41, taking his elector's certificate, lined up to receive
a ballot. He drew marks behind the names of the two candidates in
his ballot, and then placed it into the slot in a red,
paper-wrapped box.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, who has participated in several elections for deputies of
the county people's congress, said that voters were enthusiastic
about electing deputies because of more rational procedures this
time.
</P>
<P>
"More importantly," he said, "deputies of previous county
people's congresses here have won the confidence of the people by
proposing the renovation of school buildings, raising teachers'
salaries, building flood-control facilities and developing the
local economy."
</P>
<P>
For voters' convenience, staff members in the electoral
district also offered five mobile boxes, each escorted by three
working members to collect ballots in villagers' homes.

After counting ballots on the spot, Han Dehua, a 35-year-old
farmer, was announced the winner as a deputy of the county
people's congress in the electoral district.

Han said, "I will cherish the opportunity as a deputy here. I
will never let you down."
</P>
<P>
The county started the election campaign in September, said
Yang Zaisen, deputy-director of the Standing Committee of Langxi
County People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The county, with a population of 329,000, has more than 233,000
voters. A total of 107 electoral districts are expected to elect
185 deputies.
</P>
<P>
"The right of nomination obviously reflects the democratic
rights of the voters," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
According to China's election law, 10 voters or more can
nominate their own candidate.
</P>
<P>
Up to the beginning of November, the county had 760 nominees,
464 nominated by spontaneous recommending groups of more than nine
electors each. The other 296 were recommended by parties and mass
organizations.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the election margin required by law, 295
formal candidates were chosen after consideration and consultation
between different electoral groups.
</P>
<P>
About 97.6 percent of voters in the county went to the polls,
said electoral staff members. The 185 deputies include 99 workers
and farmers; 63 deputies have no party affiliation; and 46
are women.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Learn Democracy Through Self-Governance (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in more than 60
percent of China's nearly one million villages are now exercising
the right of self-governance. They elect their own village
leadership, monitor its operation and have a say in all major
village affairs.
</P>
<P>
All this started 10 years ago today when the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress, China's legislature, adopted a
Law on the Organization of the Villagers' Committee.
</P>
<P>
The law requires all members of the committee, the formal
village leadership, to be directly elected by the entire village,
thus abolishing the long practice in China's vast countryside that
officials were hand-picked by governments at higher levels.
</P>
<P>
"A fruit of the reform and opening-up drive, this law is a
fundamental one that concerns the interests of all Chinese
farmers," commented Li Baoku, vice-minister of civil affairs.
</P>
<P>
Promulgation and enforcement of the law have helped consolidate
the success of China's rural reforms and brought a positive impact
on the rural society, he added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 25 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities have worked out concrete methods for the
implementation of the law, while most villagers' committees across
the country have undergone three direct elections during the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
"This has laid a wide and solid foundation among the people for
building a socialist democracy in our country, and blazed a trail
for the introduction of socialist democratic politics with Chinese
characteristics in the rural areas," said Li.
</P>
<P>
However, he conceded, the practice of self-governance by
farmers is still in the "primary stage."
</P>
<P>
"To many officials and ordinary people at the grass roots,
villagers' self-governance remains a fresh term," he said. "They
know little about the law, let alone how to implement its articles
one by one."

<P>
WUHAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China's steel giant, Wuhan Iron
and Steel Complex, today merged with two other large steel firms
which are all in central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan Iron and Steel, together with Daye Iron and Steel Company
and Hubei Iron and Steel Company, are among 300 key companies
supported by the central government and have played an important
role in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan Iron and Steel, a major sheet steel producer, is equipped
with advanced technology and has been one of 57 pilot businesses
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Daye mainly produces special steel while Hubei Iron and Steel
provides markets with quality structural steel.
</P>
<P>
The merger resulted in total capital of 52.1 billion yuan
(about 6.3 billion U.S. dollars), 176,300 employees and a yearly
output of 8 million tons of steel, 7 million tons of iron and 6
million tons of rolled steel.
</P>
<P>
The new iron and steel group will readjust its production
structure and strengthen its competitiveness to become the largest
steel business in central China, said officials from the group.
</P>
<P>
Those brands perviously owned by the three companies will
continue, officials said.

<HEADLINE> 5.2 Million Children Get Free Education in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A record 5.2 million children
have been registered for free education this year in Uganda, a
country with a population of 20 million, The Monitor reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The number, which is about twice that of last year, has
benefited from the government's Universal Primary Education
(UPE), a free education plan for four children per family,
according to a World Bank statement titled "public information
document".
</P>
<P>
UPE is the government's major effort to improve primary
education which was stagnated during 1970s and earlier 1980s, and
restarted this year.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to assist Uganda in primary education, the World
Bank said International Development Agency (IDA) has proposed a
100-million-dollar education adjustment credit (EAC) scheme to
fund the government in the implementation of UPE. The scheme
will finance 23 percent of budget for primary education, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The IDA money is to be used to hire teachers, provide books
and classrooms for children from poor families to reduce
inequalities in primary and secondary education.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has one of the lowest levels of education in the world
and ranks 158th among the 174 countries in the human development
index of the United Nations Development Program.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, French Chiefs of Staff Hold Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- General Fu Quanyou, chief of
the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, held
talks here today with his French counterpart, General
Jean-Philippe Douin.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations have been going well in recent years, Fu
said, and leaders of the two countries have maintained constant
contact.
</P>
<P>
He said political consultations have intensified at all levels
between the two countries. French President Jacques Chirac made a
successful visit to China in May of 1997, said Fu, when the two
countries issued a joint statement indicating they are determined
to establish an all-round partnership oriented toward the 21st
century. This signals that Sino-French ties have entered a new
period of development, he added.
</P>
<P>
With the growth of bilateral relations between the two
countries, the two armed forces have increased their ties, Fu
said, and the Chinese have adopted a positive attitude toward
cooperation between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
As two influential powers in the world, he said both China and
France propose to establish a multi-polar world and bear important
responsibilities for world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a stable cooperative relationship is in
the interests of the people of the two countries, and will be
conducive to a new pattern of Asian-European relations and to a
new international order both politically and economically, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Fu also briefed Douin on Sino-U.S. relations, China's domestic
situation and army-building.
</P>
<P>
Douin agreed with Fu's viewpoints on a multi-polar world and
bilateral relations between the two countries and their armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
He said that France and China share much in common and do not
have any conflicts of interests, and that his country is fully
prepared to engage in high-level strategic dialogue.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military to Take Actions Against Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Chief of Staff of the
Philippine Armed Forces Arnulfo Acedera today ordered all military
commanders to conduct aggressive and preemptive operations against
the New People's Army (NPA) after a number of ambushes against the
police by the group.
</P>
<P>
Acedera said the military would conduct intensified
intelligence operations and patrols against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he gave orders for additional security of military
facilities and air reconnaissance cover for ground patrols and
other operations.
</P>
<P>
However, Acedera said he did not see any need for redeployment
of troops, dismissing the NPA's attacks as only desperate attempts
to gain advantages on the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Formal peace talks between the government and the rebel group
were suspended after the abduction of a police officer by the NPA
on October 30.
</P>
<P>
Acedera accused NPA founding chairman Jose Sison of
orchestrating a scenario wherein increased rebel attacks would
directly or indirectly convince the Dutch government that it
should grant him political asylum.
</P>
<P>
This is a logical conclusion resulting from Sison's directives
and messages intercepted by the military's intelligence, Acedera
said.
</P>
<P>
The NPA rebels have recently conducted several surprise attacks
against at least three police stations in the country, killing
some policemen and taking several others hostage.

<HEADLINE> Bank of China HK Branch Marks 80th Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China Hong Kong
Branch, one of the note-issuing banks in Hong Kong, held a
cocktail reception today at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center to celebrate its 80th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
For the past 80 years, the Bank of China Hong Kong Branch has
devoted itself to serving the industrial and commercial sectors as
well as the general public, Jiang Zuqi, vice-chairman and
executive vice president of Bank of China and chief executive of
the Hong Kong-Macao Regional Office, said at the gathering.
</P>
<P>
"The bank has established close relationships with various
sectors of the community through supporting different
infrastructural constructions and participating actively in
community projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China has made every effort to help maintain
financial stability, to promote Hong Kong as an international
financial center and to maintain its continuing prosperity and
stability, Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the bank has gone through periods of ups and downs,
and has grown up and strengthened steadily.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of its solid foundation in Hong Kong was
attributable to the leadership of our head office, the drive for
excellence, the prudent operation and the strenuous efforts of our
management and staff," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"It was also made possible by the confidence, the trust and the
support extended to us by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, our
banking associates and various sectors of the community," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Looking into the future, Jiang said that after Hong Kong's
return to the motherland, the principle of "one country, two
systems" is being successfully implemented, and the prospects for
Hong Kong are bright. He said the Bank of China will join hands
with friends from all industries to build up a brighter future.
</P>
<P>
Established in September 1917, the Bank of China Hong Kong
Branch is now a major subsidiary of Bank of China. It is a
rotating chairman bank of the Hong Kong Association of Banks.
</P>
<P>
Since China's implementation of the policies of reform and
opening up in the late 1970's, the business of the Bank has
recorded substantial expansion.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the business figures of 1996 and 1978, the Branch's
deposits have increased by 75 times, loans by 141 times, total
assets by 107 times and pre-tax profit by 82 times.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Branch has 39 sub-branches, more than ten
subsidiaries and a number of associated companies in the finance,
securities, insurance, leasing and consulting businesses,
providing a full range of financial services.

<HEADLINE> Peace Is Pre-requisite for COMESA Development: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba said here today that peace, stability and democratic
governance are essential pre-requisites for the economic growth
and development within the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when officially opening the fourth meeting
of the COMESA council of ministers at Lusaka's Mulungushi
International Conference Center, according to the Zambia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba told the three-day meeting that the major challenge
faced the Lusaka-based regional body is to consolidate efforts in
the creation of an environment which is favorable to political
and economic changes as well as development.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president pointed out that the successful
implementation of COMESA programs such as the creation of a
larger regional market and economic liberalization, will depend
on a peaceful and stable environment.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to attract direct foreign investment to
speed up the industrialization process by making use of the
enormous natural resources in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, he stated that constraints such as uncertain weather
patterns, huge foreign debt and declining prices of raw materials
at the world market have continued to affect negatively the
process of COMESA's economic development, which is aiming to
achieve a free trade zone by 2000 and free movement of capital
and people among its 20 members.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the former union leader also urged individual
member countries to speed up the implementation of collectively
designed programs of COMESA and maintain harmony among regional
economic groupings in the black continent.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Set Up Land Disposal Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Regional government has decided to establish a
committee to monitor the progress of the Land Disposal Program
(LDP) for the coming five years, an official of the HKSAR said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Planning, Environment and Land Bowen Leung said
the Land Disposal Committee will hold its first meeting next
month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on "Land Bank Policy" organized by the
Hong Kong Project Management Exchange Center Limited, Leung said
the LDP would roll forward each year and the committee would also
work out the second five-year LDP with details expected to be
announced in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase land supply and build up land reserve, the
government has committed to developing 10 strategic growth areas,
which are estimated to provide sufficient land for 270,000 housing
units capable of accommodating 720,000 people between 2006 and
2011, Leung said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that due to the scarcity of land resources, the
government needs to carry out reclamation projects, as
appropriate, and set up land reserve so as to cope with future
development and meet public demand for housing.
</P>
<P>
The government will provide enough land for housing through the
 five-year LDP. Together with the residential redevelopment
projects carried out by both the public and private sectors, the
government is confident that the target will be achieved to
provide at least 85,000 housing units a year effective from 1999,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Leung noted that despite the fact that the property market has
softened during the past few weeks, the government's commitment to
 provide sufficient land to meet housing demand would not be
affected. The government would continue to dispose of land
according to the LDP, he stressed.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The National AIDS
Control Program (NACP) has warned that some 2.4 million
Tanzanians will be infected with AIDS by the year 2000 if no
strenuous efforts are made to fight against the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
The warning was given in Dar es Salaam over the weekend by the
Acting NACP Program Manager, Dr Mwita Nyang'anyi, when closing a
two-week AIDS Care and Management Facilitation course, The
Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
He told the 15 course participants from various parts of the
east African country that care for AIDS patients would be given
priority by the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, which has a population of 30 million, currently has
1.5 million AIDS patients or carriers.
</P>
<P>
"This care must guarantee confidentiality and avoid
discrimination, and allow a patient to live a normal life as much
as possible," Dr Nyang'anyi said.
</P>
<P>
He calls on people to make effort in carrying out the policy
on sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) issued in 1995, which
covers the key areas of institutional care and management of
STDs, community-based support services, protection of care
workers and orphans.
</P>
<P>
Dr Nyang'anyi expressed hope that the training activities
which include theory and basic skills would be valuable for
reducing AIDS cases by the year 2000.

short-term liquidity crunch and a weakening capital base.
</P>
<P>
The demise of the Tokyo-based Yamaichi is projected to leave
behind an estimated 3 trillion yen (about 23.9 billion dollars) in
unresolved debts, making it the largest Japanese business failure
in history.
</P>
<P>
Mitsuzuka told an emergency press conference that Yamaichi
clients' assets will be protected with the use of the Bank of
Japan's special unsecured loans.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Japanese monetary authorities will do their
utmost in cooperation with foreign counterparts so that Yamaichi's
woes do not cause a crisis.
</P>
<P>
Market confidence in Yamaichi declined on persistent rumors
that the firm is engaged in improper "tobashi" deals in which
brokerages temporarily shift investment losses from one client to
another to help a favored customer avoid reporting losses.
</P>
<P>
The brokerage's image was also tarnished by the payoff scandal
earlier this year involving a "sokaiya" corporate racketeer.
</P>
<P>
The failures of two other financial institutions this month
prompted a further plunge in stock prices, making it extremely
difficult for the already cash-strapped Yamaichi to raise funds to
meet day-to-day needs.
</P>
<P>
Sanyo Securities Co., a second-tier brokerage, went bust
November 3. It was followed by the bankruptcy on November 17 of
Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, one of Japan's top 10 nationwide
full-service commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Yamaichi held an extraordinary board meeting this morning to
formalize a plan to end its century-long history.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how to apologize to investors and clients who
have patronized us for many years," Yamaichi President Shohei
Nozawa told a press conference at the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
announcing the company's decision to dissolve itself.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the collapse of Yamaichi, Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto pledged to take all necessary steps to maintain
stability in the financial system and protect investors.

<P>
Addressing the opening of a forum on Singapore's education, Lee

We need to raise this to five percent of GDP."

items of more discretionary spending," he said.
</P>

He also stressed that by focusing on education, Singapore will
maintain and improve its lead over competitors, and this will give
Singapore a long term advantage which will not be easily lost.

<HEADLINE> HIV to Infect 1 Million Children by End of 1997: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) today stressed the need to educate young people about AIDS
and urged countries to take stronger measures in the face of a
growing number of kids infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued today, the Manila-based WHO regional
office for the western Pacific said that about 400,000 children
under the age of 15 were infected with the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS, worldwide in 1996 alone,
bringing the total number of kids infected with the virus in this
age group to 830,000.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, 1 million children in this age group will
be infected with HIV and more than 90 percent of them will be in
developing countries, said the press release issued in connection
with the observance of this year's World AIDS Day on December 1.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the epidemic, the press release said, some 3
million children below 15 years old have developed AIDS and most
of them have died.
</P>
<P>
Also by the year 2000, WHO estimated, there will be more than
1.8 million HIV cases in the West Pacific region, including
children and adolescents. There are currently more than 700,000
people in the region infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
"The HIV proceeds more rapidly to AIDS in children than in
adults," WHO regional office director S. T. Han said, stressing
that mother to child transmission, blood transfusion and sexual
contact are the major transmission routes of AIDS to kids.
</P>
<P>
"Education, both in and out of schools, is one of the most
effective ways of restricting the spread of HIV," Han added.
</P>
<P>
He urged countries and areas to unite and take urgent measures
to give children around the world hope for the future in a world
with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Children, young people and their families need support in their
everyday life so that their risk of exposure to HIV can be
minimized, he said, adding that "the responsibility lies with the
governments, health professionals, communities and families."

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Government Plans to Adjust Economic Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government will
adopt a drastic belt-tightening budget and adjust three major
macroeconomic indices -- GDP growth, external balances and prices,
the government officials said today.
</P>
<P>
With the IMF's bailout loans for South Korea to revive the
faltering national economy, the government will also accelerate
industrial restructuring, narrow current-account deficits and
upgrade the competitiveness of financial institutions and other
local enterprises, said Minister of Finance and Economy Lim
Chang-yuel.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has applied for rescue loans of 20 billion
U.S. dollars from the IMF. But analysts say the total bailout for
South Korea will reach 70-80 billion dollars, including huge
contributions which may come from the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The IMF delegation will start negotiations with South Korean
officials and is expected to demand Seoul to drastically cut down
its budget spending and raise tax rates.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is also expected to require Seoul to implement
stringent self-rescue plans covering from macroeconomy to
financial institutions, as it has done to Thailand and Indonesia
recently, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Ministry of Finance and Economy said that it
is inevitable for the country to adopt these measures and that the
GDP growth for 1998 will be lowered from 6 percent to 4 percent,
with the current-account shortfalls dwindling to less than 5
billion dollars and consumer price lower than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 and 2000, the GDP growth will be limited to less than 5
percent and the annual consumer prices gains to less than 4
percent, they said.
</P>
<P>
The government budget for this fiscal year will be cut to less
than 5.6 percent and the government is seeking measures on such
problems as wages and layoffs that the macroeconomic retrenchment
will bring with.

<HEADLINE> China's Asset Evaluation Industry Growing Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Asset evaluation is playing an
increasingly important role in optimizing the distribution of
resources and facilitating economic restructuring in China, a
senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
The business, which used to cover the state-owned sector only,
now involves the private sector. It is also expected to cover a
greater variety of economic activities such as real estate
management, taxation and mortgage guarantees, said Pan Yue, deputy
director-general of the State Administration of State Property.
</P>
<P>
Chinese asset-evaluation agencies conducted more than 50,900
evaluations in 1996, with the net book value of the assets
evaluated at 717.8 billion yuan and the appraised value at more
than one trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The evaluations resulted in a net increase of 291.2 billion
yuan in asset value, which translates into an asset value
appreciation rate of 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, the appraised asset value last year was
282.5 billion yuan, or 39 percent more than that of 1995. In the
first 10 months of this year, Chinese evaluation agencies
appraised more than 200 billion yuan worth of property for
enterprises to be listed on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that currently China has more than 3,300
asset evaluation agencies and more than 55,000 asset appraisers,
including 5,800 certified public asset evaluators.

<HEADLINE> West African Countries Plan Common Law on Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Central bank officials from
five west African countries, namely, Nigeria, Sierra Leone,
Ghana, Liberia and the Gambia are expected to meet in Abuja next
week to adopt a common law on money laundering, the Guardian
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The law will provide for the establishment of an anti-money
laundering agency in each country, with representatives from the
central bank, the police, the corporate affair commission, the
drug law enforcement agency, immigration and the justice
ministry, among others, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The agency will have the power to place any bank account under
surveillance, tap any telephone line, probe into any business
activities, stop any suspected transactions and prosecute
offenders at a special court.
</P>
<P>
The law will make it mandatory for casinos to keep records of
gamblers and their transactions for at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
It also requires financial institutions such as banks and
exchange services to report all transactions in excess of one
million Naira (about 12,500 U.S. dollars) by an individual or
five million Naira (about 62,500 dollars) in the case of a
company.
</P>
<P>
Of the five countries, only Nigeria now has a special law on
money laundering. The lack of such law has been described by
experts as a major cause of distress in African banking systems.

<P>
LAGOS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- About 3,000 Nigerian residents
in Liberia, mainly traders and artisans, returned to the country
at the weekend aboard two passengers vessels, press reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said many of the passengers looked like refugees
and complained of embarrassment by Liberian securities agents.
</P>
<P>
Liberia, which was just brought out of its seven years of
civil war with the help of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), has in the last few months seen a rift in its
relations with the sub-regional body.
</P>
<P>
Liberian President Charles Taylor has refused to allow the
ECOWAS peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG to use the country as
a launch board against the Sierra Leone coupist.
</P>
<P>
He also insisted on restructuring Liberia's army on his own,
whereas the peace agreement ending the civil war provides that
this must be done with the help of ECOMOG. Taylor said it's the
internal affair of Liberia.

<HEADLINE> China to Set up Standard Asset Valuation System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China will strive to establish
a highly scientific and standard asset valuation system in 10 to
15 years, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We want to make asset appraising an intermediate service
industry that plays by the rule of independence, objectivity and
fairness and meets the need of the development of a socialist
market economy," Pan Yue, deputy director-general of the State
Administration of State Property said at a meeting on asset
valuation.
</P>
<P>
To that end, China will set up for asset valuation a unified
legal system, a unified self-discipline management system, a
unified set of appraising methods and standards, a unified
research, education and training system, and a unified information
networking system, Pan said.
</P>
<P>
To meet the requirements on the development of the
intermediate service industry set forth by the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China in September, the asset
valuation industry must achieve several major shifts, such as the
shift from mainly safeguarding the rights and interests of the
owners of state assets to safeguarding the rights and interests of
all economic entities, the deputy director-general said.
</P>
<P>
Asset valuation management will shift from government-oriented
management to professional self-discipline while management
will focus not only on asset valuation agencies and projects but
also on certified asset valuers.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Administration Over House Property Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Administrative Rules
for Urban House Property Right Registration will be put into
effect as of Jan. 1, 1998, Li Zhendong, vice-minister of
construction, said here today.
</P>
<P>
By then, homeowners in all large cities will have to use a
unified house property right certificate issued by the Ministry of
Construction. In other cities such a certificate will be available
to the homeowners no later than July 1.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference, Li said it is a common practice
worldwide to register house property rights while in China
homeowners are issued ownership certificates.
</P>
<P>
China started the registration process in 1987, the official
said, and now 80 percent of the country's urban houses have been
registered.
</P>
<P>
Li said it is important to protect the rights and interests of
homeowners by setting up a registration system of house property
rights.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1987, China issued a provisional rule on
registering urban house property rights, which has become
incompatible with the existing situation, Li said, because of
people's increased legal consciousness and fresh economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the current rules were worked out on the
basis of the country's Administrative Law over Urban Real Estate
as well as other laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The current rules are more complete in content, Li said, with
detailed articles concerning the registration organs, scope and
legal responsibilities of those who violate the rules.

<HEADLINE> US U-2 Surveillance Plane Flys Over Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said that a U-2 spy plane
of the United States entered its airspace this morning, the Iraqi
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The plane intruded Iraq's airspace at 9:30 local time (0530
GMT) over the southern city of Basra, and then flew over the Kafri
District along the Iraqi-Iranian border, an Iraqi Foreign Ministry
spokesman told the agency.
</P>
<P>
The U-2 avoided the Iraqi air defense force, and Iraqi military
leaders were tracking its flights very closely, he said.
</P>
<P>
U-2's surveillance flight is part of the inspection mission of
the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) which oversees the
dismantling of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had accused the plane of serving U.S. intelligence
services and threatened to shoot it down, which together with
Iraq's expulsion of the American arms experts had triggered a
three-week standoff.
</P>
<P>
The crisis ended after intensified Russian diplomatic efforts
and the inspectors of UNSCOM, including the Americans, were
allowed to return to Baghdad to continue their work.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said that the U.S. had wished to make other
peoples kneel down by brutal force, which he said is an illusion
to be smashed in the Middle East, particularly in the Arab world.

<HEADLINE> Bohai Sea Zone Expected to be China's Third Economic Engine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bohai Sea Zone is expected
to become China's third economic engine following the Pearl River
and Yangtze River deltas, according to local economists.
</P>
<P>
Young economists, officials and industrialists started a
two-day seminar here today to discuss development strategy in the
region to enhance mutual understanding and put forward concrete
measures to speed up regional economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was jointly organized by youth federations in
Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong and Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
The Bohai Sea Zone includes the Liaodong Penninsula, the
Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan belt, the coastal belt of Hebei Province,
the Yellow River delta and the Jiaodong Peninsula. The region is
one of China's key political and cultural centers, and one of the
major blocs in its economic development agenda.
</P>
<P>
The zone boasts rich mineral resources, sound agricultural and
industrial bases, and well-developed transportion and
telecommunications networks to fuel future sustained growth. In
the next five years, Beijing and Tianjin alone plan to invest 500
billion yuan in infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Geographically, the region is in the vicinity of Russia,
Mongolia, the Korean Penninsula and Japan. Also, key port cities
such as Lianyungang, Dalian and Tianjin are eastern starting
points of the EurAsia Continental Bridge linking China with Middle
Asia, the Middle East and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The keynote report at the seminar indicated that East Asia has
become one of the fastest-growing regions in the world and a hot
spot for international capital. Conditions combined to create a
favorable environment for development of the Bohai Sea Zone.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested setting up a regional economic community
with the eventual target of building an economic center in
northern China and a high-tech product export base.
</P>
<P>
Also, the report suggested innovation in traditional industries
in the region and fostering such industries as automotive,
electronics, machinery, metallurgical, chemical and service for
future economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Experts urged more institutional reform, particularly in
enterprise-ownership reform, to combat the adverse effect of
scattered capital input and unclear policies from different local
governments.

<HEADLINE> Experts Assembly Support Iran's Supreme Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Experts Assembly has
reaffirmed Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the country's supreme leader,
the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
The assembly is of the opinion that Khamenei is the
jurisprudent who has all qualifications stipulated in Article 109
of the Constitution dealing with leadership, the assembly's
secretariat said in a statement issued on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the assembly selected Khamenei as the
leader from all jurisprudents by taking into account all criteria
and principles stipulated in the constitution.
</P>
<P>
It said that "support for Velayat-e Faqih (governance of
supreme religious jurisprudent) and leadership of the supreme
leader is incumbent upon all those loyal to the Islamic system."
</P>
<P>
It added that any attempt to weaken this fundamental principle
would be a great sin and against the interests of Islam and the
Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
The assembly, which is based in Iran's religious city Qom some
100 kilometers south of the capital, condemned "the vicious,
discord-sowing moves by some ill-informed figures or malicious
personalities who viciously foster the idea of separating the
nation and the leadership."
</P>
<P>
On November 14, a famous religious canonist, Ayatollah Hussein
Ali Montazeri, criticized Khamenei for interfering in government
affairs, saying that the leader should be a supervisor to monitor
the affairs, rather than directly intervene.
</P>
<P>
The controversial remark by the disgraced former
successor-designate of the late Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini
triggered strong condemnation from religious and political figures
and organizations.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, several hundreds of religious instructors and
students stormed Montazeri's office in Qom and the police was
forced to use tear gas to disperse the protesters.
</P>
<P>
During the past few days, rallies and demonstrations were held
throughout the country to condemn Montazeri's remark and voice
supports for Khamenei.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fog has engulfed Jinan
since Saturday, slowing down traffic and lowering air quality.
</P>
<P>
A dense mist has been hanging over Jinan, capital of eastern
China's Shandong Province. Automobiles are restricted to a top
speed of 20 kilometers per hour within the city limits.
</P>
<P>
City transport authorities have closed parts of the express
highways and all flights taking off from the city's airport were
postponed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Residents have experienced breathing problems because the air
is high in sulfides, according to the city's environmental quality
monitoring station.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals are crowded with people with breathing problems and
the flu, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the city's meteorological observatory said the fog
is partly due to low temperatures and high humidity. The lack of
any wind has exacerbated the air quality as pollutants build up
instead of being dispersed.
</P>
<P>
Weather forecasters are predicting rain or snow if the fog
disperses by noon Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"If the fog lingers on, we will likely have acid rain or acid
fog," cautioned environmental officials.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Greek Defense Ministers Confer in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian said here today that to develop friendly cooperative
relations between the two countries and two armed forces of China
and Greece is not only in the fundamental interests of the two
peoples but also serves world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission
and state councillor, made the remarks during talks with Greek
counterpart Akis Tsohatzopoulos, who arrived here at Chi's
invitation.
</P>
<P>
Extending the welcome to Tsohatzopoulos' on his first China
visit, Chi said that the two countries, both nations with ancient
civilization, have seen smooth development in bilateral relations,
adding that the two countries share the identical or similar views
on the major international issues.
</P>
<P>
China is a developing socialist country, the nature of the
social system and its national development strategy decide its
defense-oriented policy, Chi said, adding that China never seeks
hegemonism and forges military alliances with other countries.
</P>
<P>
China will reduce its armed forces by half a million people
during the next three years, following a reduction of one million in
the 1980s, Chi said. This not only is conducive to bettering troops
with Chinese characteristics, he said, but also benefits
maintaining world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos said that China, as a permanent member of the
Security Council of the United Nations, plays an important role in
international affairs. He expressed hope of enhancing cooperation
with China in the economy, national security and the defense
industry.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos also exchanged views with Chi on the
international security situation and other issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
Kui Fulin, deputy chief of the general staff of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army was among those present at the talks.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Chi presided over a welcome ceremony in
honor of Tsohatzopoulos and accompanied him in an honor-guard
review.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Bangladesh to Speed up Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- World Bank (WB) President James
D. Wolfensohn has suggested that Bangladesh speed up reforms in
the sectors of finance, education, water resources management and
government administration.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn made the suggestion in a letter to Bangladeshi Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina about his recent visit to the country. The
letter was delivered by the World Bank's office in Dhaka on
November 9, the Independent newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reforms in the above-mentioned four areas should be given
particular attention in order to accelerate the development of the
country, Wolfensohn stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the government's efforts, weak management
of nationalized banks, a worsening loan default situation and lack
of efforts to improve the governance of banks were impeding
financial discipline.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for firmness on the part of the prime
minister to lead the reform activities.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said the World Bank's office in Bangladesh had been
asked to assist the government in developing a 10-year vision for
the education sector.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank chief said he had suggested immediate
implementation of a plan to rationalize the government structure.
Progress in implementing his suggestion would be reviewed after
four months and a decision would be made on what additional steps
could be taken for further development, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, several projects funded by and the IDA
(International Development Association) would also be reviewed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Copies of the letter were also sent to ministers of education,
health and family welfare, water resources, and the Public
Administration Reform Commission, and the governor of the
Bangladesh Bank, the newspaper said.

LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Briton Colin McRae's hope to
win his world title was dented after going off the road in thick
fog on the opening stage of Monday's second leg in the British RAC
auto rally held at Cheltenham.
</P>
<P>
McRae lost more than one minute in the incident on the
18.65-kilometer stage at Radnor and dropped to eighth overall.
</P>
<P>
He wins the world title event only if he takes the top honor at
RAC here and Finland rival Tommi Makinen finishes outside the top
six,
</P>
<P>
McRae's mishap was welcome news for Makinen, who moved up to
fourth at the end of the stage after overnight third-placed driver
Didier Auriol dropped to 10th when he ran too cautiously through
the fog-hit stage.
</P>
<P>
Makinen needs to finish in the top six in the RAC Rally to lift
his second consecutive world championship crown.
</P>
<P>
Briton Richard Burns, Makinen's teammate at Mitsubishi, was
fastest overall on the stage and opened a 25-second lead over
Spain's Carlos Sainz.
</P>
<P>
The day's remaining six stages will take the teams around
central Wales before a return to the Cheltenham base on Monday
evening.

<P>
GENEVA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) today started a three-day expert
meeting on the application of competition laws and policies.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting here, participants will exchange views and
experiences on three major issues related to the application of
competition laws and policies:
</P>
<P>
- The treatment of restrictive practices such as selective
distribution, exclusive dealing and franchising;
</P>
<P>
- Ways and means of promoting a "competition culture;"
</P>
<P>
- International aspects of competition and the problems for
competition law enforcement, including international mergers and
industrial concentration which affect other countries; and the
strengthening of international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The participants will also consider a study prepared by the
UNCTAD Secretariat on the empirical evidence of the benefits
derived from applying the principles of competition law and policy
to economic development, so as to attain greater efficiency in
international trade and development.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is the only international forum where all
countries, developed and developing, as well as those in
transition, meet to discuss specific competition policy issues,

SINGAPORE, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Share prices rose sharply in
moderate trading on the Singapore market today as the benchmark
Straits Times Industrials Index surged by 39.45 points to close at
1,681.85 points today.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said that the market benefited from investors who fled
from markets elsewhere in the region and bought Singapore blue
chips instead. However, the overall mood was still cautious as the
market braced for the reaction to the collapse of Yamaichi in the
Japanese market, which was closed today for a holiday and will
open tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume stood at 180.55 million units, worth
348.78 million Singapore dollars (about 219.36 million US
dollars). Advances and declines were equal at 170 counters each,
while 276 other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Telecom was the most actively traded counter as
it registered a turnover of 25.5 million units. It was followed by
Innovest Bhd which had 9.55 million shares traded. Renong Bhd was

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Lifts Freeze on Foreign Labor in Plantation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
has agreed to lift a freeze on the intake of foreign labor in the
plantation industry which is focusing on export-oriented
activities to boost production.
</P>
<P>
However, such a move will be temporary until the government
finds out a long-term solution to the problem of labor shortage in
the plantation industry, Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik
told reporters here today after officiating the Fourth Malaysian
Palm Oil Promotion Council Annual Seminar.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia imposed a freeze on foreign labor in the plantation
industry at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Lim said, Malaysia's plantation industry needs
some 50,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
He added that the shortage of labor, which is one of the major
constraints for the plantation industry, has caused and will
continue to cause losses of about 1.08 billion ringgit (about 310
million U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
According to Lim, by 1996, Malaysia had planted 2.62 million
hectares of land with oil palm trees and the area under such trees
is projected to increase to about 2.9 million hectares by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Bullish crude palm oil prices have been quoted on the Kuala
Lumpur Commodities Exchange recently. The prices of palm oil now
hover above the level of 1,700 ringgit (about 488.5 dollars) per
ton, from 1,100 ringgit (about 316 dollars) per ton in the middle
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, India and China are Malaysia's leading palm oil
export markets.
</P>
<P>
Lim said palm oil prices have gone up due to currency
fluctuation, a recent haze and the El-Nino phenomenon as well as
the effects of labor shortage on production.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would implement a price stabilizing
mechanism to prevent unnecessary increases in the price of
domestic cooking oil and his ministry is currently working on the
establishment of the mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Lim criticized a report which suggested that palm oil-based
cooking oil be replaced by coconut oil, saying the report could
ruin the efforts made to promote the palm oil industry in the
domestic and international markets.

CANBERRA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
remained largely unchanged in light trade today as investors were
cautious of Asia's direction and the possible impact of the

The All Ordinaries Index closed down 0.6 points to 2482.1, with
a marginal improvement in industrials offset by a slight fall in

uncertain because of the Asian problems," Jamie Spiteri from Shaw

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
weakened today, bereft of directional cues with no local data
released and Japanese financial markets closed.
</P>
<P>
The local currency settled at 69.28 U.S. cents from a close of
69.46 U.S. cents last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Traders said market activity was subdued, largely because of a
lack of Japanese players as a result of a national holiday there.
</P>
<P>
However, the Australian dollar, along with other currencies,
did rise against the yen after it was announced that one of
Japan's four big brokerages had collapsed because of financial
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Yamaichi Securities Co today filed a request with the finance
ministry to suspend business with a view to liquidation.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 87.90 yen from 87.59 yen
previously, and at 1.2022 marks from 1.2003 marks in Sydney
yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Human Resources Held in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of human resources
practitioners, consultants and academics are gathered here to
explore the challenges and opportunities of the profession in the
years ahead.
</P>
<P>
A two-day annual conference of the Hong Kong Institute of Human
 Resources Management (IHRM) opened today. Some 40 speakers, who
are mostly human resources professionals and business executives,
are expected to address the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The role and function of human resources, competencies that
human resources practitioners will need to acquire, the evolving
role of training for human resources development, and the impact
of information technology will be among the key issues to be
discussed at the gathering.
</P>
<P>
"In recognition of the important year of 1997, Moving Beyond
1997 is selected as the theme for the conference," said IHRM
President Eddie Ng, who noted that the profession will definitely
undergo revolutionary, not evolutionary, changes in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
The conference consists of five plenary sessions and 20
concurrent seminars. Issues on people management in China's inland
areas and the Asia-Pacific region, including the topic on
compensation and benefits, are to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
Findings of the research project "Human resources management
strategies and practices in foreign invested enterprises in the
People's Republic of China" were released at the conference. The
project is a joint research by the IHRM, Hong Kong's leading human
resources professional body, and the Institute of International
Technology and Economy under the Development Research Center of
the State Council of the PRC, conducted since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the conference is an exhibition featuring
leading-edge services and products provided by professional
consultants and vendors. One of the exhibitors, the South China
Market of Human Resources, shows their on-line job-matching system
covering several major cities in China's inland areas. A book
store is also set up to display related publications.
</P>
<P>
IHRM, founded in 1977 with the aim of safeguarding the interest
of the human resources profession and enhance its influence at
various levels, now has more than 2,800 members among which 250
are corporate members.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Start Air Route to Nanjing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to start a regular air
service to Nanjing, capital of East China's Jiangsu Province, next
April while a chartered flight service will be inaugurated next
month, the Macao Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Yang Qilong, deputy general manager of the China Travel
Service (Jiangsu) Group Company, who signed a chartered flight
service agreement with Air Macao last weekend, said the new air
route is aimed at attracting more Taiwan passengers.
</P>
<P>
The air service has great potential as Nanjing has a large
number of Taiwan investors, Yang noted.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the quasi-direct flight service between Taiwan and
Beijing, Shanghai and Xiamen via Macao has attracted many Taiwan
passengers. Experts estimated that about 70 percent of the
passengers of Air Macao are from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The first chartered flight will start on December 29,
according to the agreement. There will be two round flights each
week and the air travel will take two hours and 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Li Keli, general manager of Air Macao, told the Macao Daily
News that the regular flight service is expected to begin next
April upon approval by aviation authorities in China's mainland
and Macao.
</P>
<P>
By then, Air Macao will have 11 regular air routes, six of
which to China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the airline plans to start regular service to
Chongqing City in Southwest China later next year and prepares for
the start of air routes to Guilin in Southeast China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region and Hangzhou in East China's Zhejiang
Province and to Malaysia, Singapore and Japan.

<HEADLINE> UN Arms Inspectors Continue Mission in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations weapons
inspection teams continued their mission today for the third
consecutive day after they returned to Baghdad on Friday, the
Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi official who did not give his name said that eight
teams left here between 8 and 9 a.m. local time (0500-0600 GMT)
for a number of sites marked for U.N. permanent inspection.
</P>
<P>
The maintenance team of the monitoring cameras would inspect 16
sites to make sure that the cameras installed there were in proper
operation while the helicopter team would make two flights over
some Iraqi military bases, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agency quoted an anonymous U.N. inspector as
saying that the experts did not anticipate any difficulties or
obstacles that might be caused by the Iraqis in their work.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. inspectors carried out their mission smoothly and
without interference in the previous two days.
</P>
<P>
Iraq allowed the 75 U.N. inspectors, including four Americans,
to be back on Friday after a three-week standoff that erupted
after Iraq accused the Americans of being spies and threw them out.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors working for the U.N. Special Commission are
trying to verify that Iraq has complied with the U.N. orders
issued in 1991 at the end of the Gulf War to destroy its weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Only then will the U.N. Security Council lift the crippling
economic sanctions imposed on Iraq in August 1990 when its troops
invaded Kuwait, touching off the Gulf War.

<P>
PARIS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news in
leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Lionel Jospin Sunday took advantage of the
assistance from his partisans at the Socialist Party congress to
retaliate against the criticism by President Jacques Chirac over his
employment policy. Chirac has warned Jospin against ``hazardous
experimentations'' in his job policy. Jospin joked that what was
really ``hazardous'' was for Chirac to dissolve the parliament and
hold early general elections this spring.
</P>
<P>
-- One week after the massacre of Luxor, it is time to settle
account. After sacking his interior minister, Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak turned to abroad to seek scape-goats by violently
attacking European countries for providing refuge to Islamists and
indirectly holding them responsible for the massacre.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In his closing speech at the Socialist Party congress on
Sunday in Brest, Lionel Jospin responded, and for the first time
without caution, to the criticism of the chief of state, creating a
net tension in the cohabitation. ``I remember a hazardous
experimentation which began on April 21, 1997... in the electoral
matter in connection with the dissolution (of parliament),'' said
Jospin ironically in front of the Socialist militants, in response
to a warning given by Chirac against ``the mirage of hazardous
experimentations'' by his government.
</P>
<P>
-- Asked in a poll by Le Figaro and some other press institutions
on the political situation of the Provcene-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region
in southern France, 79 percent of the local inhabitants said that
corruption exists in their region, while 59 percent said that
corruption is ``neither more nor less serious'' in the region than
other regions of France. Sixty percent said that there exist
``mafia behaviors'' in the local political circles, and 86 percent
said that this corruption is the expression of a more general
degradation of the political life in France.

The museum, built in cooperation with the UNESCO, showcased
more than 2,000 pieces of art depicting the historical and
civilizational heritage of Nubia from the pre-historic time until
the 1960s when the High Dam was built.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Sunday told reporters after
the inauguration of the Nubia Museum there was no dialogue with
terrorists and that any person who raised arms would be decisively
faced.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the bloody killing in Luxor on Monday last week,
Mubarak accused some European countries of harboring terrorists. He
wondered if the Europeans would like their sons not to be killed,
why had they protected terrorists and offered money to killers.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- The Egyptian People's Assembly Sunday passed the tax
conciliation bill to shorten the dispute period between tax payers
and the tax authority.
</P>
<P>
It was also aimed to ease the burdens on the Judiciary, tax
authority and tax payers.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Basij Force Vows to Defend Supreme Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Basij (volunteer
mobilization) force commander, Ali Reza Afshar, today vowed to
defend the country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the Basij headquarters here
on the occasion of the 18th anniversary of its formation, Afshar
said his force would fight against any plots against the supreme
leadership, Velayat-e Faqih (governance of supreme religious
jurisprudent).
</P>
<P>
He praised recent political demonstrations to support the
supreme leader but denied there were any attacks on a prominent
religious figure, Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, who formerly
had been designated as successor to the late Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that hundreds of
religious instructors and students Wednesday attacked Montazeri's
office in the religious city of Qom, some 100 kilometers south of
the capital, following his criticism of Khamenei's interference in
government affairs.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iranian Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance
Ataollah Mohajerani also termed Velayat-e Faqih, national unity
and territorial integrity as three principles of the duty of the
Basij.
</P>
<P>
Afshar said the Basij force would hold a ceremony Wednesday to
reiterate its allegiance to Ayatollah Khamenei, who is also the
commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the Basij would hold a nationwide
maneuver on Wednesday to strengthen its buildup and defensive
capability, with the participation of some 5 million volunteers
from all strata.
</P>
<P>
Terming defending the country and assistance to the people as
the two main duties of the Basij, he said his force has
contributed much to the country's defensive, security, relief and
constructive programs during the past 18 years.
</P>
<P>
The Basij commander noted that so far there were 5 million
Basij soldiers under his command, hoping the figure would rise to
20 million in the near future, an ideal set by Iran's late
Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Afshar noted that his force was divided in three parts named as
regular, active and special, adding that the Basij force would be
turned into a part of the country's Islamic Revolution Guards
Corps (IRGC) at a time of defending the country.

ATHENS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The "Revolutionary Nuclei," a

which occurred in Athens Sunday night, said an unidentified man
today.

The man told this to Skai, a local private television station,
the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>

The explosion of a home-made device seriously damaged the
offices of the Pan-National Democratic Union, a political movement
founded earlier this year.

Some homes, shops and the offices of the Greek Strategic

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu to Propose Further Redeployments: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu is preparing a new proposal on further troop
redeployments in the West Bank, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is considering pulling out troops from 6-8 percent
of the areas under Israeli control in the second phase of the
three-stage pullbacks as stipulated in the Hebron agreement
signed last January, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu conditioned the first and second phases of troop
pullbacks on a promise by the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) to continue combating terror and its agreement to
immediately hold the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also proposed completing the final phase of pullbacks
as a part of the final settlement.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu held consultations Sunday on the further
redeployments with senior Cabinet ministers, including Foreign
Minister David Levy, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, and
Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
Under the Hebron agreement, Israel should have completed the
first stage pullback by March 7 this year, and the second stage by
September 7.
</P>
<P>
In early March, Israel approved the scope of the first stage
redeployment as only 9 percent, which was rejected by the
Palestinian side which demanded for at least 30 percent. Due to
the failure to carry out the first stage pullback, the second
stage has also been delayed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's move to consider further redeployments came amid
mounting pressure from both the Palestinian side and the United
States, which is becoming increasingly impatient with the current
stalemate in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a public speech last Friday, U.S. President Bill Clinton
publicly expressed his dissatisfaction with the current state of
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, warning that the window of
opportunity is narrowing with the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
As a sign pointing to Clinton's anger toward Netanyahu's
policy of intransigency, the U.S. president refused to meet
Netanyahu during the latter's recent visit to the U.S. to attend a
conference of Jewish federations.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating the government's move to carry out further troop
pullbacks, hardline Jewish settlers and rightist lawmakers
threatened to topple the government if it hands over more land to
the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Michael Kleiner, a rightist lawmaker and head of the powerful
Land of Israel Front in the Knesset (Parliament), warned Netanyahu
Sunday against agreeing to a freeze of settlement construction and
transferring more land to the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Kleiner said his group, which comprises 18 lawmakers within
the ruling coalition, would vote against the government on future
issues, a move that will bring down the government.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli law requires the government to secure 61 votes in
the 120-seat Knesset. If it fails, the government will step down
to pave the way for holding new elections both for the prime
minister and the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government is now holding a 66-seat majority in
the Knesset, but it cannot survive even six coalition lawmakers
defect.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Halts Diesel Trade With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has banned the diesel
trade with Syria in the border areas, the local newspaper Daily
News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ankara will no longer grant visas to Syrian tanker drivers who
have been bringing diesel to Turkey in the last two months, the
paper quoted a statement of the Turkish Foreign Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Turkey made the decision in retaliation
for Syria's move to bar Turkish drivers from taking part in the
cross-border fuel trade.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear why Syria has banned Turkish drivers from the
cross-border transportation of diesel, which is allegedly produced
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors have been at odds due to a number of
differences, including the sharing of water resources and support
for anti-government organizations.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, an energy-starving country, has to import crude oil and
oil products from neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Overall Situation in China Excellent: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here today that the overall situation in China is
excellent with its economic growth expected to be at nine percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
"China's economy is expected to grow at about eight percent in
the remaining years of this century and at about seven percent in
the first decade of the next century," Jiang said in his speech at
a dinner party hosted by Vancouver Mayor Philip Owen for the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told about 1,000 guests at the party that since the
launching of reform and opening-up in the late 1970s, China's
productive forces, overall national strength and people's living
standards have all improved significantly.
</P>
<P>
The volume of foreign trade, both import and export, will
hopefully exceed 310 billion U.S. dollars this year, and is
expected to reach 400 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
This will promise a bigger market and greater opportunities to
the rest of the world to engage in economic exchanges and
cooperation with China, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party
of China last September drew a blueprint for China's reform,
opening-up and modernization drive towards the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"As required by reform and development, we will continue to
open the market steadily, speed up the process of opening up
infrastructures such as energy and communications and open up the
service sector such as banking and insurance with measured steps,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We will also further improve trade and investment environment
and create conditions for equal competition between Chinese and
foreign-funded enterprises by protecting the rights and interests
of foreign-funded enterprises according to law," he said. "An
all-directional and multi-tiered opening-up pattern has basically
taken shape."
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here this morning for the 5th APEC informal
leadership meeting scheduled for Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> S. African Rural Areas on Alert for Cholera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- South African rural
areas have been warned of possible outbreak of cholera by the
country's health department.
</P>
<P>
Unless precautionary measures are taken, rural areas in the
country could experience a cholera outbreak similar to that in
neighboring Mozambique where at least 120 people have died, local
daily quoted health department officials as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Cholera has reportedly infected at least 2,700 people in
various parts of Mozambique and its capital Maputo.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified health officials said no special measures
were being implemented at ports of entry into South Africa as it
was impossible to detect the disease or prevent cholera-infected
people from entering the country.
</P>
<P>
Neil Cameron, national director of communicable disease
control, said that with conditions as they were in northern
KwaZulu Natal Province, Mpumalanga Province and Northern
Province, "we can expect cholera in the country."
</P>
<P>
The health department has sent a cholera alert to the three
provinces and a request to report any cases immediately.
</P>
<P>
Cameron said the oral vaccine provided only about 50 and 60
percent protection and did not stop the spread of the organism.
</P>
<P>
Cholera is usually transmitted via contaminated water, but can
also be conveyed by flies which contaminate food with infected
faeces.
</P>
<P>
People infected with the disease usually have symptoms of
severe diarrhoea, vomiting and rapid dehydration, which may
result in death if treatment is not timely.
</P>
<P>
The British Airways Travel Clinic in South Africa has run out
of the vaccine for the disease because of the unusually high
number of requests for the vaccine from tourists and locals since
cholera broke out in Mozambique two months ago.

<HEADLINE> 15 Percent of Zambian Children Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- About 10 to 15 percent of
Zambian children have disabilities and require active
intervention and specialized services in education, according to
Zambia Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper today quoted Willian Chanda, acting vice
chancellor for University of Zambia, as saying here on Sunday
that by 1995, 160,000 to 250,000 children of primary school going
age in the country had mental and physical disabilities and
needed special education.
</P>
<P>
He said this figure did not include mal-adjusted or mentally
disturbed children.
</P>
<P>
He said this scenario has led to the limitation of the
services for the identification, assessment and placement of such
children and in certain cases, virtual absence.
</P>
<P>
Currently, special education school provisions are still
inadequate from primary school to tertiary level, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 there were 31 special education institutions, 28 at
primary, one at secondary and two at tertiary levels, Chanda
noted.
</P>
<P>
There are also 80 special education units, of which 51 were at
the primary and 29 at the secondary school levels, he added.
</P>
<P>
Due to huge demands and the efforts made by the Zambia
Institute of Special Education, the university has introduced an
ambitious degree course in special education with assistance from
the Finnish and Zambian governments in the 1996-1997 academic
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dean of the school of education said that department is
offering many specialized services to people with disabilities
such as lessons in braille writing and speech correction among
others.

<HEADLINE> Mandela, Mbeki Disagree on Crime: NP Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- It emerged that South
African President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki
did not agree on the nature and extent of the crime situation in
the country, new National Party (NP) leader Marthinus van
Schalkwyk said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki stated last Friday that crime was an extremely urgent
problem and that there was indeed an increase in some serious
crimes, The Citizen newspaper today quoted van Schalkwyk as
saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's 81-year-old mother had to close her store in Eastern
Cape Thursday after an armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old store, two years older than Thabo Mbeki,
helped maintain the whole family in the apartheid years when
Thabo Mbeki's father, Govan, was in jail.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, on the other hand, reacting to a letter which van
Schalkwyk sent to him last week, said that crime was under
control and that huge success was being achieved in the fight,
the NP leader said.
</P>
<P>
Van Schalkwyk described the government's handling of the crime
situation as "extremely inept", creating the impression that it
was falling over its own feet and that the left hand did not know
what the right hand was doing.
</P>
<P>
He said Mandela's approach of denial did not contribute to the
finding of solutions.
</P>
<P>
He asked for "bold and corrective" steps to fight crime in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Western Cape Premier Hernus Kriel called for a referendum on
the restoration of the death penalty to curb the wave of violent
crimes, but was severely attacked by the ruling African National
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Western Cape is the sole province in the hands of the
opposition National Party.
</P>
<P>
Mandela fervently opposed the reinstatement of the capital
punishment on the grounds that the white apartheid regime used
the death penalty as a tool to oppress the black majority.

The five new routes will have one or two flights a week, and
air carriers in Japan and ROK will be invited to act as China
Northern Airlines' overseas operators to help arrange return
flights.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Three east African countries
are conducting a study to set up a Customs Union in a bid to
harmonize customs tariffs among themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation today quoted Cabinet Minister Nicholas Biwott
as saying that substantial progress had been made under the East
African Co-operation in the establishment of a regional policy
framework.
</P>
<P>
He told the just concluded East Africa Co-operation (EAC)
Joint Investment meeting held in Nairobi that the regional body
had embarked on a process of harmonization of investment codes in
member states of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The three governments are committed to the success of the
renewed co-operation, Biwott said, adding the three countries had
signed a tripartite double taxation agreement.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum of understanding was signed by the member
states' capital and security market authorities to promote the
development of stock markets in the region, the minister stated.
</P>
<P>
To encourage private and foreign investment between the three
countries, Biwott said, exchange-control liberalization and
abolition of import licensing measures had been put in place.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the ninth Permanent Tripartite Commission
of the EAC had been postponed due to preparations for the general
elections in Kenya next month.
</P>
<P>
However, permanent secretaries responsible for regional
cooperation from the three member states will meet as scheduled
starting today.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues to be discussed at the meeting is the signing
of a defense cooperation agreement envisaging joint security and
disaster handling operations among the three states.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the three chiefs of defense met in Arusha, northern
Tanzania, to draw up a draft memorandum of understanding to work
together on various defense related matters.

GUANGZHOU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province resumed
its economic growth momentum in October after a long lull.
</P>
<P>
Suffering a depression last year, Guangdong's economy began to
inch into the black in the first half of this year. But it
wasn't until October that province's economy showed clear progress
out of the economic doldrums.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector generated 76.4 billion yuan (9.2 billion
U.S. dollars) in output in October, up 17.2 percent over the
corresponding period last year. The sales-to-output ratio in this
sector reached 96 percent, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales in October were 25.8 billion yuan, up 15.2 percent
over the same period last year. However, the retail price index
dropped by 0.9 percent and the consumer price index increased by
0.7 percent.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China has begun using a new
construction technology involving rubber cushioning to reduce
earthquake damage to buildings.
</P>
<P>
After repeated physical, chemical and mechanical tests, the
rubber-cushioned foundations of the buildings demonstrated a
strong bearing capacity and flexibility, said experts.
</P>
<P>
The rubber cushioning on building foundations will last 70
years, they said.
</P>
<P>
A steel-and-brick apartment building on Linghai Road in Shantou
employed the rubber cushions during its construction in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The eight-story building resisted a 1994 quake measuring 7.3 on
the Richter scale, which happened in the Taiwan Straits just 200
nautical miles from Shantou.
</P>
<P>
Apartment dwellers of the cushioned building said they hardly
felt the earthquake while other urban residents experienced heavy
shaking.
</P>
<P>
The rubber-cushioning technology could also be used in building
such projects as underground railways and bridges, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Introduce Non-Contaminating Wool Packs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- All wool presented for sale
after June 2000 must be inside special non-contaminating packs,
the Australian Wool Exchange Ltd. (AWEX) announced today.
</P>
<P>
The move follows overseas wool processor concerns about the
current HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) packs being a major
contributor towards wool contamination.
</P>
<P>
"The AWEX board has agreed that the Wool Exchange should use
its position to effect changes in the use of non-contaminating
packs while continuing to work with industry to overcome other
causes of contamination," AWEX Chairman John O'Neil said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
AWEX is a non-profit organization for Australian wool growers,
which, among other things, sets up the regulation for wool
package.
</P>
<P>
More than 3.5 million packs, all made overseas, are used
annually by the wool industry.
</P>
<P>
AWEX estimates 93 percent this season were made of HDPE.
</P>
<P>
Nylon wool packs are considered the only ones to offer
protection against contamination. But AWEX said this could change
over time.
</P>
<P>
The manufacture of HDPE packs is expected to stop by March 1999
with imports ceasing by June that year.
</P>
<P>
Expensive than HDPE packs, the nylon ones do not fray or pierce
as easily as HDPE packs, which can lead to stray fibers becoming
mixed up with the wool.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Girl students in Monze, about
180 kilometers southwest of the Zambian capital, are becoming sex
victims in the hands of drug dealers, Times of Zambia reported
here today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted some parents with daughters at Rusangu
Secondary School and Charles Lwanga Teachers College in Monze as
complaining that their daughters are being used to serve truck
drivers after being drugged in some bars in town.
</P>
<P>
There is a well-organised syndicate which is ferrying girls
from their schools at midnight after offering them good money and
drugging them before handing them over to truck drivers,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The parents of the victims said something must be done to
correct the situation before many more girls get involved in
drug-trafficking and their education spoiled.
</P>
<P>
Adrenny Kanondo, headmistress of Rusangu Secondary School,
confirmed the matter, saying the issue is serious and needs the
immediate attention from the drug enforcement commission.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable information reaching her office and
proved by herself, she said, a number of girls are on the payroll
of some bar owners and that every weekend they are ferried in
cars at midnight to entertain truck drivers and other people.
</P>
<P>
It is also said that some bars in Monze are becoming transit
points of drugs from neighbouring countries, using innocent
children to sell on the market.

NANJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Jiangsu province has
become an important export base of crabs, soft-shelled turtles,
and lobsters destined for Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The province has 100,000 hectares of crab raising areas that
produce an annual output of 40,000 tons of fresh water crabs,
accounting for 80 percent of the country's total. The crab raising
industry earns an annual of three billion yuan (375 million
U.S. dollars) for the province. The city of Dafeng exports 3,000
tons of lobsters every year.
</P>
<P>
The province has set up 150 soft-shelled turtle bases. Baoying
County plans to spend 50 million yuan on a large aquatic products
center, and the province expects to produce one million
soft-shelled turtles a year and earn 70 million yuan from them.
</P>
<P>
Foreign businesses have shown growing interest in the
processing of the aquatic products. Companies from Singapore
invested in the province's processing lines. In Hongze County
alone, more than 20 kinds of the processed aquatic products are
sold to the United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Hong

<HEADLINE> 3,000 Australian Workers Evacuated from Steelworks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was
injured and 3,000 workers were evacuated after major fires erupted
at a coastal steelworks 100 km south of Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
The meltdown of a power transformer has been blamed for
sparking a series of major fires which forced the evacuation today
of a Port Kembla steelworks owned by Australia's leading steel
producer BHP, or Broken Hill Pty. Co., and injured at least one
person, the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Police Commander Bruce Newling from the Lake Illawarra patrol
told reporters that the emergency started in a power plant shortly
after 9 a.m. local time when a transformer melted down.
</P>
<P>
Newling said the meltdown caused a fire which then prompted a
power surge in a number of areas which resulted in a series of
fires throughout the plant including the coke ovens and two blast
furnaces.
</P>
<P>
A BHP spokesman said production resumed at the plant but it
would be a couple of days before it was working at full capacity.
</P>
<P>
"But we expect to be making steel before the day's out and
there will be no impact on our customers," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said a couple of workers on the waterfront had received
minor cuts and abrasions during the time of the fires, but it was
not yet confirmed whether they had been caused as a result of the
emergency.
</P>
<P>
The resources company said power was being progressively
returned to the plant via portable compressors and power plants.
</P>
<P>
The company said there was a major fault in the transformer or
high voltage power switch which interrupted power to much of the
plant.
</P>
<P>
The loss of power also triggered emergency close-down of the
blast furnaces and other key plant areas, BHP said.
</P>
<P>
The company said the situation was under control by 1 p.m.
local time and employees were beginning to return to various areas
of the plant after being evacuated earlier in the morning.
</P>
<P>
BHP Port Kembla plant manager George Edgar said it was still
too early to assess the cost of the fires.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Institute of
Bankers (ZIB) has called for the creation of a statutory body to
deal with money laundering and other serious crimes more
effectively.
</P>
<P>
The proposed body should encompass the Drug Enforcement
Commission (DEC) and the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), ZIB
said, according to today's Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
ZIB also urged the government to make necessary amendments to
existing banking and financial services acts.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions passed at the just concluded money laundering
workshop held in Ndola in northern Zambia stipulated that stiff
penalties should be meted out for non compliance to both
individuals and institutions.
</P>
<P>
The seminar resolved that there should be an assurance of a
clear process of arbitration against victimization.
</P>
<P>
The act should have clauses to protect anti-money-laundering
officers so that their identity is kept secret.
</P>
<P>
The bankers resolved that former bankers with criminal records
should not be employed in financial institutions and that their
professional conducts should be approved by the ZIB.
</P>
<P>
ZIB pledged to set up continuous staff training on anti-money
laundering in order to be competent with international practising
standards.

JERUSALEM, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel's inflation is poised
to hit 29-year low in 1998, The Jerusalem Post today quoted
International Monetary Fund Vice-President Stanley Fischer as
saying.
</P>

<P>
"The 7 percent range is possible if they stay the course and
they're on track for that in 1998," said Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Israel's inflation this year is likely to reach 8.5 to 9.5
percent, with the government target set at 7 to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Fischer's 7 percent comment, Bank of Israel
Governor Jacob Frenkel said the government has set a 1998

<HEADLINE> S'pore Airlines, Lufthansa Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Airlines and
Lufthansa announced here today the formation of a strategic
alliance that will provide passengers of both carriers with a wide
range of enhanced benefits.
</P>
<P>
After a year of discussion, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
confirming the alliance was signed here today by the chief
executive officers of the two carriers.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Airlines (SIA) said that the MOU covers a wide
area of commercial cooperation, including code-sharing, network
and schedule development, frequent flyer programs, product
development, ground-handling, customer service, information
technology, and cargo operations.
</P>
<P>
The alliance is said to be an expansion of a long-standing
commercial relationship between the two carriers. SIA and
Lufthansa first began working together in September 1989, when
they initiated a joint freighter service between Singapore and
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
The two airlines will further develop this commercial
relationship to include passenger services and they will expand
their passenger schedules to offer travelers more choices and
better connection times, they said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, both airlines operate daily round-trip passenger
flights between Singapore and Frankfurt. Four of SIA's daily
flights to Frankfurt go beyond to New York. From April 1998, each
airline plans to increase its frequencies between Singapore and
Frankfurt to ten flights per week from the present seven, offering
passengers alternative daytime departures from both cities, along
with the current late-night services, they said.

<HEADLINE> Special Tours For Special People Being Offered In South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Some smart tourist agents in
this capital city of Guangdong Province have come up with special
tours using the theme of love and family.
</P>
<P>
Tourist agencies recently began announcing packages for young
and middle-aged parents and their children with the slogan
"Showing Affection to Your Children", and this summer, 5,000
people responded.
</P>
<P>
Organizers have provided eight travel routes since the special
travel service started three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Parents used to think that taking children along with them on a
trip was inconvenient, according to local travel agencies. But, in
recent years, most parents want to give their children more
experience by taking them on outings.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, higher paychecks have also enabled young
urbanites to show more filial piety to their elderly parents, so
travel agences have organized "filial love" package
tours. Organizers of groups of elderly travellers carefully plan the
routes and the routine. Guides are also much more aware of how to
take care of their health needs.
</P>
<P>
According to recent travel statistics in Guangzhou, more of the
elderly traveled this year, accounting for nearly 30 percent of
the number of tourists.
</P>
<P>
Financial support from their children helps the elderly in
this, and "filial love" tours accounted for two-thirds of the
tours for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Other special tours, like those for honeymooners, spouses, and
alumni are now being planned, according to local sources.

<HEADLINE> China's Qaidam Basin Reports Progress in Oil-Gas Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Qaidam Basin on China's
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has added 56 million tons to its proven
petroleum reserves over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai Provincial Petroleum Administration says that the
basin has 4.17 billion tons of petroleum reserves and over one
trillion cu.m. of gas reserves. It ranks fourth in China in
natural gas reserves, only after the Sichuan,
Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Tarim basins.
</P>
<P>
Song Kexian, deputy director of the administration, says that
China's strategy in the petroleum industry -- "stabilizing oil
output in the east and developing oil reserves in the west" has
allowed the Qaidam Basin to speed up oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
The administration has planned to find 600 million tons of
proven oil and gas reserves and produce three million tons of
crude oil and 800 million cu.m. of gas annually by 2000.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the Qaidam has spent one billion yuan
(about 830 million U.S. dollars) on oil and gas exploration, 25
percent more than the total for the Eighth Five-Year Plan
(1991-95) period. Only 10 percent of its total oil reserves and
five percent of natural gas have been verified in the basin,
according to Song.
</P>
<P>
"As more oil and gas reserves are verified, a number of related
industrial projects will be started, thus creating opportunities
for overseas investments, " he notes.
</P>
<P>
Two oil pipelines, with a total length of 300 km, and a
gas-burning power plant, have been completed, and 5,000 households
in the city of Golmud use gas for cooking. Work has also started
on a third gas pipeline, 280 km in length, and a 10,000-ton
methanol project in the Golmud Oil Refinery.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai Provincial Petroleum Administration has plans to
establish a joint-stock company and issue B-shares for overseas
investors. It will also build a gas pipeline from the basin to
Xining, capital of Qinghai Province, and a larger gas-burning
station.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Defends Imposition of Visa Rule on Britons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's sovereign right to
make independent decisions on matters of national interest should
not be subject to debate, the Daily Nation today quoted a Kenyan
senior official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sammy Mbova, Permanent Secretary for Tourism and Wildlife
noted that decisions such as the imposition of visa requirements
for British travellers to Kenya were neither impulsive nor
punitive, but the culmination of exhaustive diplomatic
consultations between the relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
Mbova, who is leading a tourism promotion delegation
participating in the annual world travel market fair in London,
said that the new development should be accommodated in tourism
business operations without any reservations.
</P>
<P>
The new visa rule has been interpreted as a retaliation for
Britain's imposition of a visa requirement on Kenyans and other
east African citizens last year.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania was the first east African country to introduce visas
for visitors from Britain, and Uganda has recently been
considering a similar measure.
</P>
<P>
British tourists were reported as saying that the new rule was
"fair enough" as it is reciprocal.
</P>
<P>
A source from Kenya's tourism industry noted that despite the
opposition to the imposition of the visa rule by some
stakeholders in Kenya's tourism industry, the Kenyan government
was unlikely to reverse the decision.

plans to boost its cargo handling capacity at major ports.
</P>
<P>
It has 22 deep-water harbors, six of which now can handle

2,460 ships involved in marine transportation, which carries
600,000 containers a year.
</P>
<P>
The province is taking efforts to reinforce the ports of
Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Meizhou Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Fuzhou and Xiamen ports have 200 million yuan (25 million
U.S. dollars) in fixed assets each and can handle up to 10 million
tons of cargo a year, earning 100 million yuan annually from
marine transportation.
</P>
<P>
Marine transportation helps the province's export-oriented
economy and also improves economic cooperation with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Growth of the marine industry is expected to exceed
that of the provincial economy as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Rodents Rampant in Tanzanian Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Large herds of rats are
ravaging maize and other crops in Turiani division in east
Tanzania's Morogoro region, posing serious threats to
agricultural output this season.
</P>
<P>
Peasants in Turiani, a major food production area, said on
Friday that numerous rodents emerged suddenly at the start of the
current rains, attacking crops in nearly 10 villages.
</P>
<P>
"I have planted two acres of maize for four times but all have
been eaten by rats. I'm tired," Kisimbo Mbwambo told Daily News.
</P>
<P>
The peasant said local people were surprised by the sudden
increase of the rodent population at the onset of rains.
</P>
<P>
"Usually they die in their holes when it rains. Now it is in
the opposite situation," he lamented.
</P>
<P>
Peasants sleeping in their farms during the night to guard
against baboons and wild pigs, now have to cover their feet for
fear of being bitten by rats.
</P>
<P>
Mbwambo, who have settled in Turiani for 25 years, said he has
never seen such a phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Other villagers say they have failed in killing the
crop-eating animals with chemicals or other traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
"We have tried to drown them in plastic containers filled with
water and food remains. You can kill 300 at a time but that has
not helped the situation," another peasant Emmanuel Mweta said.
</P>
<P>
The villages affected are all located in the lowland area east
of the Nguu mountains.
</P>
<P>
Omari Saidi, chairman of Lungo village, said villagers are
still looking for agricultural experts who can help solve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
Food shortage is imminent in the affected villages this year
despite the good rains this season, Saidi said, adding that two
types of rats were uprooting maize and rice seeds as well as
sugar canes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Say Further Dunhuang Research Is Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Some noted Chinese historians
are saying that research on the Dunhuang Grottoes needs to be
improved because of certain problems.
</P>
<P>
Duan Wenjie, director of the Dunhuang Research Institute in
northwest China's Gansu, says that the future does not look very
good if the research just stops at the textual stage, and that
there is not systematic program for the research, which is
currently dominated by personal interest instead of a larger plan.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhengyu, another Dunhuang expert, says that the number of
researchers in major Dunhuang research countries like France,
Japan and Russia is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
The Dunhuang Grottoes, on the silk road, in Gansu province in
northwest China, were discovered in 1900. Thousands of paintings,
manuscripts, statues, and other relics were found there and
then carted off by foreigners and are now scattered about in
foreign countries and in China.
</P>
<P>
Research on the grottoes has become very popular because it
provides important information about ancient religions, arts,
history, and China's connections with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Scholars suggest that better and more systematic research be
done to keep the study alive into the next century. Training more
young experts is the most important thing, they say, and there
should be extensive co-operation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, modern technology should be introduced to the
studies, and a publicity program developed to provide information
to the public.

VANCOUVER, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here today China is willing to further develop its
mutually beneficial cooperation with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks at a meeting with Thai Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai. The two leaders arrived here earlier today to
attend the 5th APEC informal leaders' meeting scheduled for
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, both Jiang and Chuan spoke highly of the

<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin today called for respect for the diversity of culture,
values and model of development among nations in seeking common
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"Only when we acknowledge differences, seek common ground while
putting aside differences, respect each other and cooperate for
mutual benefit can peace and stability be maintained in a region
and the world at large and common development and prosperity be
achieved," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech here at a dinner hosted by Vancouver Mayor
Philip Owen, Jiang said today's world is a diversified and
colorful one, in which all countries are independent and equal
members of the international community.
</P>
<P>
Peace and development have increasingly become the major themes
of our times, Jiang said. Countries are more closely interwoven
economically through exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"But it does not mean that there exists only one cultural
tradition, one value concept, or one model of development," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here this morning for the 5th APEC informal
leaders' meeting scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said in the next two days, leaders from APEC members will
exchange views on how to further deepen and strengthen regional
economic and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
APEC, as the most important economic forum in this region, has
provided a good venue for members with different cultural
traditions and at varying development levels to strengthen
economic and technological cooperation through consultations on an
equal footing, he said.
</P>
<P>
After years of practice, APEC has formed its unique approach
which has been identified by the Manila meeting as "APEC
Approach", he said.
</P>
<P>
"This cooperative approach based on consensus and voluntarism
is in conformity with the trend of our times and the realities in
the Asia-Pacific region and strikes a balance between the rights,
interests and requirements of different partners," he added.

services to China since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The company's Shanghai office is expected to be conducive for
the company's better understanding of the dynamics of China's
markets and its effects on global textiles.

<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada, November 23 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of

</P>
<P>
"We believe that the economic difficulties besetting Thailand

Thai economy are bright," said the Chinese minister, who is here
for the Ninth Ministerial Meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC).
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, which concluded here in the west Canadian
city Saturday, discussed, among other issues, the impact on the
region's economies produced by the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"China is ready to offer help within its capacity to Thailand,

<HEADLINE> Giant Chain Stores to Emerge in Next Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Groups of giant chain stores
are likely to be created in the next five to 10 years in China,
the Ministry of Internal Trade disclosed over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The annual sales volume of each of these chains is expected to
exceed 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S. dollars), according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Their participation will revolutionize China's traditional
commodity distribution by developing a fledging chain store
sector, said officials attending the ceremony to launch the China
Chain Store and Franchise Association (CCFA) here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter of congratulation on the establishment of the
association, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said: "Practice has proved
that chain store management is an important means of realizing the
modernization of the commodity distribution industry and is the
main thrust for structural readjustment and in-depth reform for
the sector."
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the management aim of chain store
businesses, which "is to bring convenience and benefit to the
people."
</P>
<P>
Chain store management has been introduced in early 1990s. With
its low-price and high-volume strategy, China's chain store sector
has grown rapidly. The trend has been warmly welcomed by
low-income families, which form the majority in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is to become the main-stream of the future development of
China's retail business, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China's chain store business fall broadly into seven categories
-- supermarkets, convenience stores, brand-name specialist shops,
department stores, snack counters, service centers and building
material shops.
</P>
<P>
"In 1994, there were 150 chain store companies with 2,500
outlets. But the number of companies had jumped to 1,000 with
14,000 outlets by the end of June this year." said Di Jiankai,
CCFA director and head of the Trade Administration Department of
the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Large Number of Ancient Bird Fossils Discovered in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 250 bird fossils
that date back 120 to 150 million years have been unearthed in the
western part of Liaoning Province in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Scholars from the U.S., Germany, Canada, and Britain have
visited the area in the past year, and the Fifth International
Conference on Birds and Evolution will be held in China in the
year 2000, with the Liaoning bird fossils high on the list of
discussion topics.
</P>
<P>
The latest discoveries belong to the late Jurassic Period and
the early Cretaceous Period of the Mesozoic Era, scholars say.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a large number of fish and plant fossils have been
unearthed in several counties.
</P>
<P>
No other place on earth has such a large fossil collection from
such a crucial period of change on earth that is preserved so
well, according to John Ostrom, Professor Emeritus of Yale
University, a well-known expert on ancient birds.
</P>
<P>
Scholars explain that today's Liaoning Province was an active
volcano region in ancient times, and gasses from volcanic
eruptions killed the birds and then instantly covered them with
volcanic ash.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s, farmers first found fish fossils in the area
and sold them secretly, but the later discovery of bird fossils
caught the local government's attention.
</P>
<P>
It's been estimated that many of the almost 1,000 ancient bird
fossils unearthed in the area have been sold abroad secretly,
according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have prohibited the collection or sale of
fossils and have set up a fossil preservation zone in a
two-sq.km. area, and are building a museum.
</P>
<P>
Scholars point out that the fossils will provide information
about the geography, climate, and environment of ancient times.

He said investment in Beijing's real estate sector slid 4.3
percent, and sales dropped 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The investment was sufficient, although it declined slightly,"
Deng said.
</P>
<P>
The decline in investment was a result of the developers'
intention to lessen the investment scale stemming from the market
presure, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Developers were still confident about the city's property
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
They broke ground on commercial houses totalling 3.55 million

</P>
<P>
They also leased 115.2 ha, which doubled last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
According to Deng, the average price for residential properties
rose 10 percent, and individuals' purchasing of houses rose 57
percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 95 percent of
throat cancer patients are heavy smokers, which reinforces the
link between cigarettes and cancer, said a Chinese doctor.
</P>
<P>
"Heavy smokers are considered to be those who smoke more than
one pack of cigarettes a day," said Li Xiaoming, a 35-year-old
doctor at the No. 1 Clinical Hospital of the Bethune Medical
University in northeastern China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
Li said that ingredients in cigarettes such as nicotine and tar
curb the immune system and promote carcinogens. Smokers also run a
high risk of tumors in their respiratory systems, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"Those harmful elements in cigarettes can cause the split of
DNA, which will in turn result in the incidence of cancer," Li
said, adding that the "throat, which is more fragile to the
elements, is more likely to contract cancer."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist Finds That Early Emperor Lead A Strong Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist has found
evidence that Qinshihuang, China's first emperor, used a very
strong army to unite China for the first time, 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Feng Shenglin, 58, a biologist from Hunan Education College,
has been using modern anatomy for 10 years to study 8,000
terracotta figures unearthed near the emperor's tomb in the
Chinese city of Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
Feng's findings support what many historians believe that
Qinshihuang built one of the most powerful armies on the planet,
and a recently-published book says that 80 percent of the
sculptured soldiers are "healthy and strong", and 90 percent are
taller than ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
"It is obviously a robust army," Feng says. He is now in charge
of a 10-member group of researchers who are analyzing data from
the sculptures to find out how powerful the ancient army was.
</P>
<P>
Qinshihuang built China's first dynasty in 221 B.C after
several years of battles with six rival kingdoms in the Yellow and
Yangtze River valleys.
</P>
<P>
According to historical documents, millions of Qin soldiers
played a part in the reunification efforts. Many of them were then
used to help build the Great Wall after the dynasty was
established.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his death, the proud emperor duplicated his beloved
soldiers and officers in terracotta in hopes that the sculptures
would safeguard his underground palace.
</P>
<P>
The experts have also found that the terracotta warriors
represent almost all types of faces that can be found among
today's Chinese. Their findings also indicate that anatomy and art
were highly developed in China 2,000 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Aid Program Brings Hope to Tibetans in Poor Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Tibet Autonomous Region
has invested eight million yuan (one million US dollars) in a
comprehensive agricultural development zone in barren areas near
the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
The development zone's 120 ha. of farmland, 120 ha.
of grasslands and 110 ha. of forests will provide employment for
some 300 poverty-stricken families in four neighboring townships with
a total population of 1,400 people.
</P>
<P>
The zone covers 13,000 sq.km. in Tingri County, Tibet's poorest
county.
</P>
<P>
Despite extensive wastelands, the county has abundant water,
solar energy and mineral resources. Tingri, a country with a
poverty-stricken population of some 30 percent, has failed to
realize economic development due to severe weather conditions and
backward infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The first training course for poor people was introduced to the
county two years ago. However, the county plans to reach the
nation's poverty relief standards by the end of 1998, according to
a local official.
</P>
<P>
Tingri will allocate over 7.37 million yuan for poverty relief
and will complete all approved development projects, including
population relocation and construction of water treatment
facilities. The county will also establish a loan fund of 12
million yuan, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He added that the county is currently focusing on large-scale
irrigation projects and the reclamation of low-yield land.

<P>
HANOI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin arrived here today for a three-day visit to Vietnam
aimed at promoting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Prime Minister Pan Van Khai is scheduled to hold a
welcome ceremony at the president's residence before his formal
talks with the visiting Russian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of bilateral economic and trade cooperation is
said to be one of the topics of their talks.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, President of Vietnam Tram Duc Luong will meet
Chernomyrdin, sources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides will sign several accords on economic and trade
cooperation this evening.
</P>
<P>
Do Muoi, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of Vietnam, is scheduled to meet the visiting
Russian prime minister tomorrow.
</P>

Chernomyrdin is the highest-ranking official from Russia to
visit Vietnam since the disintegration of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the then Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet visited

In the 1970s and 1980s, the former Soviet Union was the largest
source of foreign aid to Vietnam and its largest export market as
well.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the Soviet Union brought about a sharp decline
in Vietnamese-Russian relations.

<HEADLINE> Dostum Troops Capture Malik's Headquarters: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Forces of Uzbek warlord
Rashid Dostum claimed Sunday that his forces had seized Abdul
Malik's headquarters at Maimana in northwestern Afghanistan and
Malik had fled abroad, local newspapers reported here today.
</P>
<P>
However, there was no independent confirmation of the claim,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Dostum's spokesman Abdul Baqi Turkestani as
saying Dostum's forces met with little opposition when they took
Maimana, the provincial capital of Faryab.
</P>
<P>
Malik, who had been one of Dostum's commanders, defected to the
Taliban, who now control some two-thirds of Afghanistan, to help
them enter Dostum's stronghold Mazar-e-Sharif in northern
Afghanistan in May this year, forcing Dostum to flee abroad.
</P>
<P>
But he turned against the Taliban militia only days later and
killed a large number of their fighters, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Malik had moved to Maimana after Dostum
returned to Mazar-e-Sharif from a four-month exile in Turkey to
reclaim leadership of Uzbeks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the reports said Dostum and the Taliban on Saturday
released nine captives from both sides in a swap of prisoners.

DHAKA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
taken up a massive program for the construction of 2,500 cyclone
shelters in phases in a bid to minimize the loss of life and
property from tropical cyclones, the national news agency BSS
reported today.
</P>
<P>
As of today, about 1,000 cyclone shelters have been built, out
of a target of 1,200 set for the first phase, with help from
friendly countries, international voluntary organizations and
non-governmental organizations, BSS quoted MH Khan Chowdhury, a
disaster preparedness specialist, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's entire coastal belt of 710 kilometers is exposed
to the potential danger of cyclones.
</P>
<P>
Since the country gained independence in 1971, 3,931 kilometers
of coastal embankments have been built by the Bangladesh Water
Development Board under 435 projects to protect coastal land from
inundation by tidal waves and storm surges, Chowdhury said in a
paper on "Cyclone, the Cyclone Warnings and their Dissemination:
Bangladesh Perspective."
</P>
<P>
Killer-severe cyclones develop along the country's coasts with
75 percent chances strictly from April 15 to June 15 and from
September 15 to December 15, he noted.

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The decline in India's
inflation continued for the fourth week in succession with the
annual rate of inflation dropping to 3.2 percent for the week
ended November 8, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
During the week, the inflation rate fell by 0.03 percentage
points from 3.23 percent in the previous week and 6.47 percent
during the corresponding week last year.
</P>
<P>
The wholesale price index (WPI) for all commodities (base
1981-82=100) fell by 0.1 percent from the week before to 329.3.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has slumped by about one percentage point in the last
four weeks alone.
</P>
<P>
Economists here have suggested that the persistent fall,
despite recent hikes in the prices of petroleum products and rail
freight charges, may be due to the slackening of demand in the
sluggish Indian economy.
</P>
<P>
Though analysts have predicted an upturn in inflation in the
second half of the year, signs of any upward movement in inflation
is yet to be sighted.

<HEADLINE> Thai Anti-drug Drive Hurt by Economic Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The current economic slowdown
has not frustrated the drug trade in Thailand but hurt local
police efforts to fight drug, a senior Thai police officer said.
</P>
<P>
Drug dealers have cut drug prices to maintain their market in
Thailand as the country is undergoing an economic slowdown,
Thailand's Narcotics Suppression Bureau Commander Noppadol
Somboonsap said at a seminar here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An amphetamine pill which used to cost 120 baht (4.8 U.S.
dollars) now was sold at 50-70 baht (1.2-1.7 dollars), the Thai
drug suppression head was quoted as saying by local newspapers
today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, amphetamines have emerged as a popular alternative
to the expansive heroin in Thailand now, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Thai police's drive against drug was
weakened as the government cut its budget due to the economic
slowdown, Noppadol said.
</P>
<P>
The budget for drug suppression shrank to merely 17 million
baht (0.4 million dollars) compared with the more than 100 million
baht (4 million dollars) in the past, he said.
</P>
<P>
Police could not launch strong campaigns with such limited
funds, he added.

<HEADLINE> Irrigation Project in NW China Provides Water for Arid Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Yindaruqin Irrigation
Project in northwest China's Gansu Province is playing an
increasing big role in promoting local economic development.
</P>
<P>
The project, which began partial operation in October of 1995,
has helped farmers increase local grain output by 10 million
kilograms and forest areas by more than 660 hectares. The improved
environment has attracted 35,000 farmers to settle in the
irrigated areas.
</P>
<P>
The project was constructed to divert water from the Datong
River in Qinghai Province to Qinwangchuan Plain, about 60
kilometers away from Lanzhou, capital of Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
With feeder, main and branch canals totaling 884 kilometers --
half the distance of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal -- the
project has been called the longest "underground canal" in China.
</P>
<P>
"The townships of Dongshan, Xicao and Shuping of Yongdeng
County benefited from the irrigation project first," said Gu
Qihao, chief engineer of the project.
</P>
<P>
The main part of the project was completed in 1995. It provides
water for 14,000 hectares of cultivated farmland, an increase of
6,000 hectares from the 1995 figure of 8,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the project, the Qinwangchuan area got a
per-hectare grain yield of 5,250 kilograms in 1995, six times that
of previous years.
</P>
<P>
The region has upgraded 866 hectares of land into high-yielding
farmland, and improved 2,000 hectares of low-yielding land. As
many as 730,000 trees have been planted. An area of 2,660 hectares
has been afforested, with profitable orchards occupying 265
hectares.
</P>
<P>
When the project goes into full operation, it is expected to
irrigate 57,300 hectares of farmland.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Garment Industry on Verge of Closing Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The garment industry, a
major foreign currency earner for Nepal, is on the verge of
closing down due to lack of clear-cut policies of the government,
newspapers said today.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Nepal's ready-made garments are five percent more
expensive than those made in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri
Lanka has led to a slackness in exports, the newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
Following the establishment of the garment industry in the
1980s, the number of garment factories reached 1,300 in 1990, but
less than 300 are now operating in the country, the newspapers
said.
</P>
<P>
Ready-made garments worth 60 million rupees (about 1 million
U.S. dollars) were exported in the last fiscal year which ended on
July 14, but the very beginning of this fiscal year witnessed a
slump, the Nepal Garment Industries Association said.
</P>
<P>
The government's policy of distributing quotas for setting up
garment factories is much blamed for the slump, the association
said, adding that many factories receiving quotas are doing other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on management of garment factories Sunday,
Nepali Commerce Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani said that the
government is committed to tackling the problems facing the
garment industry.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's garment industry imports raw materials from India,
China, Indonesia and Pakistan and exports ready-made garments to
the United States, Germany, France and England.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Argentina Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Influenced by the current
financial turmoil in Asia, foreign investors in Argentina are
withdrawing their investment in finance and securities, leading to
a sharp drop of foreign investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the National Securities Commission showed
foreign investment in securities market dropped by 15 percent from
23.1 billion U.S. dollars in September to 17.1 billion dollars in
October.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of investment mainly took the form of massive
sell-off of Argentine public bonds and the shares of Argentine
companies.
</P>
<P>
Argentine economists said the turbulence in global stock
markets originated in Southeast Asia exerted less impact on
Argentina than the financial crisis in Mexico in 1994. However,
its long-term impact is expected to show up next year.

</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Horn briefed Klima about the referendum in
Hungary on its entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization

<P>
Hungary held the referendum on November 16 to decide if the

</P>
<P>
Klima, the Austrian chancellor, reaffirmed at a press

</P>
<P>
The Austrian government should first of all propose that
Austria join the military alliance if and when a unanimous
decision is made by the Social Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Then the Austrian National Council should adopt a resolution
calling for Austria's participation in the NATO.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Klima and Horn announced at the conference that the
prime ministers of Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic will
meet in Budapest in mid-December.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Launches Probe into Finance Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand has
launched a probe into a local finance firm, accusing its
executives of fraud and mismanagement, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Sunday, the Thai central bank said that
Mahatun Finance Co. was found to have extended loans from August
to October in a dishonest way.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has sacked three top executives of the firm,
which is one of the 33 finance firms currently still operating in
Thailand, and appointed two regulators and one outsider to
investigate its accounting books.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also ordered freezing the assets of the three
top executives for 180 days, while requesting the Police
Department to prohibit any executives of the firm from leaving
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Regulators were forced to take urgent action to correct the
company's financial position and prevent damage to the public
interest, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The move is the first action taken by the central bank using
its expanded power under the six financial reform decrees passed
last month, which authorize the central bank to sack directors and
executives of a company without calling a shareholders' meeting.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first action taken by the bank against the 33
finance firms that it announced healthy after suspending the
operation of 58 finance firms in June and August due to their
funds problems.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said that the firm's operation would continue
as normal and depositors and creditors would remain under the full
protection of the government.
</P>
<P>
Central bank officials said that the measure taken against the
firm was not due to the firm's finance position but the unethical
and illegal behavior of its top executives, who reportedly used
falsified documents to obtain loans from the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Mahatun Finance has a registered capital of merely 150 million
baht (3.75 million U.S. dollars). Thailand's Association of
Finance Companies said that the firm reported its net assets at
949.5 million baht (about 38 million dollars) in 1995.

He said murder is the most common crime committed by these
workers while the crimes involve both employers and illegal alien
workers.
</P>
<P>
Chidchai said that enforcing the law against local employers
should be the most efficient way of dealing with the issue.
</P>
<P>
Apart from facing a criminal suit, suspected employers will
also be liable to meet the expenses of returning such illegal
workers back home.
</P>
<P>
Chidchai said he will cooperate with border patrols and the
provincial police as well as the Central Investigation Bureau to
monitor the illegal entry of foreign workers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Buyers Prop Up Shanghai's House Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Houses designed for domestic
buyers are playing a major role in Shanghai's real estate
business, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The prices for Shanghai's houses are among the highest in
China, said Alex Wong, managing director of Shanghai Fortuneland
Property Consultants Co., Ltd..
</P>
<P>
But housing prices here are reasonably distributed, and buyers
have several alternatives.
</P>
<P>
Housing prices within the inner ring road could reach 6,700
yuan (about 807 U.S.dollars) per square meter and the figure is
as high as 10,000 yuan (about 1,200 U.S.dollars) per square meter
when it comes to the housing area near the city center.
</P>
<P>
In the suburbs, housing sells at 1,000 yuan (about 120
U.S. dollars) per square meter.
</P>
<P>
Wong pointed out that major purchasing hot spots continue to be
houses around the city center, and the prices of middle-price
housing around the inner ring road have seen a steady increase.
</P>
<P>
Wong said that during 1997 and 1998, 202,000 more square meters
of housing will go on sale.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that residential buildings in the Pudong area
have started to catch public attention, among which those in the
Changli area have shown rich potential for large profits and
investments.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Currency Devalued Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The exchange rate of the
Bangladeshi currency taka against the U.S. dollar has been
adjusted downwards by 0.45 taka or one percent with effect from
today, announced the Bangladesh Bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank rate of Bangladesh, the floor interest rate on which
it lends to the commercial banks, has been re-fixed at eight
percent from the current 7.5 percent, also effective today,
according to a separate announcement of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Bank's buying and selling rates for the
greenback with authorized dealer banks will now stand at 45.30 and
45.60 taka per dollar respectively, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh's currency was last devalued on October 24 with
buying rate of 44.85 taka and selling rate of 45.15 taka per
dollar. The spread between the buying and selling rates was fixed
at 0.30 taka from the earlier 0.20 taka.
</P>
<P>
The new buying-selling middle rate has been revised to 45.45
taka from the earlier 45.00 taka per dollar.
</P>
<P>
With the latest downward adjustment, the Bangladeshi currency
has been devalued for the 11th time in less than one and a half
years of the present government.
</P>
<P>
The new bank and exchange rates were announced at a time when
the country's foreign exchange reserves came down to an
"uncomfortable" low while the credit to the private sector was
growing over the target, local newspapers said today.
</P>
<P>
The inflation, which was almost static at a low level for a
long time, showed an alarming rise with the expansion of the
private sector credit, prompting the authorities to go for the
dual-strategy, newspapers added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President's Call to Restore Ailing Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Securities Analysts here hail
President Soeharto's instruction to state-owned companies to boost
their portfolio investment in order to help restore the ailing
stock market.
</P>
<P>
"It is really good news for investors. I think it will help
bring back the buying impetus," Vice President of Mashill Jaya
Securities Tjandra Kartika said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said although it will take several days for the state-owned
companies to comply with the president's instruction, the impact
of the order will be psychologically significant enough to renew
trading activities.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Soeharto instructed state-owned companies to
allocate at least one percent of their profits to buy shares on
the local stock market to help restore the weak trading
activities.
</P>
<P>
The president also instructed the monetary authorities to use
the 5 billion U.S. dollar standby loan from Singapore as
low-interest credits to improve the liquidity of big and medium
companies.
</P>
<P>
Tjandra said with a total profit of about 6 trillion rupiah
(1.7 billion dollars) last year, the country's state-owned
companies would have about 60 billion rupiah (18.75 million
dollars) to buy stocks.
</P>
<P>
"Such an amount is still small compared to the current market
capitalization of around 150 trillion rupiah (46.875 billion
dollars)," local press quoted Tjandra as saying.
</P>
<P>
There are 178 state-owned companies operating in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) composite index
declined by almost 45 percent from its peak of 740 points on July
7 to 391.25 points last Friday. At least 70 Shares declined below
their par value of 500 rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The composite index broke the psychological barrier of
400-point level last week on a combination of regional weakness,
currency crisis and lack of confidence in the country's financial
and capital market.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said that without a bailout measure, the JSX
composite index could fall further to below the 350 level because
the market fundamentals remained very weak.

<HEADLINE> Slovak Foreign Minister Visits Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 23 (xinhua) -- Slovakia's Foreign Minister
Zdenka Kramplova arrived here Sunday for an official visit to
Bulgaria and said the two countries can cooperate more actively
and more fruitfully in the future.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry
Sunday evening, Kramplova said fine institutional conditions have
been created to promote two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Slovak Republic and Bulgaria traded 29.4 million
U.S. dollars' worth of goods, of which 19.7 million were Slovak
exports to, and 9.7 million were imports, from Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
However, she expressed her country's dissatisfaction at the
bilateral trade since the implementation of a free trade agreement
on January 1, 1996. The trade volume even dropped in
January-September 1997 compared with the same period a year ago,
she said.
</P>
<P>
"The Slovak Republic is interested in the entry of Slovak
companies into the Bulgarian market and is pleased to find that
Slovak companies are already starting to show some interest," she
said.
</P>
<P>
So far, 12 Bulgarian-Slovak joint ventures have been registered
in Slovakia and 10 in Bulgaria. She also argued in favour of a
reactivation of the joint economic commission.
</P>
<P>
On Monday Kramplova and her Bulgarian counterpart, Nadezhda
Mihailova, will meet to discuss questions concerning the two
countries' European and Euro-Atlantic integration and bilateral
relations.

<HEADLINE> Manila Agrees to Lower 1998 Growth Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
bowed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s judgment and
agreed to lower its economic growth targets for 1998, including a
revision of vital macroeconomic indicators.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine negotiating panel agreed to lower the expected
gross national product (GNP) growth to 5.0 to 5.3 percent from a
high of 6.0 to 6.5 percent target earlier presented to the IMF,
Manila Bulletin today quoted government sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government also agreed to raise the inflation rate and
interest rate targets for next year, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
From a relatively low scenarios of 6.0 percent, the average
inflation rate for the whole of 1998 now was pegged at a range of
6.5 to 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The average yield of the bellwether 91-day Treasury Bills
(T-bills) was moved up to a range of 13 to 15 percent from an
earlier assumption of 13.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government panel and an IMF review mission
earlier reached an impasse in their disagreement over the
country's economic growth figures for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines insisted that GNP growth for the next year
could hit 6.5 to 7.5 percent while the IMF said it should expect
only 4 to 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said this would be a more realistic target considering
the full effect of the continuing depreciation of regional
currencies would be felt only in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also found the government's projections of inflation
rate and interest rate in 1998 to be too low.
</P>
<P>
The IMF review mission left the country last Wednesday without
firming up the macroeconomic targets for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
The sources admitted that the revision was made to reflect the
continuing currency turmoil in the region and possible ill-effects
of the EL Nino phenomenon which is already causing a prolonged
drought in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the Philippines and the IMF still disagree on the
government's fiscal position and the macroeconomic projections for
1997, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar People Urged to Strengthen National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Senior General Than Shwe today
urged the Myanmar people to strength national spirit and
consolidate national unity for the realization of national
targets.
</P>
<P>
In his message on the occasion of the Myanmar National Day,
Than Shwe, chairman of the State Peace and Development Council
(SPDC), also called for uplifting of the national prestige and
integrity, preservation and safeguarding of the cultural heritage
and national characters and uplifting of dynamism of patriotic
spirit.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Nowadays, neo-colonialists are directly or indirectly
interfering in the internal affairs of sovereign nations through
various means on the pretext of advocating democracy and human
rights to help their lackeys seize power."
</P>
<P>
"The State Peace and Development Council, adopting
non-disintegration of the union, national solidarity and
perpetuation of sovereignty as national policy and laying down
political, economic and social objectives, is building a modern,
peaceful and prosperous state with added momentum," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Simultaneously, it is also firmly establishing national
reconsolidation which is essential in ensuring perpetuity of a new
nation where democracy flourishes based on law and discipline," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-seven years ago in 1920, Myanmar university students
launched an anti-colonialist movement, boycotting the Rangoon
University Act put into effect by the then British colonial
government which intended to prolong the colonial education
system. The movement led to Myanmar's independence in 1948.

<HEADLINE> Cabinet Reshuffle in Portugal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Portugal's Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres has in a major cabinet reshuffle appointed new
ministers for defense, the interior, economy and employment, the
Prime Minister's Office said today.
</P>
<P>
Jose Veiga Simao, 68, who once served as a minister in the
government of Marcello Caetano before 1974, became defense
minister.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Coelho, deputy minister at the Prime Minister's Office,
was appointed as interior minister to replace Alberto Costa, while
keeping his existing responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Solidarity and Social Security, Eduardo Ferro
Rodrigues, will combine his job with that of employment minister.
</P>
<P>
The Economy Ministry will be headed by a close Guterres aid
Joaquim Pina Moura, who replaces Augusto Mateus.
</P>
<P>
A communique of the Prime Minister's Office said the prime
minister created two new ministries -- Ministry of Parliamentary
Affairs and Ministry of Sports, Youth and Drug Abuse -- which will
be headed respectively by Antonio Costa and Jose Socrates.
</P>
<P>
As Guterres revoked the post of minister in the Prime
Minister's Office, Foreign Minister Jaime Gama has been lifted to
number two in the government.
</P>
<P>
The shake-up was triggered by the resignation of Defense
Minister Antonio Vitorino, who resigned Thursday amidst suspicions
that he had avoided paying some tax on a land deal several years
ago.
</P>
<P>
It is the first government reshuffle since the Socialist Party
came to power in October 1995.

BANGKOK, November 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 630 registered
companies in Bangkok with a total registered capital of 1.585
billion baht (41.7 million U.S. dollars), closed operation last

</P>
<P>
Out of the 638 companies closed, 101 were from the troubled

<P>
JINAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Early in the morning twilight,
58-year-old Li Changxue, a village official, leaves his home in
Badayu Village in east China's Shandong Province and hurries over to
the highway near the village to co-ordinate business at
the local fruit market.
</P>
<P>
Fruits traders from near and far come with their trucks and
wait for hours for buyers from the village in the Yimeng Mountains,
where 180 households used to depend heavily on farming.
</P>
<P>
Most of the villagers were poor because of water
shortages, and many went out to beg just to survive. Li himself
worked very hard, but could not feed his three children.
</P>
<P>
However, the reform and opening-up policy of China has changed
things. The government of Mengyin county, where Li lives,
restructured agriculture by encouraging farmers to plant fruit trees
on mountain slopes.
</P>
<P>
As a result, per capita income of the villagers is now 3,000
yuan and Li' family now earns over 30,000 yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
The change in Li's family epitomizes that in the Yimeng
Mountains, where 9.7 million people live.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income was below 150 yuan in Yimeng Mountain areas in
1984.

LONDON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Colin McRae of Britain took the
early lead after the opening 10 stages of the RAC Rally in
Cheltenham, England on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
His flu-stricken rival and points leader Tommi Makinen of
Finland was back in sixth after the first day and struggling to
stay there.
</P>
<P>
The Scot, who won the championship two years ago and needs to
make up 10 points on the Finn in the final race, finished the
first of three days racing with a 15-second lead over another
Finn, Juha Kankkunen. Another former world champion, Carlos Sainz
of Spain, was a further four seconds back.
</P>
<P>
Makinen, barely able to speak because of a heavy attack of flu,
was 32 seconds behind as the drivers returned to Cheltenham after
10 stages taking in auto racing circuits at Silverstone and
Donington Park. Although a sixth place finish would just be
enough to take the title he is already tired and could easily be
caught by the drivers behind.

NEW YORK, November 23 (Xinhua -- Jana Novotna of Czech Republic
won the season-ending Chase Championship by defeating Mary Pierce
of France 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, 6-3 here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With Sunday's victory, Novotna regained the No.2 ranking which
she lost to Lindsay Davenport of the United States after the
Advanta tour last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pierce, who was named the WTA Tour Comeback Player of the Year,
opened the match with blistering groundstrokes to beat Novotna to
the net as she did when she shocked top-seeded Martina Hingis in
the quarterfinals. She took in charge through the first 12 games.
</P>
<P>
But Novotna served brilliantly during the entire match, served
into Pierce's body to stave off the first break point, then she
set the tune in the rest of the match.
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, Novotna also teamed with Lindsay Davenport to
win the doubles title, defeating France's Alexandra Fusai and
Nathalie Tauziat 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 6-2.

<HEADLINE> Survey Reveals Urban Preferences for Entertainment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A recent poll shows that
China's urban dwellers spend most of their spare time on
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
About 46.9 percent of those surveyed chose "seeing films" as
their favorite entertainment activity. while 34.4 percent liked
"watching TV."
</P>
<P>
Beijing's Horizon Research Group organized the survey of 1,500
urban residents between 18 and 60 in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou,
Chongqing and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Reading, listening to cassettes, watching VCDs, playing
karaoke, listening to radio broadcasts and dancing also were
listed as favorite activities, the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
However, people's interests varied by city. Beijing and
Chongqing residents liked watching TV best, but showed less
interest in going to the cinema; Guangzhou residents loved seeing
films and going to amusement parks, but were less enthusiastic
about reading and listening to music; Shanghai residents favored
listening to the radio, going to theaters and playing computer
games.
</P>
<P>
Besides entertainment, a growing number of urban residents
listed physical-fitness exercise as a favorite spare-time
activity. Half chose walking and others listed badminton, table
tennis, basketball and football, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Overwhelming Majority of the ordinary residents did not list
golf or bowling because of their relatively high cost.

VANCOUVER, Canada, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met here today with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, their seventh meeting in a
year.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian said Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
state visit to the U.S. last month was very successful as both
sides agreed to establish a constructive strategic partnership for
the 21st century, Chinese diplomatic sources told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The achievement is not only in the interests of a long-term,
stable and healthy development of Sino-U.S. relations, but also
conducive to world peace and stability, Qian was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Albright told Qian that Jiang's visit is very successful since
it established a framework and set a target for the U.S.-China
relations, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton is expecting to meet Jiang again,
Albright told Qian, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his hope that the two sides will implement the
agreements reached between the two sides during Jiang's visit to
strengthen bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also discussed China's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO). They said they hope their
countries will conclude negotiations on the issue as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they promised to expand cooperation in all areas,
including regional and international affairs, in accordance with
the common views Jiang and Clinton shared during their meeting.
</P>
<P>
The four-party talks on the Korean Peninsula, issues about
Iraq, and Climate Change Treaty negotiations were also discussed,
the Chinese sources said, with giving further details.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Guangzhou Municipal
Government will switch its attention to its "comfort housing"
project in 1998 to provide shelter to those with scarce living
space, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The city has provided about 39,000 flats to the 26,000 families
whose living space is less than five square meters per person and
those who earn less than the city's average annual income of
13,634 yuan (about 1,642 U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, more than 80 percent of them prefer buying flats in
the "comfort housing" project, so the government has decided to
start the project early next year, said Jin Yiguo, assistant
director of the city's property administration bureau.
</P>
<P>
In the next three years, the city will raise about 1.8 billion
yuan (about 216.87 million U.S.dollars) each year to construct
several blocks consisting of multi-storeys or high-rises, with the
floor space of each condominium ranging from 50 to 75 square
meters, he said.
</P>
<P>
The project will cover 3.72 million square meters, 20 percent
of the building space of 18.6 million square meters to be erected
as part of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The prices of the multi-storey building will be between 1,900
yuan (about 228.9 U.S.dollars) and 2,200 yuan (about 265.1
U.S.dollars) per square meter, while the prices of the high-rise
buildings will range from 2,800 yuan (about 337.30 U.S.dollars) to
3,100 yuan (about 373.5 U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the residential buildings in the project will
be directly sold, 10 percent of them through bank mortgages and
the remaining 10 percent will be set aside for rent.

<HEADLINE> WTA Tour to Make Changes for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 23 (Xinhua) -- WTA Tour CEO Anne Person
Worcester said on Sunday that the 1998 women's tennis tour will
add six more tournaments, increase prize money and try to head off
a pleyrs coup launched earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Worcester, who decided not to renew her contract with the WTA
Tour to spend more time with her family, said the tour does not
recognize a recent attempt by a number of mid-ranked players to
take over the WTA Player Association.
</P>
<P>
Tour players Linda Harvey Wild of the United States, Karin
Kschwendt of Luxembourg and Patricia Hy Boulais of Canada
spearheaded a revolt at the Chicago tournament earlier this month
aimed at improving the stature of rank-and-file players.
</P>
<P>
The WTA Tour has received a temporary restraining court order
against the move, in which three members were removed from the
player association's executive board and replaced by associates
sympathetic to mid-ranked players' objectives.
</P>
<P>
For 1998, the women's tour will have six new lower level, Tier
III and Tier IV events. These tournaments will take place in
Bogota; Makarska, Croatia; Istanbul; Boston, Seoul and Bali,
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The new Croatian tournament is a doubles only event.
</P>
<P>
Tour prize money will increase from slightly over 38 million
U.S. dollars this year to over 40 million U.S. dollars in 1998.
The four Grand Slams, the Chase Championships and Tier I events in
Moscow, Key Biscayne and Indian Wells will offer in excess of one
million U.S. dollars in prize money for the women.
</P>
<P>
After an extensive search for Worcester's replacement failed to
find a likely candidate for the CEO position, the WTA Tour's Board
of Directors have agreed to change the approval procedure for the
position.
</P>
<P>
Instead of a unanimous 10-0 board vote, only seven votes of
approval are needed to appoint a new CEO.
</P>
<P>
If a new CEO is not found by January 1, Bausch &AMP; Lomb
Tournament Director Bob Arrix will temporarily manage the tour's
day-to-day operation.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The port city of
Qinhuangdao, a popular spot for visitors to northern China's Hebei
Province, is striving to create a sound environment for developing
tourism.
</P>
<P>
The city has established bird sanctuaries, coastal protection
zones, a wild animal zoo and forest reserves in its coastal and
northern mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
The city launched "Afforestation Year" in 1996 and, so far,
more than 100 million yuan (12.5 million U.S. dollars) has been
spent to plant more than 600,000 trees. Per capita grassland
occupation stands at 5.73 square meters and the grassland coverage
rate is 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to improve the natural environment have paid off,
officials say. Beidaihe, a well-known summer resort, has become a
haven for birds. A total of 405 species of birds, or one-third of
the country's total, have been found in this region.
</P>
<P>
To wipe out pollution, Qinhuangdao has focused its attention on
developing environmentally friendly industries and harnessing
polluting enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Improvements in the environment has facilitated the development
of the tourism industry and opened the province wider to the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
During the January-August period, domestic and overseas
visitors exceeded six million, with an economic returns of more
than two billion yuan (250 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Up to date, the city has approved 848 overseas-funded
enterprises, with 1.88 billion U.S. dollars in contracted overseas
funding. More than 230 overseas-funded firms, now in operation,
have produced 37 percent of the city's total industrial output
value.
</P>
<P>
The city's gross domestic product reached 20.12 billion yuan
(2.5 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996, 3.3 times that of 10 years
ago.

enforcement to cope with the city's worsening environmental
situation.
</P>
<P>
"The general environmental quality of the city has leveled
off," said Shen Yonglin, an official with the city's
Environmental Protection Bureau. "Some parts of the city and some
environmental indicators have shown signs of improvement."
</P>
<P>
"As a 100-year-old industrial city and a city experiencing a
period of booming construction, Shanghai is facing a serious
challenge to protect its environment," Shen said.

As many as 21 regional regulations and laws concerning
enviromental protection have been worked out in the past five
years. Six billion yuan (400 million U.S. dollars) has been
allocated to reduce pollutants and move polluting factories. A
total of 850 polluting factories have been moved from downtown
Shanghai or forced to suspend operation.
</P>

The first phase of a waste water treatment project for the
Suzhou River has been put into operation at a cost of 1.6 billion
yuan. The second phase of the project is now under construction.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the diversion work for the Huangpu River is
expected to improve the city's drinking water quality. Estimated
cost of the project is 2.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the second phase of the Pudong Gashouse,
the Shidongkou Gashouse, and the Shanghai Coking Plant, more than
90 percent of the city's residents have access to natural gas.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Tongyi (Unified) Sugar
Manufacturing Co. Ltd of Nanning, capital of south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, has started to net profits 13 months after
its estalishment in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Nanning had six state-owned sugar refineries, four
of which had losses in 1995. So the city government combined
the six into the Nanning Tongyi. By the end of August
this year, it had net a profit of 2.33 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The new company presses 20,000 tons of sugarcane a day and
produces 200,000 tons of sugar a year, making it China's biggest
sugar maker. It still had 7.62 million yuan in losses in 1996
because of management and market problems.
</P>
<P>
To halt this trend, the company improved controls on technical
development and equipment to reduce expenditures, and on
marketing, and had a management shake-up in the six factories.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the company got an average of 4,130 yuan per ton
of sugar this year, 120 yuan more than last year. By mid-August,
12,000 tons of stockpiled sugar had been sold.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The latest archeological
findings suggest that the human history of Tianjin, the largest
coastal city in northern China, date back 7,000 years ago, a
millennium earlier than previously believed.
</P>
<P>
In March, a farmer found remnants of earthenware in Jixian
County in the northern region of Tianjin, drawing attention from
local governments.
</P>
<P>
Pottery, boneware and stoneware were unearthed at the 3,000
Square meter site. Archeologists said their findings include
household implements, tools of production and ancient religious
instruments which are from the early Neolithic age.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Wengang, an archeologist participating in the excavation
at the site, said the findings are different from either the
Yangshao culture of central China or the Hongshan culture of
northern China.
</P>
<P>
The new findings are of great value to the study of the history
of the city and northern China, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the city's cultural relics department has taken
measures to protect the site. The study of the relics is still
under way.

<HEADLINE> Baby Whales Returned to Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Five baby whales, who
apparently became lost in the tide and mistakenly swam to the
shore, have been returned to the sea with the help of an aquatic
products department and fishermen in Taizhou, eastern China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based "China Oceanic News" reported that the whales
were caught by local fishermen when they were stranded on the
shore. Each of them weighed 40-50 kilograms with a sea-blue back
and a circular spouting hole on the head.
</P>
<P>
The whales, about 1.2 meters long, reportedly made crying
sounds. Experts believed that they were newborn whales.
</P>
<P>
The Taizhou aquatic products bureau brought the five whales
into deep ditches on the shore, and kept them alive for several
days. After the baby whales recovered sufficiently, they were
returned to the sea.

<HEADLINE> Defense Industry Conversion Attracts Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Southeastern China's defense
industry has absorbed about 300 million U.S. dollars of foreign
funds for 90 joint ventures in their conversion from military to
civilian production.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that foreign investors in this
mountainous region mainly come from Japan, Germany, the United
States, Britain and the Republic of Korea. The joint ventures are
engaged in such fields as car parts, motorbike components,
aircraft parts, household electrical appliances, chemicals,
electronics, textiles and food.
</P>
<P>
One of the largest projects is Chang'an Suzuki Automobile Ltd.,
which was jointly established by the Suzuki Co. Ltd. from Japan
and two Chongqing military enterprises. Suzuki invested 85 million
U.S. dollars in the venture.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Peikun, an official from the State Planning Commission
said that China's military industry in the southwestern region
started producing products for civilian use in the early 1980s,
"pulling off its mysterious veil."
</P>
<P>
The central government encouraged the shift from military to
civilian production by allowing them to move out of valleys and
into cities or near railways so that their products would be more
accessible to the market, he said.

PARIS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The French Socialists today
ended their congress in the western port city of Brest with an
emphasis on the success scored by the Socialist Party under Lionel
Jospin in the legislative elections this year and the government
it established.
</P>
<P>
This is the first congress held by the Socialists since the
death of Francois Mitterrand in January 1996 and under Jospin.
</P>
<P>
The number two of the Socialist Party, Francois Hollande, said
that the congress is one of "pride" and "coherence" between the
political slogans of yesterday and today.
</P>
<P>
He praised Jospin for making the Socialist Party one of
"victory, rally and pride" which has overcome the inner fighting
it once experienced.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said in his closing speech that he himself is proud of
the course he has trailed through and the action he has taken, but
said that he remains cool.
</P>
<P>
The national secretary of the French Communist Party, Robert
Hue, whose party has been given three government seats by Jospin
in exchange for its support, also went to the congress to
congratulate, the first such gesture by the Communist leader in
history.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Meets with Iraqi Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan met
today with visiting Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz at the
Royal Palace to discuss Iraqi standoff with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's official news agency Petra reported that in the
90-minute meeting, the king stressed the need "to take all
necessary steps that will ensure the speedy lifting of sanctions
and the suffering of the brotherly Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
The meeting came as U.N. arms inspectors returned to Baghdad
and resumed their regular work after Russia promised Iraq to seek
a rapid lifting of the seven-year-old U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. arms inspectors working with the United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM) on dismantling Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction resumed their normal work in Iraq from Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This followed the diplomatic solution to a three-week standoff
between the U.N. and Iraq, which expelled U.S. inspectors in order
to draw world attention to its demand for the lifting of the
crippling U.N.sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The teams returned to Iraq Friday after Baghdad had officially
told the U.N. Security Council its agreement to the resumption of
the work of UNSCOM with all its members, including the Americans,
taking part.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aziz, who arrived here Saturday, called for
all the Arab countries to resume flights to Iraq as soon as
possible, as a way to help Baghdad defuse the influence of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Iraq urged the resumption of Arab airlines to Iraq as there was
not a decision from the United Nations yet forbidding such
flights, Aziz told a group of Jordanian politicians and media
officials.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Ready to Resume Navigation to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Minister of
Transport Al Binu Akul Akul said here today that navigation will
be resumed between Sudan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Akul made the remarks when speaking to reporters before leaving
for Cairo to participate in the African Transport Ministers
Conference due to be held on November 24-27.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries had formed a joint committee to
examine the obstacles obstructing navigation between them. He said
the committee would hold its first meeting in the first week of
December.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not give the date of the resumption of the
navigation.
</P>
<P>
River navigation along the Nile river between Wadi Halfa in
northern Sudan and the Aswan port in south Egypt is the only means
of water transport linking the two neighboring states. It was
suspended in 1992 due to the deterioration of relations between
the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi FM Welcomes Proposal on Debating UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed al-Sahhaf said today that his country welcomes a
proposal put forward by Kenya on the re-opening of a debate on
the U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference here this evening, Sahhaf also
welcomed suggestions put forward before the Security Council on
replacing the American U2 spy plane with another one from a
different country and a French proposal regarding options for
alternating reconnaissance planes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he revealed that the understanding reached between
Iraq and the U.N. stipulated that U.N. arms inspection teams
avoid getting close to locations considered as part and parcel of
Iraq's national sovereignty and security.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there were no banned weapons in Iraq and the
action of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraqi weapons of mass destruction from 1993 until now
was mere "procrastination" in blocking the lifting of the
sanctions imposed on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions can not be lifted unless the weapons inspection
teams verify that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. arms inspection teams have resumed their work in Iraq
after a Russian-brokered compromise eased the confrontation
between Iraq and the U.N. triggered by Iraqi expulsion of six
Americans in the UNSCOM.
