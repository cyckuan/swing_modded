<HEADLINE> Egypt's Labor Party Leader Freed After Four-Day Questioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian state security
prosecutors on Saturday released the leader of the country's sole
Islamic-oriented opposition Labor Party who was being questioned
over the party's links with the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Shukri, 84, was freed after being held and questioned
since last Wednesday, the official Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
MENA initially said that he will be questioned again next
Tuesday but said later that he would not have to return for more
questioning.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have accused the Labor Party of having links with
Brotherhood fundamentalists, cooperating with Islamic extremists,
receiving unauthorized funds and adding a religious character to
its program in opposition to national unity.
</P>
<P>
The government's Parties Affairs Committee suspended the Labor
Party in May citing an internal power struggle, and later urged
courts to dissolve the party completely.
</P>
<P>
The party started out as a socialist-oriented movement when it
was founded in 1979, but allied itself with the Muslim Brotherhood
for the 1987 parliamentary elections and formally adopted an
Islamic line at its general congress in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Court Lifts Ban on Opposition Al-Shaab Bi-Weekly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court on Saturday
lifted a ban on the publication of Al-Shaab newspaper, the
mouthpiece of the opposition Labor Party which is also under a
suspension.
</P>
<P>
The Higher Administrative Court turned down a government appeal
against a lower court ruling that the suspension ordered by the
Parties Affairs Committee on the paper be lifted, the official
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Parties Affairs Committee, a government body overseeing
activities of political parties, ordered in May a suspension of Al-
Shaab and also the country's sole Islamic-oriented party on charges
of instigating riots and internal power struggle.
</P>
<P>
However, a lower administrative court lifted the suspension on
September 9 on the bi-weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The party appealed simultaneously against the suspension on its
activities. But the lower court said it was not within its
jurisdiction to rule on the committee's decree of the same date to
dissolve Labor.
</P>
<P>
Under Egyptian laws, only the parties court is authorized to
decide whether a political party should be dissolved.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper published an article in May saying a book by a
Syrian writer insulted Islam. The article sparked riots in which
religious university students clashed with police in Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Presidents of Egypt, France Discuss Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
discussed the Middle East peace process on Saturday with his French
counterpart Jacques Chirac, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation initiated by Chirac, the two leaders
reviewed the situation in the Middle East in light of the
deadlocked Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Chirac also exchanged views on possible new ideas
for resolving the thorny issues in the negotiations, including
Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees and final borders, it added.
</P>
<P>
Little progress has been made in the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations over the question of Jerusalem and the Islamic holy
sites there since the Camp David summit ended in July without
results.
</P>
<P>
Egypt supports the Palestinians' stand demanding East Jerusalem,
seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, be the capital of their
future independent state. France desires to play an active role in
mediating the Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Warns Anti-govt Refugees From Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
government warned those refugees from the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) sheltered in Tanzania to stop conducting
subversive activities against their government, otherwise they
will be stripped of the refugee status.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation
Jakaya Kikwete told a press conference here Saturday that the
recent act by a group of Congolese to form a political alliance
against the Kinshasa government was contrary to Tanzania's laws
governing the status of refugees.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania officially recognizes Laurent Kabila as a bona fide
President of the DRC, therefore, the government does not support
Congolese who want to use their stay in this country to conduct
subversive activities against a friendly government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete made these remarks in response to an announcement made
by the self styled leaders of Congolese Liberation Party (PLC) and
the Party for National Independence and Democracy (PANIDEC) at a
press conference here on August 31.
</P>
<P>
The leaders claimed that they have united to form the Union of
Forces for Liberation and Democracy (UFLD) in a bid to oust from
the DRC all foreign forces and ultimately remove President Kabila
from power.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said that all the Congolese should conduct their
activities within the framework of the 1999 Lusaka agreement which
provides for all Congolese to participate in the negotiations on
the country's political system.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, there are some 100,
000 DRC refugees sheltered in western Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Agrees to Hold Regular Meeting With Advisers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has approved a monthly meeting with his advisers to widen
the spectrum of the government's policy-making, reported the News
Agency of Nigeria on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted authoritative government source as saying
that the proposed meeting, expected to be chaired by Obasanjo,
will be part of the president's efforts to involve a wider
spectrum for top government functionaries in decision making and
policy formulation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be along with the lines of the current weekly
session of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) to broaden the
bases for inputs into policy formulation by the government, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Recommendations and policy inputs put forward at the meeting
are to be discussed at the FEC session before a final decision
will be taken, it added.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo has been widely criticized by the media that he should
seek opinions of his more-than-enough advisers before taking any
decisions about the government issues.

<HEADLINE> Over 10,000 Iraqi Children, Elderly Die Under Sanctions Last Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of 10,267 children and
elderly people died last month as a direct result of the decade-old
United Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq, a report released by the
Iraqi Health Ministry said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 7,436 children under the age of five died
of diarrhea, pneumonia, respiratory infections and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
As to the elderly people, 2,831 died of heart disease,
hypertension and malignant neoplasms.
</P>
<P>
Such a high mortality rate, due to malnutrition and medicine
shortage caused by the sanctions, was in sharp contrast with the
same month in 1989, when some 302 children and 480 elderly people
died.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the beginning of the sanctions in August 1990 till
the end of last month, the mortality of the Iraqi people has
reached 1.34 million, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly called on the U.N. to lift the sanctions,
imposed after its invasion of Kuwait, claiming that the sanctions
have caused a humanitarian tragedy in the country.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. oil-for-food accord allows Iraq to import food, medicine
and other humanitarian supplies to alleviate the impact of the
sanctions, but Iraq says the program can not meet the needs of the
Iraqi people and demands the U.N. to totally lift the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Road Accident Kills 5, Injures 10 in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A road accident in Iran's
southwestern province of Khuzestan on Saturday left five people
dead and 10 others injured, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy happened when a bus carrying passengers collided
with a truck on the road linking provincial capital Ahvaz and the
city of Andimeshk, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Local traffic officials blamed the accident on the truck driver,
who suddenly swerved the truck to the left.
</P>
<P>
Road accidents have been on the rise in Iran. A recent survey
conducted in this regard revealed that some 200,000 accidents take
place on Iranian highways each year resulting in the death of 15,
000 people.
</P>
<P>
Traffic experts believe that narrow roads, heavy traffic and
non-observation of traffic rules by drivers are the main reasons
for deadly accidents.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's Coast Guards on
Saturday intercepted a Malaysia-flagged tanker loaded with Iraqi
oil, the Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The 1,500-ton ship was held after it appeared within the Kuwaiti
territorial waters early Saturday morning, the ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
It said 13 sailors including five Indians and eight Iraqis were
aboard the tanker. But the statement didn't mention how much oil
the tanker was carrying.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is still under an international embargo imposed after it
invaded Kuwait in 1990. Bagdad needs to comply with all relevant
United Nations resolutions in exchange for a lift of the 10-year-
old sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In July the Kuwaiti Coast Guards intercepted three boats coming
from a southern Iraqi port on their way to Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Appeals for More Relief Assistance to Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United Nations'
special envoy Catherine Bertini has reiterated her call for more
relief assistance to the Horn of Africa which has been in crisis
resulted from successive years of drought disaster.
</P>
<P>
Bertini, also executive director of the World Food Program,
said here Friday that although famine has been averted in the Horn
of Africa, the drought crisis still persists in the region.
</P>
<P>
She said that 207 million U.S. dollars of relief has been
raised for Ethiopia and Kenya and other countries in the drought-
stricken region, but that sum is only 54 percent of what has been
requested for.
</P>
<P>
There is still the need for additional support for the victims
of the drought in the region, Bertini stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Ethiopia, the U.N. senior official said thanks to
the international emergency aid, the level of malnutrition and
mortality rate in areas like Gode in the Somali National Regional
State, has been lowered remarkably compared with early this year.
</P>
<P>
Gode, about 600 kilometers southeast of Addis Ababa, is
believed to be one of the hardest hit areas in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
However, she noted that in addition to food aid, people in the
drought-affected areas also need other assistance such as shelter,
special food for infants, water supply, sanitation and medical
care.
</P>
<P>
According to Bertini, the total need of food and non-food
assistance required for Ethiopia is 190 million U.S. dollars, of
which 49 percent has been made available, and the rest are yet to
be raised.

<HEADLINE> 16 Districts in S. Africa Defined as Foot-and-mouth Disease Control Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen magisterial
districts in KwaZulu-Natal of South Africa have been declared as
foot-and-mouth disease control areas, where animals may not be
moved without permits.
</P>
<P>
These areas are Camperdown, Chatsworth, Durban, Iananda,
Kranskop, Lions River, Lower Tugela, Mpumalanga, Ndwedwe, New
Hanover, Pietermaritzburg, Pinetown, Richmond, Umbumbulu, Umlazi
and Umvoti, according to a statement issued by the Foot-and-mouth
Disease Control Center on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Exports of affected animals and their products are banned in
the control areas, and these animals are not allowed to move
unless they are examined by a state veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
The objective of adopting the control measure is to ensure that
the disease does not spread widely.
</P>
<P>
Last week, foot-and-mouth disease was diagnosed on a pig farm
in Camperdown, prompting officials to put down about 700 pigs and
put in place a total prohibition on the movement of livestock in
the 10 kilometers zone.
</P>
<P>
"We are fairly sure that the disease had been localized in the
10 kilometers quarantine zone around the affected farms,"
provincial deputy director of veterinary and public health Mark
Warren said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, local officials continued to test livestock in the
area for traces of foot-and-mouth disease. Warren said about 120
farms had been screened by Saturday morning. The results show
that about seven or eight farms are still outstanding.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of the disease threatens the country's meat
industry. Singapore, Mauritius and Namibia have already banned
livestock and animal products from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
This has been the first outbreak of such kind of disease in
South Africa since 1957.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Sets Tree Planting Day to Avert Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has assented to January 1 as the National Tree
Planting Day in order to encourage more people to protect
environment and avert the growing threat of desertification.
</P>
<P>
Media Saturday quoted Minister for Natural Resources and
Tourism Zakia Meghji as saying that Tanzanians should cultivate a
tree planting culture as a commitment to biodiversity conservation
and combating desertification.
</P>
<P>
She said that the looming threat of desertification is a result
of increasing population (from 9 million in 1961 to the present
some 33 million) which is translated into increased food demand.
</P>
<P>
"This demand leads to more land for agriculture hence
encroachment of forests," she said, adding: "Harvesting of trees
for fuelwood, charcoal and building poles are some of the factors
contributing to deforestation."
</P>
<P>
The minister said that about 91 percent of energy in the
country come from fuelwood and charcoal and a total of 65,000
hectares are burnt every year throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure effective participation of the public on the
Tree Planting Day, Meghji said her ministry will join other
ministries, various national and international institutions, and
regional and district leaders in preparing action programs.

<HEADLINE> African Children Face Various Kind of Threats: Zimbabwean President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Saturday said the survival of children in Africa was
threatened by civil strife, poverty, devastating diseases,
unstable political, economic and family environments.
</P>
<P>
Children were significantly affected by all the policies,
programs and practices of their communities, governments and the
international world, Mugabe said when speaking at the
commemoration of the African Child Day with Child Sexual Abuse as
its theme this year.
</P>
<P>
The African Child Day was declared in a resolution of the
Organization of African Unity in 1990 with a view to urging
African nations to pay greater attention to issues related to
children.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said his government was deeply concerned about the
numerously reported cases of child sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, a total of 11,085 reported cases of
child sexual abuse occurred from 1993 to 1996 in Zimbabwe. Last
year, about 6,000 cases of rape and statutory rape cases were
reported countrywide.
</P>
<P>
Noting that child sexual abuse was a social problem, Mugabe
urged people to make concerted efforts to solve this problem.
</P>
<P>
To commemorate the African Child Day, Zimbabwe's children
staged a children's parliament resembling the actual parliament
with a speaker and 150 members. Debates by the "parliament" were
centered on the need to severely punish perpetrators of sexual
crimes against children.
</P>
<P>
Several cabinet ministers and Members of Parliament of the
ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front attended
the event.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkey-U.S. Ties Clouded by "Armenian Genocide" Bill By Xing Guoxin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Relations between Turkey and
its ally the United States have been marred after a U.S. Congress
subcommittee approved a bill recognizing the 1915 killings of
Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as genocide.
</P>
<P>
Turkish leaders, including President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit and political party leaders and lawmakers,
condemned the passage of bill as "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Late on Thursday, the "Armenian Genocide" bill was passed by the
U.S. House International Relations Subcommittee on International
Organizations and Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
It urges the U.S. administration to educate its executive branch
employees, especially those dealing with human rights, on the
Armenian genocide, calling on the U.S. president to refer to the
genocide in an annual April 24 message to commemorate the deaths.
</P>
<P>
Armenia claimed that tens of thousands of Armenians were
massacred by Turks in April, 1915 and has been campaigning for an
international condemnation against Ankara regarding the alleged
atrocity.
</P>
<P>
Turkey denied the so-called "Armenian Genocide," arguing that
the number of alleged genocide victims exceeds that of the total
Armenian population at that time.
</P>
<P>
Turkish politicians expressed their anger and urged U.S.
President Bill Clinton to exert more efforts to dissuade
congressmen from supporting the bill, which now goes to the full
House International Relations Committee for a vote to be held next
week.
</P>
<P>
At Friday's press conference, Turkish presidential spokesman
Metin Yalman said President Sezer has called on the U.S.
administration to make more efforts to prevent the bill from
advancing any further in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
"President Sezer reiterated that the passage of the bill would
lead to damage to Turco-American relations almost beyond repair,"
Yalman said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Ecevit said "Turkey is doing its best to
promote peace in the Caucasus. Taking a position in favor of the
Armenian resolution is an extremely ugly and saddening event."
</P>
<P>
He warned that the passage would harm Turco-American relations,
hoping that the U.S. administration will take initiatives "to show
the House the right path."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S administration, which is also uneasy about
the bill, has been struggling to block the bill's passage. Clinton
has asked his National Security Adviser Sandy Berger to convince
the House members not to support the bill, Turkey's Anatolia News
reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration fears that if the bill is approved in
the Congress, vital American interests in the region will be
endangered.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Turkey has threatened to shut down its
Incirlik air base which American and British warplanes use to
enforce a no-fly zone over northern Iraq, or recall a 4 billion U.
S. dollars attack helicopter tender, which was preliminarily
awarded to the U.S. Bell company.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Friday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry
said the bill would harm the close ties between the two North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies and dim the prospect of
improving Turco-Armenian relations.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has not given its diplomatic recognition to Armenia, its
Christian Caucasus neighbor, since the country's independence
following the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Ankara imposes an economic blockade on Armenia because of the
latter's dispute with its neighboring Turkic-speaking Azerbaijan
over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabach.
</P>
<P>
Ankara said the establishment of diplomatic relations with
Yerevan will be conditioned upon the country's end of its "
occupation of Azeri territories" as well as abandoning its anti-
Ankara attempts by pressing for the Armenian genocide bill in the
world.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Developed Nations to Be More Responsible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 23 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank chief
encouraged developed countries to focus on environmental
protection for the sake of sustainable economic development
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 64th meeting of the G-24 ministers, Dai
Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, said although
economic globalization is a general trend, developing countries
have not been able to benefit. He noted how the south-north gap
is widening.
</P>
<P>
Dai said there has been a decline in resource transfers from
developed countries to developing countries despite the end of
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said developed countries only promote the free flow of trade
when it is in their favor.
</P>
<P>
Protectionism and unrealistic trade terms enacted by developed
nations have severely hindered economic improvement in developing
nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Dai warned that the lopsided pattern of economic development in
the United States, Japan and the euro zone has led to
extraordinary volatility in exchange rates and capital flows, and
thus has brought about extreme uncertainties in the functioning of
the world economy.
</P>
<P>
"Sustainable world economic development will never be realized
unless these problems are solved," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Dai noted that since a fair and equitable international
economic order is essential to the sound development of the global
economy, developing countries should strive for their due say in
international economic affairs and their legitimate rights. Their
interests and positions should be respected. He urged the G-24 to
play a more important role in this respect.
</P>
<P>
"Under the influence of new shareholders and NGOs with
political backing, the World Bank has become more politicized in
recent years; this is not consistent with its Charter or the
interests of developing countries," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the World Bank will strictly abide
by its Charter and serve developing countries, and that its
policies will not run counter to the fundamental interests of
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Developed Nations to Be More Responsible EDS-Retransmission with correction of lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 23 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank chief
encouraged developed countries to take measures to create a better
environment for sustainable global economic development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 64th meeting of the G-24 ministers, Dai
Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, said although
economic globalization is a general trend, developing countries
have not been able to benefit. He noted how the south-north gap
is widening.
</P>
<P>
Dai said there has been a decline in resource transfers from
developed countries to developing countries despite the end of
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said developed countries only promote the free flow of trade
when it is in their favor.
</P>
<P>
Protectionism and unrealistic trade terms enacted by developed
nations have severely hindered economic improvement in developing
nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Dai warned that the lopsided pattern of economic development in
the United States, Japan and the euro zone has led to
extraordinary volatility in exchange rates and capital flows, and
thus has brought about extreme uncertainties in the functioning of
the world economy.
</P>
<P>
"Sustainable world economic development will never be realized
unless these problems are solved," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Dai noted that since a fair and equitable international
economic order is essential to the sound development of the global
economy, developing countries should strive for their due say in
international economic affairs and their legitimate rights. Their
interests and positions should be respected. He urged the G-24 to
play a more important role in this respect.
</P>
<P>
"Under the influence of new shareholders and NGOs with
political backing, the World Bank has become more politicized in
recent years; this is not consistent with its Charter or the
interests of developing countries," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the World Bank will strictly abide
by its Charter and serve developing countries, and that its
policies will not run counter to the fundamental interests of
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Three More Abu Sayyaf Rebels Killed, Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Three more Abu Sayyaf rebels
were killed Saturday in the southern Philippines, bringing to 98
the number of the rebels killed since the launching of the
military operations against the rebel group a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The three Abu Sayyaf rebels were killed in an encounter with
government troops in the town of Talipao in Jolo island, Sulu
province, Saturday morning, the ABS-CBN TV station reported,
quoting Arme Forces spokesman Brig. Gen. Generoso Senga.
</P>
<P>
Senga also said Saturday afternoon at a press conference at the
Southern Command of the Armed Forces in the city of Zamboanga that
one of the Abu Sayyaf leaders, Commander Sahiron Radulan, was
seriously wounded in an encounter in Talipao on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
One army soldier was killed during Friday's heavy fighting
while a radio communication technician was missing, he said,
adding that the Abu Sayyaf suffered an undetermined number of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
So far, three government soldiers have been killed and six
others wounded since the military launched attacks against the Abu
Sayyaf rebels last Saturday to rescue the 19 hostages held by them.
</P>
<P>
Two French journalists were recovered Wednesday by the military,
which is continuing to pursue the rebels, who are still holding
one American, three Malaysians and 13 Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Senga said the overall operation has been slowed down by the
military's concern for the safe rescue of the hostages, and this
is indicated by the letup in the air assault on suspected rebel
lairs.
</P>
<P>
He said any air bombings now are done only to support ground
troop movements.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government Calls on Opposition Party MDC To Stop Playing political Games  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a statement released here to the press on Friday, Moyo said,
"The lawful investigations, which have already yielded compelling
evidence, have reached an advanced stage."
</P>
<P>
"Further evidence has been uncovered and new leads are being
pursued to determine, among other things, who threw the grenade,
at whom and for what reasons," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said some suspects were assisting the police with
investigations and the expectation was that the matter should come
before the courts in the very near future.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the seriousness of the crime and the need to leave
no stone unturned, the government calls on law abiding citizens
and other observers to refrain from interfering with lawful police
investigation," he said in reference to statements by the MDC on
the bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
The blast rocked the MDC Headquarters in Harare last week. In
the blast no-one was injured.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Home Affairs Minister John Nkomo told Parliament
that the bombing of the MDC Headquarters was an" inside job."
</P>
<P>
He said police had found consignments of arms comprising
grenades, pistols, rifles and teargas at the party's offices.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai told a press
conference that the party now had evidence surrounding the blast.
" The evidence points to the involvement of people in the highest
offices of the government in a conspiracy to destabilize the MDC,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The MDC is the largest opposition party in the country. In the
June parliamentary elections, It got 57 seats, the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front led by President Robert
Mugabe won 62 seats.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Sets Tree Planting Day to Avert Desertification  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local media quoted Saturday the Minister for Natural Resources
and Tourism Zakia Meghji as saying that Tanzanians should
cultivate a tree planting culture as a commitment to biodiversity
conservation and combating desertification.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the looming threat of desertification is a
result of increasing population (from 9 million in 1961 to the
present some 33 million) which is translated into increased food
demand.
</P>
<P>
"This demand leads to more land for agriculture hence
encroachment of forests," she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that about 91 percent of energy in the
country comes from fuelwood and charcoal and a total of 65,000
hectares are burnt every year throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Meghji said in order to ensure effective participation of the
public on the January 1 tree planting, her ministry will involve
other ministries, various national and international institutions,
and regional and district leaders in preparing action programs.
</P>
<P>
"The national Tree Seeds Program has sufficient supply of
seeds in its centers, she said.

agreed to continue three-way cooperation with the United States in
dealing with the Korean Peninsula issue.
</P>
<P>
Ideally, the three countries will maintain close contact so
that ties between the two Koreas, between Japan and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and between the United States
and the DPRK will benefit all parties, Mori said at a joint press
conference after the talks.
</P>
<P>
He suggested holding summit with DPRK leader Kim Jong Il to
boost negotiations between Japan and the DPRK on normalizing
diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who arrived on Friday for a three-day visit, urged Mori to
enact by the end of the year a bill giving permanent foreign
residents in Japan the right to vote in local elections. South
Korea has repeatedly stated such a desire, since many of Japan's
permanent local residents are Korean.
</P>
<P>
The bill, to be discussed during a 72-day extraordinary Diet (
parliament) session which opened on Thursday, has already been
opposed by some parliament members from Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party.

<P>
BRUSSELS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Belgian international
striker Luc Nilis of England's Aston Villa club fears he may not
play again after breaking a leg earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Nilis suffered a double fracture of his right leg in a
collision with Ipswich keeper Richard Wright.
</P>
<P>
Nilis told Belgian daily Het Laatste Nieuws he feared the
injury might make a return to top-level football impossible.
</P>
<P>
"Over the next two months things could change but I fear that
could be it for my football career," the paper quoted Nilis as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that "I should be grateful I still have my leg. The
most important thing is to get well again and do the things every
normal person can do, such as playing with the children. Football?
Right now, I'm not thinking about it."
</P>
<P>
Nilis joined Villa from Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven at the
beginning of the season and had already made quite an impression
with a superb goal against Chelsea last month.

</P>
<P>
The program, also known as the "863 Program" initiated 14 years
ago, involves some 60,000 scientists and enables the country to
have an edge on the international high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
An modern computerized integrated manufacturing system (CIMS),
an advanced design, management and manufacturing system, has been
developed by Chinese scientists as part of the achievements of the
national high-tech research and development program.
</P>
<P>
Today, more than 200 enterprises in the country apply the CIMS
to the manufacturing of over 50 products in 11 series, whose
annual output value is well above 100 million yuan (12 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The CIMS will continue to be a theme for research in the field
of automation under the "863 Program" when China is implementing

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Meets CICLD Congress Participants (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Top Chinese legislator Li
Peng met Friday with some Chinese and foreign representatives to
the 20th Congress of the International Commission on Large Dams (
CICLD).
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the standing committee of National People's
Congress, said water conservancy is the lifeline of China's
agriculture and an important foundation for the country's economic
and social development.
</P>
<P>
He said per capita of water resources of the Chinese people is
lower than that of the world's average. Moreover, the allocation
of irrigation resources is quite unbalanced in terms of time and
geography.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government pays close attention to the
development and effective utilization of water resources, and
building dams and other facilities is very important in the
process.
</P>
<P>
China has, he said, built more than 80,000 reservoirs since the
founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, which have
been playing an important role in promoting economic growth and
dealing with flood damage.
</P>
<P>
In the course of developing its western regions, China has
initiated a project that will transmit power from the west to the
east. Li said it is essential to speed up infrastructure
construction in the areas of water conservancy and hydropower,
especially those on the main branches of the Yangtze river, Yellow
river and other main rivers.
</P>
<P>
It is of great significance to improve the allocation of
irrigation and hydropower resources in western regions as well as
promote sustained social and economic development there, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said China has attached great importance to ecological
balance and the protection of water resources while developing the
economy, in order to have a harmonious co-existence between human
beings and nature.

<P>
He said the primary aim of building the Three Gorges Project is
to control and mitigate flood damage, generate power, and use it
for navigation, irrigation and other purposes.
</P>
<P>
The whole project involves about 20 billion U.S. dollars with
55 percent of the total to be used in project construction and the
rest in migration and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
China has taken steps to maintain an ecological environment
along the Yangtze river, which involves planting trees and grass
as well as preventing the cultivation of land on the upper
sections of the river, while mapping out regulations to protect
geologic and water resources, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said China has combined the development and use of water
conservancy with sustained development in construction of the
Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
Li said the convening of the congress in Beijing provided a
good opportunity for Chinese and foreign experts to learn from
each other. China, as a developing country, is willing to learn
more from its foreign counterparts in related areas.
</P>
<P>
The four-day congress, which ended in Beijing on Friday,
focused on a number of key issues concerning the construction of
dams.
</P>
<P>
The CICLD was founded in 1928 and now has 81 member countries.
China joined the organization in 1974.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Health Ministry Warns Lethal Mosquitoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Health officials urged Lebanese
to spray stagnant water with insecticides and report any
unexplained illnesses, National News Agency (NNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The measures are aimed to guard against two mosquito-borne
viruses blamed for deaths elsewhere in the region.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Karam Karam said on radio that no cases of West
Nile Virus or Rift Valley Fever have been reported in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also issued a statement, urging Lebanese to use
mosquito netting as a protecting way.
</P>
<P>
Mosquitoes transmit the viruses from birds and livestock to
humans. Lebanon is especially concerned about a West Nile Virus
outbreak that has killed 14 people and infected scores of others in
Israel, with which Lebanon shares a border.
</P>
<P>
According to Health Ministry sources, an outbreak of the virus
in Lebanon depends on whether migrating birds from regions in
Africa, where the virus in prevalent, pass through the country.
</P>
<P>
There is no specific treatment for the virus and there is no
vaccine and the best precaution is to eradicate mosquitoes that
carry the virus.
</P>
<P>
"Once a person is infected, all he can rely on is his own immune
system and I have to say that it is not easy at all for those who
have a weak immunity system," an expert of the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The mortality rate of the virus is around 1 per 1,000 cases. The
virus can cause encephalitis and potentially fatal diseases that
cause swelling of the brain or the lining around the brain and
spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
Rift Valley Fever has killed 78 people in Yemen and 16 people in
southern Saudi Arabia, near the border with Yemen.

<HEADLINE> Russian Plane in Iraq to Defy Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A Russian passenger plane
carrying a delegation of anti-embargo activists arrived in the
Iraqi capital on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Yuri Shifranic, head of the delegation and former
Russian oil minister, told local and foreign reporters that the aim
of the visit is to protest the decade-old embargo on Iraq and to
show solidarity with the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government did not ask for approval from the United
Nations Sanctions Committee, but just notified it, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to make efforts to lift the embargo on Iraq,"
he said, adding that the flight has got full support from the
Russian government.
</P>
<P>
He slammed the air embargo unilaterally imposed on Iraq by the
United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Iraq should be "an independent and free country in all aspects"
and free to transport people to other countries over the world, he
said, stressing that this is the most important message he wants to
deliver to the world.
</P>
<P>
On the Iraqi side, Abdul Razaq Al-Hashmi, head of the Iraqi
Peace, Solidarity and Friendship Organization, condemned the U.S.
and Britain for obstructing civil flights to the embargo-stricken
country.
</P>
<P>
There is no U.N. resolution banning civil planes to Iraq, and
the fact that foreign planes came to Iraq one after another has
proved that the air embargo is "absolutely not true and not valid,"
Al-Hashmi said.
</P>
<P>
As to the Russian plane, "it is not the first and it will not be
the last, that is for sure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 people, including journalists, a football team, artists
and other activists were aboard the direct flight from Moscow to
Baghdad. They will stay in Iraq for two days.
</P>
<P>
This is the second foreign plane landing at Saddam International
Airport in two days. A French plane arrived at the airport on
Friday despite objections from the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been calling for lifting the U.N. embargo on Iraq,
and has deemed unnecessary to get permission from the U.N.
Sanctions Committee to fly civil flights to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain argue that agreement by all members of the
U.N. Sanctions Committee is needed for such flights.

SYDNEY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- World number seven Ji Xinpeng
sealed China's victory at the Olympic badminton by snatching the
men's singles gold at the Sydney Olympic Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Chinese upset the second-ranked Indonesian

most of the medals in one competition had gone to a single nation
since badminton entered the Olympics at the Bacelona Games in 1992.
Only the men's doubles title was taken by Indonesian Tony Gunawan
and Candra Wijaya at the Sydney games.
</P>
<P>
"There are two reasons for Ji's victory," head coach Li Yongbo
said after the match."One is his tactics and the other is his
fighting spirit."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese coach said:"We studied Hendrawan's play very
carefully and made full preparations before the Olympics,"
</P>
<P>
Ji had come into the Olympics with just a victory in the Japan
Open earlier this year as his previous biggest tournament win.
</P>
<P>
"I fought to the best of my ability and it paid off," said Ji.
"It was an advantage for me that Hendrawan's old coach was
preparing me."
</P>
<P>
"The coaching we received was the reason for our success as a
team. We were encouraged to compete without having to think of
gold medals in advance.
</P>
<P>
"I was very determined and very confident, which helped me to
perform at the best of my ability."
</P>
<P>
Ge Fei and Gu Jun earlier won the women's doubles by beating
their second-seeded compatriots Huang Nanyan and Yang Wei 15-5, 15-
5. Ge and Gu's second Olympic gold followed wins at the last two
world championships, but they claimed that it is getting harder.
</P>
<P>
"Previously when we were young there was less pressure on us,"
said Gu. "But now everyone expects us to succeed every time we
play. After what we have achieved before, we were afraid of
falling from the pinnacle. And as we get older we fear being less
able to manage physically."
</P>
<P>
Gao Ling and Qin Yiyuan, the sixth seeds, beat the third-seeded
South Koreans Chung Jae-Hee and Ra Kyung-Min 15-10, 15-4 in the
women's doubles match for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
Gao was particularly impressive in adding to the gold medal she
gained in the mixed doubles in Sydney with Zhang Jun earlier in
the week.
</P>
<P>
Gong Zhichao won the women's singles gold for China on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Alumni Against Independence of Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Delegates attending a meeting
of the Huangpu (Whampoa) Military Academy Alumni Association (
WMAAA) today said they firmly oppose the so called "Independence
of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Li Yunchang, deputy director of WMAAA, said the association,
whose members are living in various parts of the world, are very
concerned about national unity.
</P>
<P>
"We will build more connections with our alumni overseas to
oppose splittism," Li said in a work report at the fourth session
of the council's second administrative council.
</P>
<P>
He said the association will work harder to push forward the
course of the national reunification.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Tinghan, deputy head of the United Front Work Department
of Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said the change of
leadership in Taiwan cannot change the fact that Taiwan is part of
China.
</P>
<P>
"The leaders of Taiwan should be sincere and take actions to
clearly acknowledge the one-China principle, if they do put the
happiness and benefit of Taiwanese people into consideration," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also prepared an open letter, which read, "We hope
WMAAA alumni living overseas and in Taiwan unite to fight for the
complete reunification of the motherland."
</P>
<P>
The delegates at the meeting, which closed today, elected Li
Yuan as the deputy director of the association.
</P>
<P>
The WMAAA was founded in June 1984 in commemoration of the 60th
founding anniversary of the Whampoa Military Academy, a military
school for senior officers of the national revolutionary army
during 1924-1927.
</P>
<P>
According to the association's charter, it is aimed at
enhancing ties among alumni and promoting the motherland's
reunification.

<HEADLINE> Religion Cannot Be Used to Interfere in China's Internal Affairs: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior official said today
that the Chinese people cannot tolerate overseas forces using
religion as a tool to interfere in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, deputy chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made
the remarks at a meeting to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the
Three-Self Patriotic Movement in China.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is also head of the Front Work Department of
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said it is
necessary to popularize patriotism education among religious
believers and expose the crimes committed by foreign missionaries
in China in history.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of education that religions are
compliant with the China's socialist society.
</P>
<P>
While running churches, religious believers should safeguard
the interests of the people, abide by the law, and maintain
national unity, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Wang said, churches in China should carry out
research on religions abroad, train more middle-aged and young
missionaries who are patriotic, and build the good image of
Chinese religions in the world.
</P>
<P>
The official praised Chinese patriotic Christians for their
great contributions to the socioeconomic development of the
country during the past five decades.
</P>
<P>
He blasted some overseas forces which attempted to deny the
history when imperialists were using religion to invade China.
</P>
<P>
During the time from the Opium War in 1840 to 1949, when the
People's Republic of China was founded, he said, the imperialists
had continuously used religion to serve their evil purposes. Some
missionaries participated in the opium trade, drafting of unequal
treaties and invasion. Some served as intelligence agents or
guides for foreign invaders.
</P>
<P>
In 1950, in order to break away from the control and influence
of imperialism, Chinese Christians, led by Y.T. Wu, initiated the
"self-administration, self-support and self-propagation" patriotic
movement.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the National
Committee of CPPCC, attended the meeting and sent greetings to
Chinese Christians on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the
State Council.

Turkish minister's visit to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Targamadze said that the protocol aims at preventing crimes such

<HEADLINE> Iran Refutes U.S. Comments on Jewish Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Saturday dismissed as "interference
in Iran's internal affairs" the comments made by U.S. officials on
the trial and sentencing of 10 Iranian Jews convicted of spying for
Israel.
</P>
<P>
An appeals court in the southern ancient city of Shiraz on
Thursday cut short the prison terms of the Jews from between four
and 13 years, to between two and nine years.
</P>
<P>
Since the Jews were found guilty of spying for Israel by the
court and sentenced to prison in July, some U.S. officials have
expressed disappointment, called the court ruling unfair, and
requested that the Jews should be released.
</P>
<P>
Asefi, however, accused Washington of promoting smeary
propaganda intended to question the justice and capacity of Iran's
judiciary system, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the pressure and disinformation, the Iranian
judiciary proceeded on the case independently and without political
considerations, Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the accused Jews had been given a fair and
just trial in accordance with the Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
On reports that Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi has held talks
in New York with some of his Western counterparts on the release of
the convicted Jews, Asefi said those claims were untrue.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 Jews, along with some Muslims, were arrested in
Shiraz, capital of Fars province, in the first half of last year,
and the trial started in April.
</P>
<P>
Three Jews and two Muslims were acquitted in July, but 10 Jews
and two other Muslims were convicted of cooperating with the
Israeli security service and sentenced to four to 13 years of
prison terms.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers for the Jews protested against the ruling and
appealed to the provincial court, which issued the new ruling
Thursday after delays.
</P>
<P>
The arrest and trial of the Iranian Jews sparked protests from
Israel and Western countries which demanded Iran release them
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Iran that the case had nothing to do with religious beliefs and
no foreign country should interfere in its domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Iran has a Jewish community of about 25,000 people, the largest
in the Middle East outside Israel.

<HEADLINE> Barak's Security Advisor to Visit India for Security Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The chief of staff of
Israeli Prime Minister's Office Danny Yatom will travel to India in
the coming days to discuss security cooperation between the two
countries, Israel Radio reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Yatom, also Prime Minister Ehud Barak's security advisor, is
invited by Indian Home Affairs Ministry to discuss with Indian
officials in New Delhi India's anti-terrorist campaign and the
assistance Israel could provide to India, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of senior Israeli anti-terrorist experts is
currently visiting India to seek ways to combat the so-called
separatists in the mountainous region of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
India, which controls a large part of the Kashmir region,
accuses Pakistan of arming and training Kashmir separatists, a
charge Pakistan denied. Pakistan rules one third of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation, grouping senior Israeli police
commanders and military intelligence officials, is reportedly
visiting the Kashmir region and other military-hit areas to assess
India's security needs.
</P>
<P>
Israeli defense sources said over the weekend that the visit to
India by the Israeli delegation is to culminate in an overview
report which allows experts to study the needs of India in the
fields where Israel might be able to provide assistance.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Israel three months ago, Indian Home Affairs
Minister Lal Krishna Advani asked Israel to help his country in
fighting terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Israel promised that it will not provide training for personnel
or send any instructors, but will only provide information and sell
equipment to India.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, when India and Israel established full diplomatic
relations, India has become Israel's third largest market for
defense- related exports.

<HEADLINE> Manila Rejects Calls For Fixed Forex Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Economic managers of President
Joseph Estrada's administration rejected Saturday calls by some
sectors to fix the exchange rate of the peso against the U.S.
dollar,saying this would do more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
Ofelia Templo, Assistant Director General of the National
Economic and Development Authority, said such a move would only
create a black market similar to that in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"If you fix the rate and it's not an equilibrium rate that
matches the demand to the supply, you only create a black market,"
she said on a radio program.
</P>
<P>
"The market with the fixed rate will become useless. The people
won't follow the official rate, and that makes the situation worse,
"she asserted.
</P>
<P>
A lawmaker suggested earlier this week that the foreign
exchange rate be pegged at 43 pesos to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The weakening peso fell further in Friday's trading, closing at
an all-time low of 46.155 pesos against the greenback.
</P>
<P>
But Templo said the country must learn from its experience that
prompted it to deregulate the foreign exchange sector about 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
While many look to Malaysia as a good example of a country
where the currency rate is pegged, the Malaysian economy is more
controlled,she noted.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the sector is liberalized and people can
set up dollar accounts aside from peso accounts, she said, adding
that the central bank just enters the market to intervene only
when needed.
</P>
<P>
Besides, she said, the falling peso reflects the global trend
that even affluent economies cannot prevent.
</P>
<P>
"This is not unique here. Almost all the currencies in the
region have been depreciating" as a result a strong dollar, she
said.
</P>
<P>
As such, she said, "even if there were no domestic factors, we
would still feel the pressure."

<HEADLINE> Pakistani CE Calls for Tackling Environment Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf on Saturday called for addressing
critical environmental issues facing the South Asia region,
according to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural address at the Third South Asia Geological
Congress in Lahore, he said the region was facing several grave
environmental issues like desertification, soil degradation,
underground and surface water pollution and unplanned solid and
liquid waste disposal.
</P>
<P>
"Understanding and application of geological knowledge would
certainly be invaluable in addressing these issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
In this purpose, General Musharraf said, the Pakistani
government is committed to promoting and improving international,
regional and sub-regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the importance of greater co-ordination within
this vast region as it is blessed with abundant human and natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said Pakistan has a unique geographical location as
it is located at the cross-roads of West, Central and South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"I do wish to caution, however, that resource exploitation
should be addressed in a way that we leave this planet as a better
place for our future generations as compared to what we inherited
from the past," he stated.
</P>
<P>
The four-day congress, organized for the second time in
Pakistan by Pakistan Academy of Geological Sciences, has attracted
delegates from countries like Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, India, Nepal
and Bangladesh.

earnings have plummeted by 17.4 percent this year compared to last
year, the Coffee Board of Kenya has announced.

poor prices. Although 1.3 million bags (50 kilograms per bag) had
been auctioned in the 1999/2000 coffee year compared to 969,926
bags last year, average sales to per bag has dived by 34 percent,
from 127.58 U.S. dollars last year to 86.59 dollars this year, the
board said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has exported a total of 1.3 million bags of coffee,
earning 135 million dollars this year, while last year it exported
969,926 bags, realizing a earning of 149 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Top buyers of Kenyan coffee are Germany, Netherlands, Belgium,
Sweden, Britain, the United States and Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Become Free Trade Zone Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) will become a full-fledged free trade
zone next month, COMESA Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha has said.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha announced in Kenya's capital Nairobi on Friday that
nine of the 20 member states including Kenya were at an advanced
stage of lifting tariff barriers to allow untaxed goods to flow
freely across their borders by October 31.
</P>
<P>
"We already have a critical mass of about 200 million people in
the nine countries as the basis to move the regional integration
a step forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha noted that the launch of COMESA's free trade zone will
be the first in Africa as the lifting of trade tariffs was still
only an idea in the Southern African Development Cooperation (SADC)
,
</P>
<P>
The COMESA secretariat is now talking with three other
countries, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, which have indicated they
will remove their tariff barriers by the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
He said that Seychelles was still reworking its trade and
tariff structures but has announced it would free its borders and
market by June 2001.
</P>
<P>
The nine countries that are ready to move are Kenya, Egypt,
Djibouti, Malawi, Mauritius, Madagascar, Sudan, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Oil Prices to Be Stabilized Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's oil prices will soon
be stabilized because the country's sole refinery gutted last year
will resume production in a few days, Times of Zambia reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Components and major repair equipment for Indeni Petroleum
Refinery in Ndola in the north of the country arrived Friday from
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of the refinery will ultimately stabilize the
prices of fuel apart from ensuring a steady and continuos flow of
the petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted general manager of the refinery Fred
Zama as saying here Friday that the repair works will be completed
within seven days and after that the refinery will be pre-tested
and later re-commissioned.
</P>
<P>
Zama said that security at the plant will be reinforced to
prevent infernos such as the one which gutted the oil plant mid
last year.
</P>
<P>
Petrol is sold now in the country at about 0.9 dollar per litre.

<HEADLINE> Heat Guard Hardaway Happy with New Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Guard Tim Hardaway Saturday
said he was happy and looking forward to the upcoming NBA season
after agreeing to a one-year deal with the Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-veteran, playing for the United States at the
Olympic basketball tournament in Sydney, had been seeking a longer
deal but said he still hoped he could play out his career with the
Heat.
</P>
<P>
34-year-old Hardaway, who has been injured often over the past
two seasons, said: "I won't talk terms of the deal but I have
agreed and I am putting it all behind me now. I'm completely
healthy, and looking forward to the season."
</P>
<P>
Fort Lauderdale's Sun-Sentinel said on Friday the deal was
worth some 12 million U.S. dollars, which would make Hardaway the
highest-paid point guard in the league.
</P>
<P>
The Heat have added forwards Anthony Mason and Brian Grant
along with shooting guard Eddie Jones and appear set to dominate
the eastern conference with Patrick Ewing leaving rivals New York
for Seattle in a four-team, 12-player deal earlier this week.

<HEADLINE> Day-8 Roundup: Jones and Greene Win Sprints, Redgrave and Thompson Make Olympic History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- American superstars Maurice
Greene and Marion Jones became the golden boy and girl of the
Sydney Olympic Games, winning the men's and women's 100m sprints
in a fine weather Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British oarsman Steven Redgrave and American swimmer
Jenny Thompson established Olympic records by becoming the most
successful athletes in respective area on the eighth day of the
games.
</P>
<P>
Jones, 24, kickstarted her bid for a record gold medal haul of
five with the second-largest winning margin in Olympic 100m
history after finishing in a 2000 world best 10.75 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 world championship second place finisher Ekatarini
Thanou was a distant silver medallist in 11.12 seconds and Tanya
Lawrence of Jamaica took the bronze in 11.18 seconds, denying
veteran Merlene Ottey a place on the podium by just one hundredth
of a second.
</P>
<P>
Jones' winning margin of 0.37 seconds was the second largest in
Olympic history after Australia's Marjorie Jackson won the 1952
race by 38 hundredths.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first Olympic gold medal for the American runner.
</P>
<P>
Greene clocked 9.87 seconds in the men's race, just one-
hundredth of a second outside his fastest run of the year from
September 1.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 200m world champion Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago
improved from his Atlanta bronze from 1996 to the silver medal
position in 9.99 seconds, with Obadele Thompson of Barbados
claiming the bronze in 10.04 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic gold medal completed Greene's major 100m
achievements which include 100m world titles 1997 and 1999 and a
world record run of 9.79 seconds in Athens on June 16, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The only other gold medal from track and field was taken away
by world record holder Jan Zelezny of Czech Republic in the men's
javelin event with a throw of 90.17 meters
</P>
<P>
In rowing and swimming, Redgrave became only the third athlete
to win gold medals at five successive Olympic Games when he took
the title in the coxless fours while Thompson won a record eighth
gold of her career in the women's 4x100m medley relay - in a world
record of 3:58.30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Redgrave's achievement was acknowledged by the International
Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch who presented
him with a special gold Olympic pin for his unprecedented record
in an endurance sport.
</P>
<P>
Other rowing golds on Saturday went to Belarus, France, Germany,
New Zealand, Romania and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
Thompson also dead-heated with teammate Dara Torres for the 100
m freestyle bronze to lift her career medal haul to an
unprecedented ten. All her golds have been in relays. The seventh
gold was already a record - one more than former East German
Kristin Otto, who collected six golds at the 1988 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
After the final day of the swimming competition, the United
States has taken a total of 14 swimming golds followed by
Australia and the Netherlands, each with five. A total of 14 world
records were broken.
</P>
<P>
Russian duo Vera Ilina and Ioulia Pakhalina wrote Olympic
diving history by winning gold in the first ever synchronised
event with a narrow victory over the Chinese favourites Fu Mingxia
and Guo Jingjing in the women's three-meter springboard event.
</P>
<P>
After their superb performances, their teammates Dmitri
Saoutine and Igor Loukachine showed the greater consistency to
edge another pair of Chinese rivals Tian Liang and Hu Jia by an
even narrower margin in the men's 10m platform final.
</P>
<P>
China made up the loss of diving from badminton when their
shuttlers won the women's double and men's singles events.
</P>
<P>
In all-Chinese final of the women's doubles, world number one
Ge Fei and Gu Jun brushed aside Yang Wei and Huang Nanyan for the
gold. And in the men's singles, China's Ji Xinpeng trounced
Indonesian Hendrawan in straights for the title.
</P>
<P>
China also won the men's table tennis doubles gold when Yan Sen
and Wang Liqin defeated their teammates Liu Guoliang and Kong
Linhui in the final.
</P>
<P>
In shooting, Rajmond Debevec of Slovenia won the men's small 50
m rifle 3 positions event with an Olympic record score of 1,275.1
points and Mykola Milchev of Ukraine shot a perfect score of 150
to equal the world record and win the men's skeet gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Paolo Pezzo of Italy became the first cyclist to win mountain
bike gold medal in two consecutive Olympic Games. She kissed the
ground after winning the 35.7 kilometer cross country course on
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Jones Takes Gold in Women's Dash with Huge Margin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Marion Jones of the United
States won the women's 100 meters final Saturday night by clocking
10.75 seconds to capture her first Olympic gold medal in one of
the greatest performance in the Olympic women's dash.
</P>
<P>
Her winning time was a season's best in cool conditions and a 0.
4 meter per second head wind at the Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Jones exploded from the blocks and was supremely dominant with
the rest of the field trailing four meters behind.  Ekatteini
Thanou of Greece took the silver in 11.12 while Jamaica's Tanya
Lawrence crossed the line in 11.18, edging her teammate Merlene
Ottey by a wafer-thin .01, denying her an eighth Olympic medal
having gained her first at the Moscow Olympics in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The winning margin of .37 second was the second-biggest in
Olympic 100m history, men or women. The biggest victory was by
Australian Marjorie Jackson, who won by .38 in Helsinki in 1952.
</P>
<P>
"I am really excited. I feel great," said Jones. "I think I put
together a technically good race. I'm just so happy. This has been
a long process. It's a dream come true. I am an Olympic champion
at 24," she added.
</P>
<P>
"Having my familly here, makes it really special. I think I ran
against the best athletes tonight. But I guess I was just the best
on the night," the American said.

<HEADLINE> Czech Zelezny Makes Hat-Trick in Olympic History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Jan Zelezny of the Czech
Republic won an unprecedented third successive Olympic javelin
gold on Saturday with his best effort of 90.17 meters.
</P>
<P>
Zelezny, 34, former world champion in 1993 and 1995 and current
world record holder, is the first competitor, either man or woman,
to win three Olympic javelin golds.
</P>
<P>
The Czech veteran, out of a string of back and shoulder
injuries in recent seasons, established his winning stance by
throwing to his winning distance in his third effort.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Steve Backley, who won the silver and bronze medals
in the last two Olympics, finished again for the silver with 89.85
and Sergey Makarov of Russia took the bronze with 88.67.
</P>
<P>
World champion Aki Parviainen of Finland finished a
disappointing fifth while Konstantinos Gatsioudis of Greece, who
had the year's best of 91.69 meters, was a further step away.
</P>
<P>
Zelezny, who was expected to retire after he missed the 1998
season, made a successful comeback last year by winning a bronze
in the world championships.

SYDNEY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- World number seven Ji Xinpeng
of China snatched the men's singles gold at the Sydney Olympic
badminton tournament here on Saturday by upsetting the second-
ranked Indonesian veteran Hendrawan in straight sets.
</P>
<P>

quarter-finals and world number three Peter Gade-Chirstensen of
Denmark in the semifinals, cruised to a comfortable 15-4 first set
win.

Hendrawan picked up his game in the second set and was once

"There are two reasons for Ji's victory," head coach Li Yongbo

carefully and made full preparations before the Olympics,"

<HEADLINE> Coffee Begins To Take Off In China(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers in the
Shunping County, northern Hebei Province, are now harvesting
coffee like their counterparts in Brazil and Africa.
</P>
<P>
Li Yujun, a local farmer, is expecting another bumper coffee
yield this year on his five-mu (0.33 hectares) of land. He started
growing coffee beans in 1998, and the yield last year brought him
over 5,000 yuan (about 600 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Hebei Provincial Mengjiang Development Company is a local
company focusing on the coffee trade. Zhu Zhanzong, the general
manager, said he and the State Administration of Internal Trade
introduced the coffee beans into the county two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The company signed contracts earlier this year with Beijing,
Tianjin and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and will produce
over 100 tons of coffee beans and instant coffee. It also signed a
contract to export 40 tons of coffee to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Li and his family have come to like coffee. "In the beginning,
the coffee was bitter. But we gradually got to like its aroma. I
also send some coffee to my friends as gifts," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Zhu is happy with the company's progress. Now some 4,000
households in the county grow over 200 hectares of coffee.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese farmers are generally the most conservative. If they
can accept growing coffee, then it will not be long before coffee
becomes a popular drink in China," said Zhu.

<P>
According to the company's survey in Qingdao, in east China's
Shandong province at the beginning of this year, one among five
local citizens likes coffee.
</P>
<P>
Members with the International Coffee Organization (ICO) said
China is a large tea consumer. Coffee was introduced to China in
the 1920s, especially in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
After a hiatus of some 40 years, coffee began to make a
comeback in the early 1980s when the country initiated economic
reforms. ICO statistics show Nescafe and Maxwell are now household
brands in the country, occupying 70 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Mei Da Coffee Company Ltd. north China's agent to
Starbucks Coffee, a US coffee chain group, has set up 16 coffee
shops in Beijing since the first one opened in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ding Lei, manager of Mei Da's Managing Department, said they
planned to open 20 coffee shops by the end of the year in Beijing.
Tianjin and Dalian will also open coffee shops next year.
</P>
<P>
Ding said, "most customers who frequent Starbucks are white
collar workers and college students, aged between 15 to 40 years.
Many young people think it cool and hip to drink coffee in bars
and restaurants."
</P>
<P>
ICO has organized in Beijing and Shanghai tasting coffee
festivals earlier this year to try and improve the image of coffee
in this potentially huge market.
</P>
<P>
Like China, Japan has a rich tea culture. Coffee has also taken
off in a big way in Japan. In the past 30 years, coffee
consumption has increased 12 times in Japan, becoming the fourth
largest consumer only after the United States, Brazil and Germany.
</P>
<P>
ICO members said China, a country of 1.2 billion people, now
only consumes one percent of coffee around the globe. Chinese only
drink about three cups of coffee a year on average.
</P>
<P>
" It may be a long way to go before we get the same kind of
response as in Japan," said ICO members.

<HEADLINE> China Strongly Demands U.S. to Repatriate Crime Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sun Yuxi said today that China strongly demands the
repatriation of a Chinese criminal suspect from the United States
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that Zhang Hongbao, a Chinese national who has been
involved in crimes of rape, counterfeiting certificates, and
illegal immigration, entered the United States in February
illegally.
</P>
<P>
China has made several solemn and just representations to the U.
S. side and provided a lot of evidence concerning Zhang's
involvement in the crimes, demanding that the United States
repatriate Zhang to China for the benefit of the cooperation in
law enforcement and bilateral relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Sun said, a U.S. immigration court went so far as to
grant Zhang "protection status from cruel penalty" on September 20.
This action by the U.S. side helps criminal suspect escape the
punishment he deserves, and as a result, the legitimate rights of
the victims are not protected.
</P>
<P>
It is also a wanton distortion of and attack against China's
legal system, Sun stressed.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the action of the U.S. side also reveals
its hypocrisy in respecting the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
China has expressed its strong resentment and firm opposition
to the action made by the U.S. side, and strongly demands that the
U.S. side correct its wrong decision and repatriate Zhang as soon
as possible, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Vice President Directs More Help For Sulu Evacuees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice President
Gloria Macapagal Arroyo Saturday directed the regional office of
the Department of Social Welfare and Development to continue its
support for relief operations for evacuees in the southern
province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
The department for Western Mindanao has already assisted over 3,
000 families with some 14,000 members in various evacuation
centers in the province as of Saturday, said Arroyo, who is also
Welfare Secretary,according to the Philippine News Agency.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,800 families have been displaced since the
launching of military operations against the Abu Sayyaf in Jolo
island, Sulu,last Saturday to rescue the 19 hostages held by the
rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Two French journalists were recovered Wednesday by the military,
which is continuing to pursue the Abu Sayyaf rebels, who are still
holding one American, three Malaysians and 13 Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The vice president, who flew to the southern city of Zamboanga
earlier in the day, conferred with officials of Southern Command
of the Armed Forces and discussed the situation in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the regional health office is reportedly organizing
a mission to attend to the health and other needs of the evacuees,
and collecting medicines and other medical needs.
</P>
<P>
Regional health director Dr. Lourdes Labiano said she is
concerned about medical supplies needed in the province
considering the fact that the number of those needing medical
attention could be by the hundreds.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday 26 boxes of medicines and 30 oxygen tanks were
shipped to Jolo on board a military transport vessel.
</P>
<P>
The military has suspended commercial sea travel to prevent the
Abu Sayyaf rebels from escaping from Sulu.

<HEADLINE> UAE Paper Raps U.S. Proposal on Al Aqsa Mosque </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A major newspaper in the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) Saturday criticized as unfair the U.S.
proposal of putting the holiest Muslim site of Al Aqsa Mosque in
Jerusalem under international sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal, which makes easy for Israel to take over
extra Palestinian rights, has manifested the extent of the U.S.
partiality as well as its recklessness with regard to relevant U.N.
resolutions, the Dubai-based Al Bayan daily said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Arabic-language paper called on the Palestinians
to reject this prejudicial proposal and not to bow to U.S.
pressures, in order to restore their looted rights. And that will
force Israel to accept decisions of international legitimacy, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper urged Washington to abandon its partiality and at
least maintain its role as a major sponsor of the Middle East peace
process, which has been in deadlock since the July Camp David
summit between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. President Bill Clinton ended without
any agreement.
</P>
<P>
The major thorny issues between Israel and the Palestinians are
the fate of Jerusalem, especially the sovereignty over the Temple
Mount in the stone-walled Old City which hosts various Jewish and
Muslim holy sites, and the return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are expected to
receive a package of bridging proposals prepared by U.S. officials
by the end of the week or the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
Under the package, one possible solution for the Tempe Mount
issue is an idea raised by the U.S. and Egypt and backed by France,
in which the sovereignty of the Mount will be transferred to the
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. Israel is
reportedly inclined to accept the proposal.

<HEADLINE> India to Hike Petrol Products Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government said
Saturday that prices of diesel, LPG, kerosene, petrol and aviation
turbine fuel will be increased but a decision on the timing will
be taken in due course.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum Minister Ram Naik told reporters soon after the
cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, "
There will not be any announcement today...it will be made in due
course of time."
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over soaring global crude prices, he said
that the country's oil pool deficit had become unmanageable.
</P>
<P>
"We will go for a mix of increase in prices, cut in duties and
oil bonds to reduce the deficit," he added.
</P>
<P>
Appealing to the state governments to lower sales tax on petrol
products by five percent for immediate relief to consumers, he
said that any further delay in price hike is not possible now.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan MPs Ask Israel to Revive Irrigation Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Members of Ugandan Parliament
have asked the Israeli government to revive the Karamoja
irrigation scheme in the northeastern region that was abandoned in
1968, the New Vision daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The legislators discussed with visiting Israeli Parliament
member and leader of the Coalition Ofir Pines-Paz the role Israel
could play in the modernization of agriculture in Uganda, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"We are asking Israel to reconsider this mission for the mutual
benefit of the two countries, and we will provide Israel with many
cash crops,"said Okulo Epak, a member of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Israeli ambassador to uganda Kaacov Amital said that the
revival of the scheme would depend on the "deepening and widening
of relations between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The Israelis had made a joint feasibility study in the
northeastern region including Karamoja and Teso for an irrigation
scheme using Lake Kyoga waters.
</P>
<P>
Israel plans for agriculture in Uganda were ruined in 1972 when
the then Ugandan government cut diplomatic ties with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Supports Lifting of U.N. Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish officials and business
leaders have again called for the "total" lifting of U.N. sanctions
on Iraq, including a ban on air services.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Turkish diplomats, business leaders and
experts who have come out to express their opinions following
Jordan's request for U.N. permission to resume air services to
Baghdad. The Jordanian move was followed by France, Russia and
China and a number of other Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The decade-old U.N. sanctions are the main reason for the huge
losses inflicted on Turkish trade with Iraq, an unidentified
diplomatic source was quoted as saying by Turkish Daily News
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Iraq ranked first in
terms of foreign trade volume among Turkey's neighbors. Thereafter,
the economic and political ties between Baghdad and Ankara were
enormously affected by the crippling U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey now earns approximately 600 million U.S. dollars a year
from exports to Iraq under the oil-for-food program, an exemption
from the embargo, and from transit fees for Iraqi oil flowing
through a pipeline to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan,"
said the source.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Turkey would continue its efforts to have the
embargo lifted so that the trade volume would subsequently be
expanded.
</P>
<P>
Mehmet Aslan, chairman of Trade Chamber of Gaziantep, a province
bordering Iraq, said that Turkey's economic losses have exceeded 80
billion dollars over the past 10 years. "Not just the southeast
region, but regions all over Turkey have incurred great losses," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Gaziantep Chamber of Industry Chairman Nejat Kocer described the
past 10 years as "lost years" and said that the sanctions should be
lifted immediately.
</P>
<P>
He accused the United States of blocking Turkey's efforts to
lift the embargo, adding that the Turkish government has not pushed
hard enough to have the sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
A French plane carrying doctors, sportsmen and writers arrived
in Baghdad on Friday from Paris, the first such flight from France
since the U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
France informed the U.N. Sanctions Committee on Thursday night
that a humanitarian flight would be taking off early Friday. France
refused a request to delay the light for additional 12 hours for
the issue to be studied.
</P>
<P>
Russia sent a similar flight to Iraq on Sunday with U.N.
approval. But the plane also carried passengers, including oil
executives interested in making deals with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that increasing flights, with their questionable
passenger lists and last-minute notifications, are an indication of
the growing challenge to the principally U.S.-supported sanctions.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Bangladesh Requests for Deferral of NAM Summit  By Chen Jian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The 13th Non-Aligned Movement (
NAM) Summit scheduled in Dhaka in September next year has been
deferred apparently to enable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to
complete her full term, informed sources said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The NAM Coordination Council at its meeting in New York on
September 17 endorsed Bangladesh's request to defer the 114-nation
summit by at least six months, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials are tight-lipped about the reason
for the request, but political observers here believe the request
was made to facilitate Sheikh Hasina to remain in power till the
last day of her five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka indicated that February or March of 2002 would be "a more
suitable time" for Bangladesh to host the summit. Citing September
as "a month of monsoon and floods" and October as a period of "
unfavorable natural conditions", Dhaka proposed that a six-month
deferral would be "more convenient" to host the mega-event, the
first of its kind being ventured by Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
However, political observers claimed that the reason for
deferral of the summit was that the present government would
complete its term on July 13, after which a caretaker government
would take over to hold the next general elections.
</P>
<P>
In September, the scheduled time for Summit, the country would
be under a caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Apparently the request for deferral was made to allow the prime
minister more time for electioneering to be better prepared for
the election, they believed.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for putting off the summit may be to have more
time to complete the infrastructure facilities including flats for
accommodation and logistics for an estimated 500 foreign
dignitaries including heads of state and heads of government, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh first made the request for deferral at the NAM
Troika breakfast meeting in New York on September 12 and at
another meeting of the Troika on September 14. The request was
then conveyed to the NAM Coordination Council meeting chaired by
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that Bangladesh should have considered the
feasibility of holding the summit on its due date when it bid for
hosting the mega-event.
</P>
<P>
Most of previous NAM summits were held in September, which is
kept in mind by all NAM organizers and participants as it enables
them to adopt some crucial resolutions on common issues to place
those at the United Nations General Assembly which begins its
session on the third Tuesday of September.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Conduct Relief, Rehabilitation Operations in Sulu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
reassured residents in the southern province of Sulu over the
weekend that it will give top priority to relief and
rehabilitation efforts in the province once military operations
against the Abu Sayyaf are over.
</P>
<P>
"This is in line with the President's rehabilitation and
development of Mindanao, especially in conflict-hit areas. Talipao
and Patikul in Sulu will get special attention once this is over,"
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said on radio Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The towns of Talipao and Patikul in Sulu are reportedly bearing
the brunt of the ongoing military operations to rescue the 17
remaining hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf and to crush the rebel
group.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada authorized the military operations
last Saturday to stop the vicious cycle of kidnappings by the Abu
Sayyaf, which days before seized three more Malaysian hostages
after releasing four Europeans.
</P>
<P>
The military, which recovered two French journalists on
Wednesday, still has to rescue the three Malaysians, an American
and 13 Filipinos in the hands of the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Zamora said the National Disaster Coordinating
Council is coordinating relief efforts to help residents affected
by the military operations.
</P>
<P>
Two civilians have been confirmed killed in the operations and
more than 4,800 families have been evacuated from affected areas
in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Sulu Governor Abdusakur Tan has assured the public that
residents displaced by the operations are well taken care of and
that the presidential office and local government units involved
are closely coordinating to ensure the steady flow of aid to the
evacuees.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Swimmers Win Most against Aussies and Incredible de Bruijn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The American swimmers have
pocketed 14 gold medals with two more world records set in the
last-day competitions at the Millennium Olympic Games, underlining
their dominance in the pool over the host Australians and the rest
of the world.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 14 new swimming world records set at the Games, the
U.S. relay teams contributed two more on Saturday to enlarge their
own credit to four, including three from the relay events,
levelling the hosts on the number of world records.
</P>
<P>
However, it was Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands who became
the most phenomenal individual swimmer as she won the most of
three individual golds and set the most of three individual world
records at the eight-day competitions.
</P>
<P>
After setting the world marks in the 100m butterfly, 100m
freestyle and 50m freestyle, the Dutchwoman triumphed again in the
50-meter freestyle on Saturday following her victories in the 100m
butterfly and freestyle.
</P>
<P>
And the Netherlands has more to cherish as Pieter van den
Hoogenband stole two freestyle titles from Russian legendary
Alexander Popov with two world records in the 100m and 200m,
enabling the darkhorse to claim a joint second place with the
hosts on five gold medals apiece.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the Americans exploited their home advantages
for a total of 13 swimming golds in Atlanta, and they even managed
for a step further in Sydney as Gary Hall and Anthony Ervin tied
first in the men's 50m freestyle finals for a total of 14.
</P>
<P>
The Australians, who stand second overall with five golds, nine
silvers and four bronzes, can only boast of their four world
records, all through the freestyle events, with Michael Klim in
the 100m and Ian Thorpe in the 400m, apart from their 4x100m and 4
x200m relays feats.
</P>
<P>
The 50m freestyle champion Gary Hall anchored the United States
to a world-record victory in the 400-meter medley relay after the
American women also set a world medley relay mark.
</P>
<P>
However, Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres, the two most
recognisable women in the U.S. swimming team, remained shorthanded
of their first-ever individual title although the 29-year Thompson
won her eighth career relay gold as the United States cruised to a
world record of 3:58.30 in the 400 medley relay and 33-year-old
Torres has competed in her fourth Olympics after a seven-year
retirement.
</P>
<P>
The Americans got the best of the Aussies in both medley relays
wherein the Australia's men and women had to settle for silver.
The American women went 3-0 against their Aussie counterparts in
the relays, while the their men peers were toppled 1-2.
</P>
<P>
With eight gold medals, all in relays, Thompson ended her
swimming career one short of gymnast Larissa Lathynina of former
Soviet Union for most golds by a woman.
</P>
<P>
As Kieren Perkins was stopped by Grant Hackett from becoming
the first male swimmer to win the same individual Olympic event
three times in the 1,500m freestyle, Popov was neverthless the
most miserable swimmer as he backed home without a single gold
medal, but a lonely silver medal from the 100m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
All the remaining nine gold medals went to the Europeans as
Italy pocketed three, both Ukraine and Romania bagged two apiece,
and Sweden and Hungary cherished one each.

<HEADLINE> Paolo Pezzo Defends Olympic Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Italian cyclist Paolo Pezzo
successfully defended her Olympic gold medal in women's mountain
biking cross country race at the Sydney Olympic Games on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Pezzo won her second gold medal following
Atlanta 1996 by finishing the 35.7 kilometer race in one hour 49
minutes and 24 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The silver medal went to World Cup champion Barbara Blatter of
Switzerland, who finished 27 seconds behind Pezzo. The two-time
world champion Margarita Fullana of Spain, who collided with Pezzo
in the race, picked up the bronze after finishing 33 seconds back.
</P>
<P>
Blatter led after the first two of five rounds and Fullana
crashed in the penultimate round, allowing the Italian to move
ahead.
</P>
<P>
Just as she did before Atlanta, Pezzo removed herself from
regular World Cup competition to concentrate her preparation on
the Games.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, she was suspended six weeks for a doping offence.

<P>
CAIRO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt and Japan have signed a contract for the first stage of
the Suez Canal Ferry due to open in October next year. The
contract, worth 1.8 billion Japanese yen (16.67 million U.S.
dollars), is an extension of another signed at the beginning of the
bridge construction.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- The Egyptian government has taken measures for carrying out a
national program for training and rehabilitating graduates with the

machinery.
</P>

Al Gomhuria:

<P>
-- Israel and the Palestinians expressed growing frustration
Friday at the lack of progress towards a peace deal to end their

Israel are going around in an empty circle," said a senior
Palestinian official.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Government Intensifies Rescue Efforts as Bourse Falls to New Low By Yang Qingchuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 23 (Xinhua) -- As Thai stock index has
fallen to a lowest point in nearly two years, Thailand is
intensifying its efforts to pull the stock market out of its
downside momentum and restore confidence among investors.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index dropped to
274.14, the lowest point in past 23 months, at this week's closing
yesterday. So far this year, the market has plunged over 40
percent, making it the poorest performer among the 18 stock
markets throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, the market's booming memories are not so far away. The
SET index reached its historical peak in January 1994 at 1789
points and the market capitalization amounted to a healthy 3.5
trillion baht (83 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
When the Asian financial crisis started three years ago, the
index had plummeted to 527 points, and the slide continued to
yesterday, with the market capitalization reducing to 1.4 trillion
baht (33 billion dollars) -- which means the market has lost over
two trillion baht (47 billion dollars) in capitalization since its
peak.
</P>
<P>
Although the whole economy is picking up now, the gloom still
pervades the market: the interest rates are low, the currency is
steady yet dropped slightly, the export growth is strong, but the
market is keeping losing ground.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said if the stock market, which has served as a
barometer for the country's economy and a capital base for
sustainable economic growth, can not revive before long, it will
finally hinder the kingdom's economic recovery and growth.
</P>
<P>
Knowing this, the kingdom has been taking a series of measures
to boost the market.
</P>
<P>
In the country's latest move to revive the stock market, the
SET office, the stock market operator, announced yesterday that it
would complete restructuring the market within one and an half
year, and planned to split the market into an operational unit and
a non-profit organization which is devoted to develop the market.
</P>
<P>
Later last month, based on the proposals from the finance
ministry, the central bank, the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) and the SET office, the government unveiled a comprehensive
plan which consists of short-, medium- and long-term measures,
aimed to solve the structural or fundamental problems of the
beleaguered stock market and breathe new life to it.
</P>
<P>
In the short term (six months), the country plans to launch an
index option trading for its blue-chip SET 50 index this November,
increase investment choices for domestic investors, support the
introduction of non-voting receipts to increase investment options,
teach unlisted companies the benefits of listing and introduce on-
line operations.
</P>
<P>
The medium-term measures (six to 18 months) include supporting
the retail investor base, developing an industry-wide Internet
trading platform, introducing stock options, moving towards real-
time depository registration, supporting share dissemination of
large state enterprises and providing clearing and settlement
services for debt instruments.
</P>
<P>
As for the long term (over 18 months), the plan vows to create
a 100 percent non-scrip system, facilitate straight-through
processing, establish a back-office utility for security companies,
form alliances with overseas exchanges and enable direct access
for foreign institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country also aims to list more than 100 new
companies in the next five years, which is expected to increase
the annual market turnover to 60 percent of its gross domestic
product and further boost Thai stock market's weighting in the
index of major international credit rating agencies.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said whatever measures are being taken to
save the bearish market, their successes largely depend on two
tasks: attracting foreign investors back to the market and
broadening the domestic investor's bases.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have long been turning their backs on
Thailand. Figures show that foreign investors were almost all net
sellers during the first half of this year, which means the
foreign investors were keeping retreating from Thai stock market.
</P>
<P>
When comparing Thai stocks with those big, bullish and booming
markets elsewhere in the world, the investors naturally desert the
former.
</P>
<P>
While the London Stock Exchange merging with the Frankfurt
market and the New York Stock Exchange building more trading
platforms, there are little changes happened in Thai stock market.
The supply of stocks is shrinking and all are limited to what is
known as "old economy".
</P>
<P>
The SET has been already moving toward a new-technology-
oriented direction, but there is still much more to be done.
</P>
<P>
At home, analysts said the country should encourage its
citizens to place more importance on stock investments rather than
bank savings. A survey shows that only 0.6 percent of Thais own
stocks and fewer are engaged in active trading, while the ratio is
one-third in Singapore, and 20 percent in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistic Office found that over 70 percent of
Thai savings go into bank and only 1 percent is put into stocks
and bonds.
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech, SET chairman Ameret Sila-On addressed the
problem. "The SET needs to try harder to bring saving money into
the stock market," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that without enough domestic investments in the
capital market, including stock markets, firms will not have a
enough long-term financial basis to develop.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said since the structural and fundamental weakness has
long rooted in the Thai stock market, the country's measures to
boost it may not take effect in the short term. The SET index will
keep on going down till the end of the year, under the influence
of the recent cooling-down of the U.S. economy and the kingdom's
upcoming general election later this year.
</P>
<P>
However, in the long round, with the overall national economy
recovering more steadily, the measures will begin to yield
positive results, they said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Reassures Public of Stable Macroeconomic Fundamentals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
reassured the public over the weekend that the country's stable
macroeconomic fundamentals will help the economy overcome the
pressure of a weak peso and rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The presidential palace and the central bank are taking steps
to ensure that the economy remains stable amid these two negative
developments triggered by global trends which even rich countries
cannot avoid, Director General Felipe Medalla of the National
Economic and Development Authority said on government radio.
</P>
<P>
"The public must not lose confidence in the fundamentals of our
economy. The president and the central bank are doing everything
to make sure our economy remains stable," Medalla said.
</P>
<P>
The softening peso hit a historic low in Friday's trading,
closing at 46.16 pesos against the U.S. dollar. As in the past
days, the peso was weighed down by such factors as the swelling
budget deficit, the conflict in Mindanao and poor investors'
sentiments as well as the trend of weakening regional currencies
as a result of the strong greenback.
</P>
<P>
Medalla also reiterated that the double whammy of high crude
oil prices in the world market and the weakening of regional
currencies, which have both affected the Philippine economy, are
temporary.
</P>
<P>
He assured the public that the peso is supported by the country
's strong exports as well as by its gross international reserves,
which are now at an all-time high of over 15 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Even rich economies, such as France the United States and
Britain, are also feeling the burden of high crude oil prices,
which continue to rise despite the increased output levels pledged
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, he said.

<P>
NAIROBI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Airways has posted a
pre-tax of 2.8 billion shillings (about 36.4 million U.S. dollars)
for the financial year ending March 2000, the airline's chairman
Issac Okero has announced.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the airline's annual general meeting here Friday,
Okero said his airline was among the most profitable organizations
during the year, with many others in the industry reporting
massive losses, the government-run newspaper Kenya Times reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The management of the airline has embarked on a fleet
modernization and expansion program, which will spend more than
750 million dollars in acquiring modern aircraft to compete more
favorably in the market, Okero said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Managing Director Richard Nyagah announced
in a statement that the airline was set to increase its fleet by
purchasing five Boeings and leasing another five Boeings,
scheduled to be delivered between July 2001 and January 2003.
</P>
<P>
Okero said his company is pursuing a strategy to position
Nairobi as the premier regional hub for traffic into and out of
the continent.
</P>
<P>
He noted although the strategy has started to realize some
fruits, it requires commitment and collaborative efforts between
Kenya Airways, the Kenya Airports Authority and other stakeholders.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Kenya Airways was for the second year running
awarded "African Airline of the Year Award" at the fourth biennial
African aviation conference in Pretoria, South Africa.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil
advanced into the men's tennis singles top eight at the Sydney
Olympic Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian, second seed and favourite to take the gold,
defeated Croatian Ivan ljubicic 7-6 (7-2), 6-3 in the third round.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian, who won his second French Open in June, will
have to face in the quarter-final the winner between Yevgeny
Kafelnikov of Russia and Mark Philippoussis, the last Australian
man left standing.
</P>
<P>
Spanish eighth seed Juan Carlos Ferrero also advanced to the
last eight, beating Canadian wildcard entrant Daniel Nestor, who
had upset Australia's Patrick Rafter in the second round, 7-6 (7/4)
, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
American black sisters Venus and Serena Williams also enjoyed
themselves at the Games, reaching the doubles quarter-finals
after dropping the first set against Russian pair Elena
Likhovtseva and Anastasia Myskina.
</P>
<P>
But it was third time unlucky for Spain's Conchita Martinez and
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, who were eliminated by Belarus's Natasha
Zvereva and Olga Barabanshchikova.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniards won silver at the Barcelona Olympics and bronze

<P>
In the women's singles, Australia's young hopeful Jelena Dokic
rallied from 5-1 down in the second set to eliminate Paraguay's
Rossana de los Rios 7-6 (7/5), 7-5.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old lost her concentration after rolling over an
ankle in the second game of the set but, after the pain subsided,
pulled herself together to prevent the match going into a third
set.
</P>

There were also wins for the Russian tenth seed Elena

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- It is a joy for Beijing
people to view clear skies, though it is a common experience for
people in some other cities.
</P>
<P>
There have been 120 days recorded with air quality better than
level two (fairly good air quality) in the first eight months of
the year, while there were only 70 days in the same period of last
year, declared recently by Wang Guangtao, vice-mayor of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has encountered nine sandstorms in the first half of
the year, but local taxi drivers have not found obvious mud spots
on their cars after the rain in September.
</P>
<P>
Rapid urban construction has produced too much pollution in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has decided to invest 46.6 billion
yuan (about 5.6 billion U.S. dollars) to improve the environment.
</P>
<P>
Replacing coal with natural gas, rebuilding vehicles that run
on clean fuels, planting more trees and grass, and closing or
reconstructing some polluting enterprises are all included in the
city's five-year (1998-2002) environmental protection plan.
</P>
<P>
Beijing began to report daily air quality last year,
encouraging people to supervise the government's working progress
to improve the environment.
</P>
<P>
It will continue its efforts to cure the matter of gas emission
and coal consumption in October.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Govt to Move Industries out of Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister
Girija Prasad Koirala said Friday that the Nepali government would
move all industries out of Kathmandu valley to relieve the valley
of heavy pollution, The Kathmandu Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Koirala announced the decision here while addressing a function
to mark the 21st Social Service Day, the English daily said.
</P>
<P>
"The project would help reduce the valley's burgeoning
population by as much as 50 percent and will indeed help ease the
burden of the valley, said Koirala.
</P>
<P>
"If everything turns out to be as planned, then Kathmanduites
will be freed from garbage havoc, water scarcity, pollution and
the like," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kathmandu valley consists of three municipalities, namely
Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur.
</P>
<P>
What makes Koirala's announcement significant is that the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) has agreed to assist the Nepali government
in the effort.
</P>
<P>
"I have already talked to the ADB officials and they have
agreed to provide infrastructure in a scheme to relocate all the
industries, including carpet and garment factories, of the valley,
" said Koirala.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1,800 carpet factories, 150 garment factories, one
cement factory and some other factories are now located in the
Kathmandu valley and are bringing a myriad of problems, especially
pollution, to the valley.

<HEADLINE> Deforestation Claimed as Cause of Floods in Mekong Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Experts at the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific (ESCAP) was quoted as saying that forests have reduced
in most countries in the region from 70 percent of land area in
1945 to about 25 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The other causes are reduction in river channels and drainage
system, reclamation of floodplains and wetlands, rapid expansion
of urban and residential areas and frequent occurrence of extreme
weather conditions and unusual rainfall patterns.
</P>
<P>
"Floods continue to be one of the most severe annual disasters
in Asia. The intensity of flood disasters appears to have
increased in the region in the past decade, especially during the
past few years," said ESCAP Executive Secretary Kim Hak-Su.
</P>
<P>
"These annual flood disasters have caused increasingly serious
social and economic impacts in the developing countries and
aggravated poverty in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In recognition of the serious impacts of flood on the process
of economic and social development of the countries in the region,
ESCAP recently implemented a project to promote regional
cooperation in flood control and management in Asia and the
Pacific. And we hope this will be useful for the communities," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been made by ESCAP and other international
organizations to strengthen regional cooperation on flood control
and management within the framework of a strategic planning and
management process for regional development: vision building,
priority setting and common-goal setting.
</P>
<P>
This was the first such initiative of its kind to review and
publish, in a recent special publication, experiences in regional
cooperation in flood control and management at the regional,
national and basin levels.
</P>
<P>
Because of the financial and resource constraints governments
should consider realistic targets to reduce damage, increase
disaster awareness and improve forecasting systems, the ESCAP
report states.
</P>
<P>
"Realistic targets, for example, are provision of
infrastructure for 100 percent protection of residential areas by
2010 or the improvement of flood forecasting by 50 percent for
agricultural areas by 2005," an ESCAP flood expert was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
A 1998 ESCAP regional survey identified floods as the most
common disaster experienced practically in all the countries
surveyed.
</P>
<P>
The worst floods in decades hit the Mekong Delta region of
Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand in recent months, claiming hundreds
of lives and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

<HEADLINE> Absence of Right Policy Hinders Bangladesh's Manpower Export: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The absence of a right policy
and lack of proper initiatives by Bangladeshi diplomatic missions
abroad are obstacles to earning the expected amount of foreign
exchange through exporting manpower, the Financial Express said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Though Bangladesh's earnings of remittances have been rising
significantly over the past years, the job markets for
Bangladeshis did not develop much due to the absence of the proper
planning, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring countries, like India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, are
picking up most of the jobs in overseas markets under concrete
plans. They are also holding the key positions in different
private and corporate organizations in foreign countries and
earning huge amounts of foreign currencies for their countries,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh people usually serve as workers and earn less as
most of them are unskilled and inexperienced.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Bangladesh Association of
International Recruiting Agents Golam Mostafa termed the export
of manpower as a very prospective area for the country. Mostafa
was quoted as saying that it is very unfortunate that the country
has failed to get a proper guideline to boost earnings by
exporting manpower overseas.
</P>
<P>
Repudiating ready-made garments (RMG) as the single largest
export earning sector in the country, Mostafa said that the
country actually gained the highest amount of export earnings as
remittances from expatriates.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the raw materials and the machinery being used in
the RMG industries are imported from abroad, he argued, adding
that this increases the expenditure in the RMG sector to a large
extent.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has so far earned more than 13.6 billion U.S.
dollars as remittances from the expatriates serving in different
countries around the globe until July 2000, according to
statistics from the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training
and the Bangladesh Bank.
</P>
<P>
In the year 1999, the country earned the highest amount of
remittances worth 1.64 billion dollars from non-resident
Bangladeshi people.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months from January to July of the current
year, Bangladesh earned over 1.23 billion dollars, according to
the statistics.
</P>
<P>
More than three million people have migrated abroad, mainly to
the Middle East countries, since the beginning of foreign
employment for Bangladeshi citizens in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Of the Bangladesh people who are in service in various
overseas countries, more than 0.11 million are professionals, 0.88
million are skilled workers, 0.63 million semi-skilled and 1.27
million are unskilled workers.
</P>
<P>
If necessary steps are taken by the government to develop
skills of the people, additional job markets can be created in
overseas countries and the country can earn a huge amount of
foreign currencies, said Mostafa.

<HEADLINE> Experts See New Spell of Sino-Singaporean Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- China's approaching accession
into the World Trade Organization is welcomed by Singaporean
business people who see more opportunities through a broader range
of economic cooperation, said a renowned Singaporean economist.
</P>
<P>
Tay Beng Chuan, chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of
Singapore, said at the Overseas Chinese Worldwide Forum 2000 which
ended Thursday in this port city on China's eastern coast, that
the mutually complementary economic cooperation of the two
countries has great development potential.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's abundant resources and huge market along
with Singapore's geographic advantage as a port and managerial
experience of modern industries have jointly created good
preconditions for exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Singapore, as a growing international financial hub, has a
great role to play in directing funding to China. Its connections
with Southeast Asian, European and American countries will help
smooth out China's foreign trade barriers, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
He said that after China's WTO entry, its financial, insurance,
telecom, transportation and tourism markets will become more open.
These sectors are to Singapore's advantage. Singapore can share
its experience with China in these fields.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's demand for professionals like accountants,
auditors and lawyers will provide jobs for Singaporean talents, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to Tay, the Singapore Trade Development Board has
attached itself to China's development strategy for the western
region. It plans to approve more research programs to explore the
market potential of information and technology upgrading, law
consultation and life sciences study in west China.

<TEXT>
<P>
Soeharto, accompanied by his two daughters, arrived at
Pertamina Hospital at 06:50 a.m. local time (23:50 GMT Friday).
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's top lawyer Juan Felix Tampubolon told reporters that
the 24-member medical team had told him the examination may take
as long as two days.
</P>
<P>
The medical team was established by the decree of South Jakarta
Prosecutor Office chief on September 18. Judges ruled that the
medical team should examine Soeharto and report when the hearing
reconvenes on September 28.
</P>
<P>
However, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman Friday said it must
be the prosecuting judge, not a medical team, who ultimately
decides whether Soeharto is fit to appear in court on corruption
charges.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who is charged with corruption committed during his
32 years in power, has failed to appear at the opening two
sessions of his trial -- on August 31 and September 14 -- because
of what his lawyers claim as brain damage, memory loss, high blood
pressure and other ailments.
</P>
<P>
Public prosecutors in the Soeharto case have rejected the
lawyers' argument and urged the panel of judges to establish an
independent team to re-examine Soeharto.

<HEADLINE> Official: American Hostage in Cahoots with Abu Sayyaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Philippine government
official Friday accused kidnapped American Jeffrey Schilling of
being in cahoots with his Abu Sayyaf captors.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said, "We have long been
saying that Mr. Schilling is not the ordinary kind of hostage who
was taken against his will," the Philippine Star reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Very clearly, he is deeply involved with those who kidnapped
him.If you read his remarks, basically they are no different from
that of(one of Abu Sayyaf commanders) Abu Sabaya," Zamora was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Schilling's taped message aired the other
day over a radio station in the southern city of Zamboanga in
which Schilling urged the Philippine government to halt military
operations against the Abu Sayyaf in the southern island of Jolo,
Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada ordered pre-dawn military operations
against the rebel group last Saturday to rescue its hostages. Two
French journalists were recovered on Wednesday. But the rebels are
still holding 17 hostages, including Schilling and three
Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
Schilling, in a telephone conversation with his mother in the
United States arranged by the radio station, reiterated his
charges that the military offensive would alienate the government
from Muslims in Sulu, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He asked his mother to tell the Philippine government to stop
the military operations which he said was the biggest threat to
his life.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Seif al-Islam, son of Libyan leade Moammar Gadhafi,
reportedly claimed on Friday that Schilling was selling arms to
the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
"He may have converted to Islam, but he is above all an arms
dealer ... We now know that Schilling was selling weapons to the
rebels," he said in an interview with France's Figaro magazine.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the American had met with the Abu Sayyaf
several times.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said Friday that
government troops had pinpointed the whereabouts of Schilling and
his captors, and that the Schilling would be rescued soon.
</P>
<P>
According to the military, 95 Abu Sayyaf members have been
killed in the ongoing offensive and 25 suspected rebels captured
while two government soldiers have died and six others have been
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The military said only two civilians were confirmed to have
been killed in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
The government has set up 30 evacuation centers for more than 4,
800 evacuated families in Jolo.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from the
Organization of American States (OAS) and Guatemalan President
Alfonso Portillo on Friday discussed issues regarding the
territorial dispute between Guatemala and Belize, Mexican media
reported.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held a two-hour closed-door meeting in the
presidential house, during which they discussed the nature of the
century-old territorial conflict and the possibilities of a
solution.
</P>
<P>
The OAS delegation is made up of British national Shridath
Ramphal and U.S. lawyer Paul Reichier.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala claims more than 12,000 square kilometers from
Belize's total territory of 23,000 square kilometers and has
proposed international arbitration, which was rejected by Belize.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala considers invalid a treaty it signed in 1859 with
Belize and Britain regarding border limits. The border between
Guatemala and Belize has been the scene of constant friction.
</P>
<P>
Belize declared independence from Britain in 1981. The then
Guatemalan President Jorge Serrano Elias recognized its
independence, but his successor, Ramiro de Leon Carpio, did not.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Asian Tourism Back on Track with Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Tourism in the Asia-Pacific
region is back on track with a spectacular increase of 11.1
percent in arrivals in 1999, thanks to the economic recovery that
surpassed all the expectations.
</P>
<P>
"Asia-Pacific region was the star of world tourism in 1999,"
said Dawid de Villiers, deputy secretary general of World Tourism
Organization (WTO), at the International Tourism Asia (ITA) 2000
held in Hong Kong recently.
</P>
<P>
"From a negative growth of 1.2 percent in 1997 and 1998 the
region excelled in 1999 to reach a growth rate of 11.1 percent and
to set a new record of 97.2 million international tourists
arrivals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Growth in tourist arrivals was widespread in the region. WTO
statistics indicated that the Chinese mainland received the
largest number of tourists in 1999, followed by Hong Kong,
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Among top ten destinations in East Asia/Pacific, Malaysia
achieved a 42.9 percent rise of tourist arrivals in 1999. Hong
Kong, Singapore and Thailand also witnessed a double-digit growth
of 18.3 percent, 11.1 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively.
Tourist arrivals in China's mainland rose 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Villiers said the success of 1999 should be repeated and even
improved upon in the year 2000, as prospects for tourism and
travel are particularly favorable.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts that economic
production in 2000 will grow at a rate of 4.2 percent. Growth in
the recently industrialized Asian economies are expected to be
particularly strong, around 6.6 percent, which will contribute to
tourism growth.
</P>
<P>
Based on the economic forecast, WTO estimated arrivals to East
Asia/Pacific will hit nearly 110 million in 2000. By 2010, some
195 million tourists are expected to choose a destination in East
Asia/Pacific and by 2020 the total number of tourists may hit 397
million, representing fully one-fourth of all international
tourism, according to WTO forecast.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime of tourist arrivals increase, outbound tourism
by East Asia/Pacific residents is on the rebound, with Japan,
South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia making up the main
outbound markets.
</P>
<P>
Harsh Varma, WTO's regional representative for Asia, said there
is a visible recovery in the outbound travel, following the crisis
that confined the low and middle-income travelers.
</P>
<P>
With the economic growth, those with higher income are even
traveling to more long-haul destinations and more often, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there has been a tendency in the last two
or three years to seek out new destinations, and eastern Europe
and Scandinavia, with its good flight connections, have been
benefited.
</P>
<P>
WTO predicted that some 108 million people of the region are
expected to pack their bags and head for foreign destinations this
year.
</P>
<P>
Varma said WTO is actively engaged in guiding and educating
Asian markets about new destinations on offer, adding that two of
the most recent projects are for the Mekong River and Tumen River.
</P>
<P>
"We hold technical meetings and seminars throughout the region
where we let the outbound sector know about international and
regional trends, showing which are the emerging destinations and
what needs to be done to promote Asian travel to them," he said.

<HEADLINE> Three Abu Sayyaf Members Sentenced to Life in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Three Abu Sayyaf members were
sentenced to life imprisonment by a trial court in the southern
city of Zamboanga on Friday for kidnapping a family in 1992, the
first time that members of the rebel group have been convicted of
abducting.
</P>
<P>
The three, captured in 1995, were among 22 Abu Sayyaf rebels
who kidnapped a doctor and 10 members of his family in the
southern island of Basilan in 1992, freeing them only after ransom
was paid,Manila Bulletin reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the sentence was read as death penalty in the
Zamboanga regional trial court, but the court later said the three
only face life in jail because their crime was committed before
capital punishment was restored in 1994, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The doctor, Nilo Barandino, was quoted as saying that he hoped
the conviction would encourage other kidnap victims of the Abu
Sayyaf to come forward and testify.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf rebels, who are still holding 17 hostages
including an American and three Malaysians, are being hunted in
the southern island of Joo.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada ordered a pre-dawn assault
last Saturday against the rebels in Jolo to rescue the hostages.
Two French journalists were rescued on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan Sign Border Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan
signed a border treaty and several documents regarding bilateral
cooperation during Uzbek President Islam Karimov's visit to
Turkmenistan on Thursday and Friday, the Turkmen Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The treaty on border demarcation between the two Central Asian
countries was signed by Karimov and his Turkmen counterpart,
Saparmurad Niyazov, at the end of their talks, according to the
report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, a joint committee for border demarcation will
soon get down to work.
</P>
<P>
Karimov later told the press that his country and Turkmenistan
took the credit for becoming the first Central Asian countries to
settle their border problems. He expressed the hope that the
common border would become a link of lasting peace and harmony
between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two presidents also exchanged views on
a wide range of issues including bilateral cooperation in various
areas and regional security.
</P>
<P>
Karimov said there was a great potential for bilateral trade
and economic cooperation. Two-way trade soared to 180 million U.S.
dollars so far this year, a 3.5-fold increase over the same period
of 1999, Karimov said.
</P>
<P>
On regional security, Karimov said Turkmenistan's experience in
maintaining regional security and stability was valuable for other
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also praised President Niyazov for his efforts for a
political solution to the Afghan conflict. Afghanistan has been
torn by a civil war for years.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Demands More Information on Plan Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela is demanding from
Colombia more and better information about the military aspects of
Plan Colombia, a U.S.-aided massive campaign against drugs and
rebel guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel said Friday
that his country has been kept virtually in the dark about the
military component of the program, noting that as a neighbor of
Colombia, his country was entitled to be informed and acquainted
with Colombia's problems.
</P>
<P>
But he added that relations between Venezuela and Colombia have
always been good and no problem or dispute is desired.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed Venezuela's reservations about other plans
related to this military operation and asked the Colombian
authorities to address his concerns.
</P>
<P>
Rangel noted that Ecuador, Panama, and Brazil share the same
concerns about Plan Colombia, which was put forward by Colombian
President Andres Pastrana in the name of combating drug
traffickers and producers in his country and flanked by the United
States with aid worth 13 billion U.S. dollars in July.
</P>
<P>
The neighboring countries of Colombia, a country plagued by
decades of civil war between the government and guerrilla groups,
fear that trouble would spill over onto their own territories.
</P>
<P>
Rangel repeated his call for Pastrana to give Venezuela the
information which Caracas "considers just and necessary to know."

<HEADLINE> Colombian Peso Plunges as Investors Fear Kidnappings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The devaluation of the
Colombian peso accelerated Friday as plans to privatize the
country's state enterprises failed since foreign investors were
scared away by news of guerrilla attacks and extortion.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar jumped to a record high of 2,246 pesos as news
broke out that 2.165 billion dollars to privatize several state
industries were canceled. So far this year, the peso has lost
nearly 18 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the sale of 77 percent of ISAGEN, an
electricity generating firm valued at 385 million dollars, was
postponed and the sale of 51 percent of Bogota Telephone Company
estimated at 1.4 billion dollars, was canceled.
</P>
<P>
"Everything points to the fact that the two possible investors
quit when they reassessed the country's security conditions after
the Cali mass kidnapping," said Bogota Mayor Enrique Penalosa when
he announced that Telefonica of Spain and Telecom of Italy
abstained from bidding.
</P>
<P>
The rebel National Liberation Army (ELN) kidnapped more than 50
persons on Sunday on the Cali-Buenaventura Road in Valle del Cauca
department, southwest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Also postponed indefinitely is the sale of 76 percent of
Interconnection Electrica S.A. (ISA), worth 380 million dollars.
The guerrillas toppled 425 supporting towers in the last 20 months
to hamper the privatization.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government still hopes to sell 50 percent of its
share of Carbocol, the largest open pit coal mine in the world,
valued at 435 million dollars in October.
</P>
<P>
It is feared the mine, whose railroad transports 20 million
tons of coal every year, could become the target of more frequent
guerrilla attacks.

</P>
<P>
In a 45-minute meeting at the White House, Reno told Clinton
that "she has asked the Office of Professional Responsibility to
do a thorough review, as is their practice when ... questions have
been raised by a prosecution, like this one by a judge or others,"
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said that both Clinton and Reno agreed that "the most
important thing we can do is to try to get to the bottom of this (
case)."
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Reno and Clinton was arranged after the
president said last week that he had been "quite troubled" by the
treatment of Lee, who was held in solitary confinement for nine
months without bail before his release under a plea agreement with
the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the release of Lee last week, Federal Judge James
Parker apologized to the Taiwan-born scientist and said that the
way the departments of Justice and Energy handled this case "had
embarrassed our entire nation and each of us who is a citizen of
it."
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the 60-year-old Lee had been singled
out for prosecution simply because he is ethnic Chinese.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian pair Dmitri Saoutine
and Igor Loukachine took the title of the men's platform
synchronized diving, the second gold of Olympic diving tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Russian pair totalled 365.04 points in the event, which
made it Olympic debut at Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
The pre-competition favorites Tian Liang and Hu Jia of China
finished a disappointing second with a total of 358.74 points from
5 dives.
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal went to German Jan Hempel and Heiko Meyer who
collected 338.88 points.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so excited. I can't quite believe we've won the medal."
said Loukachine.
</P>
<P>
"It was very hard during the whole competition. WE put in our
best and were prepared for a good fight." Loukachine said.
</P>
<P>
Tian Liang, who teamed up with Hu Jia shortly before the
Olympics due to his original partner Huang Qiang sustained a hand
injury, said the Russians deserved to win the gold.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we were beaten due to a short preparation with
Hu Jia," said Tian Liang, "we've done alright but the Russians
have done extremely well. The Russians had a high degree of
difficulty which meant they were taking a big risk."

<HEADLINE> HK's Deflation Slows in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The deflation rate of Hong
Kong slowed down in August this year, although housing rental and
clothing sectors remained sluggish, according to Hong Kong iMail
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Consumer Price Index (CPI), a broad measure of
inflation, registered a year-on-year fall of 2.7 percent in August,
the smallest decline since last March. The index dropped 3.2
percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The government attributed the improvement in prices to the
reduced decline in private housing costs and renewed price
pressure from external sources following firmer world commodity
prices.
</P>
<P>
Falling prices have battered Hong Kong for 22 consecutive
months since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, with soaring
unemployment rate, and falling or unchanged wages level.
</P>
<P>
According to August statistics, housing rental and clothing and
footwear continue to report the largest price declines. Clothing
and footwear dropped 11.6 percent from last year in the composite
CPI, followed by housing, which fell 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that with property prices stabilizing, newly-
signed housing contracts were likely to cost more, which will help
ease deflation.

<HEADLINE> S&AMP;P Reminds Risks of 3G Operators in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's mobile phone
operators that intend to bid for the third-generation (3G) license
will face rising risks of costs, Saturday's South China Morning
Post quoted a Standard &AMP; Poors economist as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moving to 3G technology would require large capital outlays
that would affect the financial profiles of the operators, said
John Bailey, Standard &AMP; Poor's (S&AMP;P's) director of corporate
ratings, after an S&AMP;P-sponsored telecommunications conference
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a fundamental question of how some players will be
able to recoup their start-up costs for 3G," he added.
</P>
<P>
In its recently released Asia-Pacific Telecommunications report
that came amid a global correction in the valuations of telecoms
companies, S&AMP;P emphasized growing credit risks in the industry
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
Locally, blue-chip counters such as Pacific Century CyberWorks
and SmarTone Telecommunications have been hit hard, with their
share prices plunging more than 30 percent in the past month.
</P>
<P>
S&AMP;P said the granting of 3G licenses by the Office of the
Telecommunications Authority (Ofta) of Hong Kong would serve as a
catalyst for an industry consolidation.
</P>
<P>
Ofta is expected to announce its preferred way to allocate
licenses before the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
"We regard 3G as a major business risk as we are uncertain
about its demand and business model," said Agnes Lee, S&AMP;P
associate director of corporate ratings.
</P>
<P>
"But what we are sure of is that the market will consolidate in
the short to medium term, and the cash-rich companies will have a
better chance of survival."

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen to Build More Berths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen City, also a
special economic zone in south China's Guangdong Province, will
spend 15.65 billion yuan (about 1.89 billion U.S. dollars) on port
construction in the Tenth Five-Year Plan period (2001-2005).
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the city will use the money to
build 32 new berths for ships in the next five years, including 10
specialized container berths.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, Shenzhen's handling capacity will increase to 70
million tons. The city will by then be able to handle 6.5 million
TEUs (twenty-feet equivalent unit) of containers and be ranked as
one of the world's 10 major container ports.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the city has invested 7.99 billion
yuan (about 963 million U.S. dollars) in port construction, half
of which was covered by overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
It now has 135 berths, including 43 deep water berths and 12
specialized container berths. The city operates more than 40 sea
routes to ports in regions such as Europe, America, Australia and
Asia.
</P>
<P>
A total of 46 million tons of cargo were shipped to and from
Shenzhen Port last year, of which, 19 million tons were
transported in containers. It is expected that 48 million tons of
cargo will be shipped using the port city.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Put on Sale Higher-Quality Jade, Gems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will put on sale at
its upcoming mid-year gems emporium a great number and higher
quality of jade and gems mined from four famous mines in the
country, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
These jade and gems, mined from the Hte Lone Sein, Hmaw Kyan
Kmaw, Sama and Mongshu mines, will be sold through competitive
bidding or tender at the state-sponsored 9th Mid-Year Gems
Emporium scheduled to be held here on October 3.
</P>
<P>
These mines are known as the source of high quality jade stones
and precious gems.
</P>
<P>
Pearl and jewelry will also be put on sale at the event,
sponsored by the Myanma Gems Enterprise of the Ministry of Mines.
</P>
<P>
Mid-year gems emporiums were introduced since 1992 in addition
to annual events which have been held since 1964.
</P>
<P>
At the 37th annual Myanma gems emporium, which took place in
March this year, a total of 23.847 million U.S. dollars were
fetched, breaking the past highest record of 1990's 27th emporium

merchants of 215 companies from 11 countries and regions as well
as 183 local gems traders. The foreign gems merchants mostly came
from China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Thailand and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is a well-known producer of jade, ruby and sapphire in
the world and the country earned over 300 million dollars from its
37 annual and eight mid-year gems emporiums,according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar enacted the New Gemstone Law in September
1995, allowing national entrepreneurs to mine, produce, transport
and sell finished gemstones and manufactured jewelry at home and
abroad.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Agree to Resume Talks on Cease-Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the rightist Colombian United Self-
Defenses (AUC) Friday agreed to reopen negotiations with the
government on an urgent and generalized cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
AUC chief Carlos Castano and Andres Paris, a FARC spokesman,
announced the news separately, the local radio network reported.
</P>
<P>
The AUC presented an 11-point agenda, including political and
democratic reforms, an economic development model, agrarian and
urban reform, and an energy policy.
</P>
<P>
FARC, the largest and oldest leftist rebel force in Latin
America that controls about 40 percent of Colombia, is engaged in
slow-moving peace talks with the government, but no cease-fire
deal has been reached so far.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the government froze the peace process because the
guerrillas refused to hand over a suspected plane hijacker.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts in the country between the government and guerrillas
have taken 35,000 lives over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
FARC has 15,000 members, while the extreme rightist AUC has 7,

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's current account
deficit dropped to 3.75 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP)
in the past 12 months to August, the best result recorded since
October 1997, the Central Bank said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit dropped from July's 23.8 billion U.S. dollars, or 3.
88 percent of the GDP, to 23.4 billion dollars in absolute value
in August.
</P>
<P>
Altmir Lopes, head of the Economic Department in the central
bank, said the deficit reduction came from improvement in the
trade balance, and the drop in the remittance of profits and
dividends abroad.
</P>
<P>
Brazil has posted a trade surplus of 769 million dollars this
year, according to the latest data released by the government.
</P>
<P>
The remittance of profits and dividends, which dropped 44
percent in August compared to the same period last year, also
produced a positive effect on foreign accounts.

<HEADLINE> Redgrave Wins Fifth Gold as Britain Takes Men's Coxless Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Steven Redgrave collected his
fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal when he led the British team
to win the men's coxless four event at the Sydney Olympic Games
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 1997, 98 and 99 world champion British crew of Matthew
Pinsent, a three times Olympic gold medalist, Tim Forster,
Redgrave and James Cracknell won the race in five minutes 56.24
seconds.
</P>
<P>
This is 0.38 seconds in front of Italy, with Australian taking
the bronze with a further 0.99 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
The British team rowed their bow ball in front after 100m, and
moved out after 250m to lead by a canvas from Australia, with the
United States in third place.
</P>
<P>
By 500m, Britain had extended its lead to half a length, but
then had to respond to a strong challenge to Italy in the second
500m.
</P>
<P>
The Italians passed the United States just after the 500m mark
and the Australian after 700m, and were within half a length of
the British team at the half way mark. Britain lifted the rating
again, adding half a second to their lead with the Itaslians being
challenged for second by the Australian crew.
</P>
<P>
In the final stage of the race, Australia and Italy tried to
row down Redgrave and his crew, but the British simply had too big
a lead.
</P>
<P>
Redgrave won his other Olympic gold medals in 1984 (men's
coxless four), 1988 (men's coxless four), 1992 (men's coxless pair)
and 1996 (men's coxless pair).
</P>

<HEADLINE> Over 100-ton Aerolite Discovered in NW China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A group of aerolites, which
cover several square kilometers in area, have been found in
northern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Hui, an assistant research fellow with the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Regional Museum, said that the biggest aerolite among
the group is estimated to weigh over 100 tons. The heaviest
aerolite so far discovered in the world weighs 60 tons, found in
Namibia in 1920.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who discovered the iron meteorites in Qinghe County,
said that the number of this group of cloud stones is estimated at
several thousand.
</P>
<P>
An aerolite weighing 32 tons was also found in the county in
1898, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Most of the aerolites discovered this time are round and
pointed, their surface covered with holes. Zhang analyzed that
they are metals which combine components of iron and nickel.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that aerolite is of great scientific and cultural
value in studying the birth of elements, the formation and
evolution of the universe, the solar system and life on earth.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said what is surprising is that stone human figures
carved out of the aerolites, and rock paintings featuring the
images of cattle, sheep, horse and camel were also found on the
cloud stones.

<HEADLINE> Sylvite Resources in NW China Exploited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Lop Nur Sylvite Company Ltd.,
made up of four enterprises in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, was recently founded to exploit sylvite
resources in Lop Nur, China's largest dried salt lake.
</P>
<P>
Lop Nur covers 10,000 square kilometers at the eastern edge of
Tarim Basin in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Formed with an initial investment of 420 million yuan, the
company will engage in the development, production and sales of
sylvite sulfate, potassium nitrate and other scarce chemical raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
It is speeding up construction of a sylvite deposit which is
expected to turn out 200,000 tons of sylvite sulfate and 30,000
tons of potassium nitrate with a combined annual output value of
400 million yuan next year.
</P>
<P>
Owing to lack of sylvite resources, China spends huge amounts
of funds on importing potash fertilizer annually. Operation of the
sylvite mine in Lop Nur will alleviate China's demand on sylvite
and potash fertilizer.

More attention must be paid to the health of young and middle-
age workers, said deputy Minister of Health Peng Yu at the opening
ceremony of Healthcare Campaign for Young and Middle-Aged Workers
on September 21.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Limited
shows that the health condition of young and middle-aged workers
in China needs more attention.
</P>
<P>
After testing 10,000 patients in eight regions, the survey
showed that young and middle-aged workers paid less attention to
high blood pressure than elderly people did, which directly
affects the treatment and control of the disease.

Mental Factor Leads to Diabetes: Survey
</P>
<P>
Chinese medical experts found that abnormal mental conditions
might be important factors for the type II of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
After a nationwide survey on 413 diabetes patients, the experts
found out that endocrine disorder, high blood pressure and heart
rate, which are considered to result from abnormal mental
conditions, would bring about low insulin and glycemia.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts formerly regarded that some unhealthy
lifestyles, such as lacking physical exercise or excessive eating,
could lead to diabetes II, while diabetes I is due to genetic
factors.

Project Launched to Improve Adolescent Reproductive Health
</P>
<P>
China started a five-year Sino-American project on September 22
to provide information and service about reproductive health to
the country's young people aging from 10 to 24.
</P>
<P>
The young population targeted by the project accounts for one-
sixth of the country's total and two-thirds of the 100 million
transient population, said Liu Hanbin, vice-president of the China
Family Planning Association (CFPA) at the project-launching
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
There is currently no systematic work in providing information
and service about reproductive health to adolescents and unmarried
young people in China, Liu said, adding that a nationwide project
is needed to promote such work.

Traditional Chinese Medicine Reduces Risk of Osteoporosis in Space
</P>
<P>
A Sino-French space experiment has shown that a traditional
Chinese medicine is conducive to the proliferation of osteoblast,
a bone-forming cell, during space flight, thus reducing the risk
of osteoporosis facing astronauts.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion is the result of a 15-day space experiment
jointly sponsored by Chinese and French researchers last year.
</P>
<P>
The loss of bone substances is a long-term, sustained process,
which eventually leads to osteoporosis, and poses obstacles for
astronauts adapting to gravity.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's third largest
political party the Alliance for Democracy (AD) has been thrown
into a crisis, after the country's Independent National Electoral
Commission (INEC) withdrew its approval for the party's operation
recently, reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to Nigerian law, all political parties must be
officially approved by the INEC to be allowed to operate in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The INEC claimed that it withdrew the approval, because the
party had failed to hold a national convention since its set-up,
as against the law.
</P>
<P>
The AD, the third largest party behind the ruling People's
Democratic Party and the main opposition All Peoples Party, has
great influence on the country's southwest region, including the
country's commercial center Lagos State. But the party has little
standing outside the country's southwest.
</P>
<P>
Six out of the country's 36 state governors are currently AD
members, while 20 out of 109 senators and 68 out of 360 house
representatives are also from the party.

further endorsed after Friday's semi-finals, in which Ge Fei and
Gu Jun, the defending Olympic champions and top seeds, cruised
into Saturday's final after beat compatriots Gao Ling and Qin
Yiyuan.
</P>
<P>
Their opponents in the final are Huang Nanyan and Yang Wei, the

ABU DHABI -- A major newspaper in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Saturday criticized as unfair the U.S. proposal of putting the
holiest Muslim site of Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem under
international sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal, which makes easy for Israel to take over
extra Palestinian rights, has manifested the extent of the U.S.
partiality as well as its recklessness with regard to relevant U.N.
resolutions, the Dubai-based Al Bayan daily said in an editorial.

An appeals court in the southern ancient city of Shiraz on
Thursday cut short the prison terms of the Jews from between four
and 13 years, to between two and nine years.

court and sentenced to prison in July, some U.S. officials have
expressed disappointment, called the court ruling unfair, and
requested that the Jews should be released. (Iran-US-Spy Case)

PRAGUE, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Seven industrial
countries Saturday urged the members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producing countries to
take actions to dampen soaring oil prices.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that world oil prices return to a level
consistent with lasting global economic prosperity and stability
for both oil producing and consuming countries, and in particular
for the poor developing countries," said a statement issued at the
end of the G-7 meeting of finance ministers and central bank
governors.
</P>
<P>
The group promised to improve the efficiency of oil using and
strengthen the stability in oil markets. "We agreed to remain in
close contact and to continue our discussions with oil producing
and consuming countries as we evaluate measures appropriate to the
evolving situation in oil and product markets," the statement said.
</P>

Meanwhile, the G-7 ministers stressed that they have a shared
interest in a strong and stable international monetary system.
After the joint intervention to defend the battered euro Friday,
the ministers said they will "continue to monitor developments
closely and to cooperate in foreign exchange markets as
appropriate".

While emphasizing the important role of the international
financial institutions, the statement also noted that the G-7 will
continue to work together with other members of the international
community to further strengthen the global financial system.

The G-7 ministers reaffirmed their strong commitment to
achieving further progress in delivering debt relief to poor
countries committed to poverty reduction. However, the statement

of successful economic and social reform in those countries is
imperative.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices to Drop on Monday: OPEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) said Saturday that oil prices will drop
as from Monday after the United States announced the release of 30
million barrels from its strategic reserves.
</P>
<P>
"It is reported that the Texas crude has dropped 1.30 dollars
per barrel and something similar is happening with the North Sea
Brent," said OPEC chairman Ali Rodriguez, who is also Mines and
Energy Minister of Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, who will chair an OPEC summit from September 26 to
28, said that there is no problem of oil supply. He argued that
OPEC is not responsible for the high oil prices, now reaching more
than 37 dollars per barrel. Market speculation is to blame, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the prices will drop as from Monday after the U.S.
announced Friday to release 30 million barrels of its reserves and
the OPEC has decided to increase crude supply by 800,000 barrels
