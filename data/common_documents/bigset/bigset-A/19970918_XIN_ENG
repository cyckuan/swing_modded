<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The exposition of the
international situation and China's foreign policy in the report
by Jiang Zemin at the on-going Party Congress is of great
significance for guiding China's cross-century foreign affairs,
said Chinese diplomats here today.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats, who are delegates attending the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China, said Jiang's report has
carried forward and developed Deng Xiaoping's thinking on
diplomatic affairs, stressing the most outstanding characteristics
of the current international situation.
</P>
<P>
"The report has evaluated the achievements China has scored in
foreign relations over the recent five years and explained the
current international situation in a down-to-earth manner," said
Liu Huaqiu, director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the State
Council and vice-minister of foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The report has also worked out a principle for China's
diplomatic work in a down-to-earth manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang Jiaxuan, vice-minister of foreign affairs, said Jiang
Zemin made a penetrating analysis of the current international
situation with a focus on the two themes in the present era --
peace and development.
</P>
<P>
He said the most important part in Deng Xiaoping's thinking on
diplomatic affairs is the formulation of correct principles and
policy after timely, proper analysis and judgement of the
international situation.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
noted the excellent and important point Jiang Zemin has made in
his report is to respect the diversity of the world and to work to
bring about a just and rational new international political and
economic order.

<P>
In Tang Jiaxuan's view, it is an important point of Deng
Xiaoping's thinking on foreign affairs that foreign affairs should
not be handled on the basis of differences in social system and
ideology between countries. This point has also found expression
in Jiang Zemin's report to the Party Congress, which said: "We
should further improve and develop our relations with developed
countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence."
</P>
<P>
The most fundamental reason why China's diplomatic efforts in
the past five years could overcome difficulties to create a new
situation is that the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at
the core has correctly implemented the thinking and theory of Deng
Xiaoping on diplomatic work and combine them with the country's
actual conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We owe every major success we have won and every strategic
step we have taken to Deng Xiaoping's thinking on diplomatic
work," he added.
</P>
<P>
The essence and soul of the part contained in Jiang's report on
China's foreign affairs is the sentence: "It is necessary to adhere
to the ideas of Deng Xiaoping about diplomatic work and firmly
pursue an independent foreign policy of peace," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang said: "Deng Xiaoping's ideas about diplomatic work
will continue to be the guiding ideology of our foreign affairs in
future."
</P>
<P>
Of course, the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the
core firmly implemented Deng Xiaoping Theory in the past five
years, succeeding in boosting China's economic development and
enhancing the comprehensive strength of the country.
</P>
<P>
Looking into the future of China's diplomatic work at the turn
of the century, Chinese diplomats held that challenges co-exist
with opportunities.

<P>
A very important point Jiang has made in his report, Shen said,
is his exposition of the international situation. "For a fairly
long period of time to come, it will be possible to avert a new
world war and secure a favorable, peaceful international
environment," the foreign ministry spokesman quoted Jiang Zemin as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jiang also pointed out that the present-day world is
still insecure. It is also a brilliant and dialectical exposition,
said Shen.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yongxiang, China's ambassador to the People's
Democratic Republic of Korea, said,"The remarks on foreign
affairs by Jiang Zemin have embodied China's highest national
interest, and we all Chinese diplomats must resolutely implement
them."
</P>
<P>
"It is an important guiding principle for our embassy work to
adhere to Deng Xiaoping's thinking on foreign affairs, opposing
hegemony, safeguarding world peace and developing good-neighborly
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said that China's has scored outstanding
achievements in foreign affairs, which helped bring about an
excellent international relations.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqiu owed these achievements to the full implementation of
Deng Xiaoping's thinking on foreign affairs by the CPC Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
According to Shen Guofang, China has further improved relations
with its neighboring countries since the beginning of the 1990s in
accordance with the strategic principle set by Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, we have withstood the pressure of 'sanctions' by a
few Western countries. So far, many countries, including some
Western countries, are willing to establish a new type of normal
and healthy cooperative relations with China geared to the 21st
century," said Shen.

<P>
To seize the opportunity and meet the challenge to create a
better international environment is to firmly implement the 10
basic principles set in Jiang Zemin's report on diplomatic work
and implement the independent foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member state of the UN Security Council, Tang
said, China is to double its efforts for multi-lateral diplomatic
work. In the wake of a global trend toward multipolarity, China
should make new contributions to the development and peace in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The multi-lateral diplomatic work commands a wide range of
subject. It includes not only the United Nations and the
international organizations under it but also regional and
continent-to-continent political and economic organizations and
various kinds of seminars and talks in terms of economic
cooperation, safety and disarmament, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We should take an active part in these seminars and talks," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang said enthusiastic participation in the
multi-lateral diplomatic work is the requirement for establishing
a just and rational new international political and economic
order. It will further promote the global polarization, which
benefits the maintenance of world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqiu said the 10 basic requirements set in Jiang's report
is a historic conclusion based on experience. Therefore, it is of
historic significance. They are the reliable guarantee for
implementing the independent foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
"By firmly implementing these requirements," Liu said, "we can
improve and develop our relations with surrounding countries,
strengthen solidarity and cooperation with other developing
countries, improve and expand relations with developed countries
on the basis of five principles of peaceful coexistence, make
progress in economic and technological cooperation and scientific
and cultural exchanges on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit, play a bigger role in the UN and other international
organizations, develop relations with political parties in other
countries and boost non-governmental diplomatic work," he said.
</P>
<P>
In this way, he said, China will further raise its
international status, exert more influence on international
affairs, and make fresh headway in its diplomatic work.

<HEADLINE> 12 Killed in A UN Helicopter Crash in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, Bosnia, September 17 (Xinhua)-- A UN helicopter with
16 people on board crashed today in central Bosnia. Twelve people,
including a senior international mediator, were killed, according
to AP reports.
</P>
<P>
The only survivors appeared to be the four crew members, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
German envoy Gerd Wagner, one of the most senior diplomats
stationed in Bosnia, was killed in the crash. Wagner, 55, was a
deputy to Carlos Westendorp of Spain, the high representative to
Bosnia in charge of trying to implement peace.
</P>
<P>
Wagner was one of five people from Westendorp's office on
board. The other four included two Germans, a Briton and an
American, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Neither the identities nor nationalities of the seven other
passengers killed were immediately known.
</P>
<P>
UN spokesman Liam McDowall said 11 of the 16 passengers were
killed in today's crash. Western diplomats who spoke on condition
of anonymity later increased that figure to 12, and said two of
the four crew members received minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst accident involving international envoys in the
Balkans since April 3, 1996, when a plane carrying U.S. Commerce
Secretary Ron Brown from Tuzla, Bosnia, to Dubrovnik, Croatia,
plowed into a mountain in a heavy storm.
</P>
<P>
According to one of the survivors, the weather was fine when
the helicopter left Sarajevo, but it encountered dense fog west of
Fojnica, 20 miles east of Bugojno, McDowall said.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter, likely a Soviet-made Mi6HIP, was leased to the
United Nations by Ukraine, said UN spokesman Alexander Ivanko.
</P>
<P>
Ivanko said the helicopter left Sarajevo at 9:15 a.m. (3:15
a.m. EDT), headed for Bugojno and the northern town of Brcko.
</P>
<P>
At least one UN and two NATO helicopters were sent to the crash
site to search for survivors and possible clues as to the cause of
the crash.

<HEADLINE> International Symposium on Occupational Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A three-day international
symposium on occupational health started here today under the
theme: Risk Reduction In the Workplace.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, held for the first time in Africa, was being
attended by over 200 occupational health practitioners from
Europe, Africa, Asia and Americas.
</P>
<P>
It aimed to provide a forum for exchange of information on
methodologies and applications of research on occupational
health.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organisation estimates that 10 million
workers are injured and a further million contract occupational
diseases annually throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
At her opening address, Zimbabwean Minister of Public Service,
Labour and Social Welfare Florence Chitauro said during the past
10 years, an average of 150 occupational diseases have been
recorded annually in Zimbabwe against a background of about
20,000 work-related injuries and 250 fatalities.
</P>
<P>
However, she said Zimbabwe had since reviewed and strengthened
its laws and tripartite systems and built skills that promoted
sound occupational health practice.
</P>
<P>
Chairperson of the Zimbabwe Occupational Health and Safety
Council Rene Loewenson said that globalisation had ushered in
production processes that posed additional health hazards for the
african continent grappling with falling health budgets.
</P>
<P>
she noted that occupational epidemiologists and professionals
in southern Africa faced the difficult task of distinguishing
between ''occupational'' and ''work related'' risks, particularly
in light of the HIV/AIDS pandemic which, in some cases,
threatened to wipe out the entire workforces.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Trails Russia in Race to Build AN-70 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 17 (Xinhua)-- Russia could soon be selling the
AN-70 military transport plane developed jointly with Ukraine to
foreign buyers while Ukrainian production lines for the aircraft
remain grounded, local newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Russian is getting ready to manufacture the plane while it's
still unclear when we will be able to start producing the AN-70
here in kiev," Antonov Design Bureau Director Petro Balabuyev was
quoted as saying at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said if money to start mass production at the Aviant plant
in Kiev was not available soon, Ukraine would lost AN-70 orders to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Cash-strapped Ukraine and Russia agreed to share the high cost
of the AN-70's development and arranged production so that neither
country could take the lead in mass producing. Ukraine and Russia
are to assemble the planes independently but share the production
of components.

<HEADLINE> US Housing Starts Down to Lowest Level This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Construction of new homes
in the U.S. declined in August to the lowest level this year, U.S.
Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that housing starts fell by 4.8 percent to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.36 million, the lowest
level since last December.
</P>
<P>
It was also the third decrease in the past four months and the
sharpest since a 5.5 decline in April.
</P>
<P>
The report said that housing starts of single-family homes last
month fell by 5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
1.07 million, the sharpest drop in five months. Apartment building
declined by 4.3 percent to a rate of 291,000.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, the starts plunged 19.2 percent in the Northeast --
the largest drop since February. They also fell 3.8 percent in the
West, 3.5 percent in the Midwest and 2.7 percent in the South.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, housing starts in the U.S. are running 4
percent below last year's pace, when they hit an eight-year high
of 1.48 million.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said strong demand for housing, fueled by plentiful
jobs and low mortgage rates, would almost certainly revive home
building from August's level, although not past last year's
record.
</P>
<P>
However, applications for building permits -- a barometer of
future building plans -- fell nationally by 1.6 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.39 million in August. They
fell for both single-family homes and apartments.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean President May Release Predecessors Before Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam is likely to give special pardon to jailed former
presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo before the December
election, a high-ranking government official said today.
</P>
<P>
Kim has maintained a position of pardoning Chun and Roh at an
appropriate time after the presidential election, but it is highly
likely that he will grant the amnesty before the presidential
election as a result of Kyonggi Governor Rhee In-je's entry into
the race last week, the official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Rhee announced last Saturday his intention to bolt from the
ruling New Korea Party and run into the election on his own, thus
forcing the ruling party and its presidential candidate Lee
Hoi-chang to face difficulties in the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The president said earlier this month that pardon for Chun and
Roh is a grave issue which should not be resolved by political
considerations.
</P>
<P>
However, the source added that the possibility of Kim moving up
the timing of the special pardon cannot be ruled out in the light
of the need to facilitate unity of all political forces in the
ruling camp under Lee's leadership.
</P>
<P>
The latest opinion polls show Lee and Rhee lagged behind
opposition leader Kim Dae-jung, who is making his fourth bid for
the presidency at his 70s.
</P>
<P>
The special pardon would be a wooing gesture to Kyongsang
Province voters, the home town of the two presidents, in the
forthcoming presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Delinquency Rate on Credit Cards Increases in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of Americans
overdue on their credit-card bills increased sharply during the
April-June quarter after falling a bit in the first quarter, the
American Bankers Association (ABA) said today.
</P>
<P>
The delinquency rate -- the percentage of accounts 30 or more
days overdue -- was up to a seasonally adjusted 3.69 percent in
the second quarter from 3.51 percent in the previous three months,
the ABA report said.
</P>
<P>
It was near the all-time record of 3.72 percent set during the
last three months of 1996, comparing with the 2.56 percent three
year ago.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in consumers falling behind on credit-card
bills has coincided with an explosion in personal bankruptcies,
which reached a record 1.26 million during the 12 months ended
June 30.
</P>
<P>
But based on total dollars outstanding, rather than the number
of accounts, delinquencies dropped to 5.24 percent in the second
quarter from 5.43 percent in the first.
</P>
<P>
The ABA said that bank lenders have been tightening credit
standards during the past year and a half.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a composite delinquency rate for a variety of
closed-end consumer loans -- as opposed to open-ended credit such
as credit cards and home equity loans -- also increased to 2.55
percent in the second quarter, driven by an increase in auto loan
delinquencies. That's up from 2.47 percent in the previous quarter
and the highest in five years.

<HEADLINE> Dutch GDP to Expand in 1997: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product
(GDP) of the Netherlands will grow by 3.25 percent this year, the
same as in 1996, said an official report.
</P>
<P>
The growth, according to the latest quarterly report published
by the Netherlands' Central Planning Bureau, is the result of a
robust economic expansion and subdued inflation.
</P>
<P>
The underlying indicators are actually more encouraging,
suggesting a growth rate of 3.75 percent, a figure projected for
next year, the government agency said in the report.
</P>
<P>
Though the U.S. dollar and pound sterling have appreciated
strongly this year, it said, fierce competition on the domestic
market and efficiency improvements are keeping inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
The trend in labor costs remains moderate, opening the way for
further rises in company earnings, and the current 2 percent
annual employment growth is likely to be sustained, it said.

LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) - Unemployment figure in Britain
fell by 48,600 last month to their lowest total for 17 years,
according to official figures released here today.
</P>
<P>
The Office For National Statistics said the number of people
out of work and claiming unemployment benefit dropped to
1,496,600, giving a jobless rate of 5.3% of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
It was the 18th consecutive fall in the seasonally adjusted
total, which is now at its lowest level since 1980.
</P>
<P>
Another main component of the day's statistics was average
earnings. Underlying earnings grew by 4.5% in the year to July, up
from 4.25% the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government said the unemployment and earnings data
triggered to inflationary alarm bells.
</P>
<P>
However, employment minister Andrew Smith was quoted as saying
that "There is no room for complacency... but it would be wrong to
draw alarm signals from the unemployment figures today."
</P>
<P>
"I believe today's numbers are consistent with the sustainable
growth that the UK government figure is determined to achieve," he

<HEADLINE> Nine Germans Killed in Cairo's Terrorist Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Suspected Muslim militants
attacked a bus in the busiest quarter of downtown Cairo at noon
today, killing nine German tourists.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Rahian Shehata, Governor of Cairo told reporters that
nine foreign tourists were also injured when three attackers
opened fire and threw some bombs into a parked tourist bus in
front of the Egyptian Antiquities Museum.
</P>
<P>
The injured were rushed to Kasr al-Eini Hospital for treatment,
he said, adding that the attack was timed to create the utmost
upheaval as the place it targeted was the world famous trove of
Pharaonic treasures sitting on the edge of Taharir Square, Cairo's
most crowded commercial and business center.
</P>
<P>
As the first bomb went off, at least 33 tourists were inside
the bus. The white bus was gutted black and its glass windows were
all broken.
</P>
<P>
Foreign tourists, shocked and some sobbed, were ushered away
from the museum, one of Egypt's most famous tourist attraction and
usually heavily-guarded.
</P>
<P>
An Australian, identified herself as Laura, told Xinhua that
the police and the attackers exchanged fire. "Just minutes,
explosions, fire, bullets, and hell... I was waiting at the gate
for others to come out (of the museum)."
</P>
<P>
A police officer, told reporters that two of the attackers,
identified as Saber Mahmoud Farahat Abul Ela and his brother
Mahmoud were wounded and arrested, while the third fled the scene.
</P>
<P>
The police, carrying riot shields and automatic rifles, has
cordoned off the roads leading to the Taharir Square, the city's
central transit point, leading to a near paralysis of the
transportation in adjoining neighborhoods for hours.
</P>
<P>
The area is being combed in hunt for any of their cohorts and
to secure it from any further possible bomb threats, according to
the police.
</P>
<P>
A police officer, on condition of anonymity, said that the
attackers were wearing business suits in an apparent attempt to
avoid attention in the super-crowded city center that hosts a
number of government offices and plush hotels.
</P>
<P>
Cairo Security Chief Major General Mohamed Abdel Latif said
that the assailants were immediately overpowered by the museum's
security guards after the explosions.
</P>
<P>
Today's bomb attack was the latest in a five-year violent
campaign launched by Muslim militants since 1992 to overthrow the
secular government and install a strict Islamic rule in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,200 people have been killed in the violence, including
tourists, police officers and Coptic Christians. Most of the
attacks took place in Upper Egypt, hideouts for most militants.
</P>
<P>
It is suspected that the attack was launched to retaliate
against the country's single largest trial of 98 Muslim militants
three days ago.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian military tribunal condemned to death and hanged
four Muslims and meted out various prison terms to 69 others
convicted of staging major terrorist attacks to topple the
government.
</P>
<P>
In the previous attack on foreigners, Muslim militants opened
fire on a group of Greek tourists in Cairo's Europa Hotel in April
1996, killing 18 and injuring 16.
</P>
<P>
Germany has been the largest tourist exporting country to
Egypt. A total of 460,000 Germans visited Egypt in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Iran Launches Most Extensive Military Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran today unfolded its most
extensive joint military exercises ever in Koushk-Nosrat and
around the Qom lake, about 150 kilometers south of capital Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that 200,000 troops
of the navy, ground and air forces took part in the first stage of
the week-long war games code-named Zolfaqar.
</P>
<P>
The joint military exercises are a very effective means of
displaying the capability and defense strength of the army in
dealing with possible threats, military experts said.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier-General Mohammad Mahmoudi said that 10 independent
divisions or brigades and artillery units took part in today's
maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
The participating troops backed by heavy artillery fire
advanced toward hypothetical enemy positions while parachutists on
board C-130 cargo planes landed behind the enemies, he said.
</P>
<P>
After capturing the enemy positions, they then launched
mopping-up operations with support of choppers, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoudi said this stage of the exercises were aimed to prepare
the forces for the main attack.
</P>
<P>
Major General Ali Shahbazi, chief of the joint staff of the
Iranian army, said earlier that the exercises would be an
expert-level one comprising different drillings including defense
against chemical attacks and electronic warfare, to be overseen by
some 200 military experts.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Iranian-made planes and tanks would be tested
and live ammunition would be used throughout the operations.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends to Strengthen UN Role in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today recommended to further strengthen the role of the
United Nations in Somalia by adding another professional staff
member to the United Nations Political Office for Somalia(UNPOS)
and convening an ambassador-level meeting on Somalia.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said developments
since the Nairobe understanding and the Sodere declarations, the
agreements reached in Mogadishu and the Sana'a and Cairo
agreements, had given rise to hope that the Somalia parties might
have finally arrived at a stage where they would engage in serious
consultations for peace.
</P>
<P>
Annan recommended to hold a meeting on Somalia at the
ambassador level at Headquarters in September, 1997, chaired by
the Under-Secretary-General of the Department of Political
Affairs, which would aim at harmonizing views on mechanism and
measures to maximize the international community's efforts to help
Somalia achieve national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the U.N. chief also proposed to adding another
professional staff member to the UNPOS.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed the political process in Somalia was at another
critical juncture and the international community would continue
to make every effort to help Somalia people in the relief,
rehabilitation, reconstruction and development fields.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Credit Card Delinquencies Near Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Credit card delinquencies in
U.S. jumped to 3.69 percent of accounts in the second quarter,
according to a new report by the American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
That's second only to the 3.72 percent recorded in the fourth
quarter of 1996, the ABA said.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcies that too often follow credit card
delinquencies are taking a toll on all card users. Card issuers
raise interest rates and fees to try to recoup losses.
</P>
<P>
The ABA said banks have tightened credit standards. But some
experts said they haven't done enough to keep a good control. Many
platinum cards offer 100,000 U.S. dollar credit lines.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1996, outstanding card credit totaled 1.8
trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Card issuers could stem rising delinquencies by shrinking
credit lines and terminating inactive accounts, experts say.

<HEADLINE> French FM: Outsiders Cannot Help Solve Algeria's Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine today said he believed that no outsider can offer a
solution to the five-year-old conflict in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
"I say it with much sadness... no one is capable of bringing a
satisfying answer to the Algerian tragedy," Vedrine said. France
is Algeria's former colonial power and its largest trade partner.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine's remarks came after the United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan offered to mediate between the
Algerian government and Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Annan's offer was rejected by the Algerian government, which
called it an interference into the country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Muslim fundamentalists have been battling the authorities since
early 1992, when the government canceled a general election in
which radical Islamists were on the verge of a victory.
</P>
<P>
Some 60,000 people have been killed in the violence
thereafter.

<HEADLINE> Sight Restoration Program in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A team of ophthalmologists
specializing in cataract surgery have arrived in Gongbo'gyamda
County in southeastern Tibet to launch today a Sight Restoration
Program sponsored in part by the Beijing-based Red Cross
Foundation of China.
</P>
<P>
Herdswoman Jiji, 63, was the first of some 200 patients to
queue at the Gongbo'gyamda People's Hospital. The team performed
eight surgical procedures this afternoon alone.
</P>
<P>
Gongjue, the elderly woman's son-in-law, noted that they had
traveled over 100 km by horseback. "My mother-in-law has suffered
loss of vision due to cataracts for over eight years," said
Gongjue. "We came here upon hearing that Beijing was sending a
high-level medical team to perform free cataract surgery."
</P>
<P>
Liu Ping, who performed the 30 minute surgical procedure on
Jiji, said her vision is to be restored withing two days. Liu said
that state-of-the-art ultrasonic emulsifiers were being used to
implant artificial crystals, a technique being used for the first
time ever in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Following the operation, Jiji told her son-in-law that "The
doctor from Beijing has brought me good luck, and now I will be
able to once again see my ten children and grandchildren."
</P>
<P>
Local officials attribute Tibet's high incidence of cataracts,
one of the highest in the nation, to the strong ultraviolet rays
on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Some 600 of 5,000 Tibetans currently
suffering from cataracts will undergo surgery as part of the Red
Cross Foundation program.
</P>
<P>
Another team of ophthalmologists left Lhasa today for Nagarze
County in Shannan Prefecture.

SINGAPORE, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The haze situation in
Singapore worsened this evening with the three-hourly Pollutant
Standards Index (PSI) reading hitting an all-time high of 226 at
10 p.m., the Environment Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the PSI reading of 226 was higher than the

<HEADLINE> Japanese Securities Brokerage Raided Over Payoff Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan's third biggest
securities brokerage was raided by prosecutors and the country's
securities watchdog today over payoffs to a corporate racketeer.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office and the Securities
and Exchange Surveillance Commission suspect that, by making the
payoffs, Daiwa Securities Co. violated Japan's Commercial Code.
</P>
<P>
Investigators alleged that Daiwa officials in 1995 extended
over 67 million yen (560,000 U.S. dollars) to Ryuichi Koike, a
corporate racketeer, or "sokaiya" in Japanese, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Daiwa also allegedly complied a demand by Koike to compensate
investment losses of 300 million yen (2.5 million dollars) in his
illegal discretionary stock transactions beginning in August 1992.
</P>
<P>
The compensation, said the sources close to the investigation,
was in violation of the Securities and Exchange Law.
</P>
<P>
In their operation today, prosecutors searched several Daiwa
facilities including its head office, and homes of its executives.
</P>
<P>
It came a day after the arrest of five former and current
executives of Yamaichi Securities Co., the smallest of Japan's
"Big Four" securities brokerages, for extending payoffs to Koike.
</P>
<P>
Koike, already in custody and indicted in a similar payoff
scandal involving Japan's biggest brokerage Nomura Securities
Co. and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, was served a fresh arrest warrant
Wednesday on suspicion of the Yamaichi payoff.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are also reportedly investigating allegations that
Nikko Securities Co., the remainder of the "Big Four," has given
payoffs of up to 10 million yen (83,000 dollars) to Koike.
</P>
<P>
Payoffs to "sokaiya" are banned under the Commercial Code, and
reimbursing stock transaction loss and discretionary securities
trading are illegal under the Securities and Exchange Law.
</P>
<P>
However, the financial institutions find it very difficult to
cut off ties with corporate racketeers like Koike, who can
determine the businesses of these institutions by possessing large
amount of their shares through illegal means.
</P>
<P>
Eight top executive of Daiwa will soon resign to take
responsibility for the payoff scandal, and Nikko is also likely to
drastically reshuffle its top management, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Round of Economic Restructuring Expected in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Marked by a proposition of
diversified forms to realize public ownership, China is brewing up
a strategic restructuring of state-owned enterprises in a deeper sense,
so as to basically establish a system of socialist market
economy by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
In this course China's economic restructuring as a whole is
expected to do deeper.
</P>
<P>
"China is targeting at the most formidable block, the reforms
of state-owned enterprises, on its way to economic restructuring,"
said Professor Gao Shangquan, vice president with the China
Society for Economic Restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Theoretical breakthroughs concerning the connotation of public
ownership, manifestations of its dominant position in the
national economy, and diversified forms of
public ownership in the report delivered by Jiang Zemin at the
National Congress of the Communist Party which was just ended
earlier today, will lend a powerful impetus to a
new round of economic reform, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
His report indicated that any ownership forms in accordance with
"the three favorables" -- favorable to promoting the productive
forces in a socialist society, increasing the overall strength of
the socialist state and raising the people's living standards,
can be employed.
</P>
<P>
These remarks, it is widely believed, have laid a theoretical
foundation for breakthroughs to be scored in economic
restructuring, state-owned enterprises in particular.
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of Prof. Gao, the forthcoming economic
restructuring will be characterized by an improved structure of
ownership, a shrink in the number of the state businesses but
a higher efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Gao added, enterprises will effectively
become the main subject of the market competition, capital flow
will be facilitated, and the role of government will be
transformed to indirect control of the enterprises.

<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Communist veteran
who attended the 15th National Party Congress said the week-long
congress was "very successful", and it was really a congress that
"has inherited the past and ushered in the future."
</P>
<P>
Bo Yibo, 89, the Communist veteran, made the remarks in an
interview with the press right after attending the closing session
of the five-yearly congress which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
He urged all the Chinese Communist Party members to
unswervingly rally around the CPC Central Committee with Jiang
Zemin at the core and hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory to advance the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics
into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"Heavy responsibilities are ahead in invigorating the Chinese
nation," said Bo Yibo who expressed his firm belief that China
would be in the rank of the medium-developed countries by the time
of the centenary of the founding of the People's Republic of
China, and achieve the strategic objectives set forth by the late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New Round of Economic Restructuring Expected in China-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While strengthening development of 1,000 large-and medium-sized
enterprises which have a bearing on the national economy, China
will allow a great number of state-owned enterprises to gear to
market operation, encouraging them to run in any forms of
organization such as the systems of joint stock and joint stock
partnership so as to invigorate the state sector as a whole and
make the state-owned sector to supplement each other with the
non-state-owned sector for a common development.
</P>
<P>
Reform of the state-owned enterprises has been deemed as the
key in structural reform.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics have shown that China has 300,000
state-owned enterprises, 13,000 of which are large-and
medium-sized ones. Some are in a difficult position as a result of
an inflexible mechanism, posing a trouble for the sustained and
sound economic development in China.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongyu, Minister in charge of the State Economic and
Trade Commission, said the state will make a breakthrough in the
reform of state-owned enterprises in terms of five aspects
including innovation of systems, structural readjustment,
strategic reorganization of the national economy, "emphasizing the
bigger enterprises while giving a free reign to smaller ones", and
merger and bankruptcy of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to build basically a modern enterprise system in the
majority of key large- and medium-sized enterprises, with marked
improvement in their performance, he added.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to push forward development of joint
stock system at state-owned enterprises, improve capital market,
lower the debt ratio and expand the capital fund of enterprises
by raising funds on the capital market.
</P>
<P>
With deepening of reforms in the micro-economy centered around
the improvement of the state-owned enterprises, some economists
held, the macro-economic reforms in such fields as investment,
finance and social security will be further accelerated as well.

<P>
LHASA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Tibetans have displayed strong
support for the unity and stability of the motherland during the
15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Numerous well-known Tibetans who have returned from abroad have
praised Jiang Zemin's work report presented at the opening of the
congress. They were especially pleased with Jiang's stress on
upholding the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and modernizing
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"Jiang's report summarized China's experiences over the past
century and outlined the country's long-term plan," according to
Gyibug Puncogcedain, a member of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). "I'm
fully confident of future economic development in Tibet."
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan splittist clique headed by the Dalai Lama is intent
on hindering social stability and economic development in Tibet
and can in no way win support from the people, said
Puncogcedain. "We will closely unite around the CPC Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core and maintain a clear mind
in order to promote national unity and economic development."
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the Regional Nationality and
Religious Affairs Commission, "Tibet has achieved notable progress
in all fields since the introduction of the reform and opening
drive and we must treasure hard-earned stability."

The official stressed that it is essential to implement
patriotic education in local lama temples due to the fact that
some lamas have engaged in splittist activities under the banner
of religion and their actions have produced very bad influence.
</P>
<P>
He quoted the 10th Bainqen Lama as saying that "Temples should
look like temples, and lamas should act like lamas."
</P>
<P>
Qangngoiba Doje'ngoizhu, a member of the CPPCC National
Committee, said: "The education sector in Tibet has blossomed
since liberation in the 1950s. Tibet now has some 4,000 schools
with a total of 320,000 students, and 73.5 percent of local
school-aged children have access to education."
</P>
<P>
Priority has been placed on ensuring that all local schools
offer courses in the Tibetan language, he added.

confident about women's affairs in Tibet," said Yangjin.

<P>
Ma Yugui, a member of the Regional Committee of the CPPCC,
blamed a small group of foreigners for spreading rumors about
Tibet. "I was born in old Tibet and I am thoroughly familiar with
the region," said Yangjin. "They simply want to deceive people in
other countries."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls on US, Britain not to Block Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraq called on U.S. and
Britain to stop obstructing the approval of contracts signed by
Iraq with foreign companies, Iraq News Agency (INA) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In a message forwarded by Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf to U.N. Security Council which was published by INA
today, the minister underlined the necessity of maintaining a
balance between selling Iraqi oil and supplying Iraq with food and
medicines in implementation of the U.N. Security Council
Resolution 986.
</P>
<P>
"Though more than 100 days have passed by since the first stage
of the oil-for-food deal expired, there are still 60 contracts
have not been submitted to the U.N. Sanctions Committee," he said,
adding that more than 70 contracts were suspended at the request
of the U.S. and Britain and 21 contracts were disapproved by the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The message said that that the credibility of the U.N. Security
Council, especially that of the U.S. is questionable. It demands
balance between selling Iraqi oil and supplying it with food and
medicines and the issue should be addressed in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
Iraq declared to have its oil exports suspended in June to
protest against U.N. tardiness in approving the contracts signed
by Iraq with foreign companies, as well as the role played by the
U.S. in this connection.
</P>
<P>
U.N. and Iraq signed the oil-for-food deal in May 1996 which
allows Iraq to export 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over a
six month period to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
goods for its people who are suffering under U.N.-imposed sanction
against Iraq following Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The
U.N. renewed another six months period of the deal on June 4, which
allows Iraq to sell 2 billion dollars of oil as of June 8.

<HEADLINE> ADB Approves Loan to Finance Thai Rural Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) said today it has approved a 200 million U.S. dollar loan to
help Thailand finance its rural enterprises to improve rural house
incomes.
</P>
<P>
The loan is part of the bank's 1.2 billion dollar assistance
package announced by the Manila-based financial body to support
the country's economic stabilization program.
</P>
<P>
Because of an overheated property sector and some serious
problems in the banking system, Thailand has been hit by a
prolonged financial crisis since February this year.
</P>
<P>
The ADB has committed to help bail Thailand out of the current
crisis along with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and some
countries.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to finance 54,000 rural enterprises in
the country under a rural enterprise credit project, the ADB said
in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to create 127,000 full-time jobs in the
country's poorest provinces, which are particularly vulnerable to
Thailand's current macroeconomic difficulties, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The project will also strengthen its executing agency, the
state-owned Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives, in
loan processing, supervision and customer services.
</P>
<P>
Despite Thailand's rapid economic growth in recent years,
household incomes in rural areas are only a quarter of those in
urban areas, mainly because of low agricultural productivity and a
lack of employment opportunities, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be from the ADB's ordinary capital resources,
with interest to be determined in accordance with the bank's
pool-based variable lending rate system for U.S. dollar loans.

<HEADLINE> Senior Trade Official Confident in Enterprise Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The theoretical breakthroughs
in the exposition of ownership made by the 15th National Congress
of the Communist Party of China will further promote the reform of
China's state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the State Economic and
Trade Commission, said progress will be made in the reorganization
of state-owned enterprises, readjustment of economic structures
and enterprise merge and bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The state will place special emphasis on managing well 1,000
key large state-owned enterprises based on the experiment in 512
large enterprises while adopting a more flexible policy in other
state-owned enterprises, Wang said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The major tasks in the reform of state-owned enterprises will
be structural readjustment, reducing the swelling structure which
is resulted from overlapping construction and intensifying the
work on enterprises'merger and bankruptcy, he said.
</P>
<P>
This year, China is to increase the amount of funds earmarked
for writing off bad debts caused by bankruptcy of state-owned
enterprises from this year's 30 billion yuan to 40 billion yuan in
1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
Though some state-owned enterprises are still in difficulty,
preliminary results have been achieved in the readjustment and
reform of the state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Wang said, the amount of
profits gained by the state-owned enterprises increased by 115
percent compared with that in the same period of last year.
State-owned enterpriss in 20 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities, or two thirds of the national total, have improved
their efficiency so far this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the reform will not prevent all enterprises from
bankruptcy. The joint stock system will play a bigger role in
enterprise reform, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We should neither rush headlong into mass action nor demand
mandatory practice in implementing the shareholding system and
joint stock partnership," he said.
</P>
<P>
China will speed up development of capital market. Direct
fund-raising is to be a major channel to increase capital for
state-owned enterprises. Meanwhile the flow of capital through
market will be a principal form in building enterprise groups,
Wang said.

BRUSSELS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- About 15 percent of the
employed people in the 15-member European Union (EU) say they are
happy with working on part-time basis.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of the part-timers aged 25 or over say they
don't want to have a full-time job, shows a poll by Eurostat, the
EU's statistical office based in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Part-time jobs appear to be most prevalent in the Netherlands
engaging 38 percent of the respondents while it is least so in
Greece involving only five percent of those surveyed.
</P>
<P>
"Part-time work is often seen as a policy measure to increase
the number of employed persons by promoting work-sharing,"
explains the Eurostat report summarizing the poll results.
</P>
<P>
For businesses, it says, part-time jobs can be an efficient
tool to respond to peaks in demand for goods and services in a
particular period or to extend the opening hours.

<HEADLINE> Manila Denies Plan to Suspend Talks With Leftists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
today denied planning to terminate its on-going fruitless peace
negotiations with the National Democratic Front (NDF), a leftist
alliance led by the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Howard Dee, chief negotiator in the talks with
the NDF, said the government has no plans or intentions to suspend
the three-year-long peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Dee was reacting to reports that the NDF has threatened to stop
negotiating with the government due to continuous military and
police offensives against its military arm, the New People's Army
(NPA).
</P>
<P>
"We have no such intentions and we have just sent a new
schedule of talks to the NDF that would allow both sides to
complete the negotiations by March 1998," Dee said.
</P>
<P>
But Dee failed to confirm whether the government received the
NDF warning of withdrawal from the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Dee admitted that the talks are in a difficult stage as the NDF
has rejected the government's reformulated draft of a
comprehensive agreement on human rights and international
humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
The government has offered to come up with a revised draft of
the human rights and international humanitarian agreement that
could be more acceptable to the NDF, Dee said.
</P>
<P>
The NDF has fought the government for decades since its
establishment by the CPP in 1969. The military estimated that the
group has about 6,300 armed men currently, a sharp reduction from
more than 10,000 in the 1980s due to intensified military
crackdown.

SHENYANG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Beijing resident Jia
Yuanliang, 33, left Shenyang, capital of northeast China's
Liaoning Province, toady on a 1,500-km trek to mark the September
18th Incident.
</P>
<P>
Jia will walk 20 km per day and expects to reach Nanjing,
capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, in 86 days.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six years ago, on September 18th, the Japanese
bombardment of a railway section in Shenyang heralded the
beginning of Japan's military invasion of China.
</P>
<P>
Jia plans to arrive in Nanjing on December 13, the 60th
anniversary of the bloody "Nanjing Massacre".
</P>
<P>
Japanese troops captured the city in the winter of 1937 and
perpetrated a six-week massacre which led to the death of over
300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to ensure that people will never forget the history
of Japanese aggression," said Jia, adding that he hopes for a
world of peace and generations of friendship between the Chinese
and the Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
Jia resigned his well-paying job with a foreign-funded
enterprise and began preparing for the trek one year ago.

MOSCOW, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin said today that Russia would accept no financial aid from
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) starting from 1999, local
press reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the remarks during his one-day inspection of the
Orel region near Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia will carry on reforms by relying on itself from
1999 though it will continue receiving IMF aid in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
This shows that Russia has made great achievements in the
reforms, Yeltsin noted.
</P>
<P>
Talking about joining the Paris Club, Yeltsin said, this was
the result of Russia's successful economic and diplomatic efforts.
</P>

However, he also spoke highly of the "outstanding work" of the
industrialized country and their leaders that have great impacts
on the club on the matter of Russia's club membership.

Russia itself is a large creditor nation inheriting 190 billion
U.S. dollars from the former Soviet Union, he said, and would get

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh government is
implementing an integrated nutrition project throughout the
country for reducing chronic malnutrition among the people.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to contribute significantly toward
reduction of infant and maternal mortality and bring about a
sustainable behavioral change in food intake pattern and caring
practices, government sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition is a serious problem in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five percent of children under five years old are
severely or moderately malnourished while 35 to 50 percent of new
born babies are below normal weight (less than 2,500 grams) and
about 70 percent of mothers and children suffer from
iron-deficiency anemia, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The prevalence of night blindness due to vitamin A deficiency
is 17 percent and iodine deficiency disorders affect 47 percent of
the people, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The causes of malnutrition have been identified as inadequate
food intake, poor health and bad feeding and eating practices, the
sources added.
</P>
<P>
The strategies adopted by the government for solving the issues
include accelerating formulation of a national nutrition program,
developing national expertise and capacity to control
malnutrition, strengthening existing nutrition activities and
establishing community-based nutrition interventions in a phased
manner, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Urged to Buy More Food From ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Federation of
Malaysia Consumer Associations (FOMCA) today urged the country to
import more food from fellow ASEAN countries following the
depreciation of its currency ringgit to check the current account
deficit.
</P>
<P>
FOMCA President Hamdan Adnan said a substantial portion of the
country's annual food import bill of over 8 billion ringgit (about
2.6 billion U.S. dollars) was due to imports from the advanced
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The weakening ringgit should prompt the government to buy more
foodstuff from ASEAN countries besides increasing local food
production," he was quoted by the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit has depreciated 20 percent against the U.S. dollar
since early July this year, with the exchange rate today closing
at 3.013/6, compared with 2.5 in early July.
</P>
<P>
Hamdan said neighboring ASEAN member countries like Indonesia,
the Philippines, Vietnam and Myanmar are producers of agricultural
products, from which Malaysia could import.
</P>
<P>
Regretting that "Malaysia's massive dependence on food imports
is due to the absence of an aggressive food production policy." he
said, "The strategy of increasing the price of agricultural
produce to increase farmer's income is not a sound one because it
only leads to inflation." "A better policy would be to make the
farmers increase their production."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysian Energy, Telecommunications and Posts
Minister Leo Moggie said today that the currency crisis faced by
Southeast Asian countries has made Malaysia 20 percent "poorer"
vis-a-vis its earlier financial standing.
</P>
<P>
Hence, he said, the country's industrial sector must buck up to
boost product quality to compete in the international market and
also draw up strategies for its goods to penetrate into new
markets.

CAIRO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak held talks today with Syrian President Hafez el-Assad on
the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Assad arrived in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria for a
visit that may last for three days.
</P>
<P>
The talks were also focused on the joint Arab action,
Arab-Turkish relations besides other issues of mutual interest,
the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
and Syrian Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Shara attended the talks held at Ras al-Teen Palace this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Wednesday night that the Egyptian-Syrian summit
fell within the framework of Arab consultations in the wake of
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's maiden trip to the
region to revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Mubarak also informed of the Syrian leader
of the outcome of his talks with Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel in Alexandria on Tuesday, which tackled Syrian-Turkish
ties.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is accusing Syria of sponsoring Kurdish separatist
rebels in its southeastern border region, while Damascus believes
that Ankara is trying to block its water supply from the Euphrates
River.
</P>
<P>
Tensions continue to rise as Turkey plans joint naval war games
with Israel and U.S. in eastern Mediterranean in mid-November,
which Syria fears to be targeted.
</P>

Demirel, keen to assure Mubarak that there is no problem
between Turkey and any Arab country, has asked Mubarak to make a

<P>
LAGOS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Nhgeria and Chad have agreed
to jointly build direct highway and power links to promote
greater!economic development.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the end of a three-day ministerial
meeting in the Nigerian capital of Abuja on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A communique of the meeting said the ministers had agreed "on
the options and the alternatives to be taken to actualize the
construction of direct highway and power links" between the two
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Details of the projects were not revealed, but Nigeria's
Minister of Works and Housing, Major-general Abdulkarim Adisa
said at the opening of the talks on Monday they might include a
964 million U.S. Dollars road and a 227 million Dollars power
transmission line.
</P>
<P>
According to Adisa, the main objective of building the road
link is to foster better relationship through free movement of
people between the two countries and strengthen bilateral trade
without hindrance or obstacle.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Chad are linked by the Trans-Saharan International
Route via Cameroun. At present, portions of the route are tarred,
but most of the 75-km road remains a dust road, seriously
hampering movement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A team of engineers from the two countries has been formed to
explore a route through Lake Chad, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
A 330-KV single circuit line and a sub-station will also be
built to send electricity from Nigeria to an industrial layout to
be situated along the Nigeria-Chad border.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary studies ildicated the power project is expected to
take three years to complete.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctors Help Deaf Kids to Speak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese public has long
taken it for granted that a deaf person is automatically
mute. But doctors here are trying to change the misperception by
teaching deaf kids to talk.
</P>
<P>
China has some 17 million people with hearing and speaking
deficiencies, accounting for 28 percent of the country's disabled
population. Of the deaf-mutes, about 740,000 are children under
age six, and the group is expanding by 20,000 to 40,000 youngsters
yearly.
</P>
<P>
Doctors here believe that a deaf child has the ability to
speak, provided he or she wears a hearing aid during early
childhood to pick up language and has a caring home environment.
</P>
<P>
With donations of three million yuan and some special medical
equipment, the China Hearing Medical Science Development Fund
launched "mobile hospitals" last year to provide free hearing
checks to children in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, the roving hospitals have toured over 20
poor counties in Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Shaanxi and Jiangxi
provinces, and diagnosed some 1,000 kids with hearing problems.
</P>
<P>
In Tongchan County, Shaanxi Province, doctors distributed
hearing aids to deaf children under six who have weak
hearing. Some of them regained their ability to speak properly
after training.
</P>
<P>
Doctors caution the public, pregnant women in poor rural areas
in particular, to be very careful about use of antibiotic
medications, which is believed to be one of the main causes of
congenital deafness.
</P>
<P>
They also volunteer to go to the countryside and give hearing
check-ups to children, and also to give language training courses
to professionals who will teach deaf children.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
today suspended Daiwa Securities, the Asian lead manager of the
float of Australia's leading telecommunications company Telstra,
from its role following corruption investigation in Japan.
</P>
<P>
But Australian Finance Minister John Fahey said he remained
confident that the float is on track for November, the Australian
Associated press (AAP) reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Daiwa Securities, Japan's second largest stockbroker and lead
manager of the 7.2 billion U.S. dollar Telstra float for the
jurisdiction outside the United States and Europe, was last week
reportedly banned from selling shares in Japan," AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese public prosecutors today raided the headquarters of
Daiwa in Tokyo following reports that eight top executives were
about to resign for their role in a widening pay-off scandal.
</P>
<P>
Fahey said Daiwa would be suspended from its role as of
September 19 pending further advice and information.
</P>
<P>
He said the move would protect public confidence in the process
as the critical stage of the Telstra sale approaches.
</P>
<P>
"The government is on track for a November listing of the
shares," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The government would appoint an additional lead manager to the
selling syndicate in the Telstra public share offer, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government announced earlier this year a
decision to privatize one-third of Telstra, the largest
telecommunications company in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Camerounian Vice Prime
Minister Gilbert Tsoungui has recommended that the supply of beef
be increased in urban centers to bring down prices.
</P>
<P>
The vice prime minister made the statement in Yaounde
Wednesday while presiding over deliberations at the first
semester conference of governors for the 1997/98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to a paper represented by Edmond Mbio, the
secretary of state in charge of industrial and commercial
development on the supply of cattle and beef markets in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The vice prime minister advised the competent services
concerned to regroup graziers in larger vaccination zones so that
a greater quantity of healthy cattle can be transported to urban
centers.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the vice prime minister's recommendation, Mbio
attributed the shortage of beef and cattle to the lack of
transport facilities from high grazing areas to urban centers.
</P>
<P>
Mbio also cited insecurity along the roads from the north to
the south, abusive control by some administrative services and
exportation to neighboring countries for higher profits as some
of the factors leading to the beef shortage.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine currency of
peso hit a new record low today, plummeting by 3.3 percent to
average at 33.85 pesos to one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the Philippine Dealing System, the peso opened at 32.36
pesos to one dollar and fell to a record low of 34.05 pesos in the
first few minutes.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first time that the currency breached the level
of 34 pesos to one dollar. The peso is now 28 percent below its
pre-depreciation average of 26.40 pesos to one dollar.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Central Bank governor Gabriel Singson blamed
political uncertainty for the woes of the peso.
</P>
<P>
"We more or less followed the region," he told reporters,
referring to the prolonged Southeast Asian currency crisis, in
which the Thai baht, the Malaysian ringgit, the Indonesian rupiah,
the Singaporean dollar and the Philippine peso all once tumbled to
record lows.
</P>
<P>
However, the political unstability arising from the Charter
change moves seeking a second term for President Fidel Ramos
brought more jitters to the foreign exchange market, Singson said.
</P>
<P>
A massive protest rally organized by the Roman Catholic Church
and former president Corazon Aquino will be held on Sunday to
protest the Charter change moves.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, the businessmen, exporters and importers and even
the banks have fears about the September 21 rally," said the
president of the Bankers Association of the Philippines.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
weakened further today after a much-anticipated speech by Reserve
Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Ian Macfarlane disappointed
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
With no major economic data in recent days to point the way,
Macfarlane's address in Tokyo this afternoon had been considered
by the markets a chance for the RBA to give some indication of the
direction of monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Macfarlane gave a generally positive report card on the
Australian economy, but singled out unemployment as the main
challenge for policy makers.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the RBA planned to cut interest rates further by
the end of the year, Macfarlane said "I am better off not
answering that question," but added that monetary policy remained
an important option to achieve sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the day at 71.64 US cents down
from Wednesday's close of 71.95.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The new action plan
formulated at the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) shall testify that the party "is fully capable of
guiding China victoriously into the 21st century," a senior
Pakistani official said.
</P>
<P>
In light of the past successful experience, the 15th CPC
congress, which lasted from September 12 to 18, has drawn up a
cross-century blueprint for China's reform, opening-up and
socialist modernization drive, said Habib Ur Rahman, director
general of the East Asia and Pacific Department of the Foreign
Ministry, in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The week-long congress, which decided to continue to hold high
the banner of late great leader Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, will mark a new era in
China's history, said Habib who once worked in China as a diplomat
for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
"The new action plan formulated at the congress shall once
again testify that the collective leadership of the Communist
Party of China is fully capable of guiding China victoriously into
the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Habib, who personally witnessed various stages of China's
development, spoke highly of the economic and social achievements
China has made in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
"China has become an economic giant and a political power in
the world," he noted.
</P>
<P>
On China's foreign policy, Habib said, with strict adherence to
her principled position, China has "greatly contributed to the
maintenance of world peace and to the protection of interests of
smaller countries."
</P>
<P>
"I am sure China shall continue to win over more and more
friends and increasingly high international reputation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Vows to Root Out Campus Cultism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is to set up a special
tribunal to try all offenses related to cultism and cult-related
activities in the tertiary institutions from the next academic
session.
</P>
<P>
The government determination to root out cultism on the
campuses was disclosed on Wednesday by major-general Bashir
Salihu Magashi, the general officer commanding 2nd mechanized
division.
</P>
<P>
Magashi, who is also member of the supreme Provisional Ruling
Council (PRC), also said that vice-chancellors, rectors, provosts
and students affairs officers of the tertiary institutions would
be empowered to screen students seeking admission into their
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The government decision came at a time of renewed cult
violence at the University of Lagos which claimed the lives of
two students early this month.
</P>
<P>
Institutions of higher learning in Nigeria have become hotbeds
of cult-related violence since early 1990s, and authorities have
tried to curb the trend, but with little or no results.
</P>
<P>
At a one-day workshop for youths, student leaders and
voluntary organizations in Ibadan, western Nigeria, the PRC
member lamented the complete change in the moral values of the
youths.
</P>
<P>
"The menace of social vices has been recognized to be a result
of incessant search for wealth on the part of youths who have
mostly become drug peddlers, hired assassins, prostitutes and
armed robbers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of drug abuse among our youths is a dangerous trend
that must be stopped for it not only destroys the mind but also
the individual," the major-general said.
</P>
<P>
Crimes are committed when the perpetrators have become
emboldened after consumption of hard drugs, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Agree to Speed up Release of Civilian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- India and Pakistan today
agreed to expedite the release of civilian detainees belonging to
either side but deferred a decision on setting up of a joint
mechanism to tackle contentious issues including Jammu and
Kashmir, Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued at the end of the third round of
Indo-Pakistan foreign secretary level talks said that the two
sides decided that the concerned authorities of both countries
would speed up the process of freeing civilian detainees.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the decision to speed up the release of
civilian detainees was taken as a follow up of the meeting between
Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
during the SAARC (South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation)
summit in Male, Maldives, in May this year where they had agreed
that the two governments would take measures in this regard.
</P>
<P>
It went on that further consideration was required in
operationalizing the joint mechanism agreed to deal with
contentious issues during the second round of talks in Islamabad
in June.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the foreign secretaries decided to
adjourn now and reconvene their meeting at a mutually convenient
date.
</P>
<P>
The three-day talks, which began here on Tuesday between Indian
Foreign Secretary K. Raghunath and his Pakistan counterpart
Shamshad Ahmad, focused on discussions of a joint statement issued
on June 23 at the end of the second round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Both sides had different interpretations of the June 23
statement, especially paragraphs relating to the setting up of a
joint mechanism to tackle all outstanding issues between the two
countries including the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
While Pakistan maintains that both sides have agreed in the
statement to set up a joint working group on Jammu and Kashmir,
India firmly denies such an interpretation.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Growth to Be Lower This Year: Singapore PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong said that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) will see its average growth rate lowered by one to two
percent this year after the recent financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office said today that Goh made the
comment to the media following his address to the US-ASEAN
Business Council in Chicago on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the impact the recent turmoil has on the Singapore
economy and its growth, Goh said that he thought it would affect
Singapore by one to 1.5 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
"The Singapore economy depends also on the performance of the
regional economies. We buy, we sell, we invest in these countries.
When their growth is affected, ours will also be affected," Goh
said.
</P>
<P>
"I would reckon that on the whole, if we take an average, ASEAN
will shave its growth rate by maybe one to two percent. Some
countries will lose more, some countries will do better. But on
the average, maybe we should all scale down by one to two
percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, in response to press queries, the Press Secretary to
Prime Minister Goh said today in a statement that the recent
currency crisis in the region "would not have an immediate effect
on Singapore's economic growth."
</P>
<P>
"The economy is still forecast to grow between six and seven
percent this year especially with the strong pickup of the
manufacturing sector," the Press Secretary said, adding, "however,
if the regional economies slow down in the next few years, there
would be an impact on our economic growth."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Goh is in Chicago on a four-day visit to the
United States after his visit to Mexico last week.

<HEADLINE> IMF Official Optimistic About China's Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- An International Monetary
Fund (IMF) official said here today that he was extremely
optimistic about the long-term economic outlook in China.
</P>
<P>
Flemming Larsen, deputy director of the IMF's Research
Department, told Xinhua: "If the current growth trend of nine
percent is maintained (in China), in about a decade the weight of
the Chinese economy, with Hong Kong excluded, will be similar to
the weight of the United States' or the weight of the European
Union's."
</P>
<P>
China's real GDP grew on average by over nine percent a year
between 1978 and 1996, and the IMF predicts in its latest report
"World Economic Outlook" that the growth momentum will continue in
1997 at 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
With its tremendous economic growth, China is playing an
increasingly important role in the IMF. "China's position in the
IMF is growing, and it also plays a constructive role in regional
affairs," Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
China recently supported the IMF efforts to bail out the Thai
economy by contributing one billion U.S. dollars to a rescue
package worth 17.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Larsen noted that the impressive economic growth in China has
been coupled with significant structural transformation, and
gradual opening and integration of the economy with the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
But China's transition to a market-based economy is still an
unfinished agenda, according to the IMF official, who listed four
main challenges the country has to face -- financial sector
reform, state enterprise reform, fiscal reform and regional
disparities.
</P>
<P>
He said he was impressed that at the 15th National Party
Congress, the Chinese leaders have shown their political will and
determination to reform state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Monetary Expert Diagnoses Currency Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The peso devaluation that hit
the Philippines since July 11 was inevitable owing to the
government's opening up of its economy to foreign investments, a
local monetary expert said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of Central Bank governor Gabriel Singson
during a roundtable discussion, Diwa Gunigundo, director of the
Department of Economic Research, said that the country's adoption
of a liberalized economy made it vulnerable to pressures from the
onslaught of market forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines found it difficult to go against the currency
woes because billions of U.S. dollars are involved in this crisis,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot do this at this time because we only have 11.5
billion U.S. dollars in international reserves," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said it is difficult to have a stable exchange rate system
under an open economy such as that of the Philippines, noting that
most of the country's manufacturing sector use foreign exchange
for imported orders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he attributed the currency turbulence in the region
to the manipulation of foreign fund managers who help lump the
region's economies into one basket.
</P>
<P>
This is coupled by the fact that the U.S. economy continues to
grow this year, attracting foreign investors to pull their funds
out of Southeast Asia and put them in the United States, Gunigundo
said.
</P>
<P>
Since early July, the Thai baht, the Malaysian ringgit, the
Indonesian rupiah, the Singaporean dollar and the Philippine peso
all tumbled sharply amid the current financial turmoil sweeping
the region.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Foreign Reserve Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September (Xinhua) -- Lebanese foreign exchange
reserve has registered a fall this month for the first time in the
past 17 months, the Beirut Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Bank of Lebanon was quoted as saying that
the foreign reserve dropped by 160.4 million U.S. dollars to 6.437
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the fall is expected in view of the due
repayment of treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
But he maintained the situation will be stablized as domestic
demands on the dollar have been decreasing in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bank of Lebanon has pledged to intervene in the
by keeping a narrow bid-offer spread and ensuring a steady
appreciation of the Lebanese pound.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the central bank lowered its bid-offer intervention
band for the local currency to 1,529.50-1,539.50 pounds to the
dollar from 1,530-1,540 a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's fiscal policy, based on high domestic borrowing and
interest rates, has led to the inflow of large amount of capital
and gradual appreciation of the Lebanese pound in the recent
years.

<HEADLINE> Internal Israeli Deal Postpones High Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- An unexpected agreement
between Israeli government and the settlers today led the High
Court to delay its ruling on the heated housing dispute in East
Jerusalem's Ras Amud Arab neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the three settler families, who moved into
two houses in Ras Amud Sunday night and sparked a new crisis
in the Israeli-Palestinian ties, had reached a compromise with
the government that they would leave the houses in exchange for
the government's approval to allow religious Jews to hold
seminars there.
</P>
<P>
The settlers made the concession because they insisted that
the religious Jews would continue the Jewish presence in Ras
Amud to underline the Israeli sovereignty claim over East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected agreement came just ahead of the pending
ruling by the high court on a petition filed by the Miami-based
billionare Irving Moscowitz, who purchased the houses and plans
to build a Jewish settlement there, against the government's
planned actions to evict the settlers.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid an escalation of the tense situation which
feuls fear about an eruption of Palestinian violence, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated that he would
use force to evict the settlers from Ras Amud.
</P>
<P>
It is widely expected that the court would support the
government's actions, citing the reasons for state security and
public order.
</P>
<P>
The settlers' presence in Ras Amud has triggered angry
protests from the Palestinians, who warned about an outbreak of
violence that threatens to kill the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian peace activists have been holding
demonstrations for the past days in Ras Amud, demanding for the
immediate evacuation of the settlers and resumption of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over Ras Amud reflects the sensitivity of the
dispute over the status of Jerusalem, which is set to be settled
through the final-status talks between Israel and the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Israel has claimed the whole Jerusalem, including the Arab
East Jerusalem it took over in the 1967 war, as its eternal and
indivisible capital, while the PNA hopes to establish a state
with East Jerusalem as capital.

<HEADLINE> Shelter Forest Project Surrounding Beijing Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Some Beijing residents have
found that the capital's climate has become gentler, with less
dust and grit in the air.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the improvement to a greening project in the
capital's neighbor, Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Some 3.47 million hectares of ecological shelter forest has
been established there, which has "in effect improved the ecology
in Beijing and Tianjin," said an official in charge of the
project, adding that more than 700,000 local residents have shaken
off poverty by working for the planting program.
</P>
<P>
The project, started in 1986, covers six cities and 50 counties
surrounding Beijing and Tianjin, including Zhangjiakou, Chengde
and Qinhuangdao.
</P>
<P>
Before the project began, Beijing was beseiged by heavy dust
storms for about 20 days a year. That number has decreased to
around 11, officials say, and less silt has entered the Panjiakou
and Miyun reservoirs, which are Beijing and Tianjin's water source.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the forest by-product processing industry in the
area covered by the project has generated more than one billion
yuan (about 125 million US dollars) in profit in the past decade,
benefiting over a million farmers.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Holocaust Memorial Museum to Go High-tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Holocaust
Memorial Museum (Yad Vashem) will undergo high-tech renovations
in order to accommodate a growing stream of visitors, especially
the young people.
</P>
<P>
The renovations, named "Yad Vashem 2001" project, will be
conducted according to a new design by the prize-winning
architect Moshe Safdie, who plans a dramatic wedge that will cut
sharply across the Mountain of Herzl, and features a huge
underground exhibition center, computer stations and video
theaters.
</P>
<P>
The project is estimated to cost 50 million U.S. dollars, a
third of which will be paid by the American Society for Yad
Vashem.
</P>
<P>
Avner Shalev, Yad Vashem's Director, said the project targets
a young generation growing up in the computer age and "in a
period in which there will be fewer living Holocaust survivors"
to tell their story.
</P>
<P>
He noted a tremendous increase in interest in Holocaust
studies, and the museum's increasing popularity, with nearly 1.4
million people having visited in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his design at a news conference Wednesday, Safdie
said he had sought a "non-building" kind of structure, believing
that "conventional buildings are not appropriate for telling the
story of the Holocaust."
</P>
<P>
The design features a new entrance plaza that seeks to avoid
the appearance of a train station, and which should "separate
the sacred from the profane."
</P>
<P>
In the visitors' center, 12 hollow columns will support a
trellis-like roof over a 2,500 meter structure. Displays will
tell an introductory story to Yad Vashem.
</P>
<P>
Visitors will cross a bridge on the Avenue of the Righteous
Among the Nations before entering the actual museum, which will
be shaped like a 175-meter long spine. Much of it will be
underground, providing an expanded 3,000 square meters of
exhibition space.
</P>
<P>
Once through this tunnel-like museum, visitors may choose
between an art gallery, a hall housing temporary exhibits, or
proceed to the hall of Remembrance of Children's Memorial.
</P>
<P>
Computer stations will offer multimedia presentations. A
screening center will show documentaries or other films on
request, and offer master copies of videos of tens of thousands
of survivors made by the famous American film director Steven
Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
Safdie said that the new museum will be one-way and
completely linear "like the story itself - it will start
somewhere and end somewhere."
</P>
<P>
He added that his design would enable the museum to remain
open during pending renovations.

<HEADLINE> Manila Stocks Tumble Amid Currency Woes, Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine stock market
took a beating today as the benchmark composite index tumbled for
the seventh straight day amid currency woes and political
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
The composite index fell by 64.11 points, or 3.09 percent to
close at 2,009.85 points while the broader all share index slipped
by 20.53 points, or 3.13 percent to end at 645.30 points.
</P>
<P>
Some 3.6 billion shares worth 62 million U.S. dollars were
traded in today's trading.
</P>
<P>
Dealers and brokers attributed the bearish performance of the
stock market to a number of factors including the currency woes
sweeping the region, political unstability arising from Charter
change moves and a loan default by a local consumer electronics
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
The peso dropped to a new low of 34.05 to one U.S. dollar today
due to the fall of currencies in neighboring countries and the
economic and political difficulties in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Some one million people would hold a mass rally in Metro Manila
on Sunday to voice their anger over Charter change moves seeking
to lift the term limit of President Fidel Ramos, sending foreign
portfolio investors to withdraw their funds out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EYCO Group, which manufactures small home
appliances under the brand name of Nikon, admitted that it is
having difficulties in paying its loans to banks, creating a
sentiment of selling off.
</P>
<P>
Suffering most from today's sell-off are the banking and
property stocks. The Philippine National Bank share prices
nose-dived by 16.67 percent to its six-year low while the property
stocks, compounded by the impending supply glut and higher
borrowing cost, continued to be in the doldrums.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Hails Successful Conclusion of 15th Party Congress (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, the organ of
the Central committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
warmly hails the successful conclusion of the 15th National Party
Congress in an editorial to be published on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Calling it "an epoch-making Congress", the paper said that the
whole Party and the people of the whole country are rejoiced at
the event for it was convened at a crucial moment of the country's
reforms and opening-up and it has carried forward the cause and
forged ahead into the future; it has held high the great banner of
Deng Xiaoping Theory and has unswervingly adhered to the correct
line formulated since the Third Plenum of the 11th Party Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
It is also a meeting which has mobilized the whole Party and
people of the entire country to unite and strive for an all-round
advancement of the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The greatest contribution of the congress was to establish Deng
Xiaoping Theory as the guiding ideology of the Party, it said.
</P>
<P>
"As an important milestone, the congress will shine forever in
the history of our Party and the state," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin's report to the congress on behalf of the 14th CPC
Central Committee has won the praise of all the delegates and the
warm support from the whole Party and the people of the country,
the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Based on Deng Xiaoping Theory and the Party's basic line, the
report summed up the rich experience gained in the past two
decades since the reforms and opening-up, especially since the
convening of the 14th National Party Congress in 1992, and put
forward the basic program for the primary stage of socialism and
outlined the strategy for the great cross-century cause, it
continued.
</P>
<P>
It has proved that the third generation of China's central
leading collective with Jiang Zemin at the core is the reliable
successor to Deng Xiaoping Theory and the great cause pioneered by
Deng, the editorial stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
The newly elected Central Committee includes a number of
long-tested senior officials, some middle-aged officials grown up
since the founding of new China and some young officials who have
both ability and political integrity, the editorial noted.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the Party's cause is flourishing and does not
lack successors, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The primary task of the whole party is to study and implement
the guidelines of the Party Congress, unify our thinking and
strive for the grand goal set forth by the Party congress," the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The most important aspect in implementing the guidelines of the
Party Congress is to arm the whole Party, leading officials and
people in the country with Deng Xiaoping Theory, it said.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping Theory is the heritage and development of Mao
Zedong Thought and Marxism in modern China, and it is the powerful
spiritual support in invigorating the Chinese nation, it said,
adding that history has proved and will continue to prove that
only Deng Xiaoping Theory which combines Marxism with China's
actual conditions and the characteristics of the times can
correctly solve the future and destiny of socialism in China.
</P>
<P>
The principle of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from
facts is "the quintessence of Deng Xiaoping Theory, the cherished
heritage of the Chinese communists and the everlasting truth of
Maxism," it said.
</P>
<P>
The whole Party should implement the principle and start from
the actual situation that China is still in the primary stage of
socialism, continue the reforms and open up wider to the outside
world and promote the national economy to develop in a fast,
sustainable and healthy manner and achieve the all-round social
progress, the editorial stressed.

Leading Party officials at all levels should increase
investigations, guard against the tendency of rushing headlong
into mass action, work conscientiously and in a down-to-earth
manner, and achieve practical results, it said.
</P>
<P>
While implementing the guidelines of the Party congress, it is
necessary to improve the Party building, strengthen the cohesion
and work efficiency and improve the art of leadership of the
Party, it said.
</P>
<P>
The CPC, as a Party in power and the core of leadership of the
people of the whole country, shoulders very important historical
responsibility. Therefore, it should be strict with the Party
members and wage a resolute and effective struggle against
corruption, the editorial said, adding that leading officials at
all levels should pay great attention to study and politics, be
clean and honest in performing official duties and play an
exemplary role in serving the people whole-heartedly."
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the editorial said that the 58 million Party
members and the 1.2 billion people in China should be united as
one under the guidelines of the 15th National Party Congress and
the leadership of the 15th CPC Central Committee, work hard and
push ahead the great cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics into the 21st century.

"Most important of all is that we were able to establish very
close contacts with the Malaysian government... and I think we can
develop this relationship on all foundations we have built," she
said.

<P>
During her visit, Kumaratunga held talks with Malaysian Prime

Chinese lives and international politics, said the Mongolian
newspaper "People's Right" today.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Aircraft Industry Reports First Profit in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- State-owned Israel Aircraft
Industries (IAI) company announced today its first profits after
several years of losses.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that the company earned 7 million
U.S. dollars in net income in the first six months of 1997, and
projected a profit of 20 million dollars for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, executives of the company said the firm lost 140
million U.S. dollars during the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
"We knew we were going to make a profit for 1997, but we were
surprised by the figures," IAI president Moshe Keret said.
</P>
<P>
Keret attributed the improvement to better-than-expected sales
and a devaluation of the shekel, which also hiked earnings. He
said that this year's profitability is a trend for the IAI.
</P>
<P>
Keret noted that the company's recovery plan has eliminated
many of its problems, including staffing and inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the company has penetrated into new markets,
which brought about increased sales. During the first half of
1997, IAI signed contracts totalling 1.6 billion U.S. dollars,
more than double the 730 million dollars in contracts signed in
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
IAI's sales for the first half of 1997 were 771 million
dollars, as opposed to 692 million dollars in the same period last
year. Its backlog of orders now stands at a record 3.3 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Mass Resignations Hit Tehran Municipality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Twelve mayors governing 17
districts of Iran's capital Tehran submitted resignations to
Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi Wednesday, the English daily
Iran News reported today.
</P>
<P>
They cited lack of appropriate conditions for continuance of
their services as the reason for their resignation, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, however, rejected the resignations and asked them to
"strenuously continue their services."
</P>
<P>
This is believed to be a strong protest against the recent move
of arrests of municipal officials of Tehran on charges of alleged
financial corruption.
</P>
<P>
Seven high-ranking officials of Tehran municipality, including
Karbaschi's financial and administrative director, his security
chief and a mayor of district, were arrested in July after Iran's
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei launched the nationwide
anti-corruption move in June.
</P>
<P>
On July 31, more than 100 leftist and liberal parliamentary
deputies published a letter, condemning the arrests of the
officials.
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary said in a statement on August 14 that the
investigations of the cases of alleged corruption fall within the
authority of Tehran Justice Department and is closely supervised
by the head of the Judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary said it is independent, fair and politics-free in
dealing with cases.

<HEADLINE> Mercenary Hired Against Sierra Leone Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 18 (Xinhua)--Sierra Leone military sources
said today that a locally based international diamond mining
company run by two Israelis has hired a mercenary group to
overthrow the military government.
</P>
<P>
According to the high level sources, the Israelis have already
paid the South African Executive Outcomes (EO) a part payment or
one million U.S. Dollars of the six million Dollars which the
entire operation will cost.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian soldiers serving in the West African peacekeeping
Force in Liberia have also been accused as "part of the
operation," the source said.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Mineral Resources confirmed the
allegation and said that three agents of the Company are now
being questioned by security officials.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot yet tell you whether those being questioned are
locals or foreigners. It is a much sensitive issue," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to one geologist, Israeli firms operating in Sierra
Leone control half of the rich diamond fields in the east of the
country especially in Zimmi and Tongo.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that last year, Sierra Leone produces about one
million carats which should have fetched a minimum of 200 million
Dollars in gross domestic output.
</P>
<P>
"Smuggling and other corrupt practices have made some 800
highly valued carats not to be accounted for," he added.
</P>
<P>
The EO was first hired by the military regime of Captain
Valentine Strasser in 1992 to fight against the then rebels of
the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) but the contract was
terminated by the ousted civilian government of Tejan Kabbah in
1996 in which the group was paid over four million Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Roth: Strategic Dialogue With China to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official
said here today that the U.S. administration would continue its
strategic dialogue with China to expand cooperation and narrow
differences between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Attending a Senate hearing on "1997 China policy Act", a bill
presented by nine senators last week, Stanley Roth, Assistant
Secretary for the Bureau of East Asia and Pacific Affairs, said
that it was consistent with the policy pursued in the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
"For the past 25 years, six presidents have sought a proper
balance in our relationship with China, promoting our interest,
cooperating where possible in areas of common concern, but also,
frankly, confronting differences and trying to narrow them," said
Roth, who visited China recently in preparation for a state visit
to the U.S. by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
"The Clinton administration's strategy of comprehensive
engagement toward China is based on the premise that it is
profoundly in our interest to work toward the emergence of China
as a great power that is stable, open and non-aggressive," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The bill complains about the lack of "progress" in China's
human rights, nuclear proliferation and religion issues, and
threatens to impose unilateral sanctions on China.
</P>
<P>
Roth spoke firmly against still treating China as an enemy,
noting profound changes have already taken place in the world's
most populous country, which is growing as one of the biggest
economies in the world.
</P>
<P>
"To treat China as an enemy risks becoming a self-fulfilling
prophecy, and that serves no one's interest, least of all the
United States," he told the law-makers.
</P>
<P>
Roth believed that unilateral sanctions and other unilateral
steps would be "counterproductive" and particularly "ill-timed as
we move toward the first of our two state visits with the People's
Republic of China."
</P>
<P>
President Jiang and his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton agreed
last year in Manila to meet this fall in Washington and next
spring in Beijing. Preparations for Jiang's trip are in full
swing, according to officials from both sides.
</P>
<P>
"President Jiang Zemin's visit to Washington and President
Clinton's return visit to China next year provide the opportunity
to make concrete progress on issues of mutual concern," Roth said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that mandate sanctions would "cut us off from our
current productive dialogue."
</P>
<P>
Other senators present at the hearing also expressed concern
that such an anti-China bill, if adopted, would hold back the
progress in the Sino-American relationship and worsen the prospect
for cooperation between the two big nations.
</P>
<P>
The bill seems to be far away from becoming a law since strong
objections voiced by the administration officials and some
senators as well.

<HEADLINE> Party Congress in Ordinary People's Eyes (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Wang Erjiang, a model worker
who has won a "May 1" Labor Medal granted to excellent workers
nationwide, has asked journalists to help him collect newspapers
published during the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party
of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
"I want all newspapers covering the Congress," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang works at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, one of China's
largest steel producers, located in northeast China's Liaoning
province. He explained to his colleagues at work the report
delivered by Jiang Zemin at the opening session of the congress.
</P>
<P>
The idea of collecting newspapers came to him when some of the
workers complained that they could not find newspapers in the
workshops.
</P>
<P>
Wang decided to gather newspapers for fellow workers so that
plenty of information about the congress would be available for
all. He plans to save the newspapers once all the workers have
finished reading.
</P>
<P>
So far he has copies of 46 different newspapers, including
"Xinhua Daily Telegraph," "People's Daily," "Anshan Daily" and a
daily newspaper published by and issued within Anshan.
</P>
<P>
"State-owned enterprises will surely overcome the difficulties
they face," Wang said, full of confidence in Jiang's report. He
added that the report points out both the means and direction for
the development of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Liu Meixun was ready to rewrite a just-finished book,
"Following the Road of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics."
</P>
<P>
"The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) is a new milestone," said Liu, director of the economic
research institute of Qinghua University. "We must add new
contents that were unveiled as breakthroughs in Jiang Zemin's
report."
</P>
<P>
Liu and several colleagues finished the 300,000-word book
before the congress opened. After a week of close watch on the
meeting, Liu decided to revise her book.
</P>
<P>
"Jiang's report has answered many problems that puzzled
theorists," she said, adding that the report would emancipate
people's minds.
</P>
<P>
Liu planned to ask co-authors to also revise their
contributions to the book after they study Jiang's report. She
said that their focus would be on chapters on reform of
state-owned enterprises and on holding high the banner of Deng
Xiaoping Theory.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Deny Opening Skies to Singapore at Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will
definitely deny Singapore's demand for "open sky" air service
rights when the negotiating panels of the two countries meet on
September 23-24 in Singapore, the Philippine News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Franklin Ebdalin, who chairs the Philippine panel to the air
talks, was quoted as saying that the panel has already taken this
position even before they meet their Singaporean counterparts.
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore has requested for the air service accord
talks to justify its demand for open skies with the Philippines.
Under such an accord, designated air carriers will have unlimited
flight access and rights to and from any point of either country.
</P>
<P>
It will be grossly disadvantageous for the Philippines to grant
the request since the arrangement will be heavily in Singapore's
favor, he said, adding Singapore has only a piece of sky while the
Philippines has the entire space above its archipelago for
Singapore planes.
</P>
<P>
Ebdalin, however, disclosed that the Philippine panel may agree
to recommend the grant of additional rights for Singapore's air
carriers to fly to any Philippine international airport except
Manila.
</P>
<P>
He said that additional flights outside Manila may actually
help accelerate the development of the country's outlying regions
into major international air routes.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Abduct 9 Civilians in W. Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) abducted nine civilians in Kasese
district, western Uganda, local paper, The Crusader, reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said about 30 rebels looted the shops in suburb of
Kasese town center.
</P>
<P>
The well armed rebels did not shoot in the action, obviously
to avoid alerting soldiers or policemen usually patrolling the
area.
</P>
<P>
The rebels disappeared in the direction to Rwenzori mountains
where is believed to be the hideout of ADF.
</P>
<P>
The rebel action confirmed by Lt. Colonel Charles Angina, the
operation commander in the west.
</P>
<P>
But the commander refused to reveal any further details about
the activities of the rebels due to security reason. "I can't
ascertain exactly that it is your voice," he said, adding "rebels
are not people who only stay in the mountains and jungle, but
even stay in towns."
</P>
<P>
A security source in the district said the rebels raided the
area around 02:00 am, just moments after a police/army patrol
changed their direction.
</P>
<P>
By noon yesterday, three of the abducted succeeded in escaping
from the rebels, and still other two were rescued by local
policemen, the report said.
</P>
<P>
ADF is a rebel group acting in the west with some 350
soldiers, a recent official report said. It had some 1,500
fighters last November. ADF abducts civilians to fill their
ranks.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Protests Over Killing in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has protested to the American administration over the killing
of a Kenyan by a mob in San Francisco, the Daily Nation newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Edwin Njuguna, in his early 20s, was knifed to death Friday as
he parked his car near the venue of a private party.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Wednesday, Moi said he protested "in
the strongest terms possible the murder," adding that racism was
worse than tribalism.
</P>
<P>
He said it was sad that an innocent person was killed for
"being an African", adding it was ironical that those lecturing
the world on democracy were the same people who trampled on it.
</P>
<P>
Reports indicated that Njuguna stopped the car on the street
and a man came out and told him he could not park it there.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 people surrounded the car, according to a San
Francisco newspaper, the Napa Valley Register.
</P>
<P>
Njuguna was told to get out of the car and pushed to the
ground. He was punched, kicked and then stabbed.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation today also published an editorial calling on
the U.S. police "to move expeditiously and judiciously to get to
the bottom of this matter.
</P>
<P>
"Had a similar incident occurred in Kenya involving an
American, we can bet that we would have been flooded with
humiliating and patronizing statements and the (U.S.) State
Department would have issued a travel advisory to Americans on
their safety in Kenya and elsewhere on the continent," said the
editorial.

COLOMBO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Army has
established a special unit to investigate public complaints
against army personnel, the national news agency Lankapuvath said
today.
</P>
<P>
Army Commander Lieutenant General Rohan Daluwatta told the
agency that the unit was set up to probe public complaints of
bribery, corruption, human rights violations and other offenses in
the army.
</P>
<P>
It would also serve as a deterrent against indiscipline and
wrongdoing, the commander added.
</P>
<P>
He said all those found guilty will be dealt with firmly and
swiftly and will receive maximum punishment.
</P>
<P>
He has asked the provost marshal of the army to lead the
special unit and report to him.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman on UN Decision on Taiwan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan authorities'
attempt to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" has once
again been proven unpopular and doomed to fail, a Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remark to reporters at a routine weekly
press conference when asked to comment on the fact that the
General Committee of the 52nd UN General Assembly again rejected
the motion of a small number of countries to put the issue of
Taiwan's representation in the United Nations on the agenda of the
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
This gives an eloquent proof that any act in violation of the
objectives and principles of the UN charter, as well as relevant
UN resolutions, or any move interfering in another country's
internal affairs will be opposed by the international community,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the No. 2758 UN resolution reached in 1971 has
already solved the issue of China's representation in the UN
fairly and completely.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, as one region of China, is not at all qualified to join
the United Nations as an entity apart from China, the spokesman
said.

MOSCOW -- Russia has curbed its economic slump with a moderate

maintained the same level as last year, ending the plunge that

fact that some people in Nagorno-Karabakh want to resort to force
to solve the nine-year conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan

<HEADLINE> S. African Gold Industry Signs Wage Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's National
Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the Chamber of Mines have signed a
two-year agreement linking improvement in wages to productivity,
local daily, Business Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
A target of producing more to help rescue the slump gold
industry was agreed upon in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the agreement, about 100,000 mine workers were facing
retrenchment following gold price crash to below 320 U.S. Dollars
an ounce in global market in early July.
</P>
<P>
Last year gold production in South Africa registered only
494.6 tons, the lowest since 1956. The highest was more than
1,000 tons recorded in 1970.
</P>
<P>
Under the latest agreement officially signed Wednesday, the
minimum wage for lower surface and underground workers has been
raised from 1,000 Rand (213 U.S. Dollars) to 1150 Rand (244 U.S.
Dollars) a month, representing an increment of 20 percent for
some mines.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the workers will receive increase of between nine
and 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
NUM's General Secretary Kgalema Motlanthe described the deal
as significant and remarkable. "It is a historic agreement for us
to have achieved these increases. It's a hell of an achievement."
</P>
<P>
Frans Barker, the chamber's deputy industrial relations
advisor, said the agreement had the potential of changing the
country's industrial relations landscape.

<HEADLINE> Zambia, Tanzania Urged to Integrate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian senior official
has urged Zambia and Tanzania to integrate socially and
economically, an English-language newspaper Zambia Daily Mail
reported today.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Zambian Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence
Shimba Wednesday in the capital, Tanzanian Home Affairs Minister
Ameir Mohammed observed that the two countries have vast economic
potentials which need to be explored and improved upon, saying
they should adopt a "positive" and "vigorous approach towards
economic and social integration.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed cited the need to explore the transport sector, the
tourism industry and the mining areas if the two neighbors are to
integrate in wide dimensions.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that plans were underway to turn the once slave
trade route on Lake Tanganyika on borders of the two countries
for tourism purposes and also for opening up the Tazara
(Tanzania-Zambia) Railway Corridor into a manufacturing giant.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed challenged the Tanzanian Chambers of Commerce and the
Zambian counterparts to come up with solutions and tasks that
would realize the promotion of tourism and other aspects of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the two countries should not just concentrate
on bilateral cooperation in the economic sectors at the expense
of social and cultural activities.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed, together with two deputy ministers from Tanzania's
finance and communication and transport ministries respectively,
arrived in Lusaka Wednesday to join their Zambian colleagues
attending the sixth joint permanent commission, which was
established in 1989 and aims to promote economic and social
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the talks with the Zambian Foreign Minister, Mohammed
also emphasized the need for the two countries to strengthen and
revamp the operations of the joint commission which he said has
not performed as expected.
</P>
<P>
"The commission must explore new areas of cooperation and
soldier on in our goals to attain strong economies and political
endeavors for our two countries, said the Tanzanian official.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Holocaust Memorial Museum to Go High-tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Holocaust
Memorial Museum (Yad Vashem) will undergo high-tech renovations
in order to accommodate a growing stream of visitors, especially
the young people.
</P>
<P>
The renovations, named "Yad Vashem 2001" project, will be
conducted according to a new design by the prize-winning
architect Moshe Safdie, who plans a dramatic wedge that will cut
sharply across the Mountain of Herzl, and features a huge
underground exhibition center, computer stations and video
theaters.
</P>
<P>
The project is estimated to cost 50 million U.S. dollars, a
third of which will be paid by the American Society for Yad
Vashem.
</P>
<P>
Avner Shalev, Yad Vashem's Director, said the project targets
a young generation growing up in the computer age and "in a
period in which there will be fewer living Holocaust survivors"
to tell their story.
</P>
<P>
He noted a tremendous increase in interest in Holocaust
studies, and the museum's increasing popularity, with nearly 1.4
million people having visited in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his design at a news conference Wednesday, Safdie
said he had sought a "non-building" kind of structure, believing
that "conventional buildings are not appropriate for telling the
story of the Holocaust."
</P>
<P>
The design features a new entrance plaza that seeks to avoid
the appearance of a train station, and which should "separate
the sacred from the profane."
</P>
<P>
In the visitors' center, 12 hollow columns will support a
trellis-like roof over a 2,500 meter structure. Displays will
tell an introductory story to Yad Vashem.
</P>
<P>
Visitors will cross a bridge on the Avenue of the Righteous
Among the Nations before entering the actual museum, which will
be shaped like a 175-meter long spine. Much of it will be
underground, providing an expanded 3,000 square meters of
exhibition space.
</P>
<P>
Once through this tunnel-like museum, visitors may choose
between an art gallery, a hall housing temporary exhibits, or

<HEADLINE> Dogs to Sniff Bombs Before Mass Rally in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Police will use six dogs
trained to sniff bombs to check an area in the Philippine capital
of Manila where a mass rally would be held on Sunday, the
Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Jose Capacete, superintendent of the Western Police Bomb
Disposal Unit, was quoted as saying that the dogs are part of a
team who would assure that no bombs or explosives are planted in
the area.
</P>
<P>
About 200 traffic policemen will also be deployed throughout
the city to make certain the smooth flow of traffic during the
rally, he said.
</P>
<P>
The rally was called by former President Corazon Aquino and
Cardinal Jaime Sin to mount pressure on President Fidel Ramos
against any drive to seek for re-election or an extension of his
term through revising the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The president has revealed to the public that he may stay in
power after his term ends in June next year.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people who oppose the extension of Ramos' term
through charter change moves would attend the rally. Ramos had met
with Aquino and Sin but failed to persuade them to cancel the
rally.
</P>
<P>
Since early this month, a spate of bomb threats has haunted
Metro Manila after two explosions killed six people and wounded 60
others. It was reported that the planned rally would also be
bombed.
</P>
<P>
The opposition said the threats were made by Ramos' supporters
who wish to give the president a chance to declare martial law by
sending the country into chaos.
</P>
<P>
Political uncertainty arising from charter change moves is
scaring foreign investors to pull out their funds out of the
country, fueling the meltdown of the peso in the current financial
turmoil sweeping the region.

<HEADLINE> Water Conservancy Effort Paid Off in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region is
reaping the success of its water conservancy efforts over the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive hydrological network has been basically
completed which can supply water and electricity to the region and
enhance flood and drought control.
</P>
<P>
Since 1972, funding totaling 1.5 billion yuan from both the
central and local governments has gone toward over 300 water
conservancy projects, most of which have contributed significantly
to the regional agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has always given priority to those
projects in poor counties aiming to improve local living and
farming conditions.
</P>
<P>
A canal project in Rinbung County in Xigaze Prefecture
increased the crop yields by 150,000 kilograms the same year it
was completed and put into use.
</P>
<P>
Another in Tingri County has added more than 300,000 kilograms
of grain each year to farmers' granaries, putting an end to the
food shortage problem in the area.
</P>
<P>
The past five years saw the completion of 35 new hydropower
stations in Tibet which provide an additional 66 million
kilowatts/hours to the regional power supply, as well as clean
drinking water to some 48,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The newly-built dykes and dams with a total length of 188
kilometers have greatly enhanced Tibet's capacity to fight floods
and mud-rock flows.

<HEADLINE> China Succeeds in Growing Vanilla </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 133-ha of vanilla plants
are doing well in Xishuangbanna area, southwest China's Yunnan
Province, with some already in full bloom.
</P>
<P>
This marks a success for the country to grow vanilla on a large
scale. In the 1970s, the province's scientists did experiments in
the area and made progress.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the province spent a million yuan on a vanilla
research project for high-yielding techniques.
</P>
<P>
Vanilla is widely used in the making of cigarettes, wine, tea,
foodstuffs, beverages, cosmetics, and perfume. But only a few
countries produce vanilla due to climate limitations.
</P>
<P>
The province invested large amounts of funding into building
the Yunnan Vanilla Industrial Co., Ltd. in 1994. Now, the company
has a curing factory with an annual capacity of 300 tons. Last
year, it produced 1.5 tons of beans and five tons of vanilla bean
flavoring.
</P>
<P>
The company expects to yield 60 tons of beans by the end of the
century when all the 133 ha begin to bear fruit. It plans to
expand the growing acreage to some 667 ha and have an annual
output of 300 tons of beans.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Politicians Condemn Ras Al-Amud Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli politicians have
condemned the movement of Jews into Ras Al-Amud and asked the
expulsion of U.S. businessman Irving Moskowitz who bankrolled the
Jewish movement, the Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Shas Party leaders joined the opposition in condemning the
Jewish movement, calling it a "provocation of gentiles" that
could lead to attacks.
</P>
<P>
The party's spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia issued a statement
Wednesday, saying the Ras Al-Amud action "could incite an already
volatile situation in Jerusalem and was totally unnecessary."
</P>
<P>
MP Nissim Zvilli of Labor party called last night the
expulsion of Moskowitz, alleging that his activities of
bankrolling the movement of settlers into the Arab neighborhood
endangered public safety and state security.
</P>
<P>
"Moskowitz's irresponsible initiative is damaging security and
may lead Israel to a blood bath," he said, adding that "such a man
must not be allow to remain in Israel."
</P>
<P>
Three Jewish families moved into Ras Al-Amud on Sunday night
and their action has caused a tense situation in East
Jerusalem. Moskowitz is behind their movement, saying he bought
the property in Ras Al-Amud and the Israeli government has no
right to force the Jewish settlers to move out from Ras Al-Amud.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli High Court stated this morning to hear a
petition by Moskowitz, who is demanding a temporary injunction
to prevent any attempt by the Israeli government to evict
the Jewish settlers from Ras Al-Amud.
</P>
<P>
Meretz Party leader Yossi Sarid, however, asked last night to
bar Moskowitz from leaving Israel. He should "stay here and eat
the broth he has spoiled for us. He must not be allowed
to escape when the fire spreads and starts burning everything,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Several Labor Party MPs also demanded an urgent meeting of
parliament's State Control Committee to examine how decision was
made to allow Jews into Ras Al-Amud.

GUANGZHOU, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Young people in the

being asked to contribute their pocket money to an environmental

</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou City Communist Youth League Committee suggested

Some 500,000 yuan (63,000 US dollars) were deposited on the day
the fund was launched, sources said. Guangzhou has 1.2 million

</P>
<P>
A lack of public awareness among the adult population is

BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Workers at the New Shipyard
in northeast China's port city of Dalian in northeast China's
Liaoning Province have been doing their jobs with zeal since the
15th CPC National Congress opened last Friday. More than 1,000 of
them spent last weekend working.
</P>
<P>
"Our shipyard built ships totaling 500,000 DWT in 1996, more
than any other shipyard in the country," said Yuan Tongsheng, a
worker at the shipyard. "We could never have attained this goal
without the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the reform and
opening-up policy."
</P>
<P>
"We have set 600,000 DWT as this year's goal," Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping proposed that Chinese-built ships should become
more prominent on the international market when China's
shipbuilding industry turned sluggish, recalled Wang Lianyou,
secretary of the Shipyard Party Committee. "It is in accordance
with his instruction that our shipyard signed the first group of
export contracts in 1980."
</P>
<P>
He said that the design and building capacity of his shipyard
has met the advanced world standards following ten years of work.
</P>
<P>
The factory has produced nearly two million DWT of ships, 98
percent of which are for export. It now has ship orders of 1.69
million DWT, which are worth 740 million US dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will double our efforts to meet the requirement defined by
President Jiang Zemin in his report on efficiently operating the
state-owned enterprises at the 15th CPC National Congress," said
Wang Xin, an official with the shipyard.

JERUSALEM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces
detained five Palestinians overnight in a stone-throwing clash in

Angry Palestinian youths began throwing stones and bottles at

The congress unanimously agreed to adopt Deng Xiaoping Theory

our cause and continue to enrich and develop it in the course of
practice, it says.

The congress was of the view that Jiang's report further
emphasized the thesis that China is in a primary stage of
socialism, the resolution says, adding that this is of utmost
importance. The congress endorsed the Party's basic programs in

<HEADLINE> South Pacific Forum Meeting Opens in Cook Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAROTONGAN (Cook Islands), September 17 (Xinhua) -- The 28th
South Pacific Forum opened here today to discuss a number of
issues facing the region.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister of the Cook Islands Sir Geoffrey Henry, the
current chairman of the forum, opened the meeting which brought
together the presidents and prime ministers of the 16 forum member
countries.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Sir Geoffrey said "Over the years since
its founding, the forum has witnessed phenomenal changes in our
region. Perhaps foremost amongst these has been our growing
inter-dependence with the broader international community and the
globalization of the world economy."
</P>
<P>
"During the same period, the end of the cold war and other
developments have brought wholly different perceptions towards
international aid. Inevitably, the emphasis has shifted to the
converse of aid dependency, namely self-reliance and
sustainability."
</P>
<P>
On the models for economic development, he said, "We seek to
utilize what is offered, but not to imitate. We prefer to maintain
our cultural integrity to proceed in our own way."
</P>
<P>
Good intentions need day to day action, leader to leader
interaction, nation to nation cohesion, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed thanks to the governments of Australia, China, New
Zealand and France for their assistance in helping the Cook
Islands to host this forum.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day meeting, the leaders will appoint a new
secretary general for the forum, and deliberate on such issues as
regional trade, security, fisheries, climate change and nuclear
shipment.
</P>
<P>
They will also hold bilateral and multilateral talks with the
forum's "dialogue partners", including Britain, China and the
European Union, France, Japan, South Korea and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The South Pacific Forum was initiated in 1971 in Wellington,
New Zealand. Government heads from the forum's member countries
meet annually to discuss a wide range of common issues and
problems.

<HEADLINE> Program Against Water Hyacinth Approved in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda National
Environment Management Authority (NEMA) has approved integrated
control program against the water hyacinth, reported the local
daily The Monitor today.
</P>
<P>
NEMA executive director John Okedi was quoted as announcing
here on Wednesday that the use of an integrated control program
involving physical (manual and mechanical) and biological control
options are approved and should proceed for immediate
implementation as they have no significant environmental impacts
which either affect the health of the people or the ecological
functioning of Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
He said that the biological option should be implemented as a
long term control strategy.
</P>
<P>
Okedi's recommendation comes at a time when most of the Lake
Victoria landing sites have been choked by the water hyacinth.
</P>
<P>
"When implementing the component involving physical removal,
appropriate disposal sites should be identified for the harvested
weed to avoid reinfestation due to seed dispersal and further
pollution of the lake," Okedi said.
</P>
<P>
NEMA also recommended immediate action, stepping up the use of
physical control, especially at major transportation terminals
and power generation sites.
</P>
<P>
According to NEMA, a boom should be installed at River Kagera
supported by mechanical removal operations. More booms should
also be installed along the river before it enters Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
However, he said use of chemicals, applying herbicides has
never been approved.
</P>
<P>
Okedi said that chemical use was abandoned because of the
legal actions that could be taken upon anybody who applied
chemicals under the constitution and other laws.
</P>
<P>
He said use of herbicides would necessitate multiple
application to control the weed at manageable levels.

<HEADLINE> Archeologists Identify Capital of Yuan Dynasty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists
and historians have recently identified a capital of the Yuan
Dynasty (1271-1368) in the northern province of Hebei.
</P>
<P>
The Yuan Dynasty was estalished by Genghis Khan's grandson
following the defeat of the Song Dynasty. To ensure tight control
over the big empire whose territory spread as far as to Europe,
three capitals were set up by different emperors.
</P>
<P>
The newly-identified capital is located in Zhangbei County of
Hebei. It was in the middle of a route connecting Dadu, or the
greater capital in the present-day Beijing, and Shangdu, or the
upper capital, in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the other
two capitals of the Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have been excavating at the site for years, but
the status of the city remained unknown for a long period. After
extensive studies of unearthed relics and historical documents,
experts concluded last month that the site was "Zhongdu," or
"middle capital," which was built in the early 14th century.
</P>
<P>
The city greatly benefited from cultural and economic exchanges
between the Mongolians and the Chinese people living in the
hinterland.
</P>
<P>
Protection work is underway to preserve the historical site,
archeologists said.

<HEADLINE> WFP Appeals Food Donation for Drought-Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program
(WFP) has appealed to donors to provide food for some three
million Tanzanians who face severe food shortages over the next
few months.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by WFP in Nairobi, Kenya, Wednesday said
one million of these will need immediate help to get through the
next three months, according to the local press.
</P>
<P>
"The WFP is preparing an emergency food aid operation in
response to the drought, and appeals to donor countries to make
immediate contributions to ensure that relief food can begin to
quickly reach those most in need," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added, "Food donations typically take a minimum of three to
four months to arrive in Tanzania. However, it is crucial that
relief food distributions get under way as early as September
when food stocks are expected to be exhausted."
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that assessments of Tanzania's largest and
most important harvest indicated that Tanzania had suffered a
virtually nationwide crop failure because of erratic and poorly
distributed rains.
</P>
<P>
The WFP move is a response to the appeal made by Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa Monday to western donors to provide
emergency food aid to Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Major Gas Generator Repaired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- One of the gas turbine
generators which broke down earlier at one of the major power
stations, the Ubungo power station, in Dar es Salaam has been
repaired.
</P>
<P>
The repairs were completed early this week by an expert
brought by the suppliers of the turbines, the managing Director
of the Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO), Baruany
Luhanga told the local press Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Luhanga said, the completion of the repair works does
not mean the end of power rationing under which between 15 to 20
percent of Dar es Salaam region's requirement is being shed.
</P>
<P>
"We want to run all the gas turbines at Ubungo for 24 hours so
that we can avoid intensifying load shedding but the problem is
money to buy fuel to run the turbines," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "The four gas turbines at the Ubunga power station
consume a lot of fuel and our customers, government Ministries
plus their departments and parastatal organizations, hold 30
billion shillings (47.6 million US dollars)."
</P>
<P>
"Unless the government of our customers pays us it will be
very difficult for TANESCO to run the gas turbines and other
generators up country which depend on fuel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Power rationing has been imposed in Tanzania since September
8.

Daily Nation

<HEADLINE> Kenya Hit by Slump in Capital Inflow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is suffering from
declining growth in private capital inflow, making it the second
worst level of inward investment in sub-Saharan Africa after
Gabon's, the East African Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The capital inflow fell 42 million U.S. Dollars in the past
decade in the eastern African country, the report quoted the
latest World Bank's Global Economic Prospects document as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya's economic deterioration went back to 1991 when
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cut its
economic aid after the government refused to implement economic
and political reforms.
</P>
<P>
A majority of sub-Saharan African nations have instituted its
sponsored economic reforms as a condition for getting economic
aid from the multi-national financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
While the Kenyan economy now is still struggling on its
recovery path, the IMF suspended 205-million-Dollar aid package
to the country on July 31, saying Kenya has not done enough to
end corruption and to conduct reforms demanded by the IMF and
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is asking the Kenyan authorities to restructure
parastatals like the Keny Posts and Telecommunications
Corporation and the Kenya Power and Lighting Company before
having them privatized.
</P>
<P>
The bank is also insisting on transparency and accountability,
especially in the Goldenberg scandal, which robbed the country of
several hundred millions of dollars in fictitious gold exports
and wants those involved to be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government showed willingness to negotiate with
both the IMF and the World Bank to resolve the outstanding issues
to pave way for the resumption of IMF aid program.
</P>
<P>
Among the key issues is the streamlining of the Kenya Revenue
Authority (KRA) to make it independent.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka, Tribal Leaders Agree on Peace Deal to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government and
tribal leaders have agreed upon a peace deal to end the
decades-old insurgency in southern Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT),
which will be signed in the next meeting, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
"We have formulated a draft treaty and agreed to sign it at the
next meeting after discussion with my compatriots," said Shantu
Larma on Wednesday night, who is leading the delegation of the
Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS), the political
wing of the armed rebels in the CHT.
</P>
<P>
However, Shantu Larma did not disclose when the next meeting
would take place.
</P>
<P>
He also did not speak anything about the terms and reference of
the draft accord on a permanent solution of the two-decade-old
problems in the ethnic strife-torn hill tracts.
</P>
<P>
Reading out a written statement on behalf of both sides, he
said that the ceasefire, which is still holding after several
renewals since 1992, had been extended upto December 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
Chief Whip and Chairman of the National Committee on CHT Hasnat
Abdullah, head of the government delegation, was standing at the
left of Shantu who said that the statement had the concurrence of
both sides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
Chairperson Khaleda Zia in a statement on the same day cautioned
against signing any agreement on CHT against the interests of the
nation and its people.
</P>
<P>
The former Prime Minister said the press reports on withdrawal
of army camps from the CHT created concern among the people.
</P>
<P>
Such steps would render the country's security fragile and
endanger life and property of the non-tribal people residing in
the area, about one-tenth of the territory of Bangladesh, she
added.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the signing ceremony would be
held within the next couple of months because it would need time
to formulate the final document.
</P>
<P>
The positive outcome came from the sixth round of talks
initiated by the present government to hammer out a formula of

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Coordinate With Neighbors to Control Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will cooperate and
coordinate with Malaysia and Singapore in controlling the forest
fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan, which have caused thick haze
spreading to the two neighboring countries, a senior official
said.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation will be made a priority to be taken to control
the fires," State Minister for Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja
said last night after attending a meeting of ASEAN environment
ministers being held here.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with Malaysia and Singapore, Sarwono said,
cloud-seeding would be made directly upon the spots of fire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Singaporean Minister for Environment Yeo Cheow Tong,
who is attending also the meeting, said Singapore would help make
the cloud-seeding and provide a satellite picture to detect the
forest situation in Sumatra and Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia will provide meteorological data, weather forecasts,
feasibility studies and air quality index to support the
implementation of cloud-seeding, Malaysian Science, Technology and
Environment Minister Datuk Law Hieng Ding said.
</P>
<P>
At least 300,000 hectares of forest, mostly in Sumatra and
Kalimantan, have been destroyed by fires in Indonesia this year.
</P>
<P>
The haze caused by the fires has reached an unhealthy level
here and in Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Officials here said about 20 million people are in danger of
respiratory problems due to the thick smoke.
</P>
<P>
The haze has also caused the delay of 800 flights and at least
seven boat collisions on central Kalimantan's Mahakam River in the
last few months.
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's meeting, Indonesia also proposed the setting up
of a regional command post for environmental information to
anticipate unpredictable environmental problems, sources at the
meeting said today.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, which was opened Tuesday by President
Soeharto, is being attended by representatives from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

COLOMBO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police have warned
the public that small daily utility items such as hair brushes
could turn out to be sharp knives in the hands of underworld
elements, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Some of these dangerous weapons were disguised as key tags,
fountain pens, hair brushes and toy pistols, police said.
</P>
<P>
Police said that a hair brush of the person seated next to you
on a bus could be a well-concealed weapon.

<HEADLINE> China's Growth Means Opportunity for World: WB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China's rapid economic
growth will be an opportunity for, not a threat to the world
economy, the World Bank said today.
</P>
<P>
To avoid losses to everybody, China's accession to the World
Trade Organization is imperative, the bank said in its "China
2020" report released here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Once China's accession to the WTO is completed, trade relations
will become easier to handle and China's engagement with its
trading partners in a multilateral setting will strengthen
dialogue and encourage cooperation, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"If China's trading partners were to raise barriers to its
exports and China were to retaliate, the losses to everybody could
be large," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The opening of China's economy is an integral part of its
economic reform and a central element in its growth. Between 1978
and 1995, the value of exports and imports as a share of GDP
tripled and China became the world's second-largest recipient of
foreign direct investment after the United States.
</P>
<P>
By 2020, China could be the world's second largest exporter and
importer, and its consumers may have a purchasing power larger
than all of Europe's, the report predicted.
</P>
<P>
China's international integration is important to the rest of
the world as its trading partners will benefit from exporting to
its "vast and largely untapped markets", the report said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, foreign investors will be interested in China's sea
of skilled and disciplined workers, it added.
</P>
<P>
Industrial countries will benefit unequivocally from China's
rising demand for capital- and knowledge-intensive manufactures
and primary products and from significant terms of trade gains,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"Only their labor-intensive manufacturing will face a squeeze,
but much of that structural change would have happened anyway,
with or without China," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the World Bank held that among developing countries
the effects of China's integration will depend on how much they
trade directly with China and how much they compete in third
markets.
</P>
<P>
Countries that trade heavily with China will gain
significantly, the report said, adding that low- and middle-income
countries that are close competitors with China will experience
some terms of trade losses, "but their total trade will keep
growing and perhaps their world market share of labor-intensive
manufactures as well".

<HEADLINE> Credit Ratings For Thai Financial Firms Downgraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The New York-based ratings
agency, Standard and Poor's, has downgraded the credit ratings for
seven Thai financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Among the seven are Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest commercial
bank, and a few other large banks, such as Thai Farmers Bank and
Siam Commercial Bank.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Bank's credit ratings for foreign currency and local
currency had both been cut to BBB from A minus.
</P>
<P>
Thai Farmers Bank saw its ratings for both categories lowered
to BBB minus from BBB, and to BBB minus from BBB plus,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Siam Commercial Bank saw reductions to BBB minus from BBB plus
for both its foreign and local currency ratings.
</P>
<P>
Standard and Poor's predicted that non-performing loans in
Thailand's banking system would rise to at least 15 percent of
total loans next year as asset quality deteriorates.
</P>
<P>
The non-performing loans stood at 8.15 of the total at the end
of June, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency warned the banks' asset qualities would worsen into
next year and said a further downgrade could not be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans currently exceed 30 billion U.S. dollars,
with much of it provided to property developers, who are now
unable to repay their debts as a result of property oversupply.
</P>
<P>
The agency predicted the bad loans would continue to mount
before peaking in the latter part of fiscal 1998 (October 1,
1997-September 30, 1998), since the real estate sector "is in a
significant slump" and would not improve in the short term.

<HEADLINE> WB on China's Economic Growth in Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The rapid growth of China's
economy over the next quarter-century is clearly possible as China
has some real advantages, the World Bank said today.
</P>
<P>
In its "China 2020" report released here this morning, the
World Bank said that China's high savings rate, relative
stability, large domestic market, and record of reform bode well
for future growth.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the needed savings rate and productivity growth,
China shall maintain the momentum of reforms and skilled
macroeconomic and sectoral management, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It said that China's Ninth Five-Year Plan and its Fifteen-Year
Perspective Plan, which focus not just on the future pace of
growth but also on the entire direction of development, have laid
out the government's approach to achieving rapid and sustained
growth well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
China's Five-Year Plan for 1996-2000 targets the growth of the
gross domestic product (GDP) of eight percent a year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the first year of the plan, GDP growth reached 9.5
percent. To achieve the plan target by 2000, China will need to
grow by an average of 7.6 percent a year over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
By the standards of recent years, such growth does not seem
unduly ambitious, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report pointed out that China needs to deepen
its reforms and maintain stability to achieve a stable
macroeconomic environment and financial system, which will enable
savings to be channeled to their most productive uses.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese government has a responsibility to
manage the change of the structure of the labor force, which will
accompany the growth.
</P>
<P>
The report said that even if China's savings rate declines from
around 40 percent to a still-robust 35 percent over the next ten
years, while productivity growth fades slightly, to a more modest
1.5 percent a year, its GDP growth would be 8.4 percent a year
between 1996 and 2000 and would average 6.6 percent over the 25
years until 2020.
</P>
<P>
By 2020 per capita income in China would be approaching those
of Portugal today but would still be less than half those in the
United States, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Industry will continue to account for a much larger share of
GDP and agriculture is expected to grow at about the same rate as
it has in the past, the said.
</P>
<P>
Services are expected to be by far the most dynamic sector of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Despite strong growth in the past decade, the share of services
in China's GDP is still well below that of a typical low-income
country.
</P>
<P>
This share could change dramatically over the next 25 years as
China acquires the characteristics of middle-income market
economies.
</P>
<P>
A key element in China's growth scenario is the transformation
in the composition of the labor force, the report noted. The
transformation should be viewed as an opportunity, not a threat.
</P>
<P>
China's surplus labor is one of its greatest
resources. Efficiently handled, it will provide a powerful impetus
to growth, it added.

<HEADLINE> China Able to Meet Challenges Ahead, Sustain Rapid Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China can meet the
challenges ahead and sustain its rapid growth in the coming decades,
said a report released here today by the World Bank a few days
before the opening of the World Bank/International Monetary Fund
Annual Meetings.
</P>
<P>
In the 161-page "China 2020", a special report of the WB/IMF
Annual Meetings devoted to the host country, the World Bank highly
praised the economic achievements China has made so far and
expressed strong optimism about the country's future development
after scrutinizing every aspect of its economy.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank said that the two historic transitions China
has been experiencing from a command economy to a market-based
one and from a rural, agricultural society to an urban,
industrial one, have so far been "spectacularly successful".
</P>
<P>
China is the fastest-growing economy in the world, with per
capita incomes more than quadrupling since 1978. In two
generations it has achieved what took other countries centuries,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Swift growth and structural change, while resolving many
problems, have created new challenges concerning employment,
inequality, poverty, environment, and periods of macroeconomic
instability.
</P>
<P>
"China can meet these challenges and sustain rapid growth," it
asserted, adding that although the difficulties ahead should not
be underestimated, neither should China's strengths -- relative
stability, a remarkably high savings rate, a strong record of
pragmatic reforms, a disciplined and literate labor force, a
supportive Chinese diaspora, and a growing administrative
capacity.
</P>
<P>
"These strengths have driven China's growth for the last two
decades of this century. They could do the same in the first two
decades of the next," it said.
</P>
<P>
To nurture these strengths and use them effectively, the World
Bank suggested, reforms must develop in three related areas:
</P>
<P>
First, the spread of market forces must be encouraged,
especially through reforms of state enterprises, the financial
system, grain and labor markets, and pricing of natural resources;
</P>
<P>
Second, the government must begin serving markets by building
the legal, social, physical, and institutional infrastructure
needed for their rapid growth;
</P>
<P>
Finally, integration with the world economy must be deepened by
lowering import barriers, increasing the transparency and
predictability of the trade regime, and gradually integrating with
international financial markets.
</P>
<P>
In summary, the report said that the past two decades have
seen China's sustained, rapid modernization unlike in any other
period in the country's long history. The next two decades
promise more of the same.
</P>
<P>
"The huge risks that China faces could yet take the shine off
this potential. But with resolute leadership at home and
statesmanlike policies from the world's industrial powers, China
can overcome these challenges," it asserted.
</P>
<P>
The report said that one-fifth of humanity would then have
within its grasp the power to break free of the shackles of
poverty and underdevelopment and accomplish what could become the
most remarkable economic transformation the world has ever seen.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Get Loan From Islamic Bank </HEADLINE>

DHAKA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will get a total of
25 million U.S. dollars from the Islamic Development Bank (IDB)
under three agreements signed here Wednesday, the independent
United News of Bangladesh (UNB) reported today.
</P>
<P>
At present, a total of 13 projects in different sectors are
being implemented with IDB assistance, the UNB said, adding that
the bank's lending to these projects amounted to 83.50 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IDB's lending to Bangladesh totals 800 million dollars, the
UNB said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the IDB has already sent a message to the Bangladesh
Government to disburse another 27 million dollars in the second
phase under the credit line, and an agreement to this effect is
expected shortly, the UNB said.

<HEADLINE> WB: China in Midst of Historic Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first transition, from a rural, agricultural society to an
urban, industrial one, is remarkable because of China's vast size,
 its past control of urbanization and unprecedented speed of its
industrialization, said the WB report "China 2020: Development
Challenges in the New Century" released here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The second transition, from a command economy to a market-based
 one, has also been unique with a combination of experimentation
and incremental reforms, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank attributed China's rapid growth during the past
two decades to the interplay and synergy between these two
transitions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy expanded more than fourfold in the past 15
years. Between 1978 and 1995, real gross domestic product (GDP)
per capita grew at the blistering rate of 8 percent a year and
lifted 200 million Chinese out of absolute poverty.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank also noted that the benefits of growth have been
 widely shared among China's country-size provincial
economies. Although the coastal provinces grew faster than average
at 9.7 percent a year, the other provinces also fared well.
</P>
<P>
Another noteworthy feature of China's growth since the
beginning of reform in 1978 is its reliance on productivity
growth. Relative to other rapidly growing Asian economies, China's
 growth has been less dependent on volume increases in inputs of
capital and labor, the World Bank report said.
</P>
<P>
China's remarkably rapid growth has been driven by four
factors: high savings rate, structural change, pragmatic and
incremental reforms as well as agriculture, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
China's savings rate, averaging 37 percent of GDP between 1978
and 1995, is among the highest in the world. "Savings, as much as
growth, is China's real economic miracle," said the report.
</P>
<P>
It seems China has the capacity to meet any challenges facing
its economy given the country's strengths -- relative stability, a
 remarkably high savings rate, a strong track record of pragmatic
reforms, a supportive Chinese diaspora, and a growing
administrative capacity, the World Bank report said.
</P>
<P>
"These strengths have driven China's impressive growth in the
last two decades of this century," said the report. "They will be
equally necessary for rapid, sustainable growth in the first two
decades of the next century."

<HEADLINE> Three Sinhala Films Banned in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Public
Performances Board (PPB) has banned three Sinhala films that
contain explicit sex scenes, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
PPB Chairman Somaratna Balasuriya said the films, titled
"Salupata Ahasata" (Narrow Sky), "Ayadimi Sama" (Distant Peace)
and "Age Vairaya" (Her Revenge), could not be released even as
"very strictly for adults."
</P>
<P>
He said the films were akin to blue movies shown in Western
countries.
</P>
<P>
The board decided to withhold their release after viewing the
films.
</P>
<P>
The PPB had met the producers of the films and requested them
to cut those explicit scenes.
</P>
<P>
But the producers refused to do so and preferred to appeal
against the PPB's decision.

<HEADLINE> WB Offers Suggestions for China's Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today urged
China to further separate the roles of government and markets and
clarify rights and responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
A special report released by the World Bank here today said
that the separation and the clarification will help China lay the
foundations for sustained rapid growth and improve the quality of
people's life.
</P>
<P>
The report, "China 2020," said that the past 18 years in China
have underscored the importance of markets for growth and
prosperity, but the country's transition from a command to a
market economy is incomplete.
</P>
<P>
Many parts of the Chinese economy still have an undesirable
blurring of governmental and commercial functions, which creates
conflicts of interest within government and ultimately could harm
the economy, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that China further its efforts to boost
revenues, expand intergovernmental transfers in revenues from
richer provinces to the poorer ones and build transparent,
responsive fiscal institutions.
</P>
<P>
On the reforms of the state enterprises, it said that there is
little disagreement in China about the need to reform state
enterprises and financial system, noting that the challenge is to
introduce the reforms while maintaining rapid growth and economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report said that rather than reforming all state
enterprises at once, China's central authorities are focusing on
1,000 large state firms and on plans to invigorate them and make
them the core of modern enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It said that a key element necessary for the invigoration of
these 1,000 enterprises is an improvement in their governance,
especially in two areas: clarity on rights to assets and
assignment of liabilities among owners (the government), managers,
and creditors; and organizational structures that provide a
reasonable balance of interests among owners, creditors, and
managers.
</P>
<P>
The report also called on the government to improve the
efficiency and competitiveness of the 1,000 large enterprises, for
many of them will be exposed to international competition once
China joins the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
On the subject of transforming the banking system, the report
said that how the banking system evolves over the next 25 years
will hinge on the success of these reforms.
</P>
<P>
It said that transforming the state banks into genuine
commercial banks is crucial if China is to avoid a major bank
insolvency and if market forces are to shape the allocation of
financial resources in China.
</P>
<P>
The most important policy change required is a reduction in
government influence over the allocation of loans, it added.
</P>
<P>
Reform of interest rate policy will be an essential but
treacherous feature of China's financial development, it said,
adding that the Chinese government has already taken steps in the
right direction by reducing the number of officially determined
interest rates, introducing treasury bill auctions, adjusting
interest rates more than in line with inflation and initiating
open market operations.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the financial sector has been the soft underbelly
of China's reforms. It is the sector most vulnerable to shocks.
The authorities must be as relentless in their pursuit of reforms
in this area of the economy as they have been in others.
</P>
<P>
On establishing the rule of law, the report said that China has
made considerable progress in developing legal norms that
correspond to the needs of a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Yet, it said, much remains to be done. It may take decades for
the rule of law to establish a firm foothold in China.
</P>
<P>
One remedy is to develop the legal profession and the next will
be to improve legal education.
</P>
<P>
To flourish, markets need a background of macroeconomic
stability, the report said, adding that in future the government
faces the more difficult task of maintaining macroeconomic and
financial stability by using indirect, market-friendly measures.

<P>
SEOUL, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Main opposition leader Kim
Dae-jung continues to lead his four major rivals in almost all of
the popularity polls.
</P>
<P>
Although official campaigning has yet to get under way, it is
the first time in South Korean history that an opposition
candidate has taken the lead in opinion polls for a presidential

veteran opposition leader of the National Congress for New
Politics (NCNP), is supported by 29.7 percent of voters in a
five-way competition that includes Governor Rhee In-je of Kyonggi
Province.
</P>
<P>
Rhee garnered 24 percent, followed by ruling New Korea Party

Rhee, who lost the ruling party's nomination to Lee in July,
left the party Saturday and announced his own bid for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Cho Soon, who is now president of the small opposition
Democratic Party (DP), came in fourth with support from 13 percent
of the survey respondents. Kim Jong-pil, leader of the second
opposition United Liberal Democrats (ULD), won 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung, who also topped the latest public polls conducted
by the Joong'ang Ilbo, Hankyoreh 21, and Sisa Journal news
weeklies, has topped the popularity polls since mid-August.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the Joong'ang survey showed that 50.6 percent of
the respondents believe the December presidential poll will mark
the first-ever transfer of power from a ruling party to the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
However, because none of the candidates enjoys an overwhelming
lead, experts say several possible alliances among candidates make
the situation far from clear.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung has been trying to persuade Kim Jong-pil to
support him since June. Negotiators from the two sides are
discussing which Kim should represent the two parties in the
election.
</P>
<P>
Kim of the ULD also seeks to join hands with ruling NKP
candidate Lee Hoi-chang.
</P>
<P>
In this context, Lee may also try to push for an alliance with
former Seoul Mayor Cho Soon to turn the election into a showdown
between him and Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts see a high possibility of an alliance
between independent Rhee and Cho in that both are calling for a
generational change in politics and the end of the political
domination of the so-called three Kims, referring to President Kim
Young-sam and opposition leaders Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-pil.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the analysts point out that both Rhee and Cho have
almost the same support base; they both take away votes from the
ruling party and Kim Dae-jung's NCNP.

Russia's joining of the organization.
</P>
<P>

<P>
BANGKOK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Industry Ministry
has reaffirmed that it would follow the policy to cut gypsum
exports to save the raw material for domestic use.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, Thailand will reduce gypsum exports by 20
percent each year with an eventual aim to eliminate exports of
gypsum, the ministry said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has set a quota of 4.24 million tons for gypsum
exports next year with a minimum export price at 17 U.S. dollars
per ton, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government last year introduced a quota policy to
restrict exports of gypsum and save the raw material for domestic
industries to produce higher value-added products for exports.
</P>
<P>
Thailand reportedly is among a few countries in Asia which have
gypsum resources. The country exported 5.3 million tons of gypsum
last year.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Investors Plough Into Ukrainian Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands has become the
third largest foreign investor in Ukraine following the United
States and Germany, and Dutch investors have brought a total of
32.5 million U.S. dollars into the former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a great deal of Dutch telecommunications
investment in Ukraine. They came in at the beginning, and the
investment is continuing," explained Dutch Embassy Counselor Onno
Eldernbosch.
</P>
<P>
Overhauling communications infrastructure in Ukraine requires
major capital investment. The joint venture, the UTEL, among the
Netherlands, Germany, the United States and Ukraine has to spend 5
million dollars on each of the digital international telephone
exchanges installed in places from Lvov (western Ukraine) to
Donetsk (eastern Ukraine). The Dutch phone company PTT Telecom
owns 10 percent of the UTEL.
</P>
<P>
"The equipment is all very expensive, and you can't just
install part of it. Once you decide to improve telecommunications
anywhere, you're committed to major expenditures," said UTEL
President Olexy Marynchuk. He estimates the company's overall
investment in the Ukrainian market will reach 150 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We began here in 1992, and I can't see the flow of Dutch money
stopping any time in the near future," he said.
</P>
<P>
PTT Telecom is also helping to fund Ukrainian Mobile
Communications (UMC), a joint venture of cellular telephone. The
UMC is setting up base stations, relay stations and transmission
units necessary to make a modern mobile phone network operate in
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
"It's a massive project and we're here in Ukraine for a long
term goal," UMC Marketing and Advertising Director Jakov
Schleicher said. He disclosed that the UMC has already invested
150 million dollars, and the total investment in 1997 will amount
to 57-60 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dutch businessmen has shown great interest in this country
despite perceived red tape.
</P>
<P>
"We are patient and flexible. We're guests here and must play
by Ukrainian rules," said ING Bank office director Robert
Grant. The ING, one of the Netherlands' largest banks, has
recently opened an office in Kiev.
</P>
<P>
Shell International Petroleum Company will likely to invest up
to 1.5 billion dollars in Ukraine, despite slow progress in its
negotiations with Ukrainian authorities on building oil pipelines
across the nation.

<HEADLINE> Former East German Doping Scandal Shocks World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Former East Germany left the
world shocked as systematic doping was disclosed by its biologist
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar here, German molecular biologist Werner Franke
showed classified documents which detail the exact dosages and
drugs used for the former East German athletes.
</P>
<P>
Some of the athletes named in the documents are still world or
European record holders and some were still in the competitive
arena.
</P>
<P>
Representatives at the seminar expressed shocks at the extent
of the systematic doping, which had affected children as young as
eight and with disturbing side effects particularly on girls.
</P>
<P>
However, to rewrite the record books would be difficult as none
of the East German athletes tested positive during competitions.
</P>
<P>
Currently a two-year ban is imposed in many sports for a
first-time offence, but some said this was not an effective
deterrent because some athletes were willing to take the risk.
</P>
<P>
Franke said the East German records showed that coaches and
team doctors were as much to blame and that many athletes took
drugs unknowingly or under great pressure.

LIMA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Peru's exports in the first

organization said.
</P>
<P>
Traditional product exports, including coffee and fish oil,

</P>
<P>
Prompex said exports have been doing well despite climatic
variations affecting most of the productive sectors of the country.
</P>
<P>
Prompex General Manager Antonio Castillo said the organization
is considering special programs to help agricultural exporters
tackle the problems caused by the "El Nino" phenomenon. The
government is also studying the possibility of increasing credit
for exporters.

Prompex is promoting new export products such as giant corn,

SANTIAGO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Chile began to launch a
campaign today to combat Hanta disease which has killed 20 people
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The country has distributed booklets to educate Chilean people
and foreign tourists how to prevent Hanta virus from spreading.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Health Minister Alex Figueroa said today in the
pamphlet that fighting Hanta virus is a task for everyone. The
only way to keep away the infection is taking simple measures,
such as house cleaning and proper disposal of garbage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Education Minister Jose Pablo Arellano said his
ministry will take part in the campaign, giving instructions to
elementary schools all over the country to educate children not to
contact with rodents, which are the main transmitters of the
sickness.
</P>
<P>
Hanta is a virus transmitted to human body by rodents through
the air, by eating rotten food and contacting rodent excrements
and urine.
</P>
<P>
About 50-60 percent of people infected with the disease will
die, said Marisol Concha, chief of the Epidemiology Department of

STOCKHOLM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Former tennis great Bjorn

agreed to pay part of his debt to 11 Swedish creditors.
</P>
<P>
Borg owed them more than 8 million Swedish kronor (about one

<HEADLINE> Italian Official Advocates Permanent War Crimes Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Italy believes that a permanent
international tribunal should be set up to try war criminals,
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said today.
</P>
<P>
He told a conference on unpunished crimes and human rights
violations in the Sicilian city of Siracusa that "only through a
permanent tribunal can peace go in step with justice and the
fundamental role of law in the new world order be affirmed."
</P>
<P>
He said that a diplomatic-level meeting will be held in Rome
next summer to pave the way for the establishment of such a
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
United Nations members favor a new permanent tribunal to judge
genocide, massacres and war crimes but some of their proposals may
virtually kill its ability to function. Legal experts from more
than 100 countries have been struggling to reconcile a myriad of
conflicting views.
</P>
<P>
The proposed new court will be separate from the International
Court of Justice at The Hague, which deals with disputes between
nations.
</P>
<P>
The new tribunal could be built on the four ad hoc tribunals
that have prosecuted heinous crimes since 1945. They include the
Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals that tried war criminals of World
War Two, a tribunal set up in The Hague during the Yugoslav civil
war, and another one set up in Arusha, Tanzania, after the 1994
genocide in Rwanda.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank is
fast-tracking a plan to hike banks' loan loss reserve rate from
1.3 to two percent as part of measures to prevent mounting
defaults, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The proposed plan is intended to protect the country's banking
system from excessive defaults, which triggered the current
financial turmoil sweeping the Southeast Asian region, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Amid the currency woes, Thai baht, Indonesian rupiah, Malaysian
ringgit, Philippine peso and Singapore dollar have devalued since
early July.
</P>
<P>
The peso broke the mark of 33 to the U.S. dollar in Wednesday's
trading due to unconfirmed reports that the country would cut
further banks' liquidity reserve rate which had already been
slashed from eight percent to six percent.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be caught unprepared," a Philippine Central
Bank official explained why the bank is mulling over the plan to
raise the loan loss reserve rate.
</P>
<P>
The monetary authorities are also looking into an amendment to
the General Banking Act to allow bank-creditors to go after a
debtor using a loan for other purposes than originally intended,
the reports said.

<HEADLINE> World Champion Hill Leaves Arrows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- World Champion Damon Hill has
departed from Arrows, the Formula One team confirmed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
To replace Hill, Arrows has signed Finla Salo to join the
team's other current driver Pedro Diniz of Brazil for the 1998
season, said director Tom Walkinshaw.
</P>
<P>
Hill, 37, joined the little-known Arrows team this year after
winning the drivers' championship last season with Williams. He
struggled to make an impact this season but lied in a miserable
13th place in the standings with seven points.
</P>
<P>
Salo, of Tyrrell-Ford this season, was 17th in the standings
with two points.
</P>
<P>
Hill, looking for a more competitive drive next season, has
been linked with a move to the Prost and Jordan teams. After
Prost said it had broken off talks with Hill, the world champion
was more likely to move to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Arrows said money was the main factor in letting Hill go. Hill
was paid a reported 4.5 million pounds (7.2 million U.S. dollars)
by Arrows this season but has reportedly been seeking an increase
for next year.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan's Private Sector Thriving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The number of
individually-owned businesses increased by 56,800 in southwest
China's Yunnan Province in the first eight months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The province now has more than 6,400 private enterprises, a
rise of 16.6 percent compared with the end of last year, according
to statistics.
</P>
<P>
"Since the policy of reforms and opening-up was introduced in
the late 1970s, Yunnan's private sector has been growing fast,"
said Fei Jia, an official of the Provincial Administration for
Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, the non-state sector has not yet
developed enough, restricting the overall economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that the combined output value of Yunnan's private
sector accounts for only two percent of the total industrial
output value.
</P>
<P>
To give impetus to the private sector, the province has been
pursuing a series of preferential policies on loans, taxation,
registration, and land use.
</P>
<P>
In line with a regulation, the private businesses run by
laid-off workers can enjoy tax-free treatment.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the effort, Yunnan's private businesses generated
contributed an aggregate output value of 7.6 billion yuan (910
million US dollars) in the past five years.

wrote the tune in 1994 after the 14th Party National
Congress. China's renowned musician He Luting later revised the
piece.
</P>
<P>
It was first sung by the city's 130,000 Party members, and
later caught on in the rest of the province. Now, nearly 30
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have requested
tapes or lyrics of the song, considering it a good educational
tool for improving the Party's work style and promoting ethical
and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
When interviewed by Xinhua, Xie took from his pocket a
newspaper clipping of the text of Jiang's report, and read aloud
the part about Party officials serving the people heart and soul.
</P>
<P>
"Every word of this passage strikes the chord in our hearts, and
we will make a greater effort to promote the building of a clean
government," Xie said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the city has launched campaigns to
encourage leading officials to build up a good public image. This
effort has greatly improved the morale of society, said Zhang
Kemin, secretary of the Zhenjiang City Party Commission for
Discipline Inspection.
</P>
<P>
"The report got to the core of our problems, and more
importantly, it defines a fundamental way to eliminate graft,"
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang sang part of the song: "People's cadres must bear in mind
that every post holds a corresponding duty;they must work in the
interests of the people and bring happiness to them; and they can
only win trust and confidence of the people by serving them
wholeheartedly."

<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Faustino Asprilla
scored a hat-trick for Newcastle to beat Barcelona 3-2 in one of
12 games that kicked off the Champions Cup soccer tournament on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The talented Colombian converted the first on a penalty in the
22nd minute and headed in the second and third in the 31st and
48th minutes respectively.
</P>
<P>
The penalty kick was argued by Spanish goalie Ruud Hesp as he
dived for a loose ball and Asprilla went down, however his last
two goals were a sure display of skills of a soccer genius.
</P>
<P>
Asprilla's two clean headers were a repeat of feat as he jumped
skyward and knocked in two perfect passes from Keith Gillespie.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona was awakened to a 3-0 deficit and scored its late
goals in the 73rd and 89th minutes through Luis Enrique Martinez
and Luis Figo.
</P>
<P>
Early, Brazilian Rivaldo hit the crossbar in the 79th and the
Spaniards were almost to tie the scoreboard as Christophe Dugarry
sailed a close-in header wide in injury time.
</P>
<P>
In the 24-team competition, Manchester United had a 3-0 win in
Kosice, Slovakia, on goals by Denis Irwin, Henning Berg and Andy
Cole despite the absence of several key players.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Real Madrid of Spain had a better luck than
Barcelona, beating Norway's Rosenborg 4-1 as Italian Christian
Panucci scored the opener and Alessandro Del Piero added two in
eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
Juventus, runner-up last year, also savored a 5-1 victory over
Feyenoord of the Netherlands through goals from Filippo Inzaghi,
Zinedine Zidane and Alessandro Birindelli.
</P>
<P>
In Istanbul, defending champion Borussia Dortmund beat Turkey's
Galatasaray 1-0 as Stephane Chapuisat intercepted a pass to score
the lone winner in the 74th minute.
</P>
<P>
Bayern Munich won its home game 2-0 over Besiktas of Turkey
through Thomas Helmer and Mario Basler in an otherwise lackluster
match.
</P>
<P>
In other games, Olympiakos Piraeus scored a 1-0 victory over
Portugal's Porto in Athens through Stelios giannacopoulos,
Sporting Lisbon beat Monaco 3-0 at home on goals from Oceano Cruz,
Moroccan striker Mustapha Hadji and Brazilian Leandro Machado.
</P>
<P>
German Bayer Leverkusen won 1-0 over Belgian Lierse SK at home
through a controversial penalty in the 39th minute, Dinamo Kiev
pulled a surprise away win of 3-1 over PSV Eindhoven while Paris
St Germain won 3-0 at home over Goteborg of Sweden and Parma of
Italy played a 0-0 draw at Sparta Prague.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Helicopter Crashes in Bosnia, 12 Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. helicopter crashed over
a fog-shrouded hill in Central Bosnia today, killing 12 people,
including a senior German diplomat.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials said all the passengers -- five Germans, five
Americans, a Briton and a Pole -- were all killed.
</P>
<P>
The four members of the Ukrainian crew survived the accident,
said Kai Eide, head of of the U.N. mission in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
German diplomat Gerd Wagner, deputy to the international High
Representative to Bosnia, and a U.S. official, David Kriskovic,
working as the deputy commissioner of the U.N. International
Police Task Force, were among those killed.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said the death of Wagner
was a major loss to the Bosnian peace effort.
</P>
<P>
"I can only hope that the parties to the Dayton Peace Agreement
commemorate his loss of life by redoubling their efforts to
achieve the goal of lasting peace," Solana said.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter, a Soviet-built Mi-8, ran into dense fog while
flying through a valley near Fojnica, 50 kilometers northwest of
the capital Sarajevo, Eide said.
</P>
<P>
"Visibility was cut to a minimum. The pilots attempted to
ascend, but before they reached a safe altitude the helicopter hit
a mountainside," Eide said.
</P>
<P>
"The glass nose of the helicopter was shattered, allowing the
crew to escape through the front. Although injured in the crash,
the crew attempted to assist the passengers but were hindered by
fire and thick smoke."
</P>
<P>
One passenger was found alive and evacuated by NATO soldiers
but later died of his injuries.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said
they had no reason to believe the crash was anything other than an
accident.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian Conservation Foundation has decided on a
radical change of direction following an internal review that
identified a serious lack of public engagement with environmental
issues, such as the greenhouse emission debate, uranium mining and
wood chipping.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The union movement in Australia has warned that the
Australian government's attempts to rein in union power in two key
sectors, the coal-mining and stevedoring industries, may lead to a
national blockade of shipping and spread to workers in other key
industries.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Australia's two largest health funds will increase their
premiums by up to 20 percent on October 1, or up to 144 U.S.
dollars, for more than three million people, offsetting the
federal tax rebates intended to encourage more people to take out
private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Australian bond interest rates yesterday plunged to record
lows in the wake of one of the lowest U.S. inflation figures in a
decade, as expectations mounted in local markets of a further cut
in official rates.

<HEADLINE> Purposes, Principles of UN Charter Inviolable: China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Purposes and
Principles of the United Nations Charter and the spirit of
Resolution 2758 were inviolable, stressed Ambassador Qin Huasun,
permanent representative of China to the United Nations, today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the General Committee of the 52nd session of the
General Assembly, Ambassador Qin said, "Having been defeated for
four consecutive years, a very small number of countries, in
disregard of the norms of international law, the United Nations
Charter and the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly,
have put forward once again this year the proposal on the
so-called Taiwan's `return to the United Nations,' in which they
openly requested review of Resolution 2758 of the General
Assembly."
</P>
<P>
"The proposal distorts facts in a brazen attempt to make use of
the augustness of the organization of the United Nations to carry
out activities aimed at splitting a sovereign state and creating
`two Chinas,' `one China, one Taiwan,' or `one country, two
governments,'" said Qin.
</P>
<P>
Qin said this had not only seriously encroached upon China's
sovereignty and grossly interfered in its internal affairs, but
also willfully trampled upon the Purposes and Principles of the
Charter and Resolution 2758 of the General Assembly, at which
the Chinese government and people expressed their strong
indignation and condemnation.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly oppose the inclusion of item 159 of the provisional
agenda in the agenda of the current session of the General
Assembly and hope that members of the General Committee will
uphold justice, safeguard the Purposes and Principles of the
Charter and the spirit of Resolution 2758 and support the position
of the Chinese delegation," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Qin said, "Taiwan has been an inalienable part of the Chinese
territory since ancient times. The 1943 Cairo Declaration and the
1945 Potsdam Proclamation once again affirmed China's sovereignty
over Taiwan. To date, 159 countries have established diplomatic
relations with China. They all recognize that there is but one
China in the world, that the Government of the People's Republic
of China is the sole legal government representing China in its
entirety and that Taiwan is part of China."
</P>
<P>
Qin said, "In 1971, the General Assembly adopted at its 26th
session by an overwhelming majority the historically significant
Resolution 2758. This resolution clearly and unequivocally
recognizes that the representatives of the Government of the
People's Republic of China are the only lawful representatives of
China to the United Nations and that the People's Republic of
China is one of the five permanent members of the Security
Council and decides to restore all rights of the People's
Republic of China in the United Nations and immediately expel the
representatives of Taiwan from the place which they unlawfully
occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related
to it."
</P>
<P>
Qin stressed that this resolution had accurately grasped the
essence of the question of China's representation at the United
Nations, and the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's
Republic of China and the expulsion of the Taiwan authorities from
the United Nations were two indivisible aspects of the same
question.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the resolution had affirmed the "one China" principle,
thus settling once and for all and in a just manner the question
of China's representation at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The resolution which had reflected the Purposes and Principles
of the Charter as well as the desire of an overwhelming majority
of countries of the United Nations was a victory of justice, Qin
added.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The General Committee
of the 52nd session of the General Assembly of the United Nations
today decided not to consider the question of the so-called
"representation" of Taiwan at the current session.
</P>
<P>
It has been for five consecutive years that the General
Committee foiled Taiwan's plots aiming at splitting a sovereign
country and creating "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan" or "one
country, two governments."
</P>
<P>
On July 14, 1997, Nicaragua and a very small number of other
countries addressed a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
in which they requested inscription on the agenda of the 52nd
session of the General Assembly of an item on the so-called
"necessity to review Resolution 2758 of the General Assembly of
the United Nations due to fundamental change in the international
situation and two governments co-existing across the Taiwan
Straits."
</P>
<P>
The General Committee comprises the President of the General
Assembly and the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly, and the chairs
of the six Main Committees.
</P>
<P>
The General Committee considers the provisional agenda and the
supplementary list, considers the requests for the inclusion of
additional items on the agenda, allocates items to committees, and
submits its report for the approval of the Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Canada Reaps Budgetary Surplus in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government reaped
a budgetary surplus of 800 million dollars (576 million US
dollars) in July, the Finance Department said today.
</P>
<P>
July is the third consecutive month in which the government
recorded a surplus.
</P>
<P>
This figure represents a net improvement in the government's
budgetary position of 2 billion dollars (1.44 billion US dollars)
from July 1996.
</P>
<P>
In July, the government's budgetary revenues were up 8.8
percent, while program spending declined 8.1 percent. And public
debt charges were down 8.7 percent, the department said in its
monthly Fiscal Monitor release.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this fiscal year, the government
has reported a surplus of 300 million dollars (210 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
While in the same period last year, it recorded a deficit of
6.5 billion dollars (4.6 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
This turnaround came largely from an improving economy and the
restraint measures introduced in the past two years, the
department said.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Worried Over German Economic Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Germany's central bank today
voiced worries that the country's economic recovery could not
sustain, saying political factors were hampering an increase in
investments vital to stimulate economy, which has been all the
time dependent on exports.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly report for September, the Bundesbank stressed
that investments were the key to ignite the second stage of
economic recovery just as export was in the first stage.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, "political uncertainties concerning important
reform projects" were leading to a wait-and-see attitude of the
potential investors.
</P>
<P>
The report believed that without increased investments, the
country's problems of high unemployment -- currently at an
"unacceptable" level of more than 4 million -- and weak
consumption could not be overcome.
</P>
<P>
It hailed the signs of revival in domestic demand and noted
that the increased spending by private households applied only to
food and beverage items, but not to durable goods.
</P>
<P>
The decisive factor which would trigger a long-term recovery in
consumption would be an increase "in investments at home through
which additional jobs would be created, in turn increasing
disposable income," it said.
</P>
<P>
But such a far-reaching improvement in investments was not in
sight, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank in the report warned against any overestimation
of the current economic situation in Germany, saying the problems
facing Germany as an economic base were far from being solved.

WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- White House press
secretary Mike McCurry, commenting today on a University of Texas
law professor's remarks about minority students, said that those
kinds of remarks don't go down well with the president.
</P>
<P>
McCurry was responding to a reporter's question about Lino
Graglia, a professor of constitutional law, who said last week
that blacks and Mexican-Americans "are not academically
competitive with whites in selective institutions."
</P>
<P>
Some students and faculty members, along with state legislators
gathered Tuesday to protest the remarks and called for Graglia's
ouster.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said President Bill Clinton was encouraged by the
disapproving response among students and faculty members, and he
pointed to the incident as one reason why the president initiated
a national dialogue on race relations last spring.

UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The General Assembly
this afternoon elected South Africa as vice-president for the 52nd
session, replacing Zimbabwe, who was elected Tuesday
vice-president as well as chairman of the Fourth Committee.
</P>

Rules of Procedure which states that "no two members of the
General Committee shall be members of the same delegation." The
General Committee, which comprises the assembly president, the 21

therefore not properly constituted.
</P>
<P>
The 21 vice-presidents of the current session are China, the

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 17 (Xinhua) -- While expressing their
profound shock and grief over the killing of five Iranian
trainees, Pakistan leaders were confident that the terrorist
attack would not affect the country's friendly ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Five Iranian National Civil Aviation trainees, who came here in
August for two months of training, and their Pakistani driver were
killed by three unidentified gunmen this morning at Rawalpindi,
the sister city of the Pakistani capital.
</P>
<P>
According to local police, the Iranians were attacked on their
way from the Kamra aeronautical complex, some 70 kilometers west
of Rawalpindi, to the Civil Aviation Dhamial Camp in the city.
</P>
<P>
When their van reached the busy Chour Chowk, three unidentified
motorcyclists appeared on the road and sprayed bursts of
Kalashnikov bullets on the van, smashing the windscreen of the
vehicle and killing the driver and two of the trainees on the
spot. The other three succumbed to their injuries on their way to
hospital.
</P>
<P>
High officials of district administration rushed to the spot as
soon as they heard about the incident and police have sealed off
all the main points of the city to look for the culprits.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani Defense Ministry is now making arrangements for
sending the bodies of the trainees back to Iran on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the shooting, Iran lodged a strong protest
against Pakistan over the killing and demanded swift arrest and
punishment of the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
Expressing their profound grief over the killings, Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, President Farooq Leghari and Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub Khan assured that the government would give
exemplary punishment to the culprits.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan leaders also expressed their confidence that
bilateral relations between Pakistan and Iran would not be
adversely affected by the terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
"Relations between Pakistan and Iran rest on the solid
foundations of our Islamic faith, a shared cultural heritage and
coincidence of interests on the major issues of our time," Sharif
said in a message addressed to Iranian President Sayed Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that no dastardly act of terrorism can affect
our time-tested friendship which serves the larger interests of
the two brotherly peoples," he said.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said in his condolence message that Pakistan remains
committed to a close cooperative relationship with Iran and shall
work closely with the Iranian government in defeating the
nefarious objectives of the criminal terrorists.
</P>
<P>
So far no group or individuals have claimed responsibility for
the killing. According to unconfirmed reports, police have
arrested two persons suspected of involvement in the killing.
However, analysts here believed that some sectarian groups may be
behind the tragedy.

JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Palestinians

with Israeli riot police this evening.
</P>
<P>
Six demonstrators were arrested.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, waving Palestinian flags and shouting
slogans of anti-Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem, took to the
street and march toward the two houses in Ras Al-Amud in which
three Jewish families moved in on Sunday.
</P>

<P>
BRUSSELS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- 13 information and
communication companies will work together to bring multimedia to
schools in Europe, the European Commission (EC) said today.
</P>
<P>
They are working together within the framework of an action
plan, entitled Learning in the Information Society, in order to
enable schools to cooperate through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The companies, including Apple Computers, British Telecom,
Belgacom, Microsoft and Oracle, have formed the European Education
Partnership.
</P>
<P>
The group is aimed at offering concrete help to specific needs
in the educational sector, such as the connection among schools,
the equipment maintenance, training teachers and developing
multimedia content.
</P>
<P>
The partnership will become even more operational with the
creation in early 1998 of a foundation grouping private and public
undertakings and educational authorities from the member states of
the European Union (EU), said the EC, the EU's executive body.
</P>
<P>
One of the main objectives of the action plan is to strengthen
the cooperation between public and private undertakings in
bringing multimedia into schools.
</P>
<P>
The plan was initiated by Edith Cresson, the EU commissioner
for research, education, training and youth.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Spokesman on Clerides-Denktash Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A Cypriot government
spokesman said here today that the upcoming talks between Greek
and Turkish Cypriot leaders on security issues will aim at finding
concrete solutions to matters concerned to both sides.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, government spokesman
Manolis Christofides said that during the talks between Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash, each side will present particular security concerns.
</P>
<P>
However, he said President Clerides' proposal for the
demilitarization of the Cyprus island is "a fundamental aspect
which could be included in the security matters to be discussed."
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.N. will not put forward any proposals
during the talks and there is no agenda for the talks.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Clerides, U.N. Resident Representative
Gustave Feissel said here today that he expected the first meeting
to take place next week and "if possible early next week." The
U.N. official is expected to have a meeting Thursday with Denktash
to fix the exact date of the Clerides-Denktash talks.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on security talks between two Cypriot
communities' leaders was announced Monday by U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright during a stop-over in Cyprus after a tour
to the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
It was the result of a shuttle-diplomacy by newly-appointed
U.S. State Department's Special Coordinator for Cyprus Thomas
Miller during his four-day visit to the island following the
failure of two rounds of U.N.-led direct talks between Clerides
and Denktash in July and August.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also noted that only Clerides and Denktash will
be present at the talks, in the presence of Gustave Feissel.
</P>
<P>
He said that the agreement reached aims at creating an
atmosphere which will facilitate negotiations between the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot sides on the fundamental aspects of the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops took over the northern
third of the island in the wake of a short-lived coup seeking
union with Greece by some Greek Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan, Xinjiang Delegates Give Press Conference (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asked to comment on the remarks about Tibet made by Frank Wolf,
a Republican congressman from the State of Virginia, USA, Chen
Kuiyuan, secretary of the CPC Committee of the Tibet Autonomous
Region, said Wolf spread lots of rumors on Tibet after sneaking
round in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
"His remarks are groundless," he said.
</P>
<P>
For example, Wolf said there were "more Chinese in Lhasa than
Tibetans," though he had never been to Tibet before, nor did he
know how many people of the Han nationality there are in Tibet.
"On what grounds did he say there are more Hans than Tibetans in
Tibet?" Chen asked.
</P>
<P>
Wolf alleged that Tibetan buildings had been buried among the
Han-style buildings. Chen said Lhasa is undertaking the
modernization drive, and hence there is little difference between
the buildings of the Han-style and that of the Western style and
Tibetan style.
</P>
<P>
On Wolf's remarks that there is no religious freedom, Chen said
the Lamas have been engaged in religious activities in Tibet's
monasteries every day. All religious people lead an ordinary
religious life.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, some people outside China have wantonly
fabricated sensational rumors to vilify modern Tibet and pour
dirty water on the Tibetan people in order to mislead the public
opinion. "This has led to confusions and misunderstanding of
Tibet, and Wolf's remarks are a case in point," the regional Party
chief said.
</P>
<P>
On relations between different ethnic groups, Abdul'ahat
Abdurixit, chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said
people of different ethnic groups are working hard to develop,
build and safeguard the border regions.
</P>
<P>
So far, people of various ethnic groups have established new
relations of equality, mutual help and unity. Both the Han people
and other ethnic groups cannot do without each other.
</P>
<P>
However, there are only a handful of people who are creating
contradictions and carrying out activities to split the
motherland. "The overwhelming majority of the people in Xinjiang
love socialism and safeguard the reunification of the motherland,"
he said.

<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The education in patriotism
which started in May last year focuses mainly on democratic and
legal system, religious policies, safeguarding the unity of the
motherland, and the struggle against splittism, a Tibetan leading
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference today attended by Chinese and
overseas reporters, Raidi, chairman of the Tibet Autonomous
Regional People's Congress, said the education has been carried
out "smoothly and healthily", and has been proved "effective".
</P>
<P>
Raidi is here in Beijing attending the current ongoing
five-yearly Party congress.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the education is to raise the conscientiousness of
the Tibetan monks and nuns to love the motherland and their
religion and abide by laws and regulations, he said, adding
that we aim at building a normal religious order suited to the
socialist society.
</P>
<P>
Raidi refuted the assertion that "the education has infringed
upon religious freedom", pointing out that "no country virtually
allows social organizations or people to violate laws, or allows
law-breaking activities under the pretext of religion."
</P>
<P>
"For over a decade, construction of temples and the recruiting
of Buddhist monks and nons were not standardized. Moreover the
Dalai Lama has been carrying out separative activities," Raidi
said, adding that "these factors gave rise to some activities that
breached either the law or the Buddhist doctrines."
</P>
<P>
In responding to a question on the current situation in
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Wang Lequan, secretary of the
Regional Party Committee, said the political and social situation
in the region is stable.
</P>
<P>
"Not long ago," Wang said, "a small number of people stirred up
a riot, which was very unpopular and was firmly opposed by
people of various nationalities in the region."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Dalai Lama's recent so-called advocation for
non-violence, Raidi pinpointed that Dalai has been carrying out
separative activities all the time since he fled to foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Splittists headed by Dalai have stirred up many riots in
collusion with Western hostile forces, which has disturbed the
peaceful life of the Tibetan," Raidi said, asking how can you say
what he has done was for peace.

<P>
LAGOS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Eleven west African peacekeepers
have been killed by land mines in Sierra Leone and five others died of
undisclosed illness in Liberia while carrying out their mission,
according to the Nigerian military authorities.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the 16 soldiers, said to be Nigerians, had been flown
to Nigeria for burial with military honors, Godwin Ugbo, Director
of Defense Information, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 11 soldiers were killed by land mines planted by the Sierra
Leone junta which seized power in a coup on May 25, instead of losing
their lives in recent crossfire with the junta army, the defense
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The soliders were under the command of the headquarters of the West
African Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG), which has succeeded in ending
Liberia's civil war and is in Sierra Leone to enforce economic embargo
ordered by sub-regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the embargo, aimded at forcing the junta out
of power, is hitting hard on Sierra Leone, leading to the spread of
malnutrition and diseases and shortage of daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Children's Fund has called for the supply of
humanitarian goods to the country, while a group of Sierra Leonean
traders have also appealed relaxation of the blockade so that goods
needed for day to day living can be imported.
</P>
<P>
Confrontation between ECOMOG troops and soldiers loyal to the junta
has also intensified the situation in the country, particularly at
port areas in the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of local residents have reportedly fled the areas with
their belongings for fear of renewed exchange of fire.

ADDIS ABABA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian peasants today
were urged to use natural and artificial fertilizers together to
boost agricultural productivity as well as keep the natural
resources intact.
</P>
<P>
The call came from Mengesha Bekele, General Manager of the

Mengesha also called on concerned bodies in the country to
encourage peasants to use natural and artificial fertilizers
together and improve soil fertility and reduce the country's
dependence on fertilizer imports.
</P>
<P>
He said, the natural fertilizers obtained from chickens' and
cattle manure as well as decay of dead leaves enrich plant
nutrients without causing environmental air-pollution.

<P>
He also noted that fertilizer consumption in Ethiopia has
steadily increased during the past 20 years. However, during the

civilian mediator in charge of implementing peace in Bosnia.
Speaking fluent Serbo-Croatian, Wagner assumed the post just three
months ago.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter with 16 people on board hit a mountain some 15
kilometers northwest off Sarajevo after leaving the Sarajevo
airport at about 9:15 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
The people were heading for Bugojno to check conditions for the
return of refugees on behalf of the Bosnian peacekeeping forces
SFOR, Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
Five Germans, including Wagner, five U.S. citizens, one British
national and one Pole were killed. The four Ukrainian crew members
survived the tragic accident, Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kinkel, the pilot of the helicopter said that the
plane had flown into an unexpected dense fog. And when it emerged
from the fog, the mountain was right in front of the plane into
which it crashed.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Take Steps for Possible Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's cabinet
today approved several measures to counter the expected effects
of the El Nino phenomenon, which could cause severe drought in
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
A severe drought was expected from November to March 1998, and
its effect on South African economy needed to be mitigated by
pre-emptive disaster management, Constitutional Development
Minister Valli Moosa told a press conference in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
An Inter-Ministerial Committee for Disaster Management had
been set up to coordinate the activities of the government with
regard to the El Nino phenomenon, Moosa said.
</P>
<P>
He said the cabinet demanded the provincial governments take
steps to ensure that special institutions be established to deal
with the El Nino and other disaster related incidents, stressing
the Department of State Expenditure must ensure that an emergency
fund be made available.
</P>
<P>
A white paper on a pre-disaster policy would be tabled in
parliament in January next year.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet had also recommended that all departments and
provinces should develop and implement action plans to mitigate
the expected El Nino effects.
</P>
<P>
The ministers of agriculture and water affairs would announce
their plan of action soon, Moosa said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet had also approved an urgent ministers meeting of
the Southern African Development Community to address the
consequences of El Nino phenomenon.

<HEADLINE> EU Subcommittee Discusses Impact of Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union
subcommittee of the regions today devoted a full session to sports
as it discussed the impact that sports have on cities and regions,
both economically and culturally.
</P>
<P>
At its September plenary session, the committee delved into the
function of sports as a vehicle for demonstrating the identity of
regions and cities that have hosted or plan to host Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The 222 committee members were joined by Juan Antonio
Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC),
and a dozen of other sporting event organizers, club managers and
sporting stars as guest speakers.
</P>
<P>
The session was presided over by committee president and
Barcelona mayor Pasqual Maragall. His Spanish city played host to
the 1992 Summer Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"For the individual, sport is a source of health, passion and
quality of life," he told the session held in the form of
round-table discussion. "Sport is increasingly a part of our
culture and plays an important educational role.
</P>
<P>
"For communities of citizens, sport is also a vehicle of
cultural identity and a facet of socio-economic development.
Sometimes, sport can become a center for passions or political
interests."
</P>
<P>
It was for such a rationale that the EU Amsterdam Treaty, a
revision of the Maastricht Treaty has included sport as one of the
factors for drawing the peoples of the 15-nation union closer
together.
</P>
<P>
When asked what an ideal organization of the Olympic Games is,
the IOC chief, who was reelected on September 5 for another
four-year term, said that an ideal organization is to have
contributions from the private sectors of a society.
</P>
<P>
"It is ideal for an Olympics to be half-funded by private
sectors and half-funded by public sectors," Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
After announcing that Barcelona and Athens of Greece have just
forged a sister-city relationship, the Barcelona mayor said that
his advice to his Athens counterpart, Dimitris Avramopoulos, was
that each Olympic host city has to have its own project so as to
make its games different.
</P>
<P>
The Greek city has just won the rights to host the 2004 summer
Olympic Games, beating rivals of Rome of Italy, Cape Town of South
Africa, Stockholm of Sweden and Buenos Aires of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Both committee members and guest speakers also touched upon
such topics as sports in view of regional economic development
such as employment and construction of infrastructure and sports
in view of social cohesion within a society.
</P>
<P>
After the plenary session, Maragall, Samaranch and committee
members visited an exhibition showcasing the interrelations
between sports and regional and municipal economies and cultures.

<HEADLINE> Baril Appointed Canada's Chief of Defense Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Lieutenant-General Maurice
Baril has been promoted to the rank of general and appointed chief
of the defense staff, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien
announced today.
</P>
<P>
Prior to today's appointment, General Baril was commander of
the Land Forces Command.
</P>
<P>
"General Baril has had a distinguished career in the Canadian
Forces, with assignments ranging from serving in Cyprus to that of
military advisor to the Secretary-General of the United Nations,"
said a release from Chretien's office.
</P>
<P>
Chretien chose Baril over acting chief Vice-Admiral Larry
Murray partly because of the latter's name was tainted by fallout
from the Somalia scandal, and partly because of strong military
backing for Baril, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Murray will leave the military and become a civilian associate
deputy minister in November, Chretien said in the release.
</P>
<P>
The new chief of defense staff, who will turn 54 next week, got
a high profile last year when he led a multinational relief
mission to Zaire.
</P>
<P>
While in charge of the land forces in the past two years, Baril
criticized army leadership at all levels, and earned a reputation
as a straight-talking reformer.
</P>
<P>
He convened a surprise news conference in July last year to
announce that 34 soldiers had been implicated in misconduct,
drunkenness and black marketeering while they were deployed in
Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei: Iran Not Attempting to Acquire Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today dismissed U.S. allegation that Tehran is attempting
to acquire nuclear and chemical weapons, Iranian official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing commanders of Iran's Islamic Revolution's Guards
Corps (IRGC), Khamenei said "those claims have lost credibility
in the eyes of the world's public."
</P>
<P>
Khamenei, also commander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces, said
that Iran's strength does not emanate from inter-continental
ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"If such arms were source of real strength, the governments
possessing those would have long succeeded (in) imposing their
will over the world," he was quoted by the agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei also enumerated the U.S. failures in international
arena, its failures to suppress Muslim nations including the
Palestinians and many unsuccessful attempts to contain Iran's
progress as further evidences of ineffectivity of the arms.
</P>
<P>
The supreme leader termed the rank and file of the IRGC as
"children of the Islamic Revolution (in 1979)," emphasizing the
importance of adherence to piety both individually and within the
organization.
</P>
<P>
He further called for piety and strict devotion to the
doctrines of Islam as the source of Iran's strength and welfare
for its people.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammad
denied Iran's attempts to build nuclear weapons alleged by Israel.
</P>
<P>
At the same day, Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi rejected
recent allegations by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
that Iran was the main source of tension in the Middle East
because it was seeking weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
At his meeting with the commanders of the IRGC today, Khamenei
also attacked the United States for offering unconditional support
for the Israeli regime in conflicts with the Palestinians, noting
that "the Palestinian nation and its flag will remain alive,
instead, the Zionist regime and its staunch supporters will
disappear from the face of the earth."
</P>
<P>
The IRGC, Iran's main and largest fighting force, was formed by
Iran's clerical government shortly after it came to power in 1979
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC has an air wing of its own, and had its own navy until
it was merged with the regular naval forces a few years
ago.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Erupted in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 17 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was
killed and two others were wounded, one very critical, after
rival militiamen exchanged fire this afternoon in the center of
the busy Bakara market of South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said the shooting began when a dispute erupted
between two groups over the building of a new business kiosk in
the market.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the market said the dispute came after a group of
businessmen who owned a commercial store were attacked by about
six gunmen who wanted to build the kiosk right in front of their
store.
</P>
<P>
The store keepers defended themselves and returned fire. Store
owners nearby also opened fire in an attempt to stop the looters
taking chances from the trouble in the market.
</P>
<P>
The disputed area itself is not owned by any of the two groups
since it was one of the runways left for public use by the late
government for the smooth movements within the market. Many of
the runways and roads leading to and from Bakara market have
already been built by greedy business people taking advantage of
the anarchy and lawlessness in the country.
</P>
<P>
Other unconfirmed reports said the gunmen who attacked the
area have been looking for the other group for retaliatory
purpose.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the shooting has resulted in the immediate
closure of all business stalls surrounding the area where the
incident took place. Other businessmen have called up their
gunmen to strengthen the security of the area which was
immediately deserted.

<HEADLINE> British Newspapers to Tighten Curbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Editors of Britain's leading
newspapers today agreed to exercise more self-restraint in the
wake of the death of Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the editors, chairman of the Press
Complaints Commission (PCC) Lord Wakeham demanded a tighter code
of practice after paparazzi photographers were accused of
contributing to Diana's death in a car chase.
</P>
<P>
"We support Lord Wakeham's calls for wide-ranging and rigorous
reforms and recognize that there is a shared determination to rid
our publications of practices which we all deplore," said David
English, editor-in-chief of the Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
Wakeham said the PCC would discuss revisions to the
self-regulatory code next week with the aim of clamping down on
the use of intrusive photographs taken by freelance paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
The press watchdog would also aim to tighten newspaper
guidelines on questions of privacy, harassment, treatment of
children and intrusion into grief, he added.
</P>
<P>
British newspapers have promised either not to print paparazzi
photographs of Diana's sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, or
else not to breach their privacy with unauthorized photographs.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated calls for a press law, the British media
remains self-regulating. Legal experts say it would be hard to
draw up and enforce a law that distinguishes between people's
right to privacy and the right of the press to investigate matters
of public interest.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Exempt Palestinian Students From Tuition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has decided to exempt
Palestinian students from tuition and registration fees in a
show of concern for the Palestinians, the Middle East News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif said today that
the Palestinian students' registration and tuition fees last year
stood at 2.132 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the exemptions will apply to the
offsprings of Egyptian women whether divorced, widowed, or whose
Palestinian husbands work in the Egyptian government and public
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The privilege will also be granted to those Palestinian students
whose parents permanently live in Egypt and wish to join the
Egyptian universities and institutions but can not afford to pay
their registration and tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
These students will be fully exempted from registration fees
that range between about 1,600 and 2,250 dollars a year for every
student and asked to pay only 10 percent of their tuition fees, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority Ambassador here Zohdi el-Kodna
today praised the Egyptian move as "a courageous national
decision" that reflects Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
consistent support to the Palestinians living under the Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
He said education and culture is a vital part of the
Palestinians' future and an important weapon against Israeli
occupation. The Palestinian diplomat called upon other Arab
countries to follow Egypt's action.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has donated 10 million dollars to help ease the
plight of the Palestinians suffering under an Israeli closure
imposed following a double suicide bombing attack in Jerusalem on
July 30, which killed 17 people and injured 170 others.
</P>
<P>
The PNA lost between 5 million and 8 million dollars a day due
to the closure.

<HEADLINE> UNOSOM Accused of Committing Human Rights Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers here claimed that
more cases of human rights abuses committed by the contingents
from the multi-national forces of UNOSOM during their stay in
Somalia are bringing up here in the capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Ilyas Hagi Mohamud, one of the lawyers of the Somali
Intellectual Society (SIS), said they have 97 more cases of human
rights abuses committed by Italian soldiers in the U.N. Operation
in Somalia (UNOSOM), which vary from killing, torture and rape.
</P>
<P>
All the victims in the years of 1992 and 1993 and early 1994
need to be compensated, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the SIS, the lawyers said the Italian
committee investigating their soldiers' human rights abuses
should realize the extent of inhuman activities done by the
soldiers in Mogadishu and its surrounding districts and villages.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, SIS said there are also some cases involving the
Belgian forces in Kismayu, 500 km south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
In Kismayu itself, a local human rights organization, the
Jubbaland Human Rights, has revealed that the Belgian forces have
been charged for 137 cases, of which 84 are killings.
</P>
<P>
The Jubbaland Human Rights has condemned the judicial system
of the Belgian government, saying that Belgium has only surfaced
one case out of the large numbers in which the soldier was
acquitted.

<HEADLINE> IDB Okays First Financing to Uruguay from Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) today announced the approval of the first
financing to Uruguay from the Private Sector Department.
</P>
<P>
The first financing of some 25 million U.S. dollars is provided
for the construction, operation and maintenance of a 132-km
highway linking Montevideo with Punta del Este, as well as other
access roads.
</P>
<P>
The financing consists of two loans, a direct loan of 12
million dollars to the project company, Consorcio del Este, and a
syndicated loan of 13 million dollars with funds provided by
commercial banks under participation agreements with IDB.
</P>
<P>
The project will lead to greater private sector participation
in the Uruguayan economy and expansion and improvement of
transportation from the capital to Punta de Este, a tourism center
that produces a major share of the country's foreign exchange
earnings.
</P>
<P>
After completion of the project, 90 percent of the highway
between Montevideo and Punta del Este will be a two-lane toll road
in either direction.
</P>
<P>
The project is the first IDB financing for Uruguay from the
Private Sector Department, which lends directly to the private
sector without government guarantees. It is also the first highway
concession granted by the Uruguay government to the private sector
to operate a facility that was formerly in the public domain.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Pakistan to Bring Assailants to Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami today urged Pakistan to bring into justice the
assailants who gunned down five Iranian air force trainees in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also called on his Pakistan counterpart to do
everything possible to make sure that the assailants are
arrested and punished.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president described the Wednesday incident in
Pakistan city of Rawalpindi as "painful to the government and
people of Iran".
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the 54-year-old
president made the statement in a telephone call with Pakistan
President Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, who sent a cable of
condolence to his Iranian counterpart after the tragic incident
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Leghari assured Khatami that those who had committed the
killings could not adversely affect the solid relations between
Iran and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
According to an early report, five Iranian air force trainees
were gunned down by unidentified terrorists in Rawalpindi as they
were proceeding to a training school in a car Wednesday
morning. Four were killed on the spot and the fifth died in
hospital later. Only one student survived.
</P>
<P>
The report said that, the bodies of the five Iranians are
to be flown to Tehran on board a Pakistan plane escorted by
a Pakistan official Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the incident, Iran's Foreign Ministry immediately
 summoned Pakistani Ambassador to protest against the
assassination and urged Pakistani government to arrest and punish
the assailants of the five Iranians.
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, Foreign Minister Gowhar Ayoub-Khan said his
government would do everything to trace and arrest the
assailants.
</P>
<P>
In another message to the Iranian president, Pakistan Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif offered his shock over the incident but
assured Khatami that such incidents would never affect relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Foreign Minister Gowhar Ayoub Khan also telephoned
Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia-Pacific affairs Mohsen
Aminzadeh today and condoled with him on the killing of the
five Iranians.
</P>
<P>
He said his government would go to every length in order
to identify and arrest the assailants of the five Iranians.
</P>
<P>
In Tehran Wednesday, the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps
issued a communique on the occasion calling on the Pakistan
government to identify and arrest the killers of the five
Iranians.
</P>
<P>
It also recalled that the Iranians had several times before
been attacked by unidentified assailants in Pakistan, and warned
that the Pakistan government would better react logically to
the incident.

JOHANNESBURG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's Minister
of Defense and Aviation Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz Al-saud would
visit South Africa from September 24 to 29 at the invitation of
President Nelson Mandela.
</P>

The foreign affairs department said in a statement today that
Abdulaziz, also second deputy prime minister in Saudi Arabia, is

South Africa and Saudi Arabia established diplomatic relations

an increasingly important trading partner for the former.
</P>

In 1996, South Africa exports to Saudi Arabia increased by 31
percent over the previous year to 428 million Rand (approximately
100 million U.S. Dollars), while imports increased by 24 percent
to 933 million Rand (nearly 200 million Dollars).
</P>

The statement did not mention the proposed controversial arms
deal with Saudi Arabia, but foreign affairs department officials
confirmed last week that the matter would be discussed.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Women Less Likely to Quit Jobs for Family, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Women working in Canada are
less likely to interrupt careers for family reasons, according to
the latest survey by Statistics Canada.
</P>
<P>
And those who take a break from paid jobs are more likely to
return more quickly than previous generations.
</P>
<P>
Better legal protection for things such as maternity leave, and
the importance of two-family income are the major reasons for the
social changes, the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
"There will always be work interruptions, but the frequency and
duration of them is changing," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, Canadian women left paid employment for extended
periods and only one out of eight returned to work within two
years of leaving. In the 1990, 55 percent returned within two
years.
</P>
<P>
While women in the 1950s and 1960s often cited family as the
reason for quitting work, the pattern has changed significantly.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, fewer than half, or 47 percent, of careers breaks
were family related.
</P>
<P>
Economic reasons, such as layoffs, contract expiry, accounted
for 22 percent of women's work stoppages.
</P>
<P>
Of the women who left the workforce, the survey said 71 percent
returned to work.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Orders Air Safety Review After Air Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen today ordered the military services to halt training
flights for 24 hours and review safety procedures following five
air crashes in four days.
</P>
<P>
"Perfection is impossible, but that is our goal for aviation
safety," Cohen said in a statement released at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the review may begin at any time during the week
starting at 7 a.m. EDT Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cohen noted that his directive will not affect operational
flights, such as those enforcing the no-fly zone over Iraq or the
peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Cohen's instructions were delivered in letters to the civilian
leaders of the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
The order was made in the wake of a series of air crashes
within a week.
</P>
<P>
Two Air National Guard fighter jets collided off the coast of
New Jersey on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An Air Force F-117A fighter crashed during a Maryland air show
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a Marine F-A-18D Hornet fighter jet crashed in North
Carolina's Pamlico Sound during a practice bombing run.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday a U.S. Navy F-A-18 crashed in Oman, killing the
pilot.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday a U.S. Air Force C-141 transport plane flying from
Namibia and carrying nine men crashed in the South Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday urged Cohen to analyze
the crashes "to see if there is some pattern that would require
some sort of review by the Air Force."

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Foreign Ministers to Meet in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos will have talks with his Turkish counterpart,
Ismail Cem, on the sidelines of the United Nations General
Assembly in New York next week, to seek ways of improving relations
between the two neighboring countries, government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said here today.
</P>
<P>
The two men would discuss bilateral relations including
economic cooperation, he said, adding that Athens had formulated
an opinion as to how these relations could be developed.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources ruled out a tripartite meeting with the
participation of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright or any
other U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
As for the Madrid communique signed between the two countries
in July, Reppas accused Turkish officials of destroying the
climate in bilateral relations with their "thoughtless and
damaging statements."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that if the Turkish side indicated respect for
international law and order, then this would be "a step forward."
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have since early this year been trying to
better their strained relations for decades, but the process is
progressing slowly due to different positions of the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Britain Remains Keen to Play Role in Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary
George Robertson said here today that Britain remained keen to
play a role in international peacekeeping although Britain is no
longer a superpower.
</P>
<P>
Robertson, whose Labor government is undertaking a defense
policy review, made it clear that Britain would not retreat into
isolationism.
</P>
<P>
"Britain is no longer a superpower and we have abandoned any
pretension to act as a world policeman. But we can still make a
difference," Robertson said at a London conference.
</P>
<P>
"The question the nation must answer in the Strategic Defense
Review is whether we want to make a difference or whether we are
prepared to be a spectator at world events," he said
</P>
<P>
The Defense Secretary stressed that Britain "should plan to
take its share in actions, including high-intensity conflict, to
ensure international security reflecting the spread of our
interests and our political leadership role, particularly in the
United Nations Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Outside Europe, Britain's interests were most likely to be
directly affected by events in the Gulf, the Near East and North
Africa, Robertson said.

<HEADLINE> Prospective Oklahoma Bombing Trial Jurors Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of prospective
jurors for the second Oklahoma City bombing trial are meeting with
U.S. District Judge Richard P. Matsch in Denver, Colorado.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of a Federal Building in Oklahoma city on April 19,
1995, killed 168 people and injured hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
Coloradans from 23 counties will fill out a second
questionnaire, presumably asking for their feelings about the
death penalty, pretrial publicity and other issues in Terry
Nichols' trial which is slated to begin September 29, according to
a United Press International report.
</P>
<P>
This time the prospects will be quizzed about their knowledge
of the trial of Timothy McVeigh, the first suspect of the bombing,
which ended with the former Army sergeant convicted of all 11
counts and sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Nichols could also get the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
District court clerk James Manspeaker says about 750 initial
questionnaires of the 1,000 summonses sent out early this month
were filled out and mailed back. Some recipients had moved away
and their summonses were returned.
</P>
<P>
Individual questioning of jurors by prosecutors and defense
attorneys begins after opening statements in Nichols' trial in
Denver.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rejects Land-mine Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Wednesday announced that the United States would not sign a treaty
banning anti-personnel land-mines, saying the accord would
endanger American troops.
</P>
<P>
"There is a line that I simply cannot cross, and that line is
the safety and security of our men and women in uniform," Clinton
said in his announcement.
</P>
<P>
the United States at the last minute tried to persuade a
conference in Oslo of more than 100 countries to modify a draft
treaty banning land-mines. It wanted an exemption that would let
the United States to continue to use the weapons on the Korean
Peninsula for nine more years because of what it called an
uncertain situation there.
</P>
<P>
But the Oslo conference rejected the U.S. proposal and went on
to approve the draft treaty on Wednesday. And the delegates to the
Oslo conference will reconvene on Thursday to formally accept the
draft. The actual signing is not expected until December.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, speaking at the White House, said he felt the Korean
exemption was necessary ato protect about 37,000 U.S. military
personnel deployed there.
</P>
<P>
Earlier White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters: "We
regret that the document emerging from Oslo... will not meet some
of the necessary precautions that the United states insists upon as
we make the transition to a landmine-free globe."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, however, said he was directing the Defense
Department to develop alternatives to land-mines as a gesture of
softening his position. "In short, this program will eliminate
all anti-personnel land-mines from America's arsenal" by 2006,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Peace Activists Demonstrate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Over 300 Israeli and
Palestinian peace activists demonstrated this evening in disputed
Ras Al-Amud Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem, calling for
peace and an end to Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, organized by Peace Now, a joint
Israeli-Palestinian peace movement, was held outside the two
buildings in the neighborhood which were occupied by 15 Jewish
settlers Sunday. The incident sparked a new crisis in the tense
Israeli-Palestinian relations.
</P>
<P>
Holding placards reading "Save Peace," "Netanyahu Destroys
Peace," the demonstrators blasted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu for torpedo the hope for peace, and U.S. billionaire
Irving Moscowitz for trying to ignite a war between Israelis and
Palestinians by building the Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
Moscowitz, who bought the two houses and the adjacent area
where he intended to build 70 housing units to create a Jewish
settlement, visited Ras Al-Amud this afternoon, vowing that he
would never act to evacuate the settlers.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority Minister for Jerusalem Affairs
Faisal Husseini and Israeli opposition Labor Party member Orren
Sahour made speeches during the demonstration. They demanded the
Israeli government take measures to evacuate the settlers in order
to save peace.
</P>
<P>
Calling for coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians in
Jerusalem, Husseini said the Israeli government must end the
provocation by ousting the settlers from Ras Al-Amud.
</P>
<P>
"We want peace now, we want a future and life, we want a
future for our children," he said. He called on peace-lovers from
both sides to join hands in working for peace.
</P>
<P>
Sahour stressed that Netanyahu must remove the settlers from
Ras Al-Amud, whom he accused of violating law and order.
</P>
<P>
"We want them out of the buildings, we want the continuation
of the peace process. And I hope we should continue with the
peace process ... peace with security can be made only with the
peace process and through negotiations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The crowd responded to the speeches with loud applauses.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Hassan Zaqail, a Palestinian taxis station telephone
operator and a member of Peace Now, told Xinhua that he came to
support peace, adding there would be no peace with settlement.
</P>
<P>
Zaqail, who showed his right hand injuried by Israeli police
in a previous demonstration, said the houses belonged to his
grandmother but were sold by his cousins, who moved to Romania
now, to Moscowitz for a high price.
</P>
<P>
He said the settlers must leave the Palestinian land,
otherwise there would be Palestinian violence against the
provocation.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinians are waiting for the settlers to leave
of their own, and if not, they would be driven out by stones in
what he called a "war."
</P>
<P>
Over 100 Israeli police in anti-rioting gear were deployed
near the site to prevent possible outbreak of Palestinian
violence. Police helicopters continued hovering over the site to
guard against any disturbances.
</P>
<P>
The peace demonstration proceeded peacefully for about one
hour. But as a sign of the explosive situation, a group of
Palestinian protesters had moments earlier clashed with Israeli
police.
</P>
<P>
Some Palestinian youths threw stones at the police and
scuffled with them with sticks. During the clash, six
demonstrators were arrested and some injured by police. The group
was quickly overpowered and dispersed by the large presence of
Israeli police.

LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair and
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown ushered in a new era of
political cooperation in Britain today by inaugurating a special
cabinet committee to explore issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time politicians from outside the ruling
party of the day had attended a cabinet committee since World War
II.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see a new style of politics, and this is very much
part of it," said an aide to Ashdown. "But coalition is not what
this is about."
</P>
<P>
The new consultative committee, bringing together five Liberal
Democrats and six cabinet ministers, spent 90 minutes discussing
first-name terms government plans for reform of Britain's
unwritten constitution.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman in Blair's office said the two parties agreed to
cooperate closely on legislation to implement plans for home rule
for Scotland and Wales.
</P>
<P>
Although the Labor Party won the general election on May 1 with
a huge 179-seat majority in parliament, Blair said that he was
setting up the committee to ensure maximum support for his
constitutional reform.
</P>
<P>
The ideological gap between Labor and the Liberal Democrats,
Britain's third-biggest party after the Conservatives, has
narrowed as Labor has moved to the center ground of politics.

<HEADLINE> Arab Ministers Calls for Help to Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Arab ministers of economy
today called for collective efforts to force Israel to lift the
siege on the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and halt
the deterioration of their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Wrapping up the 60th meeting of the Arab League Economic and
Social Council, the ministers called upon the donor countries to
support the Palestinian people in reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
The ministers expressed thanks to the Arab countries and Arab
institutions that offer assistance to the Palestinian people and
called for more aid in order to confront their present tough
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The council reiterated the importance of enhancing
Arab-Palestinian trade relations, protecting production bases of
the Palestinian economy and limiting its dependence on Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) sustained daily
economic losses of 5 to 8 million U.S. dollars as a result of
Israeli blockade since a double suicide bombing attack hit
Jerusalem on July 30, in which 17 people were killed and over 170
others injured.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has donated 10 million dollars to help ease the plight of
the Palestinians and has decided to exempt Palestinian students in
Egypt from tuition and registration fees.
</P>
<P>
To canvass assistance for the frail Palestinian economy, PNA
President Yasser Arafat said he will expound the deteriorating
conditions inside the self-rule territories at the inaugural
session of the 108th Arab League Council meeting due to open on
Saturday in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's decision followed an Israeli announcement on Tuesday
that it would ease the closure of West Bank and Gaza reimposed
after September 4 triple suicide bombing in Jerusalem which killed
five Israelis.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Survey Finds Inflation Subdued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economic growth
accelerated late this summer but inflation remained subdued, the
U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) said today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed's survey of its 12 districts showed a continuation
of the conditions -- solid growth and quiet inflation -- that have
restrained policy-makers from increasing interest rates since
March.
</P>
<P>
"Although some districts note signs of slowing in selected
sectors, about half the districts say their region's overall pace
picked up," said the survey, based on information collected before
September 8.
</P>
<P>
"Most regions are experiencing tight labor markets, recruiting
difficulties or growing labor shortages," it said. But two-thirds
said that is not translating into higher wages.
</P>
<P>
The report said that "with a few exceptions, prices for goods
are said to be moving very little, if at all."
</P>
<P>
The survey was released just two weeks before the U.S. Fed's
policy-makers meet to set interest rates on September 30.
</P>
<P>
However, in a speech in Pittsburgh, Fed board member Laurence
H. Meyer warned the economy "may already be operating beyond its
sustainable capacity."
</P>
<P>
He said that Fed policy "must be alert to the potential of a
developing upward trend in inflation."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also warned
today in Hong Kong that the forces that have tamed U.S. inflation
are probably temporary. It said that "the continued surge in the
stock market and the strength of consumer and business confidence
suggest that the risk of overheating is still present."

<HEADLINE> US Says UN Chopper Crash Appears an Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
today that the crash of a United Nations helicopter in Bosnia that
has killed at least 11 people appears to be an accident.
</P>
<P>
"We have no reason to believe that the crash was anything other
than an accident," State Department spokesman James Rubin told a
regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a U.N. spokesman said that at least 11
passengers were killed when the helicopter slammed into a hill in
a remote area in central Bosnia while four other passengers were
injured and one was still missing.
</P>
<P>
Gerd Wagner, a German envoy who is charge of trying to
implement the peace accord, was among those victims.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst accident involving international envoys in the
Balkans since April in 1996 when a plane carrying U.S. Commerce
Secretary Ron Brown from Tuzla, Bosnia, to Dubrovnik, Croatia,
crashed, killing Brown and 34 others.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously this is a very sad day. It points up the dangers
that diplomats and all others, including refugee workers, face in
Bosnia," Rubin told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Iran Not to Exchange Ambassador Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish Foreign Ministry
spokesman said today that neither Turkey nor Iran has decided to
appoint ambassador to each other.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly press briefing here, spokesman Omer Akbel
said that neither Ankara nor Tehran took any steps in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Iran expelled each other's ambassador after the
breakout of their disputes over sensative religious issues.
</P>
<P>
The dispute was triggered by former Iranian ambassador to Ankara
Muhammed Reza Baqeri who made a pro-Sharia (Islamic law) speech at
the commemoration of an anti-Israeli "Al-Quds (Jerusalem) Night"
gathering last February in the Turkish city of Sincan, 40
kilometers west of Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Describing Iran as an important and friendly country in the
region, Akbel reiterated that Turkey is willing to strengthen
relations with Tehran so long as "some conditions are met."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long been accusing Iran of supporting the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party and interfering in Turkey's internal
affairs over religious matter.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem is expected to meet with
his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi in New York where they will
participate in the forthcoming 52nd U.N. General Assembly session,
Akbel said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel sent a
special envoy to Tehran to express Turkey's desire to normalize
bilateral relations.

LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in
Europe all ended in the positive ground today, supported by a 4.8
percent drop in US August housing starts.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index had eased earlier in the day on British
unemployment and retail sales data which fueled speculation of
another interest rate rise.
</P>
<P>
However, the index moved back above the key 5,000-point level
once again later in the afternoon and ended up 36.7 points at
5,013.10, boosted by US housing data which showed the US economy
cooling and led to expectations that the Federal Reserve would
keep interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares climbed above the 4,000-level and
closed up 111.53 points or 2.86 percent at 4,010.48, underlined by
Wall Street's overnight strong gains.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that banks were among the biggest gainers as
takeover speculation simmered.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, shares finished slightly up, but off their
session highs on profit-taking and the Dow's failure to hold up to
its early gains, with the CAC-40 index 3.45 points higher at

<HEADLINE> Arafat Accuses Israel of Violating Signed Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerusalem, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat said in Gaza today that building
a Jewish settlement in an Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem was a
clear violation by the Israeli government of the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Allowing the settlers to remain would violate the peace
agreements, he said. "We hope it will be solved very
quickly. Otherwise there will be a negative reaction," Arafat told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He made the comments in response to the move of 15 Jewish
settlers into Ras Al-Amud, an Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem,
Sunday, which triggered a new crisis in the tense
Israeli-Palestinian relations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ahmed Queria, Speaker of the Palestinian Council,
issued a statement in West Bank city Ramallah, calling on the
Israeli government to take steps to remove the settlers from Ras
Al-Amud. He said the Netanyahu government bears full
responsibility for any dire consequences of the latest development.
</P>
<P>
Despite the presure from the Palestinian side, U.S. billionaire
Irving Moscowitz, who intends to build 70 housing units in Ras
Al-Amud to create a Jewish settlement, vowed that he would not act
to evacuate the settlers after visiting the houses this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel's Supreme Court will hear a petition
Thursday filed by Moscowitz against the government for not
allowing him to start now the construction of the Ras Al-Amud
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Netanyahu held emergency consultations with
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Foreign Minister David
Levy to discuss the Ras Al-Amud dispute and the government's
response.
</P>
<P>
No details of today's inner Cabinet session was released. But
Netanyahu has made it clear days ago that he was opposed to the
actions taken by the settlers at this stage. However, he said that
the government has limited capability to remove the settlers
because they had acted "legally."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it is expected that Netanyahu would likely
invoke the reasons for state security and public order in
blocking Moscowitz from starting the construction in Ras Al-Amud
at present moment so to avoid an escalation of the
Israeli-Palestinian tension.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred Palestinians are demonstrating this evening in
East Jerusalem to protest against the Jewish settlement. The
Israeli police trying to disperse the procession clashed with the
demonstrators and arrested six of them.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
said today that there are some encouraging signs in the Middle
East for reviving the moribund peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I have seen some encouraging signs in the last couple of days
that all the parties realize that they have special
responsibilities to get this thing back on track," Clinton told
reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate on what encouraging signs he saw, but
administration officials cited such things as better
Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation in recent days, Israel's
partial return of tax and customs revenues it was withholding from
the Palestinians and lifting of the closure of West Bank towns.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also praised Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for
her trip to the Middle East, saying she had done "a superb job...
with difficult circumstance."
</P>
<P>
Asked what steps the United States would take in pushing the
peace process in the Middle East, Clinton said his foreign policy
team would "do everything we can to keep pushing this."
</P>
<P>
"We are going to do everything we can to try create the
condition in which they (the Israelis and Palestinians) can
succeed and to try to protect them from the downsides if they do
take risks for peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed the peace is for the parties there to make,
"and they have to have the vision and the courage and the strength
to do it."

who established an unauthorized settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a
statement issued in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The statement condemned the settlers' action, saying it was in
conflict with the spirit of the Oslo peace accord.
</P>
<P>
It was a blatant attempt to establish situation on the ground
before the outcome of final status negotiations between the
Palestinians and Israelis, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It called on all parties to the peace process to desist from
acts of provocation calculated to endanger the stability and
security of the region.

<HEADLINE> EU Expansion Should Now Take Priority Over Internal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Challenging a proposal made by
Paris, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said today that the
eastward expansion of the European Union (EU) should now take
priority over its internal reforms.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel made the remarks in an interview with the German
Suedwestfunk radio after France, along with Belgium and Italy,
submitted a paper to a meeting of the EU foreign ministers Monday
in Brussels stressing the need for further internal reforms and
integration prior to taking new East European members.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the EU reforms had already been discussed by the
last EU summit in Amsterdam in June, Kinkel said, "Now it's about
the next step, namely the expansion."
</P>
<P>
However, he also admitted that the accord reached at the
Amsterdam summit was only a provisional result which failed to
resolve key issues such as the proposed majority voting system and
the reform of the EU commission.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, we will continue to deal with all institutional
questions at the same time," Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel's remarks were made on the eve of the 70th Franco-German
summit which will be held in the eastern German city of Weimar
Thursday and Friday and will be attended by German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin.
