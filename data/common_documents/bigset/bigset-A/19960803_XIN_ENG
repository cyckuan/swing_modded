<HEADLINE> France Remains Vigilant After Bosnian Croats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- France said today that it has
noticed the decision taken by separatist Croats in Bosnia to
dissolve their political structures, but will remain vigilant
before the declaration is put into action.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the French Foreign Ministry said that the "the
Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna" has never been recognized by the
international community, and that its dissolution has long been
announced in various declarations made by the Croat-Muslim
Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the announcement of its dissolution
by Bosnian Croats will signal an anxiety for compromise by the two
parties within the federation, and that "such an anxiety will be
extended to Mostar."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also welcomed the re-opening of a railway linking
Sarajevo and the Croat port city of Ploce on the Adriatic Sea, and
hailed the European Union for financing the railway.

<HEADLINE> France, Algeria Condemn Assassination of Bishop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Both France and Algeria have
strongly condemned the assassination of a French Roman Catholic
bishop in Oran, Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Pierre Claverie, together with his driver, was killed
Thursday night in a bomb attack at his residence in Oran, a
coastal city about 500 kilometers west of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Alain Juppe said the assassination
"cannot but reinforce the determination of all those who reject
violence and hatred and who have the will that harmony and peace
be the victor."
</P>
<P>
Algerian President Liamine Zeroual said in a message to Henri
Teissier, archbishop of Algiers, that he was indignant and
sorrowful on hearing the news of assassination.
</P>
<P>
"I learned with great indignation and profound sorrow the
cowardly assassination of the archbishop of Oran. In this painful
circumstances, I assure you my deep sympathy and express to
you ... my sincere condolences," said the president in the message.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said the French
government will not let the assassination to "derail" its policy
of seeking better relations with Algeria.
</P>
<P>
However, it is widely seen that the incident would be a heavy
blow to the already shaky relations between Paris and Algiers.
</P>
<P>
Claverie was killed just hours after a meeting with de Charette
in the Algerian capital, Algiers.
</P>
<P>
The assassination was also condemned by Christian, Jewish and
Islamic religious groups in France and some other European
countries, including the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front of
Algeria in exile in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Claverie, 58, is the 40th French national killed in Algeria
since 1992 and the 19th Christian figure assassinated there since
1994. He also held Algerian citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The French government today again called on all French
nationals in Algeria to return home and those planning to travel
to Algeria not to go.

WASHINGTON -- Japan and the United States have reached an
agreement on foreign access to the Japanese semiconductor market,
Japanese International Trade Minister Shunpei Tsukahara announced
today.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Canada's western coastal city of
Vancouver, where the outgoing talks took place since July 30, both
Japanese and U.S. trade negotiators immediately claimed victory
for their respective sides.
</P>
<P>
"This is a fantastic agreement," Tsukahara said. "The contents
are almost exactly the same as Japan's version of the plan."
</P>
<P>
Under the 1991 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement, which
expired on July 31, foreign chip producers were guaranteed at
least 20 percent of the Japanese semiconductor market.

for Priebke's arrest.
</P>
<P>
Priebke, now 83, took part in the massacre of 355 hostages on
March 24, 1944 at the Ardeatine Caves near Rome. The prosecutors
in Germany said Priebke had been "involved in numerous brutal
murders."

procedure for granting permission for Jewish constructions in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip, in a bid to ease the settlement
building freeze imposed by the previous government.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during today's weekly cabinet session,
following a series of meetings between Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and leaders of the settlements last month.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reportedly accused, at the cabinet meeting, the
previous government of handicapping the natural developments of
Jewish settlements, while failing to impose same restrictions on
Palestinian buildings.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the building of a kindergarten in the Jewish
settlements used to be approved by a special ministerial committee
in the last four years, calling it "discrimination" of Jewish
settlers.

HARARE, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today urged a relief battalion of Zimbabwean soldiers
leaving for a peacekeeping mission in Angola to carry out its
duties with unquestionable professional commitment.
</P>

make great efforts to maintain peace and orderliness in Angola by
emulating the achievements scored by Alpha I and II battalions.
</P>
<P>
''Your deployment to that country is an national gesture in
the realisation and fulfilment of noble United Nations together
with other nations, and it is assisting the people of Angola in

their search for peace, stability, tranquility and security,''
said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe's acceptance of the U.N. obligations is a
result of its firm respect and observance of the principles and
norms of the U.N. charter.
</P>
<P>
The president told the soldiers that in carrying out
their duties, they should adhere to the u.n. principles of
peacekeeping by showing their patience and restraint, using

<HEADLINE> Refugees Continue to Flow Into Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said today that Rwandan and
Burundi refugees continued to arrive in Eastern Zaire, at an
average of about 400 people per day.
</P>
<P>
Between June 28 and July 31, about 13,300 Rwandan and Burundi
refugees arrived in the Uvira area, including an arrival on June
30 of a record 1,320 Burundi refugees. The second largest single
group came on July 30, involving 995 people.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR spokesperson Ron Redmond told a press briefing that at
present, the refugee arrivals remained fairly constant, and that
on Wednesday the newly arrived refugees numbered 643.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 130,000 Burundi refugees in the Uvira area
in Eastern Zaire, and another 95,000 in Tanzania including 2,321
arrivals during July, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Redmond, more than 600 Rwandan refugees went back
to Rwanda from northern Burundi, out of a group of some 3,000
people who have registered to return home since last week when the
forced repatriation began.
</P>
<P>
In addition, over the last few days, about 600 Burundi refugees
had returned to their homes in a northeastern Burundi province
from Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
At the briefing, Redmond also clarified rumors about UNHCR's
involvement in the shipping of arms of a cargo aircraft which was
seized by Zairean authorities in Goma on July 26.
</P>
<P>
He said UNHCR rent space on the Liberian-registered DC-8 cargo
aircraft that was alleged to carry arms, but it did not charge the
plane as was reported. The plane was charged by a private Dutch
company, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, military caps were found contained in the 80
boxes the cargo aircraft carried.

HARARE, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Some Zimbabwe ministries will
have to divert funds allocated for the 1996/97 financial year
towards the hosting of the world solar summit next month,
Vice-President Simon Muzenda said here today.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda said the ministries would be reimbursed by the
Treasury after the summit, whose budget is about 5.5 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
He could not say how much the ministries would contribute to
the hosting of the September 16-17 summit, but that the amounts
BDH305NAB058I02TEQL00:2300:240839
YCC076HAB267I0802QU00:2000:241719
would be based on contributions from local companies and the

</P>
<P>
The response to the government pleas for donations has been
poor, with local contributions amounting to just over 200,000 US
Dollars, the Zimbabwe National News Agency reported today.

</P>
<P>
Muzenda said the government expected most of the funding to
come from the United Nations Scientific, Educational and Cultural
Organisation, which asked Zimbabwe to host the summit.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda said, ''the ministries concerned with the solar summit
have been asked to use the money allocated to them in this year's
budget. The ministries would then be reimbursed after the
summit.''
</P>
<P>
He added, ''we are able to use the government funds because
the summit will be a state occasion.''
</P>
<P>
More than 200 heads of state and government and heads of
international organisations and institutions have been invited.

LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Four international drug smugglers
were each sentenced today to 20-30 years in jail for importing
about an estimated street value of 60 million pounds (93 million
US dollars) worth of heroin into Britain.
</P>
<P>
The gang, three Turkish Kurds and a Czech, who hid the drugs in
buses used to carry tourists around London, were caught with 200
kg of heroin, the second largest ever seized in Britain by Customs
and Excise, according to a BBC TV report today.
</P>
<P>
Of the four men, three were convicted of their part in the
crime at Southwark Crown Court, and a fourth admitted involvement.
</P>
<P>
British customs officers said that they suspected some of the
profits from the drugs might have financed Kurdish guerrillas, who
are fighting the Turkish government for a Kurdish homeland.

ISLAMABAD, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto said today that her government is doing its best to
solve the problem of unemployment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the provincial council of the ruling Pakistan
People's Party in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province,
Bhutto said that many new jobs are being created.
</P>
<P>
One of the steps taken by the present government was to lift
the embargo on government jobs which had been imposed by the
previous regime.
</P>
<P>
"The government has also initiated a policy of extending small
loans to the unemployed so that they can establish their own
business," she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she urged Pakistani people to work hard for the
progress of the country.
</P>
<P>
She said during her recent visit to South Korea, she met many
Pakistanis workers there who work 12 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
"Their examples should be followed," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the problem of price hike, Bhutto said that the complaint is
made by people during every government.
YCC078HAB270I0802QU00:3100:341743

"While complaining, people should keep in mind that the
percentage of price hike has remained very low during the present

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Raises Money To Finance Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The cash-strapped Zimbabwean
government is preparing several stock issues to raise
more than 500 million U.S. Dollars needed to finance the budget
BBH230NBB121I02TSQL00:3400:351014
deficit during the 1996/97 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said today the expected heavy borrowing had dampended
hopes of further reduction in high interest rates, the private
sector's single worst enemy since market reforms were launched in
1991.
</P>
<P>
During the new fiscal year, which started last month, the
government has set a borrowing target of 572 million U.S.Dollars,
which analysts said was unlikely to be met given the government's
history of financial indiscipline.
</P>
<P>
Of major concern to the private sector is the prospect of
another prolonged period of high interest and inflation rates.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates -- which once peaked at 45 percent at the
height of the 1992/93 recession -- are now pegged at just over 30
percent, while inflation, which also reached 50 percent in August
1993, reached 23 percent in June, this year.
VHK223NBB122I02TSQL00:3400:351863
</P>
<P>
Stockbrokers SAGIT said on Friday that Zimbabwe's national
debt of over 500 million U.S. Dollars had been increased to 660
million U.S.Dollars because the government failed to reduce the
budget deficit to 6.7 percent of GDP during the 1995/96 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
SAGIT said it is concerned that the government was forecasting
the deficit to reach 8.5 percent during the new fiscal year.
DPB302NBB122I02TSQL00:3400:351863
</P>
<P>
This meant another 530 million U.S Dollars would have to be
borrowed on the local market, said the company.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, meanwhile, has also warnded the
government to rein-in expenditure and support its efforts to
reduce inflation.

TEHRAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Two buses collided in eastern
Iran, leaving 11 dead and 59 others injured, local media said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA reported that the incident
occurred on Feizabad-Bejestan highway, southern Khorrasan
province.
</P>
<P>
The passengers on board the two buses were high school girl
students from Yazd and Shiraz, who were either going to or
returning from a pilgrimage trip of the religious city of
Mashhad.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the injured students were immediately
transferred to hospitals in Torbat Heidareyeh and Mashhad. Seven
of the injured students were in critical conditions.
</P>
<P>
A local expert said that the cause of the accident was
determined as deviation of one of the buses to the left,
which was heading to Mashhad from Shiraz.
</P>
<P>
He said that serious accidents had occasionally taken place
on the Feizabad-Bejestan axis due to the narrowness of the road
and its second-rate asphalt cover.

<HEADLINE> Announcement of Polling Date Urged in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Foundation for Democratic
Process (FODEP) of Zambia today urged the government to announce
the polling date for the 1996 presidential and parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
FODEP leader Bishop Mambo told a press briefing in Lusaka that
the government should by now have announced the election date to
allow more time for stake holders in the political arena to
prepare the groundwork and other election programs.
</P>
<P>
He advised the government to tell the nation the state of
affairs to chellange some press reports that the elections may
not be held this year.
</P>
<P>
Mambo also urged the government to critically analyse the
issue of holding the inter-party meeting before the 1996
elections.
</P>
<P>
The inter-party meeting has suspended because of controversial
views over a contitution amendment bill which stimulates that
only the second indigenous Zambians are qualified for the
presidency of the country.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party, the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy
maintains that the amendment is a law and everybody should abide
by it since it was adopted in parliament and signed by the
president in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties, however, argue that the amendment is
not just and they pledge to repeal it as it actually bars former
President and now the leader of the United Independence Party K.
Kaunda from contesting for the post of the state leadership as
his parents immigrated into Zambia before the country won
independence.
</P>
<P>
The opposition stands that this year's elections should be
conducted under the original constitution. enditem

<HEADLINE> Africa To Eliminate Polio by 2000 BAP543PAB172I02TEQL00:4900:501730 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela today kicked off an international drive to rid Africa of
poliomyelitis by the year 2000, saying the immediate target is to
vaccinate 50 million African children this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony at Midrand north of
Johannesburg, which was attended by international health officials
and dignitaries from African countries, Mandela said: "Our
aim is not merely to reduce the number afflicted, it is to eliminate
the disease completely."
</P>
<P>
The campaign is initiated by the World Health Organisation, which
has appointed Mandela Chairman of the WHO's committee for a
polio-free Africa.
</P>
<P>
The slogan of the campaign, "kick polio out of Africa", would be
displayed at soccer world cup qualifying matches throughout Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the legacy of Africa's colonial past, its lack of
resources and the devastation of war had rendered the continent's
children vulnerable to polio.
</P>
<P>
Much had already been achieved to fight the disease in Africa, and
the incidence of polio among children had fallen from more than 4000
in 1990 to less than 1000 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine African countries had been so far taking part in the
program. They would also organise national immunisation days to
vaccinate 80 million children over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's first immunisation day will be on August 12.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma, who hosted the launch,
said South Africa's target is to wipe out polio by 1998.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Begins to Privatize Public Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's public banks have begun the
long-awaited privatization program by selling their shares in the
joint foreign banks to invigorate the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Central Bank is supervising the selling process,
which includes shares of Misr Bank (Bank of Egypt), the National
Bank, Alexandria Bank and Cairo Bank, according to today's
Egyptian Gazette, the country's only English-language daily.
</P>
<P>
The privatization process in the current stage includes selling
less than 50 percent of the banks' shares, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
But by the beginning of the next year, the banks will be able
to sell more than 50 percent of their shares to foreign banks
under the newly-approved amendments to the country's bank laws.
</P>
<P>
The amendments allow foreign banks to own more than 51 percent
of the capitals of local banks. They also also stipulated that every
person's share must not exceed 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> US, Japan Continue Semiconducter, Insurance Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and Japanese trade
officials continued their efforts today in a bid to resolve
disputes over the sale of American computer chips and insurance in
the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman David Johnson said negotiators were still
at work after the five-year U.S-Japanese pact on semiconducter
expired on July 31, and with no plans for a news conference or
announcement.
</P>
<P>
Jay Ziegler, chief spokesman for the U.S. Trade
Representative's Office, said earlier that talks went all night in
Vancouver, Canada's province of British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
He said the overnight talks were conducted at the deputy
minister level by representatives of the two governments, while
industry negotiators underwent their separate talks.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators of the world's two economic giants were working
against a July 31 deadline set at a meeting in June between
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
However, as the midnight deadline approached, the two sides
agreed to keep talking indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Representative from the U.S. and Japanese computer chip
industries met throughout the day Wednesday. Acting Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky also met with her Japanese
counterpart, Shunpei Tsukahara.
</P>
<P>
The computer chip dispute involves a 1991 agreement, that set a
20 percent target share for foreign products sale in the Japanese
semiconductor market.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese have refused to renew the agreement because they
argued that a current foreign market penetration of more than 30
percent, far surpassing the expected target and the agreement is
no longer needed. They preferred a multilateral forum which
includes the 15-nation European Union to the bilateral pact.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side took the position that without a transition
agreement, the gains foreign chip producers have made in the
Japanese market could be lost.
</P>
<P>
On insurance matters, U.S. officials said talks have been
disappointing. A major barrier remains a U.S. dissatisfacation
that Japan is not living up to an October 1994 agreement to open
its primary life insurance sector, which includes services such as
auto, fire and life insurance, to foreign companies.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia to Purchase 12 Combat Helicopters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has signed an
agreement with the Franco-German Eurocopter company to purchase 12
"Cougar Mark II SAR" combat helicopters, the French Defense
Ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
The 3-billion-franc (600 million U.S. dollar) contract includes
delivery, training, logistic and technical support, said the
Defense Ministry in a communique.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Ministry sources said this is the first
important success scored by France in selling its weapons to the
Saudi air force, which resulted from "hard competition putting
into the game several planes of different countries."
</P>
<P>
The contract was signed several days ago by the representatives
of French Defense Minister Charles Millon and those of Saudi
Defense Minister Prince Sultan ben Abdel Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The purchase could significantly improve the financial
situation of Eurocopter, which has been suffering from the drop of
sales in the world aeronautical market, and will save 3,500 French
jobs, said the ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
The SAR (Search and Rescue) helicopters are specialized in
searching and rescue missions in the high seas and behind enemy
lines.

<HEADLINE> UK House Price Rise Highest for 7 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- House prices in Britain rose last
month at their highest rate recorded for almost seven years,
according to figures released today by the Halifax Building
Society, Britain's largest mortgage lender.
</P>
<P>
Prices for all types of home were 5.3 percent ahead of July
last year, the fastest pace of increase since October 1989 and up
from 4.0 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The cost of a property rose 0.5 percent between June and July
after suffering a 0.4 percent fall between May and June, the only
monthly fall for almost a year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Halifax, the price of a typical home at the
end of last month was 64,286 pounds (99,643 US dollars), more than
3,300 pounds (5,115 dollars) higher than in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Halifax said July's reversal of June's
small fall supported the society's view that prices should start
BAP549PAB186I02TFQL01:1201:120991
to edge up again later this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that cuts in mortgages rates which for most
lenders take effect from this month should help the market. In
addition, further rises in house rises should take more people out
of the negative equity trap.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of Japan's Social
Democratic Party (SDP) said that Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine is "incredible".
</P>
<P>
The SDP, a major partner of the three-party ruling coalition of
Japan, met on Thursday, during which officials criticized
Hashimoto's Monday visit to the shrine.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo-based Yasukuni Shrine is a place where memorial
services are held for Japan's dead in its war of aggression,
including class-A war criminals such as the wartime prime minister
Hideki Tojo.
</P>
<P>
SDP Secretary-General Kanju Sato and Chairman of the Policy
Board Shigeru Ito both agreed that the prime minister's visit is
"incredible".
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided to ask Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Kazo
Watanabe to pass the party's criticism to Hashimoto, the first
serving prime minister to go to the shrine since 1985, when a
similar move by then serving prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
triggered strong protests from the Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's visit has already drawn criticism from China, the
People's Democratic Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea and
other Asian nations.

LAGOS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Plans by Nigeria Airways to resume
its New York operations through an international agreement have
crumpled following the withdrawal of the American partner, World
Airways.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement which was to take effect today, Nigeria
Airways was to fly American-bound passengers to Dakar from where
World Airways would take them to New York, and bring
Nigerian-bound passengers from Dakar to Lagos and Port Harcourt.
</P>
<P>
Chris Aligbe, the Nigeria Airways spokesman said Thursday:
''the management was shocked but believed the excuse given by the
American airline.''
</P>
<P>
An unsigned statement from World Airways faxed to Lagos
Thursday said the airline decided to pull out of the West African
route ''as part of a strategy to move from scheduled service and
return to its core business.''
</P>
<P>
The American airline that gave up the only five-week-old West
African route did not, however, rule out a future re-entry to the
African markets.
</P>
<P>
The American government stopped in August 1993 direct flights
from the international airport in lagos to the united states,
citing security lapses at the Nigerian facility.  enditem

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Media Slam Japanese PM's Shrine Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's media have strongly
denounced Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's recent visit
to the Yasukuni Shrine, urging him to explain and apologize for
his action.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Daily News said in its July 31 editorial that
Hashimoto's visit to the shrine showed that he advocates the
righteousness and legitimacy of the history of Japanese
imperialism. Hashimoto should not act so hastily for the sake of
building a relationship of mutual-trust between South Korea and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Oriental Daily News said in an editorial Thursday that
Japan must acknowledge its history of aggression and do nothing
that will harm the S.Korean-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
The Korean National News pointed out in an editorial that the
South Korean people have always maintained vigilance over the
Japanese government's attitude toward imperialism since Hashimoto
came to office, who has visited the Yasukuni Shrine before.
</P>
<P>
The editorial urged Hashimoto to stop making remarks or taking
actions which would also upset other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
On July 29, Hashimoto visited the Yasukuni Shrine which honors
Japan's war dead, breaking a decade-long taboo on prime
ministerial visit to it.
</P>
<P>
Right after the visit, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said
if it really wants to establish friendly relations with its
neighbors, Japan must respect the feeling of its neighbors that
have suffered from its imperialistic aggression.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 until it
was defeated in 1945.

steel as earlier agreed on, the Finance and Economy Ministry
announced today.
</P>
<P>
The replacement of loan payment items was agreed upon after a
meeting in Moscow late last month between the two sides, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Russia will supply, instead of steel,
enriched uranium worth 75 million U.S. dollars and helicopters
worth 15 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Besides the enriched uranium and helicopters, Russia is also
supposed to provide South Korea within the year with defense
equipment worth 154 million dollars, aluminium 51 million dollars,
enriched uranium 18 million dollars and helicopters 8 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of the loans totaling 1.47 billion dollars Russia obtained from
South Korea, Moscow had repaid 40.4 million dollars in kind by the
end of July last year -- 19.3 million dollars in aluminium and
21.1 million dollars in helicopters.

<HEADLINE> Korzeniowski Wins Men's 50km Walk Olympic Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Robert Korzeniowski of Poland
outkicked Mikhail Shchennikov of Russia in the final stage to win
the men's 50-kilometer walk gold medal here Friday morning morning
in the Olympic athletics competition.
</P>
<P>
His winning time was 3 hours, 43 minutes and 30 seconds.
Shchennik finished second in 3:43:46 and Valentin Massana of Spain
took the third position in 3:44:19.
</P>
<P>
In the Games' most gruelling race, Korzeniowski, bronze
medalist at last year's world championships, stayed second with
several walkers when they hit the first 10km mark, more than 30
seconds behind the pace leader Massana, a dark horse who
registered the second fastest time in history early this year.
</P>
<P>
But Korzeniowski and three other walkers caught up the early
leader at the half-point and the leading bunch still contained
five after 35 kilometers with Korzeniowski leading, Zamudio second
and Viktor Ginko of Beralus third.
</P>
<P>
As the pace slowed down, Korzeniowski found seven men still
rolled together with him after 48 kilometers. The Pole opened a
big kick with 1,000 meters to go, and only Shchennikov could
answer his speed.
</P>
<P>
The two fought toughly when they entered the Olympic stadium
and it was Korzeniowski who had more strength reserved at the time
and walked home first for the gold.
</P>
<P>
Ronald Weigel of Germany, Olympic bronze medalist at the
previous Games and the owner of the fastest time in history,
didn't finish under the hot and humid whether. China's World Cup
winner Zhao Yongsheng was disqualified after 22 kilometers.

<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's external debts have been reduced to 1.4
billion U.S. dollars, the lowest rate of debt for any country in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Central Bank Governor Riad Salama was quoted today's
by Beirut Diyar daily as saying that the repayment terms of most
of the external debts varied between three and 27 years, and the
interests costed Lebanon 100 million dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank governor stressed that the Lebanese
government would pay the debts on schedule, and that it does not
need any agreements with international financial and monetary
groups for the rearrangements. The internal debts in this country
amounted to 6.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's public banks have begun the long-awaited
privatization program by selling their shares in the joint foreign
banks to invigorate the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Central Bank is supervising the selling process,
which includes shares of Misr Bank (Bank of Egypt), the National
Bank, Alexandria Bank and Cairo Bank, according to today's
Egyptian Gazette, the country's only English-language daily.
</P>
<P>
The privatization process in the current stage includes selling
less than 50 percent of the banks' shares. By the beginning of
the next year, the banks will be able to sell more than 50 percent
of their shares to foreign banks under the newly-approved
amendments to the country's bank laws.
</P>
<P>
The amendments allow foreign banks to own more than 51 percent
of the capitals of local banks. They also also stipulated that
every person's share must not exceed 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan said here
today that his government is expecting one billion U.S. dollars
from the initial phase of the self-off of Turk Telekom, the
center piece of Turkey's privatization.
</P>
<P>
He said the sell-off will bring an important income to the
state and the amount to come from the part will be immediately
privatized.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish parliament approved late Thursday a new draft law
to enable the government to privatize state-owned Turk
Telekom without the constitutional annulment that has obstructed
previous sell-off program.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's Minister of Oil Hamdi al-Banbi has said that
the East Delta natural gas field will increase its daily
production to about 42 million cubic feet of natural gas, 36 tons
of Butane gas and 815 barrels of by-products.
</P>
<P>
This will augment Egypt's gas production by half billion cubic
feet, accounting for 40 percent of the country's gas output, the
minister said Thursday in an inspection tour of the East Delta gas
field.
</P>
<P>
Banbi said that a joint Egyptian-Italian investment to improve
Nile Delta fields have amounted to 438 million U.S. dollars,
embracing projects on prospecting and digging.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Criticizes US' Anti-Iran Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today termed anti-Iranian stance of the United States
as a "defeated policy."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to worshipers during a Muslim Sabbath prayer
congregation, Rafsanjani said that "even France rebuffed the U.S.'
so-called anti-terrorism" proposal.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to an American proposal which calls for
sanctions against Libya, Iraq, Iran and Sudan for sponsoring
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the G7 countries did not accept the
proposal at their recent anti-terrorism meeting in Paris, only
agreeing to increase international cooperation in the fight
against terror.
</P>
<P>
"This move proved that its European allies had fully grasped
the United States' monopolistic policies," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Europeans are in fact countering Washington's unilateral
measure because they are seeing that their interests are being
endangered," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged oil-producing Moslem countries not to sell oil to
the United States to force it to change its policies toward the
Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
"We will not sell our oil to the United States, unless the
HAB239HAB287i0802QU02:3102:310114
United States stops supporting Israel,'' he told the crowd.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cargo Ship Catches Fire off Egypt's Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A Greek cargo ship carrying 52,000
tons of wheat from the United States today caught fire off Egypt's
northern coast and was towed out to sea to safeguard other vessels
in the area.
</P>
<P>
Maritime authorities said the ship's crew was rescued but that
emergency vessels were unable to extinguish the blaze. The burning
ship was towed out of Egyptian territorial waters in the
Mediterranean to prevent any damage to other ships or shipping
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Authorities at Port Said, 210 kilometers northeast of Cairo,
received a call from the ship early this morning call that the
ship had caught fire.
</P>
<P>
The fire reportedly started in the engine room and spread
through the ship's ventilating system. However, no casualties were
reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian navy vessels and Suez Canal tugs rushed to the scene
but could not control the blaze and towed the burning ship out to
sea.
</P>
<P>
Egypt imports more than five million tons of wheat each year,
and the United States is a major supplier.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Bans Trade Activities With Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The government of Tanzania
has banned all trade activities with Brundi.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this in the National Assembly in Dodoma, Central
Tanzania today, Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye said that the
move was in line with a resoltion adopted by the regional summit on
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The day-long summit, which was held in Arusha last Wednesday,
agreed to impose economic sanctions against the Central African
country following a military take-over in late July.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said the Tanzanian border with Burundi has been closed
since last march and will continue to be sealed.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the move could heavily affect Burundi
because most of its imports pass through Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said protacted ethinic conflicts between the majority
Hutus and minority Tutsi in Burundi could be ended through
economic sanctions by the international community.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, however, appealed to the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) and the internationally backed mediator,
former Tanzanian president Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, to coninue
with the search for peace in Burundi.

DAR ES SALAAM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth Secretary
General Chief Emeka Anyaoku said here today he fully supported
the decision made by the East and Central African leaders in
Arusha last Wednesday on sanctions against the military regime in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Chief Anyaoku congratulated Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa
and his colleagues for having taken the correct stand in
combating the unconstitutional regime in Africa, which is in line
with the Commonwealth's 1991 Harare Declaration on
Democratization.
</P>
<P>
During discussions with President Mkapa at the State House
this morning, the visiting Commonwealth executive also pledged to
rally other member states of the club in support of the sanctions
against Burundi.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the State House, President
Mkapa reiterated that the sanctions had been instituted in order
to restore Africa's integrity and respect in international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chief Anyaoku, who arrived here from Zimbabwe yesterday for a
six-day working visit to Tanzania, is scheduled to undertake a
three-day tour of Zanzibar from tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Syria Confident of Lebanese Cooperation on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has always showed
cooperation with Syria in adherence to a just and comprehensive
peace in the region, the state-run Damascus radio said in its
political comment today.
</P>
<P>
The radio noted that Lebanese President Elias Hrawi had
confirmed that Lebanon would never break ranks with other Arab
countries to sign a separate peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a speech marking Lebanon's Army Day in Beirut Thursday,
Hrawi rejected the reported Israeli "Lebanon First" proposal,
saying that Lebanon would not accept a conditional Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is with its Arab brothers and ... will be the last one
to sign a deal with Israel," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The comment said the the two countries are on one front, adding
that Israel must implement the U.N. Security Council Resolutions
242, 338 and 425 before peace is established in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is aimed at driving a wedge between Syria and Lebanon
through separating the Syrian peace track from the Lebanese one,"
it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Under the "Lebanon First" proposal, Israel will withdraw its
troops from an enclave in south Lebanon in exchange for Syria's
help in disarming the pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrillas and the
deployment of Lebanese army troops along the border to prevent
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and Lebanon have been stalled for
years because of a lack of progress in Israel's peace
negotiations with Syria, a major power broker in Lebanon where it keeps
40,000 troops.

<HEADLINE> US, Japan Reach Semiconductor Accord, No Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. governemnt solved a
dispute with Japan today over the semiconductor trade, but failed
to get an agreement over the penetration into the Japanese
insurance market.
</P>
<P>
This was the result of the almost four-day intense negotiations
conducted by U.S. and Japanese trade officials in Vancouver,
Canada's western coastal city in the province of British Columbia,
since July 30.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was announced by Acting Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky, who led the U.S. delegation in the two
separate negotiations with its Japanese counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The accord calls for more monitoring of global trade in
semiconductors, but lacks specific targets for Japanese buying of
foreign chips. The two sides were not able to get a deal on
opening the Japanese insurance market, and there is no specific
timetable for further talks.
</P>
<P>
The semiconductor agreement requires industry experts from the
VHK250NBB146I02TSQL03:3603:362148
DPB329NBB146I02TSQL03:3603:362148
Japanese and U.S. trade associations to compile information on
market size, growth and market share. The data will be turned over
to the respective governments every three months.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, two industry groups, the U.S.
Semiconductor Industry Association and the Electronic Industries
Association of Japan, will collect the data and make quarterly
reports to their own respective governments. U.S. and Japanese
trade officials will meet twice yearly to review the information.
</P>
<P>
The computer chip dispute involves a 1991 agreement, which
established a 20 percent target for foreign market share of the
big Japanese semiconductor market with some 44 billion U.S. dollar
sales annually. The Japanese government refused to renew the 1991
pact, asserting that a current foreign market share of more than
30 percent has far exceeded the expected target and the agreement
is no longer needed.
</P>
<P>
The 1991 U.S.-Japanese agreement on semiconducters expired on
July 31 and the new accord came at the last possible minute, with
Barshefsky repeatedly postponing her plans to return to Washington
due to slow progress in the difficult bargaining.

<HEADLINE> Tudjman Agrees to Dismantle Croatian Structure in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman today agreed to dismantle a separate Croatian governing
structure in Bosnia and accept internationally monitored elections
in the city of Mostar, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
The commitment was made during Tudjman's separate meetings with
U.S. President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and other top
U.S. administration officials, White House spokesman David Johnson
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman disclosed that Clinton used Croatia's desire to
become fully integrated with Western nations and institutions as a
leverage to obtain the Croatian commitment.
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that a deadline has been set for August 8 to merge
the purely Croatian institutions into a united Croatian-Muslim
BDH340PAB208I02TEQL03:4003:410949
Bosnian federation and hold the elections in Mostar where a
one-vote Muslim majority was elected to serve on the city council.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has repeatedly stressed the vital
BAP577PAB209I02TFQL03:4103:411666
importance of the Croat-Muslim Federation to the lasting peace of
the war-torn former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The established separate Croatian structures include police
forces and town governments.
</P>
<P>
"Those structures have to be disassembled and the Mostar
election implemented," Johnson said.

March figure of 2,458.2, the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS)

<HEADLINE> Buyout Program Produces Adverse Effect in NY Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The buyout program, introduced
two years ago in New York City's public schools with the intent to
save money, has caused the departure of thousands of the most
experienced teachers in the city's public schools.
</P>
<P>
The loss of nearly 10 percent of the city's 64,000 teachers
within 14 months--one of the largest turnovers since 12,000
teachers were laid off in the fiscal crisis of the 1970's--has
opened a host of vacancies, many in positions that are difficult
to fill, in fields like mathematics, science and bilingual
education, according to a local media report.
</P>
<P>
So far, 2,376 teachers, 93 principals, 143 assistant principals
and 134 guidance counselors have told the Board of Education that
they plan to retire under the buyout program which offers
additional pension credits as an incentive, the report quoted
education officials as saying. In years without the program, about
1,200 teachers usually retire, officials added.
</P>
<P>
This year's departures come as the system continues to grapple
with the retirement of 3,100 other veteran teachers last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, board officials said, there will be more than
3,000 openings for teachers in New York City School this fall.
</P>
<P>
To plug the gap, the board has stepped up its recruiting. For
the first time, it has sent letters to thousands of unemployed
teachers across the state.
</P>
<P>
The openings will be filled by recent college graduates who
have no teaching experience.

<P>
ATLANTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Lindsay Davenport of the United
States spent about less than 100 minutes to claim her another
major title in her career, beating Arantxa Vicario Sanchez of
Spain to win the women's singles title at the Olympic tennis
tournament here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The American, with strong forehand strokes, crashed the
Spaniard's hope to have a full set of Olympic medals.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, who won the women's singles bronze medal and doubles
silver in Barcelona four years ago, paired with Conchita Martinez
to finish third in the women's doubles here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After taking the first game in the first set, the American did
not control her pace and made 1-1 all with unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
It witnessed seasaw games in the opening set, when the two
players levelled the score at 2-all, 3-all, 4-all, 5-all and 6-all
before Davenport claimed the tie-breaker to win the first set.
</P>
<P>
Cheered by home crowds, Davenport, seeded ninth in the
Olympics, broke Sanchez's service game to lead 1-0 in the second
set before continuing her pace to take the set and the match at
6-2.
</P>
<P>
In the bronze medal match for the women's singles, Jana Novotna
of Czech Republic needed one hour and 47 minutes to beat American
Mary Joe Fernandez 7-6 (8-6) and 6-4.
</P>
<P>
When the play went on to 4-all, a foot fault was called to
Fernandez. However, the American said that the call did not
bother her play mentally.
</P>
<P>
After losing the match against Novotna, Fernandez is putting
her eyes on women'd doubles title which will be held on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"All of our matches have been pretty good, " said Fernandez,
who paired Gigi Fernandez to win the women's doubles title at the

<P>
CHENGDU, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan Province
collected a total of 5.81 billion yuan in tax revenue in the first
half of this year, up 30.9 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase was a result of strengthened efforts by the
provincial tax officials, who have been working hard to ensure a
steady and smooth tax collection operation for the past six months.
</P>
<P>
The province also ordered its tax officials at all levels to
take responsibility for tax levying, adopting a rewards and
punishment system.
</P>
<P>
Stricter enforcement of tax policies also guaranteed a good
collection of taxes in default.

<HEADLINE> Milk Price Rises in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian dairy producers raised
the price of milk from 230 fils (about 32 U.S. cents) to 300
(about 42 cents) per kilogram Thursday, the English-language
daily Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move was taken immediately after the government announced
the lifting of subsidies in animal feed.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Supply Munir Sobar said the decision will cause
prices of barley to rise to 120 Jordan dinars (about 168 dollars)
per ton, from 85 dinars, bran from 52.5 dinars per ton to 100
dinars (about 140 dollars), corn from 116 dinars to 160 dinars
(about 224 dollars) and soy to 270 dinars (about 378 dollars) up
from 210 dinars per ton.
</P>
<P>
Fayez Adwan, deputy chairman of Dairy Producers Union, said
the increase in the prices of animal feed will automatically
increase the cost of milk.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Hamouria, a member of the Union of Livestock
Breeders, was quoted by the daily as expressing regret over the
lifting of the subsidies on animal feed "without prior
consultation with the local livestock sector," adding that such a
move would adversely affect investment in the livestock industry.
</P>
<P>
Local press predicted that the lifting of subsidies on animal
feed will lead to price hikes in a number of commodities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, observers here predicted that once the government
announces the "rechannelling" of bread subsidies after the session
which the Lower House of Parliament is expected to hold to
discuss the issue Sunday, the milk price will be further
increased.
</P>
<P>
Lots of livestock breeders feed animal with the subsidized
bread instead of fodder, which, the government said, has caused a
great waste of bread and a great loss of government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to lift subsidies on animal feed
was a surprise, said observers here, noting that its decision
to float the price of bread has drew angry protests from
various political parties, interests groups and Parliament members.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties said that floating bread prices will lead
to further deterioration in standards of living in the country.
</P>
<P>
Opposition lawmakers have threatened to seek a no-confidence
vote in the government if it goes ahead with its plans to
lift bread subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The government had planned to announce the decision to lift
subsidies on bread on Wednesday night, but postponed to next
week after the Lower House of Parliament discussed the issue
Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Oil and gas rich Jilin Province
in northeast China plans to tap 1.7 billion cubic meters of
natural gas a year by 2000.
</P>
<P>
But the province is expected to consume up to 2.6 billion cubic
meters by the same year, and will have to pipe in extra supplies.
</P>
<P>
The province has already signed contracts with gas-rich
countries to buy more gas in order to make up for the deficiency.
</P>
<P>
Geologists said that the province has 320 billion cubic meters
of natural gas in its reserves, mainly in Changchun, the capital
city, Songyuan and Siping.
</P>
<P>
Gas is nowadays only used domestically and for industrial
heating and production, since gas development is still at the
initial stages.
</P>
<P>
Long-term development plans point to the province encouraging
more industrial sectors to promote the use of gas.
</P>
<P>
Jilin plans to turn out 200 million cubic meters of gas this
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan government is
confident of bringing the Taliban Militia to the negotiation
table, Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar said today, according to
reports from kabul.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar told a press conference in Kabul that the government
has ruled out any need to resort to war and is willing to hold
peace talks with the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar said his administration would agree to any
"appropriate and rational" peace proposals from the Taliban and
would agree to hold direct or indirect talks with their leaders.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the efforts of the government, there is no longer
any reason for anyone to wage war," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban besieging the Afghan capital Kabul has lost
morale and no longer has reason to fight the government.
</P>
<P>
"When I signed the agreement under which I became prime
minister, the Taliban were on the offensive and making advances
around Kabul, but now they are firmly in defensive positions,"
Hekmatyar said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban is facing a lot of problems and will eventually
have no option but to negotiate for peace, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar also reiterated a string of pledges to boost the
standard of living of poor Afghans and to revive the country's
war-ruined economy.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar, leader of Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar group), became
Afghan prime minister on June 26.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of the Auschwitz
concentration camp was replaced by a lecture on Nazi's crimes in
the city of Nagai in Northern Japan due to Germans' objection, a
national daily reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Nagai had planned to put on the exhibition in a Japanese-German
exchange summer school between July 29 and August 19, reported the
Asahi Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
However, a civic group from Nagai's German sister city of Bad
Sackingen faxed a message in May, saying they stood against the
display that would remind elderly Germans of the war history, the
daily quoted the Nagai city's planning section as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nagai instead has decided to hold a lecture on Nazi's crimes by
a German teacher.
</P>
<P>
Nazi reportedly killed several million Jews before and during
World War Two.
</P>
<P>
Nagai and Bad Sackingen became sister cities in 1983, according

<HEADLINE> Securities More Appealing to Shanghai Savers Than Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai residents are aiming to
get rich quicker - by switching savings from low-risk bank
accounts to securities.
</P>
<P>
An average 24,000 new accounts have been opened every day for
the past two months on the Shanghai stock market, with the number
of accounts now exceeding nine million.
</P>
<P>
A survey by a leading Shanghai securities brokerage company
revealed that 72 percent of the respondents choose securities as the
top investment means, with only 24 percent favoring low-risk
bank saving.
</P>
<P>
Playing the money and securities markets has given a renowned
competence in money management to Shanghai savers and investors,
who are beginning to seek a higher economic yield from their
money.
</P>
<P>
Fixed deposits in the city continued to grow during May and
June, but with a weaker momentum, with the increased amount
dropping nearly 1.3 billion US dollars in May from that in April,
according to statistics from the People's Bank of China's Shanghai
branch.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also showed that more than 60 percent of the
increased bank deposits in June came from accounts on local stock
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
State treasury bonds and enterprise bonds, however, hold even
stronger appeal than the highly speculative and risk-taking stocks
to many Shanghai people.

<HEADLINE> Deadline to End Mostar Crisis Stands Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The international community's
High Representative's Office (HRO) in Bosnia said today that the
deadline for Croats to end their boycott of the Mostar city
council has not been changed.
</P>
<P>
The August 4 deadline, by which the European Union has demanded
Croats to end their boycott is unconditional and firm, said Colum
Murphy, the chief HRO spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that "while we welcome the strong and positive moves of
diplomacy in recent days to overcome the the Mostar crisis, we
will be looking carefully to immediate implementation of recent
understandings."
</P>
<P>
Murphy was referring to Friday's meeting in Washington between
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman
who reportedly promised to bring Bosnian Croats into respecting
the results of the June elections in Mostar.
</P>
<P>
Croats, which lost to the Muslim side in the Mostar city
council elections, have refused to recognize the results, charging
that there had been "irregularities" in the overseas polling
stations where the majority of voters were Muslims.
</P>
<P>
"We are anxious frankly to see the August 4 deadline is not
slipped past in some fashion by measures that would seek to
discuss what might or might not be implemented some days or weeks
further down the line," Murphy added.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Murphy's remarks reflect the concern
of some European countries that the Mostar crisis will still take
some time to be resolved because only a general commitment was
announced after the Clinton-Tudjman meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan arrived
here today for a state visit to Syria and was greeted at the
Damascus International Airport by Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein started his talks immediately after his arrival here
with the Syrian leaders on the bilateral relations and the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The visit aims at coordinating positions of the two counties to
face up the hardline policy of the Israeli government toward
the peace process after the right-wing Likud Party won the victory
in the Israeli elections in May.
</P>
<P>
It was King Hussein's first visit to Syria in almost three
years.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries began improving at the end
of June when the king met Syrian President al-Assad on the
sidelines of the Arab summit held in Cairo in June.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that King Hussein and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu secretly met in London last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reportedly asked King Hussein to mediate in the
stalled Israeli-Syrian peace talks and briefed him on Israel's new
proposal of a "Lebanon First" peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Upon the request of Netanyahu, the reports said, King Hussein
is expected to brief President al-Assad on the Israeli proposal of
"Lebanon First."
</P>
<P>
Syria has publicly refused such an approach and called again
for the return of the Golan Heights Israel occupied from this
country in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The visit came two days ahead of Netanyahu's arrival in the
Jordanian capital of Amman for talks with King Hussein.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Myanmar Exceeds 4 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Myanmar has
increased to 4.1 billion U.S. dollars as of the end of July this
year, Minister for National Planning and Economic Development
Brig. Gen. Abel said today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20 countries and regions are investing in 197
projects in the country, he told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The oil and gas sector is leading in attracting the foreign
investment with 1.4 billion U.S. dollars, followed by the sector
of hotels and tourism with over 650 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Britain, with an investment of over one billion U.S. dollars in
Myanmar, is the country's biggest foreign investor, followed by
Singapore with 896 million U.S. dollars and France with 465
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Abel said the United States' investment in Myanmar exceeded 240
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The minister refuted two recent reports issued by the U.S.
embassy in Yangon on Myanmar's economic situation -- Foreign
Economic Trends Report: Burma and Country Commercial Guide: Burma.
</P>
<P>
"These two reports are not economic reports but political
ones," he remarked.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Myanmar enjoyed an annual growth rate of 8.2
percent in the last four fiscal years (1992-93 to 1995-96) and has
set a target of six percent for the next five years (1996-97 to
2000-2001).

<P>
SARAJEVO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led peace
Implementation Force (IFOR) today confirmed that two incidents of
violence against Muslims had occurred in northern Bosnia, with one
man killed and another wounded.
</P>
<P>
In the front-line area between the Muslim-controlled town of
Celic and the Serb-held town of Koraj, a Muslim was beaten by
Serbs on Thursday, said an IFOR statement.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident, a Muslim working in the field on the
Serbian side of the front-line was also fatally shot by unknown
assailants on the same day. The farmer, identified as Alija Agic,
67, died a few hours later in his home.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that IFOR is "concerned about both of the
incidents and the apparent inability of the Bosnian-Serb police to
control the situation."
</P>
<P>
Following Thursday's incidents, the IFOR is taking measures to
ease tensions, including joint police patrols from both the Muslim
and Serb sides, round-the-clock patrol of the area by an IFOR
airborne platoon, and establishment of additional
checkpoints.

<HEADLINE> Seven-Day Publicity Highlights Breast-Feeding in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A campaign to encourage new mums
to breast feed their babies was launched in major Chinese cities
today.
</P>
<P>
In capital Beijing medics and mother-and-baby health care
workers handed out leaflets and gave on-the-spot advice.
</P>
<P>
The activities were a prelude to the forthcoming Fifth World
Breast-Feeding Week.
</P>
<P>
Breast-feeding week was initiated by the World Breast-Feeding
Alliance and supported by the U.N. Children's Fund and the World
Health Organization. The theme of the activity this year is to
call for more attention and support for breast-feeding from
communities and society.
</P>
<P>
"Such activities are only part of our efforts to promote
breast-feeding and baby-friendly action across the country," said
Feng Huimin, an official from the Women and Children Health Care
Department under the Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
China has announced a plan for the breast-feeding rate in every
province and minority autonomous region reach 80 percent by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In order to fulfill the goal, China plans to establish more
baby-friendly hospitals which encourage breast-feeding, and offer
a high-standard of services to women in labor and infants.
</P>
<P>
So far 2,957 such hospitals have been set up throughout the
country, accounting for 38 percent of the total number in the
world, according to Feng.
</P>
<P>
Mother's milk is considered the best food for newly-born babies
because it can help improve immune system of babies and keep them
healthy.
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, many new Chinese mothers have switched to
expensive milk powders and other substitutes to feed their
babies. This has been blamed on the influence of intensive
advertising of those products or other reasons.
</P>
<P>
"We feel it is urgent to let people understand that mother's
milk is a cheap and good food for babies," Feng said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that baby-friendly action has been proved fruitful
in China. The MPH announced on Friday that the mortality of
infants and children under five, which was mainly caused by
pneumonia and diarrhoea, has dropped by 27 percent in the past
five years in China.
</P>
<P>
"I think that breast-feeding has played an important role in
the achievement because babies drinking mother's milk run far less
risk of suffering from those diseases," she noted.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin and Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Crude Palm Oil
(CPO) physicals closed the week unchanged amidst the pre-weekend
profit-taking activities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, India's State Trading Corporation (STC)
tendered 6,000 tonnes of Refined, Bleached, Deodorized (RBD) palm
olein for the first-half September shipment that prompted
short-covering activities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, higher Malaysia's July 1996 palm oil export
figures of 649,331 tonnes compared to 604,053 tonnes in June also
boosted market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), the tin price dropped by
24 sen (about 10 US cents) to close the week at 15.15 ringgit
(about 6.06 US dollars) per kg from 15.39 ringgit (about 6.15 US
dollars) the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Accumulated turnover for the week was 498 tonnes compared to
597 tonnes previously, with Europeans, local and Japanese players
dominating the week's transactions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The Malaysian rubber market ended the week lower due
to lack of buying interests and poor market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
August Rss One dipped by seven sen (about three US cents) to
326.00 sen (about 130 US cents) per kg from 333.00 sen (about 133
US cents) in the previous week while SMR 20 eased by 2.5 sen (one
US cent) to 305.00 sen (about 122 US cents) per kg from 307.50 sen
(about 123 US cents) per kg previously.
</P>
<P>
The week performance of the local market was also in tandem
with the downtrend on the Tokyo rubber futures this week and as
European buyers were away for the Summer holiday and the Chinese
buyers did not enter the market because they had fulfilled their
rubber requirement in the previous week.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian Defense Minister Ian
McLachlan said on Friday that Australia would revitalize its
alliance with the United States on grounds that its ties with Asia
would not suffer.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar in Sydney, the defense minister also
emphasised the three key elements of Australia's defense
policy: alliance with the United States, alliance with Asia and
self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
He said Australian and U.S. defense ministers, who held their
annual meeting last weekend, agreed to hold more and larger
military exercises and training operations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country is also building closer relations with
its neighbors, because Australia's security is intimately tied to
the security of the region.
</P>
<P>
"We want to maximize our self-reliance in defense operations;
we will continue to reinvigorate our alliance relations with the
U.S. and we will pursue closer relations with countries in the
region," McLachlan added.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Controls Spread of Foot-and-Mouth Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia has effectively controlled the spread of foot-and-mouth
disease with no new areas being reported infected by this animal
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural Minister Tihomir Vrebalov said Thursday that this
is because of measures taken by the government to halt the spread
of the disease coming in from Albania and Macedonia at the end of
June.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav-Albanian and Yugoslav-Macedonian borders have been
blocked, infected areas strictly isolated, and special government
funds allocated to fight the disease, he added.
</P>
<P>
To aid Yugoslavia's efforts, the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization and the European Union have provided it with 3
million injections free of charge.
</P>
<P>
The disease has caused great losses to Yugoslavia's animal
husbandry and meat exports.
</P>
<P>
Under regulations of international organizations, countries
infected with the foot-and-mouth disease are forbidden to export
meat and meat products for three years.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein of Jordan Visits Syria Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan left here
today for Damascus on an official visit to Syria in a bid to
bolster bilateral relations and discuss the Middle East peace
process with senior Syrian officials.
</P>
<P>
It was King Hussein's first visit to Syria in nearly three
years, Jordan official sources said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Damascus, Hussein will hold talks with
Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad on security situation in the
region, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Jordan and Syria began improving after a
meeting between the Jordanian king and the Syrian president on the
sidelines of the Arab summit held in Cairo in June.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was their first one since Jordan signed a peace
treaty with Israel in October 1994, which angered the Syrians who
demand a common Arab front in negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jordan accused Syria in early June of closing its eyes to
"attempted terrorist attacks in Jordan, financed by radical
Palestinian organizations based in Damascus."
</P>
<P>
However, a senior Jordanian official announced Thursday that
Syria had taken "positive steps" in addressing these concern by
arresting about 10 people suspected of plotting attacks in
Jordan, the English-language daily Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made after Jordanian security officials
provided the names of the suspects to Syrian authorities, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein is expected to reaffirm Jordan's support for
Syrian positions in peace negotiations with Israel, including a
return of the strategic Golan Heights Israel occupied in the 1967
Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein is also expected to brief the Syrian president on
the Israeli new proposal of a "Lebanon First" peace deal upon the
request of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Israel and Syria would break the six-month
deadlock in their peace negotiations by agreeing on a settlement
in Lebanon where both countries have troops.
</P>
<P>
But Syria has publicly refused such an approach and again
called on Thursday for the return of the occupied Arab lands,
including the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported that Netanyahu met secretly with King
Hussein in London on July 26 where the King was undertaking a
minor surgery.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reportedly asked the king to mediate in peace talks
with Syria and briefed him on the "Lebanon First" proposal.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the king to tell President al-Assad that Israel
would like to renew the stalled peace talks, the local media
reported.
</P>
<P>
Then the king will brief the Israeli prime minister on the
outcome of his visit to Damascus when the Israeli premier visits
Jordan Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The King will act as a channel of dialogue between Syria and
Israel and a bridge across the Syrian-Israeli gaps regarding the
peace process," a diplomatic source here told Xinhua.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Dengue Fever Threatens Not Only Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Starting today, school bells at
all elementary and high schools in the Philippines will ring at 4
p.m. on every school day to send out students for clean-up
activities in support of the nationwide campaign against dengue
fever that was launched on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to an order from Education Secretary Ricardo Gloria,
at least 17.5 million students and 600,000 teachers across the
country are required to allocate 10 minutes of their time to clean
up school premises in an effort to eliminate the breeding sites of
mosquitoes which transmit the disease.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica said the involvement of the
students is crucial for the campaign, considering that 80 percent
of the dengue cases reported this year were students.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the disease has downed more than 2,500
persons and killed at least 29 others in the Philippines, an
increase of 430 percent over the same period last year. The
Department of Health also warned that the disease will continue to
spread because the rainy season has just begun.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by the rise of dengue cases in the metropolis,
President Fidel Ramos has ordered Metro Manila to take tighter
action against dengue by enforcing regular garbage collection and
cleanup of waterways. He also declared August 2 the national
dengue elimination day.
</P>
<P>
In order to fight the widespread of the disease, the Philippine
government launched the all-out campaign on Friday, with Quezon
city chosen as the pilot area.
</P>
<P>
Quezon city mayor Ismael Mathay, Local Government Secretary
Robert Barbers, Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica and Education
Secretary Ricardo Gloria led Friday's launching rite for the
drive.
</P>
<P>
They announced that the construction of clean public toilets
and rest areas will begin this month on the north and south
diversion roads and on premier highways around Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Barbers said foreign and local tourists have decried the lack
of sanitary toilets on major highways. For decades, this problem
has been the bane of the country's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Health officials attributed the widespread of dengue to a rapid
rise in urban population, lack of adequate resources for water
storage and waste disposal, but according to Reodica, the chief
culprit is the environmental deterioration in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever is also called H-fever. It is caused by any one of
the four types of dengue viruses that are carried by aedes aegypti
mosquitowa which bite in the morning and afternoon and lay eggs on
water surfaces.
</P>
<P>
The common symptoms of the disease are bleeding nose, high
fever which lasts from two to sever days, headache, muscle pain,
physical weakness, stomach pain and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
A more lethal complication, dengue hemorrhagic fever, may
follow. First recognized during the 1950s, it is today a leading
cause of childhood deaths in many countries.
</P>
<P>
Asiaweek reported that dengue fever has replaced malaria as the
most important mosquito-borne viral infection in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report released by the United Nations,
the fever is now endemic in more than 100 countries in Africa,
America, the Eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and the Western
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
In Southeast Asia, besides the Philippines, dengue cases are
also reported to be surging in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia,
Maldives, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Industrialized countries are not spared from the disease. It is
also known to occur in the United States, Australia, Japan and New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Before 1970, only nine countries had experienced dengue fever
epidemics, a figure which by 1995 had grown more than four-fold to
at least 41 countries, said the UN report.
</P>
<P>
It also said that some 2.5 billion people -- two fifths of the
world's total population -- are now at risk from dengue whose
attack rates can be as high as 6,400 for every 100,000 persons
exposed.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 500,000 patients are sent to hospital each year,
of whom a very large proportion are children and roughly five
percent die. Without proper treatment, the death rate can reach 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
At present, vaccine development for dengue fever is still very
difficult because any of four different viruses may cause disease,
and protection against only one or two could actually increase the
risk of more serious disease.
</P>
<P>
So the best and only way now to fight and prevent the disease
is to combat the vector mosquitoes and clean the environment.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, progress is being made in the development of
vaccines that may protect against all four dengue viruses, and
such products could be commercially available within several
years, said the UN report.

<HEADLINE> Three Persons Killed by Gunmen in Southern Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen killed three
people Friday night in Malawi, Minya province in southern Egypt,
an official security source said.
</P>
<P>
The source was quoted today by the Egyptian Middle East News
Agency (MENA) as saying that Ahmed Ibrahim, 65, was shot dead in
the mosque of Ibrahim Awad village in Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Two guards, 42-year-old Nagueh Abdou Moustafa and 35-year-old
Gamal Dahi Mohamed, were also killed by the gunmen, who fled after
the attack, according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
Security forces were trying to arrest the assailants, MENA
said.
</P>
<P>
It was the third terrorist attack by unidentified gunmen in
Minya in four days. On Tuesday, three persons were killed in two
separate attacks in Abu Quras.
</P>
<P>
Moslem fundamentalist militants, who have launched a violent
campaign against the government since 1992, have carried out many
attacks in Minya. But it was unclear whether this week's attacks
were the work of Moslem militants, who have attempted to install
strict Islamic rule in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the body of a farmer identified as Mohamed Ahmed
Selim was found in Qena, southern Egypt, a security source was
quoted by MENA as saying early today.
</P>
<P>
Selim, 30, was hit by several bullets in a plantation, the
source said. Investigations into the incident are still under
way.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's Fujian province
plans to promote the development of a number of large enterprise
groups in a bid to achieve an overall growth of local economy.
</P>
<P>
These groups, with the government support and preferential
policies, are expected to have a sales value of 2 billion yuan
(about 240 million U.S. dollars) by 2000, according to the
province's plan for industrial development.
</P>
<P>
Fujian has speeded up the rational flow of state-owned assets
in recent years. As a result, some 150 enterprise groups have been
formed and become the key enterprises in machinery, petrochemical,
building materials, forestry, and aquatic products industries.
</P>
<P>
The province has made it clear that public ownership must be
adhered to and state-owned assets must play a leading role in the
development of large enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
The province has readjusted the structure of liabilities of the
groups and granted them policy-making powers to manage the
state-owned assets and raise funds with an attempt to optimize the
utilization of resources and develop scale economy. They are also
allowed to develop sales network and set up enterprises overseas.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will allocate 60 billion yuan (about
7.2 billion U.S. dollars) to 500 state-run large and medium-sized
enterprises for their technical renovation in next five
years, official sources said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Allow Foreign Firms to Borrow More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank
announced Saturday that it has decided to remove the ceilings set
on domestic borrowings of foreign firms as of January 1997 to
attract more foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Central bank Governor Gabriel Singson told reporters here
Saturday that the move would further align monetary policies with
the deregulated financial environment and the Philippine
government's program to attract foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
With the relaxation, the bank's Circular No. 572, which imposes
a debt-to-equity ratio on foreign firms from as lows as 60:40 to
as high as 70:30, will be scrapped, he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies would thus be able to borrow more in the
Philippines, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
"The restriction on the allowable peso borrowings by foreign
firms is philosophically inconsistent with liberalization,"
Singson said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the lifting of the domestic borrowing limit for
foreign companies will not result in foreign companies crowding
out the market and triggering a rise in domestic interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of peso borrowings of foreign firms to total loan
portfolio of the country's commercial banks dropped to 1.37
percent last year from 2.98 percent five years ago.

<HEADLINE> Copper Conglomerate's Privatization Should Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The privatization of the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) will be done carefully for it to
benefit the people, ZCCM Chief Executive Edward Shamutete has
said.
</P>
<P>
Shamutete made the remarks while briefing President F. Chiluba
on the process of the conglomerate's privatization when Chiluba
visited ZCCM stands at the 70th Zambia agricultural and
commercial show on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Shamutete said that the privatization of ZCCM will not be
rushed to ensure that everything is handled in a transparent
manner.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM is a state-owned conglomerate which monopolizes the
country's copper industry. It earns over 80 percent of the
country's foreign exchanges. However, it has faced liquidity
problems in recent years because of the low production levels
resulted from obsolete equipment in its mining production and the
pounding by low copper price in the world market. The company has
no financial ability for eney improvement.
</P>
<P>
To improve the ZCCM management and get better production, the
Zambian government has decided to privatize the copper
conglomerate in accordance with the country's economic reform.
ZCCM made public a statement on July 19 for the process to put
the company on sale. It is expected that the privatization of
ZCCM will complete in two stages within two years.

<HEADLINE> US Embargo Drives Thai Sea Shrimp Prices Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The US embargo on Thai sea shrimp
has driven local sea shrimp prices down considerably in just three
months.
</P>
<P>
The price of sea shrimp stood at 125 baht (5 US dollars) per
kilogram in April, but dropped to 85 baht (3.4 dollars) in July.
</P>
<P>
The US imposed the embargo because Thai fishermen failed to
meet its requirement to install devices on their trawling gears in
order to prevent endangered sea turtles from being caught and
drowned.
</P>
<P>
The embargo has resulted in a huge backlog of unsold shrimp in
the stocks of Thai processors.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the price of farmed shrimp has been affected
since April, when the price for 30-piece-size shrimp was 260-270
baht (10.40-10.80 dollars) per kilogram, compared to 200-210 baht
(8.00-8.40 dollars) at present.
</P>
<P>
A fishery industry source said the US policy does not take into
consideration of the fact the fishermen in developing nations
cannot afford to install the turtle-exclusion devices.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts have predicted that shrimp prices will drop
even further as the effects of other international policies come
on line, such as the upwardly revised tariffs imposed by the
European Union under the new generalized system of preferences
(GSP) which will come into effect next year.
</P>
<P>
If these pressures are left unchecked by the Thai government,
the problem will deal a serious blow to the overall shrimp
trawling industry, analysts feared.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The 70th Zambia Agricultural and
Commercial Show, between August 1 and 5, is going on in the
country's capital Lusaka, attracting thousands of exhibiters and
visiters, from both domestic and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The show, since it began in 1926, has marked big progress from
a local market for selling only agricultural produce to becoming
an international fair of multi-purposed exposition about various
domains in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
After giving a brief introduction about the history of the
show, a staff in the show information center, Kathryn Mwondele
told Xinhua, ''The Zambia Agricultural and Commercial Show serves
as a window of our national economic development.''

<P>
With the theme ''exhibiting excellence'', this year's show
reflects development of economic reform in Zambia. The exhibiters
from state-owned monopoly industries such as the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) which earns over 80 percent of
the country's foreign exchanges and the Tanzania-Zambia Railway
Authority (TAZARA) down to private hopusehold manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The exhibits of large enterprises tell that mono-management is
being substituted by multi-management. ZCCM companies are
providing other products and services in addition to copper to
meet social needs while TAZARA is exploring domains other than
transportation such as mining to make itself stronger in the
development of national economy.
</P>
<P>
Small and informal industries and household manufacturers are
making contribution to the progress of national economy. They
produce non-traditional products and daily necessities to meet
social needs and for exports. Their slogan is ''small industries
of today are big industries of tomorrow''.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural institutions and farmers are active in the show.
They bring their produce to the visiters such as seeds of maize,
sorghum, beans, wheat, millet and other grains, fresh fruits and
various veegetables which can all be seen on exhibiting stands.
</P>
<P>
Exhibits about scientific and technical researches are another
characteristic outstanding to the visiters in this year's show.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Red Cross Society in its pavilion shows people how
to save a patient with artificial respiration, the National
Council for Scientific Research teaches how to make energy-saving
cookstoves and use low-cost cashewnut shell briquets to save
forests, the Zambia Seed Company, in addition to provide high
quality seeds of various crops, also tells which variety of a
crop is suitalbe for a specific region of the country, while the
Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries tells ''food is
life'', stressing the importance of the agrucultural development
of in national economy...
</P>
<P>
A student from the University of Zambia said after visiting
the show, ''I didn't buy anything, but i've got a lot from the
show.''

<P>
ANKARA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is to sell three
Spanish-designed CASA CN-235 light transport planes to Croatia,
the local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Turkish defense sources as saying that the

BANGKOK, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The cap on Thailand's sugarcane
output of 55 million tons per year is proposed to be raised to 60
million tons to boost sugar exports and increase foreign exchange
earnings, The Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
A committee formed to consider requests for sugar mill
relocation and capacity expansion recently asked the Sugarcane and
Sugar Board to consider expanding plantation acreage to increase
output since more farmers are planting sugarcane instead of rice
in line with the government policy to reduce second-crop rice
growing.
</P>
<P>
Thailand exports 3.2 million tons of the 4.6 million tons of
sugar it produces per year. It is the world's second largest
sugar-exporting country after Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The proposed higher output will be discussed at a meeting of
government agencies, sugar millers and farmers before being
submitted to cabinet.

positive cases have been identified and are under treatment,
according to Health Department (HD) sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that 175 more suspected patients are also

</P>
<P>
The HD is urging parents to be careful about their children and

sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that children are easy to get the
disease and die in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The dengue cases are mostly from the urban areas, as the dengue
 causing vector mosquito breeds mostly in fresh water pools
collected after the monsoon rains, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The DH asked people to destroy all empty cans, broken bottles
and young coconut empties which can collect water and could become
breeding grounds for the dengue causing mosquito.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Congress today passed a
popular health insurance bill that would make it easier for
millions of people who change or lose their jobs or have
pre-existing illnesses to obtain coverage.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has expressed eagerness to sign the
legislation into law.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would curb the insurance industry's practice of
denying coverage to many individuals on the basis of pre-existing
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The bill would also increase tax deductibility of insurance
premiums for the self-employed while offering tax breaks for both
long-term care insurance premiums and the cost of long-term care
itself.
</P>
<P>
Tax-exempt medical savings accounts, demanded by Republicans
and approved as part of the original House bill, were included in
the legislation but only as part of a four-year test limited to
750,000 policies.
</P>
<P>
Opponents feared they would strip the healthy and wealthy out
of the insurance pool, resulting in higher insurance costs for the
sicker and poorer people remaining in more traditional plans.

<HEADLINE> India to Formulate New Textile Export Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
decided to formulate a new textile export policy emphasizing
value-added exports and non-quota markets, official sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Textile Ministry has constituted a task force to prepare a
new export policy which is expected to be in force from the
beginning of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The changes in the export policy have been initiated following
a drop in the export volumes in foreign markets like the European
Union in the first half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The volume of the garment exports to the European Union during
January-June 1996 fell by 4.67 percent to 1,420 million US dollars
from 1,492 million US dollars during the same period in 1995, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Exporters said that the current export entitlement policies
have not been industry-friendly. About 70 percent of the textile
exports are marketed in the quota countries.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka's Economy Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's economy slowed down
during the first half of this year due to a severe drought and
rising spending on the protracted ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
An unprecedented drought not only affected farmers throughout
the country but also parched the hydro-catchment reservoirs,
adversely affecting the supply of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's hydro-power supply accounts for 84 percent of its
total power supply. With water levels in reservoirs sharply
dropping, the country has been forced to impose power cuts since
March.
</P>
<P>
On March 22, 8-hour daily power cuts were first imposed. The
power cuts duration was reduced gradually till the end of July
when it stood at 5.5 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
These power cuts have affected all businesses. Economic sources
estimated that the power cut losses were running at more than 18
million US dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
Corporate earnings also dipped as the power cuts disrupted
production and ate into the profitability of business, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lanka's gross domestic product (GDP), which grew by 5.5
percent last year, would slow down in 1996 fiscal year to 3.7
percent from an earlier forecast of 4.4 percent, according to
economic analysts here.
</P>
<P>
Colombo's stock market, an emerging market in 1994 when the all
share index was around 1,400 points, tumbled to below 600 points
in late June this year. This is a direct result of the on-going
ethnic war, said the analysts.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Finance Minister G.L. Pieris earlier said that military
spending this year will increase 182 million US dollars from the
originally estimated 691 million dollars for 1996.
</P>
<P>
This is the second consecutive year in which defense spending
has outpaced the budget as the Sri Lankan military continues to
battle Tamil rebels in the North and East of the country.
</P>
<P>
The intensification of the war could hardly have come at a
worse time for the country's economy, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In May of this year, Sri Lankan government forces recaptured
the Jaffna peninsula, the strong hold of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, smashing the rebels' hope for setting up a separate
homeland in the island's North and East.
</P>
<P>
However, the rebels have retaliated with several attacks
throughout the country, putting a new extra burden on the
military.
</P>
<P>
The heavy spending on the war has forced the Sri Lankan
government to cut subsidies on some essential items including
bread and flour.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the country's inflation rate is expected to rise
to 12 percent this year as against the target of 7.7 percent.

DALIAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Abundant fishery resources and
cheaper labors have turned coastal Dalian city in northeast
China's Liaoning Province into an attractive spot for overseas

<HEADLINE> India's Foreign Investment Norms Standardized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- India's newly restructured
Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) is drafting new
guidelines to standardize clearance of foreign investment projects
and developing mechanisms to monitor large projects, a government
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The FIPB would also grant automatic approval to power projects
cleared by state governments, the Central Electricity Authority
and the Pollution Control Boards.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines would be framed in consultation with the
relevant ministries in key infrastructure areas including power,
telecom and electronics. This would ensure a common approach to
similar projects and leave no scope for ad hoc and arbitrary
clearances, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Industry Ministry is in the process of expanding the list
of 35 industries in which foreign investment projects get
automatic approval for up to 51 percent of equity share.
</P>
<P>
FIPB would be more professional and business-like in its
operations. All pending applications for project approvals would
be cleared by August 31 as announced earlier and the board would
respond to applications for new proposals within five to six
weeks, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Snake Produces Nine Eggs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A home-grown snake has produced
nine eggs, each a little bigger than a chicken egg, at a Beijing
restaurant, in the first such case ever reported in the country.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that it is very rare for human beings to be able to
observe a snake laying its eggs in person, in a restaurant or
anywhere else, because snakes are by nature very wary of human
beings.
</P>
<P>
But, at 5 pm on July 7, the restaurant's snake produced its
first white egg, and this was followed by one every 50 to 60
minutes afterwards, until 2:00 the next morning, for a grand total
of nine eggs, according to the Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
In the course of events, the snake looked up at its human
audience outside its glass home and made certain that it was very
careful to protect its new treasure.
</P>
<P>
Chinese restaurants are known to keep cages of snakes as part
of their menu offerings, and some places of entertainment keep
them for amusement or show.

<HEADLINE> India to Import More Crude Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Despite the continuing uptrend
in crude oil production, India is likely to import 41.3 million
tons of crude oil and petroleum products which would cost a
whopping 8 billion US dollars in 1996-97, Commercial Ministry
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Registering a recovery the crude oil production in the country
went up to 35.19 million tons in 1995-96 from 32.2 million tons in
1994-95. It is anticipated there would be a modest rise to 38.09
million tons in 1996-97.

<HEADLINE> No Immediate Activity in Somalia: U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States will not
take any immediate diplomatic activity in Somalia following the
death of Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid, a State Department
official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In answer to a question at a briefing of what reaction the
United State would take upon Aidid's death, State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said: "I'm not anticipating, at least
immediately, any sudden upsurge in American diplomatic activity in
Somalia. We'll have to wait and see what happens."
</P>
<P>
Aidid, who led his fighters and humiliated U.S. forces in 1993
and forced their withdrawal from Somalia, died from a wound during
a clan fighting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the officials from the US embassies in Nairobi,
Kenya and Djibouti have visited Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia,
from time to time, so as to make timely assessment on the
"politics of the country".
</P>
<P>
He said the United States would call on all factions of Somalia
to "continue to exercise restraint to end hostilities" and to form
a broadly based government.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Has Fastest Aging Population in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has the fastest aging
population in Asia, even faster than that of Japan, the Straits
Times reported today, citing the findings of a new study.
</P>
<P>
The elderly population in Singapore aged 65 and above will
double from 7 percent to 14 percent in the 21 years between 1997
to 2018, compared to the 26 years (1970 to 1996) in Japan, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
This rapidly aging of the population could cause health care
spending to more than double to 7.3 percent of the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) in the year 2030, it said, adding that it could even
rise to 11 percent of the GDP if Singaporeans' demand for health
care rose by 50 percent more than the growth in their income.
</P>
<P>
The study, with a focus on the effect of population aging on
national health expenditure, was conducted by a group of
researchers from the National University of Singapore and the
Institute of Policy Studies.
</P>
<P>
Associate Professor Linda Low, one of the researchers on the
team, was quoted as commenting that Asian countries were
experiencing a compression of the aging process, compared to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
countries.
</P>
<P>
"For example, what took France 115 years took Japan only 26
years," she said, noting that in the case of Singapore, the
population was still relatively young at the moment, with only 6.5
percent aged more than 65 years old.
</P>
<P>
However, the academics added that in Singapore, the decline in
fertility rates over the past 30 years, combined with Singaporeans
living longer, could lead to a dramatic change in the population
distribution.
</P>
<P>
They also estimated that total national health expenditure
could rise to 14.3 billion Singapore dollars (about 10.1 billion
US dollars at current exchange rate) in 2030, up from the 2.8
billion Singapore dollars (about 1.97 billion US dollars) in 1994.

DHAKA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 6.3 million people
belonging to 1.3 million families in 39 districts in Bangladesh
have been affected by the current spate of flood.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, until last night, crops on 613,560 acres
in the districts have been totally or partly damaged by flood,
which has also claimed 35 lives and destroyed 137,543 houses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 17,514 heads of cattle were perished in the flood
while 8,576 kilometers of road, 1,142 bridges and culverts and 386
kilometers of embankments were damaged.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate the people's suffering, the government has
allotted 3,530 tons of rice and tk 2.47 million (about 61,700 US

<HEADLINE> 840 Million Dollars Injected to Defend Thai Baht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand has injected
at least 840 million US dollars over the past week in overseas
money markets to defend the Thai currency following rumors of a
baht devaluation on Friday last week.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Thai central bank injected a staggering 44
billion baht (1.76 billion dollars) to tackle the liquidity crisis
at home, bank sources said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday this week alone, 6 billion baht (240 million dollars)
was injected into the repurchase market, which is where banks
manage their liquidity by trading bonds with the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials said the Bank of Thailand traded about 340
million US dollars in the currency swap markets in Singapore and
Hong Kong on Monday and about 500 million US dollars on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers could not confirm whether the central bank intervened
in foreign exchange markets on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign dealers feared that a low export growth of Thailand
during the first half of the year could lead to baht devaluation
to stimulate exports. The falling stock market index is another
factor that had made investors seek to bail themselves out of
their baht positions.
</P>
<P>
Signs indicate that following the central bank's intervention
at home and abroad, the financial markets have almost returned to
normal after a turbulent week.
</P>
<P>
More rumors over the baht devaluation again swamped dealing
rooms Friday afternoon, but were immediately quashed by the
central bank's denial.

PYONGYANG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today criticized Japan of its
preconditions on establishing bilateral relations, urging Japan
to face the history.
</P>
<P>
It was absurd for the Japanese authorities to make
preconditions that the North and the South of Korean Peninsula

</P>
<P>
The article said that the normalization of relations between
the DPRK and Japan is of the common interests of the two
countries, while the talks between the North and the South and the
"four-way talks" should be decided by the DPRK itself.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK will not think it necessary to move forward if Japan
does not want to normalize the bilateral relations, the article
added.
</P>

Japan must face its history and Japan cannot escape its
responsibility of the crimes it had committed in the past, the

ATLANTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Top-ranked Italy, which has won
every major championship this decade except the Olympics, will
play the Netherlands in Sunday's Olympic volleyball final.
</P>
<P>
Italy struggled early before beating surprising Yugoslavia
15-12, 8-15, 15-6, 15-7 in Friday night's semifinals. No. 2 the
Netherlands, a frustrated runner-up in the last three majors
championships including the 1992 Games beat Russia in three sets
15-6, 15-6, 15-10.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Yugoslavia will play for the bronze on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Italy was favored to win the gold medal in 1992, but lost to
the Netherlands in a five-set quarterfinal. The Dutch then lost in
the final to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The Italians have been the Netherlands' tormentors ever since,
with wins in the finals of the 1994 World Championships, the 1995
World Cup and two European Championships.
</P>
<P>
Italy was frustrated by Yugoslavia's blocking in the second and
third games and the hitting of Vladimir Grbic before closing out
the 2 1/2-hour match. The Italians welcomed back star hitter
Andrea Giani, who sat out the quarterfinals with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia was coming off its biggest victory ever, a
quarterfinal win over Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands, which has the tallest starting lineup in the
world, got 22 kills and three service aces from Olof van der
Meulen as it wore down the Russians.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch scored the last eight points of the second set and
the first six of the third. Van der Meulen had his hand in seven,
including two aces.

<P>
ATLANTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- World champion Fernanda Ribeiro
of Portugal beat world record holder Wang Junxia of China in the
women's 10,000 meters to steal the limelight of the day in the
Olympic athletics competition on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The day also saw four other less-known athletes destroyed world
giants' dreams to win their first Olympic golds.
</P>
<P>
Wang, world 10,000m record holder and 5,000m winner four days
ago, was dramatically beaten into second place in her last stepps
by Ribeiro.
</P>
<P>
The winner cruised home in 31 minutes 1.63 seconds to set a new
Games record, less than one second before the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"If I had opened my final kick a bit earlier, I would have won
my second gold," said the upset Wang, who was the sole female
runner at the Games to run both the two distance races.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Keter of Kenya ruined his compariot Moses Kiptanui's
hope of defending his Olympic title in the men's 3,000m
steeplechase. Keter outkicked the world record holder on the home
straight to claim the gold in 8:07.12 to Kiptanui's 8:08.33.
</P>
<P>
Alessandro Lambruschini of Italy prevented Kenya from a clean
sweep by beating Mattew Birir into fourth place with a time of
8:11.28.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I would win the race because I thought Moses
would take over me with his strong finishing power," said Keter
after the race.
</P>
<P>
Kiptanui, who set the world record of 7:28.96, failed to add an
Olympic title to his three world golds. He said:"I knew I must
lead from the beginning because I was afraid that my finish won't
be strong enough."
</P>
<P>
Chioma Ajunwa of Nigeria also chalked up a big victory in the
women's long jump by knocking world champion Fiona May of Italy
and defending Olympic champion Jackie Joyner-Kersee of the United
States into second and third positions.
</P>
<P>
Ajunwa, who mainly known as a 100m sprinter, shifted to long
jump when she saw some big names were out-of-form. The 24-year-old
won the first Olympic gold for Nigeria after producing her winner
7.12 meter in the first round. May took the silver at 7.02m, ahead
of multi-event queen Joyner-Kersee, 7.00m.
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee, who injuried her foot in the heptathlon a few
days ago, settled the bronze with her last leap and the medal was
her ninth at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
With the withdraw of world pole vault king Sergey Bubka of
Ukraine, Jean Galfione of France rose at the occasion to do big in
the men's pole vault, landing the gold with a 5.92-meter sail.
</P>
<P>
The silver and bronze were won respectively by Igor Trandenkov
of Russia and Andrei Tivontchik of Germany, both cleared 5.92m,
but dropped behind after the count-down.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 50-kilometer walk final this morning, Poland's
Robert Korzeniowski outkicked Mikhail Shchennikov of Russia in the
final stage to win the gold in 3 hours, 43 minutes and 30 seconds.
Shchennik, the second fastest in history, won the silver in
3:43.46, in front of Valentin Massana of Spain, 3:44:19.
</P>
<P>
The women's shot put world champion Astrid Kumbernuss of
Germany lived up to her reputation by outclassing her rivals with
a 20.56 winner.
</P>
<P>
China's Sui Xinmei, a three-time Asian champion and former
world indoor champion, wrapped second with a 19.88m ahead of Irina
Khudorozhkina of Russia, 19.35.
</P>
<P>
The most unpleasant thing were the slippery shots," said
Kumbernuss. "I was lucky to manage three valid throws."
</P>
<P>
Nine finals will be up for grab tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> France Captures Olympic Gold in Pole Vault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Jean Galfione of France cleared
5.92 meters on the first attempt to win the gold medal in the
men's pole vault here today at the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Igor Trandenkov of Russia also vaulted to the same height in
the first try, adding two centimeters to Sergey Bubka's 1988
Olympic record, but Galfione had only one failure in previous
attempts. Trandenkov, who missed twice in the early rounds of
competition, received the silver.
</P>
<P>
Andrei Tivontchik of Germany was the third man who cleared the
same height, but did it on the second attempt to receive the
bronze.
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the most beautiful days of my life," Galfione
said. "All the hard work and training has paid off. Today I had to
recover well between jumps and my approach had to be very good."
</P>
<P>
Galfione, 25, has been touted as a potential successor to
Bubka, current world recorder holder, since he won the world
junior title in 1990. But he failed to qualify for the final at
the Barcelona Games and won only the bronze at the 1993 World
Indoor Championships.
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame that Sergey Bubka was not there," Galfione said
at a press conference following the competition. "But 5.92 is a
world class performance. Bubka won with 5.90 in Seoul and with
5.92 last year."
</P>
<P>
Trandenkov was the silver medalist at the Barcelona Games and
bronze medalist at the 1993 World Championships in Stuttgart,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
"All went wrong for me," Trandenkov said. "The procedure was
very slow. If you think, we had to have three qualifying jumps
before and then competed for four hours today, plus a two hour
warm-up. I am sure it affected the result, not the rankings but
the heights."
</P>
<P>
Trandenkov had his personal best on July 4, just before coming
to Atlanta, when he vaulted 6.01 meters in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy to have an Olympic bronze medal," said
Tivontchik. "I am a bit surprised because I did a personal best
today."
</P>
<P>
Tivontchik, 26, was the bronze medalist at the 1995 World
Indoor Championships with a vault of 5.75 meters. His personal
best before today was 5.85 meters.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Police Question People Charged with Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Police have completed the
questioning of 123 persons charged with involvement in the Jakarta
riots on July 27 and handed their dossiers to the public
prosecutor's office, the official Antara news agency reported
today
</P>
<P>
Jakarta police chief Maj. Gen. Hamami Nata told the local press
Friday that out of 246 persons arrested in connection with the
July 27 rioting, 133 had been formally charged. Of those charged,
123 had their dossiers completed and submitted to the public
prosecutor's office, the agency responsible for the presentation
of the cases to courts of justice.
</P>
<P>
The 123 persons were directly involved in the riots and subject
to Article 170 of the Criminal Code because it had been proven
they had damaged other people's property or attacked other people
as well committed arson, he said.
</P>
<P>
Violent rioting broke out on July 27 following the takeover of
the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) headquarters in central
Jakarta from supporters of ousted PDI Chairperson Megawati
Sukarnoputri by supporters of breakaway PDI leader Soerjadi.
</P>
<P>
Soerjadi was named chairman by a breakaway PDI congress in
Medan, North Sumatra, in June, but was not recognized by the camp
of Megawati who was elected in 1993 for a five year term as the
party's leader.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Megawati, daughter of Indonesia's former
president Soekarno, had kept the party's headquarters under their
control since the Medan congress.
</P>
<P>
The rioting left three persons dead, over 25 wounded, more than
200 arrested, scores of office and bank buildings burnt and tens
of cars on fire.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Raise Oil Price on August 12 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Energy Regulatory
Board (ERB) said Friday that the prices of regular, premium and
unleaded gasoline may go up by 50 centavos (two US cents) per
liter when an automatic pricing scheme takes effect on August 12.
</P>
<P>
But other petroleum products -- liquefied petrol gas, fuel oil,
kerosene and jet fuel -- will go down under the new mechanism,
which signals the government has begun to partially deregulate its
20 years' tight control over the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
The ERB said the oil industry will be fully deregulated until
March, 1997. During the nine-month transition period, adjustments
in pump prices will be limited to 50 centavos (two US cents) per
liter.
</P>
<P>
Under the new mechanism, premium and unleaded gasoline will be
sold for 10 pesos (38 US cents) per liter while the price of
regular gasoline will increase to 9.49 pesos (36 US cents) per
liter.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos said the automatic pricing
scheme will not result in higher inflation and higher prices for
oil products being used by the majority of the population.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates, the deregulation is expected to draw a
total investment of 3 billion US dollars from 15 international
firms.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Retains Steeplechase Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Joseph Keter of Kenya upset his
fellow countryman, world record holder Moses Kiptanui to win the
men's 3,000 meter steeplechase here today at the Atlanta Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
Keter outsprinted Kiptanui in the final lap to finish in eight
minutes and 7.12 seconds, his personal best time. Kiptaunui, who
was passed on the home stretch, finished in 8:08.33 to receive the
silver. Alessandro Lambruschini of Italy was third in the race,
clocking 8:11.28.
</P>
<P>
"The competition was very good, but tough. I didn't think I
would win the race because I thought Moses would take over me with
his strong finishing power," Keter said. "I thought my fight was
of the silver and bronze. Only after the last steeple I knew the
gold was mine."
</P>
<P>
Kiptanui, who set the world record of 7:28.96 in 1992, has won
the World Championships since 1991, but today was his first time
to compete in an Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't come to Atlanta with overwhelming assurance," said
Kiptanui, who took an early lead in the race. "I took the lead
because that's how I usually run. I knew that I must lead from the
beginning because I was afraid that my finish won't be good
enough."
</P>
<P>
Kiptanui, a former football player, is also the world champion
in 5,000 meter steeplechase.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about Sydney, it's another four years of
waiting," Kiptanui said. "I'm however quite happy with this silver
medal here."
</P>
<P>
Lambruschini, who was the fourth place at both the Barcelona
and Seoul Games, surprised the Kenyans by preventing them from
sweeping the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
"Basically I am very happy with my medal," Lambruschini said.
"I thought from the beginning that I was going to get this bronze
and after three Olympics I have at last got it and I deserve it."
</P>
<P>
Lambruschini, the 1994 European champion and the bronze
medalist at the 1993 World Championships, is regarded as the main
challenger to the overwhelming domination of Kenya in the
steeplechase.

<HEADLINE> Election to Make Serb Republic a State: Serb Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming elections in Bosnia
will make the Serb Republic a sovereign state, acting "President"
of the self-styled republic Biljana Plavsic said today.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the local television in Obrenevac, a city
southwest of Belgrade, Plavsic noted that the elections in
September in Bosnia will formally make the Serb Republic a state,
or an entity with sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the elections are crucial for the Serb
Republic, because it decides the fate of the republic.
</P>
<P>
She added that the Serbs will take part in the joint governing
bodies of the future Bosnian Federation after the elections "if
the other side (the Muslim-Croat federation) shows good will."
</P>
<P>
"If the three conflicting sides have a common ground, that is
all sides are willing to seek real peace," Plavsic noted, "it will
be a good basis for cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Plavsic said she earlier met with U.S. special envoy John
Kornblum and discussed with him issues concerning the
implementation of the Dayton peace accords. She denied she and the
U.S. envoy had discussed the extradition of Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic, who was forced to resign from all public posts under
international pressure last month but still have much political
influence among Serbs.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Set to Cut Ties with Tin Association </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is ready to withdraw
from the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) as no
large-scale commercial mining of the metal has taken place in the
country for years due to low prices.
</P>
<P>
Pricha Attavipach, director-general of the Department of
Natural Resources, was quoted today by local newspaper Business
Day as saying that Thai tin producers have been constrained by a
gradual fall in tin prices, forcing many of them out of business.
</P>
<P>
Thailand currently has to import about 5,000 tons of the 7,000
tons of the metal used annually.
</P>
<P>
Pulling out of the association means that Thailand will no
longer have to pay its membership fees, but Pricha declined to say
exactly what the annual savings would be.
</P>
<P>
Withdrawal from the association will be formally carried out at
the upcoming ATPC meeting to be held in Singapore on September
18-26, he said.

ATLANTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- World champion Fernanda Ribeiro
of Portugal beat China's sensation Wang Junxia in the final steps
to win the women's 10,000 meters gold medal here this evening in
the Olympic athletics competition.
</P>
<P>
Ribeiro, who ranked first in the world last year, clocked 31
minutes and 1.63 seconds to set a new Olympic record, the time
also bettered her personal best.
</P>
<P>
Wang, world record holder in this event and the winner of the
5,000m four days ago, wound up second in 31:02.58, ahead of
Birhane Adere of Ethiopia, 31:06.65.
</P>
<P>
Wang, the only female distance runner at the Games to run both
the 5,000m and 10,000m, lured in the rear most of the time.
Ribeiro also sat third behind the Chinese, whose best time is
29:31.78 set in Beijing three years ago.

</P>
<P>
Wang dropped Ribeiro five meters when she went off the final
curve, but the European granted her teech and burned off her last
ounce of energy to pass Wang in the final strides.
</P>
<P>
Wang said: "If I had opened my final kick earlier, I would have
won the gold. My speed is not so fast as the winner."
</P>

<HEADLINE> MILF Vows to Continue Moro Struggle in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) vowed on Friday to pursue the struggle for genuine Muslim
autonomy in Mindanao as it rejected the peace agreement between
the government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF).
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chair for political affairs, said
the proposed Southern Philippines Council for Peace and
Development which will be led by MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari is "not
in implementation of the Tripoli agreement of 1976 in letter and
spirit."
</P>
<P>
He said the peace formula between the government and the MNLF
would not lead to genuine peace because "it is not accepted by
majority of the non-Moro people and it does not address the
problem of the Moro people."
</P>
<P>
Jaafar did not explain how the MILF would pursue the struggle
for genuine autonomy, but said it would "put up a fight" if MNLF
runs after them.
</P>
<P>
At the same day, MILF Vice Chair for Military Affairs Mohammad
Murad al-Haj said some 2,000 armed MNLF guerrillas have defected
to the MILF, making the latter "the legitimate representative of
the Muslims fighting for genuine autonomy" in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF "no longer represents" the Muslims after Misuari
decided to run for governor of the autonomous region in Muslim
Mindanao, Murad said.
</P>
<P>
A recent report said the Philippine military is considering the
MILF as a more potent threat than the MNLF. Its strength is
estimated at 20,000 members, including 15,000 armed fighters while
the MNLF has about 25,000 members.

<HEADLINE> Russian Saoutine Wins Men's Platform Diving Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Reigning world champion Dmitry
Saoutine denied China a gold medal sweep in the Olympic diving as
he triumphed at the men's platform final here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian, who took the platform title in the 1994 world
championships in Rome, showed his consistent form to register
692.34 points, beating runner-up Jan Hempel of Germany by 29.07.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Chinese had taken the men's springboard, women's
platform and springboard titles.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Xiao Hailiang and Tian Liang, who scored 658.20 and
648.18 points, came third and fourth respectively.
</P>
<P>
Saoutine led all the way in the final, scoring 79.20, 85.44,
79.20, 87.12, 76.50, 90.24 in his six dives.
</P>
<P>
Hempel, down to the fourth after the fourth outing, scored
93.84 points for his fifth dive which featured reverse three and a
half somersault to move one notch up.
</P>
<P>
In the final outing, the German pulled off the most difficult
dive which featured backward one and a half somersault with four
and a half twists which earned him 92.88 points and a silver
medal.
</P>
<P>
The 1992 Olympic champion Sun Shuwei failed to qualify for the
Atlanta Games after finishing third after Tian and Xiao in the

<HEADLINE> Alunwa Captures First Olympic Gold for Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Chioma Alunwa of Nigeria captured
the first Olympic gold medal for her country here today at the
26th Olympic Games athletics competition.
</P>
<P>
Alunwa, 24, won the women's long jump with her opening leap of
7.12 meters, setting a new African record.
</P>
<P>
"Coming to Atlanta it looked as if I would compete only in the
100 meters," Alunwa said, "But when my coach and I saw the whole
long jump situation, we decided to compete in long jump too."
</P>
<P>
Alunwa said she thought the event would be won at about 6.80 to
6.90 meters and she was very surprised to see the competition
started with a seven meter jump.
</P>
<P>
Fiona May of Italy took the silver with a jump of 7.02 meters
and Jackie Joyner-kersee of the United States jumped to 7.00
meters for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
May, who moved from Britain to Italy in 1993 when marrying
Italian pole vault record holder Gianni Iapachino, called her
silver medal "better than nothing."
</P>
<P>
"The move to Italy has been excellent," said the British-born
athlete who became Italy's first world champion in the event when
she won the long jump title in 1995 at Gothenburg, Sweden. "My
coach always said I would jump seven meters. Silver, I suppose, is
better than nothing."
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee, a star athlete who won heptathlon at both the
Barcelona and Seoul Games, was struggling with minor injuries this
year.
</P>
<P>
"It was tough. I didn't get gold or silver, but I'll take the
bronze," she said. "The crowd was fantastic. They motivated me. I
wish I had done better for them. I'm just glad that I got a
medal."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Approves Bill to Raise Minimum Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress today
approved legislation to raise the federal minimum wage, and sent
it to President Clinton for signature.
</P>
<P>
The approval follows months of fierce political strife. The
bill was cleared the U.S. Senate on a vote of 76 to 22, and passed
by the House of Representatives earlier today on a vote of 354 to
72.
</P>
<P>
The bill called for a 90 cent hike over 13 months to the
current federal base of 4.25 dollars per hour. The wage level will
rise by 50 cents on October 1 this year and by another 40 cents on
September 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
It is a hard-won triumph for U.S. Democrats who proposed the
wage rise earlier this year. The Democrats said the federal
minimum wage had fallen to a 40-year low in purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
But the Republicans criticized the Democrats for "playing
politics" in the election year, and tried hard to block the
bill. They succeeded in attaching some measures to the bill,
including tax breaks for small businesses, homemakers, adoptive
parents and others. The provisions were demanded by majority
Republicans for permitting the bill to pass.
</P>
<P>
The legislation was passed before U.S. congressmen rushed to
adjourn for the summer break and for the national political
conventions of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich said
there was an "underlying sense of both Democrats and Republicans
wanting to be able to go home with things the American people
want," an attitude he said also applied to President Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Promote Fish Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
promote fish consumption as part of the celebrations for the XVI
World Food Day.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of Food Ibrahim Hasan said here Saturday that
the government has chosen fish consumption as the theme for World
Food Day celebrations because despite an abundance of fish in
Indonesia, fish consumption is still below the health standard set
by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
As an archipelagic state with more than 17,000 islands,
Indonesian maritime area has a potential to produce 6.7 million
tons of fish per year. Last year, Indonesia exported 1.58 billion
US dollars worth of fish products.
</P>
<P>
The international theme for this year's World Food Day is
"fighting hunger and malnutrition," and the theme chosen by the
Indonesian government is "through fish consumption, we elevate the
public's nutritional level."
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim said that on an average, Indonesians consume 18
kilograms of fish per capita each year, which is lower than the
FAO's health standard of between 25 and 30 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
In developed countries, such as Japan, annual fish consumption
averages between 65 and 70 kilograms per capita.
</P>
<P>
He said the government hopes to increase the fish consumption
to between 20 and 21 kilograms by 1999, when the sixth five year
development plan period ends.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Day falls on October 16, which is also the FAO's
anniversary.

<P>
ATLANTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands sweep to a 3-1
victory over Spain and took the gold medal in the Olympic men's
hockey tournament here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch, who had never won an Olympic gold, scored from three
of their six corners to settle the match.
</P>
<P>
Victor Pujol gave Spain the lead in the 45th minute with a fine
rising shot following a free hit.
</P>
<P>
Floris-jan Bovelander, a powerfully-built midfielder, struck
two goals in the 52nd and 55th minutes to put the Dutch in front.
</P>
<P>
When the Dutch earned their sixth corner three minutes from
time, they brought Bram Lomans off the bench and he scored with a
flick into the roof of the net to effectively seal the match.
</P>
<P>
Dutch goalkeeper Ronald Jansen played a major role in his
team's victory.

<HEADLINE>   American Leaders to Discuss Free Trade Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Officials from 34 American countries
will meet in Lima August 15 to continue discussing the commerce
policies of the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit will be the second of its kind after this
week's Washington meeting of 11 American countries, in which
topics like noncompliance in information delivery were discussed.
</P>
<P>
The idea of establishing a free trade area in the Western
Hemisphere by 2005 arose from the Summit of Americas held in
Miami, the U.S., in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Also agreed at the summit was the annual trade minister meeting
to prepare for trade integration.
</P>
<P>
The first ministerial meeting was held in 1995 in the U.S. city
of Denver where seven working groups were set up to examine major
priorities for the FTAA.
</P>
<P>
The second meeting in the Colombian city of Cartagena proposed a
schema for the path of integration.
</P>
<P>
The Washington meeting, which ended on Thursday, also examined
progress by working groups, ideas for immediate action and
membership matters.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Minerals Trade Pattern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Statistics show that China's
import and export value of mineral products amounted to 41 billion
US dollars in 1995, more than one fifth of its total value of
imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
While the import of primary mineral products maintains the same
level in recent years, their export has been increasing at an
annual rate of 14 percent to 4 billion US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that the proportion of nonmetal mineral
products increases gradually in the total minerals trade while the
proportion of metal ones decreases.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the trade of energy minerals tends to
decrease. Crude oil will be imported more and exported less while
coal will continue to be the major mineral export of China.
</P>
<P>
China has imported more primary metal minerals and exported
less, which is quite contrary to the trade of processed ones.
</P>
<P>
Production and sale of nonmental mineral products has gone up
by a big margin. Its trade value accounts for 41 percent of the
country's total for mineral products.
</P>
<P>
Experts also pointed out that though the import and export
volume of mineral products has kept growing in recent years, the
trade value remained the same, or saw a negative growth.
</P>
<P>
They said that it is a pressing matter of this moment to reform
the foreign trade management system of mineral industry and to
make unified policy on import and export of mineral products.

MANAGUA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan President Violeta

free and transparent elections, and asked presidential candidates
to be very careful with their campaign promises.
</P>
<P>
In a speech marking the official start of the campaign,
Chamorro said: "I made a special effort to achieve my greatest
desire of making of our electoral process a civic and exemplary
feast, giving all the political parties and candidates all the
necessary conditions and guaranteeing their liberties."

<P>
She said the October 20 voting would be "the first electoral
process in complete liberty, without any kind of intimidation."

Chamorro called on all the candidates to use in their campaign
messages of reconciliation, and not promise more than could
reasonably be given.

<P>
"Nicaragua needs its programs and electoral promises to be in
agreement with the realities and the resources of our country,"
she said.

<P>
"A good politician must be aware of the Nicaraguan reality to

<HEADLINE> More Shanghai-based Firms Enter Overseas Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shanghai, August 3 (Xinhua) -- In recent years, more and
more Shanghai-based enterprises have invested, sent labors or
contracted projects abroad.
</P>
<P>
In the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-95), Shanghai
conducted economic and technological cooperation with over 110
foreign countries and regions, signed over 1,500 contracts
involving a total funds of 1.13 billion US dollars, realized 703
million US dollars in business volume, and sent 21,000 workers
overseas.
</P>
<P>
At present, Shanghai has granted 29 local companies with rights
to directly participate in international engineering projects
including contracting project.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, Shanghai-based companies have been
working on a number of sophisticated projects overseas, such as a
television broadcasting tower in Indonesia and a cable-stay bridge
in egypt.
</P>
<P>
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), Shanghai plans
to further develop its economic and technological cooperation with
foreign countries and regions, and foreign-funded joint ventures
will be encouraged to participate in the new efforts so as to
promote local products in the international market.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Experts Call for Development of Earth-Science Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists want tourists
of the future to take journeys to new frontiers - earth sciences.
</P>
<P>
They believe that adventure seekers will enjoy mixing visits
to scenic spots with journeys into the earth, viewing mines, rare
mineral deposits and other rare sights related to the planet.
</P>
<P>
The geologists urge official departments to help establish the
earth-science tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Chen Anze, Deputy Secretary General of Chinese Geological
Society, said in an interview with Xinhua, that China could
benefit greatly from the development of earth-science tourism.
</P>
<P>
He explained that tourists could gain a popular knowledge of
earth sciences, while enjoying tours of natural scenic spots
with strong geological characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Science tourism, in turn, would generate much more income for
China as well as the local areas concerned.
</P>
<P>
Chen, also President of Society of Tourism Earth Sciences
attached to Chinese Geological Society, said China has rich
resources for the promotion of geological tourism, and many
experienced personnel that could be engaged in the industry.
</P>
<P>
He said the establishment of the industry needs favorable
government policies, an overall development plan and funds for
building geological parks and establishing geological tourist
routes.
</P>
<P>
The Society of Tourism Earth Sciences draws together 500
geologists and experts of related fields.
</P>
<P>
Geologists from the society suggested the launching of a
geological resource investigation, appraisal and development
projects, natural scenic spot protection projects, developing
geological tourism commodities, such as mineral waters and
precious stones.
</P>
<P>
They urged the setting up of a number of tourist agencies for
earth-science tourism, building or renaming 50 geological parks
and opening 50 geological tourism routes by the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of geological tourism as a speciality in some
geological universities and colleges is also suggested.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the country has laid a foundation for the
establishment of the industry, adding the geological data
collected by geological departments could serve as information for
launching earth-science projects.
</P>
<P>
Chen's society has made investigations and drafted development
plans for hundreds of earth-science projects all over the country
in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The tourist agency of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral
Resources has arranged a number of geological investigation tours
for foreigners during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Chen believes that the development of a geological tourism
resource is much more worthwhile than the development of a rich
mine. The tourism project needs less investment and in a shorter
period can produce much higher profits, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Astrid Kumbernuss of Germany won
the women's shot put as expected with a 20.56-meter toss here this
evening at the Olympic athletics competition.
</P>
<P>
The world champion tossed her winning shot in the first round
and was never challenged throughout. China's Sui Xinmei, World Cup
winner in 1994, finished second at 19.88, ahead of Irina
Khudorozhkina of Russia, 19.35.
</P>
<P>
The battle started without China's Olympic silver medalist
Huang Zhihong, who suffered from an injury during a training
session here.
</P>
<P>
With Kumbernusss, world champion and world No.1 in 1995, was a
class above the rest of the field, most putters were virtually
competing for the minor medals.
</P>
<P>
Sui heaved her longest toss on her first outing, and that put
pressures on her rivals. Khudorozhkina, who marked a 20.32 meter
personal best early this season, looked pale in the showdown,
failing to do any better than her first effort of 19.35.
</P>
<P>
Neimke Kathrin of Germany, whose best toss was 21.21, couldn't
live up to her credit, only winding up seventh at 18.92.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea won its third
straight women's team gold medal by beating Germany in the final
of the Olympic archery competition in Stone Mountain, Georgia, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Germany led 162-161 with nine arrows left in the gold-medal
match Friday, when Cornelia Pfohl shot a 1, the outermost ring on
the target. Visibly shaken, she gave way to teammate Sandra
Wagner, who hit a 9 and a 10.
</P>
<P>
The mistake opened the door for individual gold medalist Kim
Kyung-wook, who hit the bullseye three straight times. Teammate
Kim Jo-sun followed with a 9 and two 10s to give South Korea
control of the match and its third straight women's team gold.
</P>
<P>
In the men's team competition, the United States advanced to
the gold-medal match with three victories.
</P>
<P>
Six straight 10s at the end gave the Americans a 251-247
victory over Italy. It was the same score the U.S. men had in
their two previous matches to tie an Olympic record that was also
broken Friday.
</P>
<P>
Germany's women, ranked second in the world, shot for the gold
medal after Barbara Mensing had two 10s on the last three arrows
in a 239-237 semifinal victory over Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Poland won the women's bronze medal with a 244-239 victory over
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Workers Benefit From Social Security System Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Almost a quarter of one million
retired workers in south China's Hainan province have had the
worry taken out of their old age.
</P>
<P>
The 223,000 pensioners have received their retirement pay
regularly for five consecutive years, thanks to the reforms in the
local social security system since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The province has implemented social security on old-age
pension, industrial injuries, unemployment and medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Hainan is so far the only province in China to implement
comprehensive reforms in the social security system, and is the
first to implement a social security system reform through local
legislation.
</P>
<P>
To see that regulations on social security are implemented,
Hainan province has set up labor supervisory organizations and
social security tribunals. They deal with cases and disputes
involving social security. Organizations have also been
established to monitor collecting, payments and the management of
the social security fund.
</P>
<P>
More than 820,000 in-service workers in the province have
joined social security system, and so have 15,397 enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995, Hainan collected 832 million yuan
in social security funds, 699 million were used, of which, 652
million were in old-age pensions, 2.592 million for industrial
injury, 13.93 million yuan for medical treatment and 1.76
million for unemployment.
</P>
<P>
At present, China uses 15 percent of its total wages to feed
retired workers, the rate for Hainan is 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that by the year 2020, China will have 300
million people above the age of 60.

<HEADLINE> Hosts Shows Superiority in Freestyle Wrestling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States showed its
prowess at the Centennial Olympic freestyle wrestling competition
which ended here on Friday, by chalking up a total of three gold,
one silver and one bronze to top the freestyle medal tally.
</P>
<P>
Tom Brands from the hosts team continued his convincing run
through the tournament, taking the gold madal for the United
States on Friday in the 62-kilogram category under cheers of the
local fans.
</P>
<P>
Brands cruised to a 7-0 decision over Jang Jae-Sung of South
Korea for the laurel.
</P>
<P>
"This is just great. It's something I've been looking for for a
long time," said Brands, the 1993 World champion.
</P>
<P>
The United States also took titles in the 57kg and 100kg
classes on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. veteran Bruce Baumgartner also won a rematch to
earn the 130kg bronze medal, his 13th Olympic and world medal. He
is the most versatile wrestler in the world and the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Two-time world champion Rasull Khadem Azghadi of Iran defeated
his old rival to win the gold medal in the 90kg discipline.
</P>
<P>
Khadem scored a takedown nearly four minutes into the match and
quickly outwitted Makharbek Khadartsev of Russia for a 3-0
victory.
</P>
<P>
Khadem, bronze medalist at the 1992 Barcelona Games, also beat
Khadartsev in the finals of the 1994 and 1995 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Khadartsev, a five-time world champion, was the 1988 and 1992
Olympic gold medalist.
</P>
<P>
However, the Olympic gold medal didn't seem to excit him.
</P>
<P>
"Honestly I don't have any special feeling," said Khadem, "I
want to thank my compatriots. I did what I had to do, and I won
the gold for Iran."
</P>
<P>
Russia, which had the most wrestlers entering into the medal
round with four, had only one wrestler winning gold. Buvaysa
Saytyev grabbed the title in the 74-kilogram class, beating his
South Korean rival Park Jang-Soon into the silver.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which took one gold and one bronze for the third-place
finish in the Greco-Roman competition medal tally, came in the
second in the freestyle, at three golds, one silver.
</P>
<P>
Asian powerhouse Iran was third at one gold, one silver and one
bronze.

NANJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 multinationals had
invested in 280 ventures in prosperous Jiangsu Province in east
China by the end of June, the latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The giants are mainly from Japan, the United States, Germany,
Britain, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Belgium and their
investment is mainly concentrated in Nanjing, Zhenjiang,
Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Yangzhou and Nantong.
</P>
<P>
One of the features of the investment is the expansion of scale

<P>
BELGRADE, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A group of Muslims attacked U.N.
policemen escorting a Serb refugee on a visit to his pre-war home
in a Sarajevo suburb, U.N. spokesman Patrik Svensson said today.
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the incident but a U.N. vehicle was
damaged when some 200 Muslims started throwing stones on the
unarmed policemen near the northern Sarajevo suburb of Vogosca on
Thursday, Svensson said in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR),
Maj. Brett Boudreau, said a unit of Italian soldiers participating
in IFOR was called to assist in calming the stick-wielding
Muslims, but did not intervene as their presence only appeared to
inflame the crowd.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims dispersed when the refugee called off his visit to
inspect his property, Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials have recently reported on maltreatment of
Bosnian Serbs in the five districts that were placed under control
of Muslim-Croat federation this spring, as provided for by the
Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
In the latest exodus, about 80,000 Serbs fled the five formerly
predominantly Serb-populated districts afraid to remain in now
Muslim-Croat controlled areas.

It is believed that about 8,000 Serbs have remained in

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wins Olympic Synchronized Swimming Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States proved its
depth of resources in the sport of synchronized swimming by taking
Olympic Games' first ever team title here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
And the Americans were awarded a rarely-seen high score for the
sport in history, with five 10s for the technical merit and four
10s and a 9 on the artistic impression at today's free routine
event. The team won the gold medal with a total of 99.720 points.
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, the American team won the technical routine with
99.200 points. The technical routine is 35 percent of the team's
total score and the free routine, 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
Canada, another world powerhouse in the field, took the silver
with 98.367 and Japan finished third on 97.753 for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
All the three are the only countries that have ever won any
Olympic medal in the sport since it was first listed as an
official Olympic medal sport in the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
At this year's Games here, the solo and duet events have been
dropped to be replaced by an eight-women team event, for the first
time in the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Russia was fourth with 97.260, France fifth with 96.076 and
Italy sixth with 94.253.
</P>
<P>
China, a comparatively new force in synchronized swimming,
suffered dearly today. Going into today's free routine as a
sixth-ranked side with a technical routine score of 94.600 points,
the team had been poised to finish sixth overall.
</P>
<P>
But a fall by one of its eight swimmers from an
above-the-surface lift cost them the ranking seemingly firm in
their hands. They finished seventh overall, just 0.129 points
behind the sixth-placed Italians, who were ranked only eighth
after the technical routine. The sobering Chinese swimmers
declined an interview after the competition.
</P>
<P>
China was placed sixth in both duet and team events at the 1991
world swimming championships in Perth, eighth in duet at the last
Olympic Games and seventh at the 1994 world championships in Rome.
</P>
<P>
"We'll continue our efforts when back home to build a strong
team and we shall come back to do better at Sydney (Games in
2000)," said Wang Ren, the team's head coach.

ATLANTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Spain upset reigning world
champion Bulgaria Friday to win the first Olympic gold in rhythmic
group gymnastics in Athens, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The group compeition was introduced to the Olympic games for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria won last year's world title and was the top qualifier
in preliminaries. Spain was second in both.
</P>
<P>
Rhythmic scoring is split equally between composition and
execution, and both countries received 10s for the composition of
their two routines.
</P>
<P>
The teams also tied on the execution scores of their second
routine with three balls and two ribbons. So the deciding factor
was Spain's.067 edge in the execution of the first routine with
five hoops.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which finished between Spain and Bulgaria in the hoop
round, was third overall. France, China and Belarus followed.
</P>
<P>
Spain finished with a total of 38.933. Bulgaria won the silver
with 38.866 and Russia the bronze with 38.365.

<HEADLINE> French Justice Minister Orders Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- French Justice Minister Jacques
Toubon today ordered the Attorney General of Paris to decide
whether some remarks made on the same day by the leader of Front
National Jean-Marie Le Pen should be sued for racism and
antisemitism.
</P>
<P>
Le Pen said at a press conference today that the judicial
inquiry being launched into four skinheads accused of desecrating
a Jewish cemetery six years ago in Capentras is "another
political plot."
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning (of the affair) and once more today, I put
forward the hypothesis of a political plot," said Le Pen at the
seat of the Front National in Saint Cloud, west of Paris.
</P>
<P>
He picked up the president of the Representative Council of
Israelis in France (CRIF) Henri Hajdenberg, former minister of
culture Jack Lang and the president of SOS Racism Fode Sylla, as
targets of personal attack.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry is linked with "bitter insinuations of some Jewish
extremists, including Mr. Hajdenberg, and Lang" and with "the
delirium of the big humped ox fool Fode Sylla," said Le Pen.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lifts Arms Sales Restrictions with Ukrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States has decided
to end its policy of denying commercial defense trade with Ukrain,
the State Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a regular press
briefing here that as of today, Ukrain will be removed from the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations list (ITAR).
</P>
<P>
The announcement came just about two weeks after the United
States lifted restrictions of arms sales to six former Soviet
republics including Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan,
Georgia and Kazakhastan. Russia was removed from the ITAR list in
April.
</P>
<P>
"That means that there are now a number of areas related to
military equipment, defense services and defense technologies
where trade will be permitted and possible with Ukrain," Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
"And this is a major step forward for Ukrain and for the
development of very close U.S.-Ukrain relationship which...for
three and a half years has been a very high priority of this
administration," the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Libya Refutes U.S. Allegation about Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Libya refuted on Friday a
U.S. allegation that it sponsored terrorism and called for an
urgent meeting of the Security Council on the matter.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to the president of the Security Council,
Libyan U.N. Permanent Representative Mohamed A. Azwai recalled
that on 28 July 1996, U.S. President Clinton urged the
international community to impose strict sanctions on Libya and a
number of countries, claiming that they are states that sponsor
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"The United States President's grave allegation against the
Jamahiriya, made randomly and without grounds or evidence, is such
as to mar the Jamahiriya's reputation with the international
community and impeded the progress of international relations,"
Azwai said.
</P>
<P>
"This is happening at a time when the Jamahiriya is affirming
its commitment to cooperating with the international community in
combating this loathsome phenomenon, one from whose evils the
Jamahiriya itself has not been safe," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He told council president Alain Dejammet that Libya
categorically rejects these accusations because they are
unsupported by any evidence and wanted to put an end to claims
that are intended only to be used for purposes of blackmail, to
mar the reputation of the Jamahiriya and to seek a scapegoat for
the inability of the United States administration to cope with
mounting domestic terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the Security Council to convene an urgent
meeting to "consider a situation that continues to endanger
international peace and security and to hear the positions of the
Jamahiriya with respect to the problem of terrorism and ascertain
its readiness to implement the measures that the international
community deems necessary in order to combat this loathsome
phenomenon."

<HEADLINE> Somali Warlord Aidid Buried Amid Calls for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, Aug 2 (Xinhua) -- The powerful Somali warlord Mohamed
Farah Aidid was buried today in Mogadishu with thousands of his
supporters attending the funeral and other faction leaders
calling for peace and reconciliation in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
General Aidid, who was deadly wounded in recent clan fighting,
died of bullet wounds on Thursday after an operation in the
capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
He was buried at his private residence at Haliwa in south
Mogadishu with his deputies and supporters at the funeral.
</P>
<P>
When a Toyota pick-up carried his flag-drapped coffin through
streets of south Mogadishu, hundreds of thousands of Somalis
stood by and saw him off.
</P>
<P>
Technical battlewagons took to the streets in salute of their
dead leader. South Mogadishu was tense but calm, according to
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Aidid controlled south Mogadishu until his death. He was
considered a leading hurdle to peace efforts by regional and
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
With the hardline faction leader gone, observers believe that
the hope of peace may come more easily in the country.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued today by Aidid's arch rivals Ali
Mahdi Mohamed and Osman Hassan Ali Atto called for an
unconditional ceasefire in the battle-wrecked city.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi controls north Mogadishu and heads the largest clan
coalition ranged against Aidid. Following the death of Aidid,
Ali Mahdi has become Somalia's most powerful strongman. Osman
Atto was Aidid's former financier, but later turned against him
and allied with Ali Mahdi.
</P>
<P>
The statement also called for a national reconciliation
conference as soon as possible and warned Aidid's faction
against laying claim to the presidency as the late general did.
</P>
<P>
However, south Mogadishu Radio supporting Aidid announced
today that four men from his faction had been nominated to
succeed the late faction leader.
</P>
<P>
The four men, their names not yet released, said that they
resolved to follow the policy of General Aideed, according to the
radio.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supports Croatia's Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
determined to fully support Croatia's efforts to be integrated
into the Western nations and institutions, a spokesman for the
U.S. State Department said here today.
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a press briefing that
the commitment was made by U.S. President Bill Clinton during his
meeting with visiting Croatian President Franjo Tudjman at the
White House earlier today.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton supported fully the goal of Croatia becoming
integrated into the Western community of nations as an independent
nation of central Europe," Burns said. "Croatia would like to take
part in some of the major European institutions. The United States
would like to support that."
</P>
<P>
Burns said that the U.S. and Croatian presidents also discussed
the issues concerning the implementation of the peace accord to
end the nearly four years of war in the former Yugoslav republic
of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration believes that the Bosnian
Croat-Muslin federation "is one of the pillars for the success of
the Dayton Accords in the future," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Croatia to support through its influence on the
Bosnian Croatian community the full implementation of the Dayton
peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Jump Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks bolted higher
today, boosted again by falling interest rates, as clearer
indication of slowing economic growth which eased fears of rapid
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 85.08 points to
5,679.83, padding a 160-point advance over the previous three
sessions. The barometer of 30 big U.S. companies has now bounced
back by nearly 500 points from the bottom of the market's steep
selloff last month.
</P>
<P>
Buyers pushed all major indexes higher, too. Advancing issues
outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-1 margin on the New York Stock
Exchange, where its volume totaled 441.67 million shares, slightly
higher than 438.94 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The technology-laden Nasdaq market revived again today, as
battered computer-related shares continued to rebound. The Nasdaq
index rose 26.07 to 1,124.92, its second biggest gain.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 6.09 to 353.87, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 12.47 to 662.49. The
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 4.85 to 548.97.
</P>
<P>
Before the stock market opened, the Labor Department reported
that the country's unemployment rate edged up to 5.4 percent in
July as job creation slackened, offering fresh signs of a slowing
economy that may not need an interest rate increase to control
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The report also eased concerns that wage pressures might boost
consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
After the employment report, bond prices shot higher, pushing
the yield on the 30-year Treasury down to 6.74 percent, its lowest
level since early April.
</P>
<P>
In another sign of economic slowing, the Commerce Department
reported today that consumer spending fell 0.2 percent in June,
the first drop since last winter, when blizzards impeded shoppers.
</P>
<P>
The department also reported that factory orders fell 0.9
percent in June, the first decline in four months, suggesting the
recent rebound in manufacturing may have stalled.
