<HEADLINE> Electric Cherry Harvester Invented in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli company, Stam
Ltd., has developed a low cost, battery-operated tool for picking
cherries, it was learned from the Israel Export Institute today.
</P>
<P>
In using the machine, the harvesting speed doubles the rate
of manual picking and simultaneously, the device is suitable
for collecting such fruits as lemons, apples, grapes, pears and
olives.
</P>
<P>
Ergonomically-designed and lightweight (0.7 kg without the
battery pack), the harvester cuts the cherry's stem to a
pre-determined, optimum length. A special mechanism flattens stem
ends and soften them, preventing damage to the collected fruit.
</P>
<P>
Apart from industrial harvesting, the tool is also suitable
for home gardening. Power is supplied by 3.6v rechargeable
Nickel Cadmium battery pack with a power reserve of eight
hours. During that period, picking capacity ranges from 75 kg
(selective picking) to 150 kg (total picking).

<HEADLINE> Moscow Blames Chechen Women for Pyatigorsk Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Moscow is blaming two Chechen
women for an explosion which killed two people late Monday at a
railway station in Pyatigorsk, southern Russia, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier and Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov told
reporters in Moscow that the explosion was set off by two Chechen
women, identified as Fatima Taimaskhanova and Aiset Dadasheva.
The blast also injured 16.
</P>
<P>
Both women, detained after the explosion in the waiting room of
the station, had admitted their criminal acts at the Pyatigorsk
station, and were connected with an attack on Budennovsk in 1995,
Kulikov said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two women had been wanted by law enforcement
agencies for participation in the attack in Budennovsk.
</P>
<P>
In Sochi, also in southern Russia, President Boris Yeltsin
described the bomb a "terrorist act," saying that he was
"extremely worried." Yeltsin is on a holiday in Sochi.
</P>
<P>
The president was to meet Alexander Chernogorov, governor of
the Stavropol region, where Pyatigorsk is located, on Tuesday,
Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
He was also to meet Kulikov on Wednesday to hear a report on
the situation.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Federation Council (upper house of parliament)
Yegor Stroyev also said on Tuesday that it was absolutely
necessary to put an end to terrorist acts in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot support, encourage and finance those who use such
barbaric methods," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Monday's explosion at the Pyatigorsk station was twice as
powerful as the blast last Wednesday in Russia's southern town of
Armavir, which killed two and injured at least seven, experts
said.

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns Against Excessive Optimism About Aids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- World Health Organization (WHO)
Director-General Dr Hiroshi Nakajima today welcomed news about
AIDS treatments but warned against excessive optimism.
</P>
<P>
"The wave of optimism that has enveloped the international AIDS
community in relation to the new therapies must not lead policy
makers to abandon their commitment to essential long-term
activities such as prevention programs and the search for
vaccines, microbicides and other effective preventive
interventions," Dr Nakajima said on opening the Informal
Consultation on the Implications of Antiretroviral Treatments at
WHO's headquarters in Geneva this morning.
</P>
<P>
The WHO director-general said that it is premature to suggest
that HIV/AIDS will soon be a chronic, non-fatal disease although
so-called triple therapies, using combinations of three
antiretroviral (ARV) drugs including a protease inhibitor to
combat HIV/AIDS, have shown "impressive results" in clinical
trials.
</P>
<P>
DR Nakajima said the two-year clinical trials with the new
triple therapies were not long enough and more time might be
necessary to indicate sustainability of clinical outcomes.
Moreover, the triple therapy is expensive, costing 1000-1500 U.S.
dollars per month, thus beyond the financial means of many
countries and especially developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Dr Nakajima stressed that investment of resources and efforts
in the development of other prevention tools, especially vaccines
and vaginal microbicides, should not be diminished.

<HEADLINE> China Wins Corbillon Cup For 12th Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China on Tuesday beat
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 3-0 in the women's team
final to win the Corbillon Cup for the 12th time at the World
Table Tennis Championships.
</P>
<P>
The defending champion team was so powerful that it only lost
one game in eight matches.
</P>
<P>
World No. 4 Yang Ying put China on the winning track as she
beat Wi Bok Sun in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Yang, the highest-ranked penholder in the
world, used a variety of high-toss serves and strong follow-up
attacks to beat unranked Wi 22-20, 21-16.
</P>
<P>
Deng Yaping, the most successful female player of the modern
era, sent China 2-0 ahead as she used her superior power to carve
out a 21-15, 21-14 victory over Kim Hyon Hui, a losing
semi-finalist at the Atlanta Olympic Games last summer.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Deng, who has added four Olympic gold medals to
her world record haul of 15 world championship and World Cup
titles, overwhelmed the 17-year-old rival with ferocious forehand
attacks and backhand flicks.
</P>
<P>
Li Ju, ranked fifth, snatched the third game against Tu Jong Sil,
winning 21-8, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Li, who beat Tu for the first time at the
Global Youth Championships in February, showed no mercy in the
game. Her variation of spin and speed proved too much for Tu, who
hit a forehand long to concede the match point.
</P>
<P>
DPR Korea, which formed a joint team with South Korea to defeat
China in the 1991 championship final, didn't show up in the
previous two Worlds.
</P>
<P>
"China had an easy game today," said Chinese team leader Li
Furong. "If our final rival was South Korea or Japan, we wouldn't
have won easily."
</P>
<P>
South Korea, who eliminated Japan in the quarter-finals,
suffered a stunning 3-0 loss to DPR Korea in the fight for a final
berth.
</P>
<P>
Germany downed South Korea 3-1 to win the third place as Hong
Kong, ousted out of the medal contention by China, finished fifth
after beating Japan 3-2.

<HEADLINE> US Wages and Benefits Up Modestly in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Americans' wages and benefits
rose by a modest 0.6 percent in the first quarter, relieving a bit
worries that a tight job market will cause accelerating inflation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Labor Department reported today that wages and salaries --
nearly three-fourths of total compensation -- rose a seasonally
adjusted 0.9 percent, the most in a year. But the department's
Employment Cost Index rise for total compensation was tempered by
a scant 0.1 percent rise in benefits.
</P>
<P>
Today's reports were being closely watched by financial markets
as the U.S. labor market has become tight in the past several
months. Many analysts have been worrying that the U.S. Federal
Reserve (Fed) policy-makers will raise rates again when they meet
on May 20.
</P>
<P>
For compensation over the year ended in March, wages and
salaries rose by 3.3 percent and benefits increased by 2 percent.
That combined for an overall rise in compensation of 2.9 percent,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
For some time now, U.S. wages and salaries have been rising a
bit faster than the core inflation rate -- consumer prices
excluding the volatile food and energy components. But benefit
gains have been modest, a reflection in part of restraint in
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that compensation gains may soon start picking up
because most of the potential gains from the conversion of health
plans to managed care have already been realized.
</P>
<P>
The Employment Cost Index is considered a good gauge of
inflation pressures in the U.S. since compensation represents
about two-thirds of product's cost.

<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing No.1 Thermal Power
plant has imported two sets of Double Extraction Condensing TG
Units valued at 550 million US dollars from Germany for its
technical transformation.
</P>
<P>
The import contract for the units was signed here today in the
Great Hall of the People by the China National Technical Import &AMP;
Export Corporation, North China Power Group and the China National
Tendering Center for Machinery &AMP; Electrical Equipment on the one

</P>
<P>
ABB won the contract to supply the units through international
tendering.
</P>
<P>
The import is one of the major projects for technical
transformation of the capital's large and medium-sized
enterprises. The completion of the project by the end of 1998 is
expected to ensure a safe and stable supply of heat and
electricity in east Beijing.

NEW YORK, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Consumer confidence of the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denies Israeli Coveting of Nile Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today categorically denied
claims that some countries outside the Nile basin, especially
Israel, are coveting the Nile water.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture and
Land Reclamation Youssef Wali made the statement when replying to
queries by participants in the Conference of Arab Ministers of
Agriculture and Water, currently in session here.
</P>
<P>
"Conveying Nile water to Israel or any Arab country has never
taken place and will not happen," Wali said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since he came to office 15 years ago, he has
never been asked officially or cordially to provide non-Nile Basin
countries with Nile water.
</P>
<P>
Wali, who chairs the conference, pointed out that projects for
exploiting the river only take place through the approval of the
countries in the Nile basin and within the context of agreements
signed in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The only agreement on the Nile dates to 1959 when Egypt and
Sudan, which use 94 percent of the Nile water, divided it between
themselves. Egypt has access to 55.5 billion cubic meters, 99
percent of its fresh water resources.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, is
suspected of doing projects that threaten to reduce Egypt's Nile
quotas. While some Arab countries, that lie in desert belt over
the equatorial zone, are feared of coverting Africa's longest
river.
</P>
<P>
Wali has said recently Egypt is cooperating with other Nile
basin countries to make the optimum use of the water resources and
ruled out any dispute between Egypt and these countries in water
quotas.
</P>
<P>
The Nile basin groups Egypt, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda,
Burundi, Kenya, Zaire and Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Pak-US Ties Should Be Based on Trade Not Aid: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani Government wants
to have an equitable relationship with the United States based on
trade and not aid, Advisor to the Prime Minister on Information
and Culture Mushahid Hussain Sayed said here today.
</P>
<P>
"I assure you we have already abandoned the beggar's bowl
mentality vis-a-vis our relationship with the U.S. as we pursue an
equitable relationship based on trade and not aid," Sayed said at
a seminar on Pakistan-US Relationship.
</P>
<P>
He said a major shift is discernible in America's relationship
with Pakistan in the context of three new regional realities and
the US is now moving toward an even-handed approach to its
relationship with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
First, he said, the people of Pakistan have returned Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif with an unprecedented mandate and the new
government firmly believes that a sound foreign policy stems from
domestic stability.
</P>
<P>
"Economy will be the underpinning factor of our foreign policy,
and this can be seen from the attitude of the International
Monetary Fund which has undergone a visible change since we took
over," he said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he said political stability makes Pakistan more
conducive to trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, he said, on nuclear issues the US has shown a
freshness of approach as there is a recognition of the fact that
the policies that are selective will not work.
</P>
<P>
"The US policy no longer stresses the roll-back of our nuclear
program as it did in the past, the illusion created by some
circles in this respect has gone," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President For Strengthend Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President F. Chiluba
promised here today that his country will play its part, both as
current chairman and host country of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), to ensure that the regional
organization move from strength to strength to face the challenge
of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the commitment while officially opening the final
dissemination conference on the COMESA International Development
Research Center project.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that the implementation of regional integration
policy will assist Africa's economic performance.
</P>
<P>
He quoted the 1996 World Bank annual report as saying that 30
countries accounting 61 percent of the sub-Saharan region's
population recorded positive per capita growth as sub-Saharan
Africa's gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated to have grown
by four percent in 1995 which was a significant improvement over
the previous 1991 to 1994 and some countries in COMESA
experienced growth rate in excess of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, despite this good progress, Chiluba said, an average
growth rate of four percent in GDP is not actually sufficient to
make much of an impact in poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Africa's savings and investments levels and
social indicators remain below those of other regions of the
world.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "We need to continue to push ahead with our
agenda for economic reform, including reform of public finances
and reform aimed at macro-economic stability to achieve even
higher economic growth rates for the benefit of our population."
</P>
<P>
Chiluba expressed the hope that the research carried out by
COMESA will help policy makers understand regional integration
and assist in developing programs that will help overcome
obstacles in achieving regional integration.

PARIS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-five percent of the French
people have more confidence in the ruling majority in running
their country, while 32 percent confide more in the opposition
Socialists and their allies, said a poll published today by the
daily Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 31 percent of the French people said they confide in
neither the right nor the left, according to the poll conducted by
the SOFRES polling institute on April 25-26.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six percent of the people polled said that it will be
"a good thing" if the Socialists win the election, while 33
percent prefer the ruling majority to win.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four percent of the people said that it will be a bad
thing if the leftwing parties come to power, while 31 percent
judge negatively a victory by the ruling center-right parties.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde said that 25 days from the holding of the first round
of the legislative elections, many French people remain
indifferent to or have shown little interest in the election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another poll by the BVA polling institute said today
that 79 percent of the French people consider the economic
situation of the country as "bad."
</P>
<P>
Fifty percent of those polled said that the situation of the
French economy is "rather bad," while 24 percent think it "very
bad."
</P>
<P>
France's public deficit in 1996 stayed at 356.4 billion francs
(62 billion U.S. dollars), or 4.2 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) of the country, according to a report by the
official statistics study bureau INSEE published today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's GDP grew by 1.5 percent in 1996, while
its household consumption rose by 2.1 percent, said INSEE.
</P>
<P>
France has to cut its public deficit to below 3 percent of its
GDP this year to qualify for the entry into the European single
currency.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen today said that no decision has been made on whether
to reduce the number of the U.S. troops as part of a plan to
modernize the military.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before meeting Romanian Defense Minister Victor
Quadrennial at the Pentagon, Cohen said that he could not confirm
reports that a Pentagon plan will recommend the Army cut its
active-duty forces by 50,000 from 495,000.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon will issue its Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR)
report next month. A New York Times report today said that the
Army will make the cut and make the U.S. military more modernized.
</P>
<P>
"No decisions have been made at this point, as we'are nearing
the conclusion of the examination process itself," Cohen told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"It is a blueprint for the Congress to look at, to see whether
or not we can reach a consensus for how we modernize our forces
for the future, how we maintain the right strategy for today and
well into tomorrow," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he indicated that the Pentagon may propose closing
more U.S. military bases.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's been clear for some time that there is an excess
capacity of infrastructure," Cohen said. "It is clear by virtue of
the fact we've had roughly a 33 percent reduction in force
structure, but about 18 percent reduction in infrastructure."

<HEADLINE> Tamil Maanila Congress to Join UF Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Tamil Maanila Congress
(TMC), a major constituent of the ruling United Front, today
decided to join the government led by Prime Minister I.K. Gujral,
Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by TMC President G.K. Moopanar at the
party's headquarters in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, this evening.
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, he said the decision was taken in the
nation's interest and in view of the expectations of the people.
</P>
<P>
The TMC had opted out of the new United Front government led by
Gujral following Moopanar's failure in the race for the prime
ministership earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
It said it refused to participate in the government on the
ground that its integrity and political morality had been
suspected unfairly by some other constituents of the front during
the discussions to choose a successor to former prime minister
H.D. Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
But ever since the formation of the Gujral government on April
21, the TMC, with as many as 20 seats in the Lok Sabha (the lower
house of parliament), had been under pressure to rejoin the
government to make it more stable.
</P>
<P>
The TMC had four ministers, two of them of cabinet rank, in the
Deve Gowda government which lost the vote of confidence on April
11 after the Congress party withdrew support to it.

<HEADLINE> Africa's Economic Performance Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- K. Y. Amoako, executive
secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA), today said Africa's economic performance has improved
considerably, and there is a new spirit of optimism on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
In his statement at the opening session of the 18th meeting of
the technical preparatory committee of the whole, Amoako
described the "emerging and more dynamic Africa" as many
countries are enjoying greater prosperity than ever before; 24
countries have posted growth figures over 4 percent; 32 countries
grew faster during the 1995-1996 than during the 1992-1994 fiscal
period and current deficits have been sharply reduced in many
countries; inflation has been reduced to moderate levels in
several countries; and there is increased activity in African
capital markets.
</P>
<P>
Referring to economic situation in 1997, he said "the economic
recovery underway since 1994 has continued", adding that "more
gratifying still, most of the African countries are participating
in this improving economic performance."
</P>
<P>
On the question of investment in Africa, Amoako said to
achieve a target rate of GDP growth of 8 percent per annum,
Africa needs to raise its investment by at least a third.
</P>
<P>
He said that while official development assistance is
declining worldwide, record levels of private capital are flowing
to developing countries. Overall, private capital flowing to the
developing world increaced from 44 billion US dollars in 1990 to
about 244 billion US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that only about 3 percent of all the
flows of private capital go to sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Mekonnen Manyazewal, Vice-Minister of
Economic Development and Cooperation of Ethiopia, said "this
year's conference picked a very pertinent theme 'accelerating
trade and investment in Africa' at a time when Africa is facing
new and daunting challenges to its socio-economic development."
</P>
<P>
Mekonnen told participants that Africa is endowed with a huge
natural resources potential and account for one-eighth of the
world population while the combined share of the African
countries (excluding South Africa) in the world exports has
fallen from 4.7 percent in 1980 to a mere 1.9 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said, during the same period, global foreign direct
investment flows have increased by two and a half fold. However,
he pointed out that Africa's share in this booming international
transfer of capital resources has fallen from 2.3 percent to just
1.4 percent between 1980 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Recently there is a clear signal across the continent, that
commitment to fundamental reform has deepened, mainly involving
an outward orientation of national economies and increased
support for the private sector and efficient markets," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 5-day technical meeting will be followed by a four-day
meeting of African economic ministers which is exepcted to be
held here between may 5 and 8.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Changes Social Aid Policy on Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is shifting
its social services aid policy on Zimbabwe from normal relief
assistance to aid investment and job creating community projects.
</P>
<P>
U.N. resident coordinator and UNDP resident representative
Carlos Lopes today said Zimbabwe, which received an annual aid
package of 20 million U.S. dollars from the world body, was one
of a few developing nations with enough capacity to adequately
provide social services to its citizens.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe fares very well in the world in self-provision of
social services like education, health and the general well being
of its people. It is one of the few African countries with a very
low child mortality rate and a high life expectancy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the reason why we (the U.N.) are no longer providing
relief assistance to this country. Instead, we are now focusing
on long term investment projects like construction of dams and
roads as well as supporting community initiated income generating
and job creating ventures," he added.

<HEADLINE> Two Dropped From HK Delegation For East Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Two gymnasts would probably be
dropped from the Hong Kong delegation for the 2nd East Asian Games
slated for May 10-19 in Pusan, South Korea, it was announced here
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Doctors of the delegation advised that the names of the two be
erased from the delegation roaster. But the Hong Kong Gymnastic
Association wish to keep them in the delegation and they would
make a last-minute effort on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But officials of the Hong Kong Amateur Sports Federation and
Olympic Committee (HKASF&AMP;OC) said that it was up to the
Association to make the final decision.
</P>
<P>
With the two erased off the list, the Hong Kong squad would
shrink to 49 athletes and 12 officials.
</P>
<P>
The Pusan Games will be the last comprehensive sporting event
Hong Kong athletes to participate before the handover at the
midnight on June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
From July 1 on, athletes of Hong Kong, which will be called the
 Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), will compete in
international events under the name of "Hong Kong, China", as
stipulated by the Basic Law concerning the SAR.
</P>
<P>
In Pusan, Hong Kong athletes will compete in six medal sports,
namely athletics, gymnastics, badminton, judo, swimming and
diving, and Wushu and demonstration events of rowing and bowling.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong brought about one gold, two silver and eight bronze
medals from the same eight sports at the inaugural East Asian
Games in 1993 in Shanghai. But two of the events have now become
exhibition events.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Hong Kong athletes are hopeful of winning
medals in Wushu, athletics, Bowling and rowing.
</P>
<P>
"Now it's up to you," said HKASF&AMP;OC President A. de O. Sales at
a reception here on Tuesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mandela Welcomes Zairean Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela was "very excited" by the news that warring
Zairean factions had agreed to hold summit peace talks, Mandela's
spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe said in Cape Town today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is to chair the meeting, which Netshitenzhe said would
probably take place later this week.
</P>
<P>
Netshitenzhe said Mandela had been optimistic that both sides
in the Zairean conflict were committed to a peaceful solution.
"He sees this latest development as a major breakthrough in the
process," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, U.S. envoy Bill Richardson said after
meeting Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko that the Zairean
presdient was willing to meet rebel leader Laurent Kabila
"immediately".
</P>
<P>
"President Mobutu assured me today that he is prepared to meet
Mr. Kabila under UN and and OAU auspices immediately," Richardson
said, adding "that is encouraging."
</P>
<P>
He said he would be passing the same message on to Kabila,
whom he was due to meet later Tuesday in Lubumbashi, Zaire's
second largest city which was held by rebel forces on April 9.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the venue, which followed weeks of secret
talks, was announced by the South African Department of Foreign
Affairs early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean peace talks would take place "shortly" on a date
to be decided, the department said, adding that South African
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who has been extensively involved
in mediation between the two sides, would also participate.
</P>
<P>
So far, the South African government has not revealed the
venue of the meeting, but a government source, who asked not to
be identified, confirmed earlier that South Africa had offered a
navy supply ship, the Outeniqua, as a venue for the talks.
</P>
<P>
The vessel is expected to anchor in international waters off
Zaire and Angola, the source said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa previously hosted the first direct talks between
representatives of Zaire's government and the rebels, during
which both sides committed themselves to an eventual cease-fire
and the establishement of full democracy.

<HEADLINE> Levy Warns Syria Against Nerve-Gas Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy warned today that Syria was taking "a grave responsibility"
by arming its ground-to-ground missiles with a dangerous poison
gas.
</P>
<P>
Levy was reacting to a report in Today's Ha'aretz newspaper
that Syria has begun producing an advanced and deadly nerve gas
and is in the first stage in putting it onto surface-to-surface
missile warheads.
</P>
<P>
In an interview to Israel Radio, Levy said that Israel has "a
capability above and beyond what Syria could imagine," adding the
Israeli army is closely monitoring the development in Syria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli foreign minister said that his country
is trying all it can to advance the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the report, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai also warned that Israel is monitoring the development,
and "does not recommend anyone to provoke Israel."
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said that he commented on the issue six months ago
following similar reports in Israel and around the world, and
stressed that he has discussed the matter with officials of United
State and Britain.
</P>
<P>
"It is better to try to talk and reach peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
Peace negotiations between Israel and Syria have been stopped
for more than a year, and the two sides blamed each other for the
failure in resuming the talks which were erupted before the
Israeli elections last year.
</P>
<P>
The current Israeli right-wing government has refused to
discuss about the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria
in the 1967 War, stressing peace talks should be resumed without
any "preconditions."
</P>
<P>
However, Syria insisted that the peace process would not be
pushed forward unless Israel commits itself to withdrawal from
the occupied Golan Heights.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Most of Hong Kong's residents
have some level of interest in sports and badminton is among the
most favored sports here, according to the findings of a survey
which was released here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the comprehensive survey initiated by the Hong
Kong Sports Development Board (SDB) showed that an average of 40
percent of the Hong Kong residents practised at least one sport
during 1996 which represented a total sporting population of about
1.96 million.
</P>
<P>
Data of the survey, which revealed for the first time
up-to-date sports participation of local residents, was collected
through telephone interviews of 4,355 Hong Kong citizens of 15
years of age and above.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 55 listed sports and leisure activities, badminton
was found to be the most popular one in Hong Kong. Other favored
sports include, in order of popularity, swimming, basketball,
soccer, squash, jogging, tennis, walking, hiking and table tennis.
</P>
<P>
Respondents with higher education level tend to favor racket
games like badminton, squash and tennis while elder people usually
engaged in less vigorous activities such as Wushu (Chinese martial
arts), walking and hiking.
</P>
<P>
Basketball and soccer were found to be most frequently
participated by the male respondents while squash was more popular
among women.
</P>
<P>
As for working group, the most frequently participated sports
were badminton and swimming. Soccer was discovered to be the most
popular sport among production workers while students are most
active in basketball.
</P>
<P>
Sport has a continuous impact on local economy. Looking at the
 money spent on sports-related goods or services, over 70 percent
was on the purchase of sports gear and wear. The average yearly
spending on sport of an individual respondent was about 3,000 HK
dollars (384.6 U.S. dollars), according to the findings.
</P>
<P>
And it is estimated that a total expenditure of about 7.6
billion HK dollars (97,000 U.S. dollars) on sports-related goods
and services was generated in 1996.
</P>
<P>
With regards to the perception and expectation of athletic
achievements, almost 40 percent of all respondents have greater
expectation towards local athletes after Lee Lai-shan's success at
the 1996 Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Government Bureaucracy Criticized in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of Zimbabwe
Industries (CZI) has blamed government bureaucracy for fuelling
the country's economic woes in the face of an increasingly
competitive global economic environment.
</P>
<P>
CZI president Jonee Blanchfield today said at the
organisation's annual general meeting that delays by the
govedrnment on key national issues like the new tariff regime had
resulted in the country losing its competitive edge in a region
that continued to be dominated by South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The government pace on these issues has been disappointingly
slow while Zimbabwe continues to forego opportunities to
restructure its economy towards growth and competitiveness," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that lack of urgency by the departments of
immigration and customs and excise negated the gains from the
various forays by the government and the private sector to
attract much-needed investsment into the country.
</P>
<P>
The departments have for a long time been accused of
frustrating investors who complain of delays in processing
documentation at the points of entry into the country.

<P>
CHANGSHA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Two passenger trains crashed

</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that the No. 324 train, which was travelling
north from Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province,

<HEADLINE> AL Chief: Water, Key to Arab Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel Meguid today called upon the Arab world to protect its
scarce water resources for the sake of its security.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab region is still suffering from shortage of water, a
matter that threatens food security," he said in his address to
the inaugural session of the Arab Water and Agriculture Ministers
Conference here.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of water in the Arab world, that lies in the
desert belt over the equatorial zone, is used in agriculture and
the rate goes even higher in countries like Egypt, Iraq, Morocco,
Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
"Water issue is a strategic one and a question of life or
death," he said, making it clear that Arab security is closely
linked to the security of water and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Meguid also stressed the importance of holding a conference of
the Asian Group for fighting desertification in Beijing on May
13-15.
</P>
<P>
Cautioning that Israel is seeking a seat at the Beijing
conference, he called upon Arab countries to jointly bar any
Israeli project on rivers in Arab states.
</P>
<P>
In a message addressed to the ongoing session today, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak also urged Arab countries to coordinate
their efforts in preserving and developing water resources.
</P>
<P>
The conference is jointly organized by the Arab Organization
for Agricultural Development and the Egyptian Ministry of
Agriculture and Land Reclamation.
</P>
<P>
The conference is attended by Arab League Assistant Secretary
General Abdel Rahman al-Sihbani, Chairman of the Arab Organization
for Agricultural Development Yehia Bakour, Arab ministers of
agriculture and representatives from Arab and international groups.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has predicted that the quota per capita of fresh
water in the Mideast and North Africa per year will nosedive from
3,300 to 650 cubic meters over the period from 1960 to 2025.
</P>
<P>
By then, the Arab states would have to settle with two thirds
of the amount used by Asian or seven times less than the
international average.

<HEADLINE> France Hit by Worst Drought in 50 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- France has been hit by the worst
drought in 50 years since the beginning of this year, and the
country's rainfall in April is 75 percent lower than its normal
level, said the French Ministry of Environment today.
</P>
<P>
The government committee of drought met today to discuss ways
to fight the drought, in which rainfall was reduced by 25 percent
in three quarter of the country and by 50 percent in half of the
French territory over the past four months.
</P>
<P>
March was a particularly dry season for France this year, and
the northwest region of Normandy reported an unprecedented
shortage of water for one century, while the central Loire River
has never had such a low water level, said officials.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Meteo France weather broadcast institute said
that France will be subjected to an anti-cyclonic dry weather from
Wednesday, after three Atlantic disturbances brought rain to the
country last weekend and early this week.
</P>
<P>
Officials are worried that drought-caused forest fires will
break out in the southeast, southwest and west forestry regions,
while 11,000 hectares of forests have already been burnt over the
past several weeks.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen central and southern departments have taken measure
to restrict use of water and seven more departments will follow
suit this week.
</P>
<P>
Some playgrounds which consume a lot of water, such as golf
courses, some farms and some factories will have to close
part-time to cut the use of water.
</P>
<P>
But officials so far refuse to dramatize the harm that the
drought will bring to the country's agriculture, including grain,
vegetable and wine production.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Recover Iron, Steel Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- At least 200 million U.S. dollars
will be required to turn around the troubled Zimbabwe Iron and
Steel Company (ZISCO) in a rehabilitation programme the
government hopes to complete by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira today said
the rehabilitation had to precede the eventual privatisation as
no investor would buy the parastatal in its present state.
</P>
<P>
ZISCO is operating at 30 percent of capacity because a major
blast furnace, number four, was shut down for relining over two
years ago and the work is being done by a Chinese company.
</P>
<P>
The government had clung to the ailing steel giant for years
because of its importance in providing materials to the
manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "it underpins the production in all other
manufacturing industries, for the nation it is very important
that we have a thriving steel industry."

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Dissatisfied With ECO Incompetence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani expressed here today his dissatisfaction with
incompetence of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO)
comprising 10 countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president openly complained about the lack of
commitment by the ECO member states, saying that some countries
have done nothing to the development of the organization.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the statement at the opening session of the
seventh ministerial meeting of the ECO. Some countries sent
ministerial level delegations to the meeting, but some dispatched
only deputy ministerial level delegation.
</P>
<P>
The ECO groups Iran, Turkey, Pakistan, Kazakhstan,
Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and
Azerbaijan. These countries have rich national resources but lack
hard currency and technology.
</P>
<P>
"Several organizations formed before ECO have developed and
grown considerably. However, the ECO has not been able to achieve
the desirable growth," Rafsanjani noted in his speech.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we have resources and can help each other in
the respect of availability and diversity of resources."
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the ECO is capable of rendering
appropriate services to its member states. He called on ECO member
countries to make decisions to materialize the organization's key
objectives.
</P>
<P>
"Steps have been taken toward implementation of ECO's
ratification, but without enough seriousness," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He called on the ECO ministerial meeting and the next ECO
summit to make strong decisions to accelerate the implementation
of its approvals.
</P>
<P>
As one of the founding members of the ECO, Iran attaches great
importance to further development of the organization and
believes that the ECO is able to play a crucial role in serving
the people of the region, he emphasized.

<HEADLINE> German Defense Minister Foresees Three New NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe
today predicted that Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary would
become full members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) within two years.
</P>
<P>
In a speech made at the George Marshall Centre in
Garmisch-Partenkirchen near Munich, Ruehe said the national flags
of the three countries could be raised alongside with those of
other NATO members at the April 1999 celebrations marking the
alliance's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe said he expected the membership negotiations of the three
nations to be completed this year and ratifications of their
accession protocols to be completed in capitals in the course of
1998.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that "the first new NATO members will not be the
last." The door to the alliance would remain open in the future,
he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the German defense minister, the purpose of NATO
expansion is to give eastern Europe the same stability as enjoyed
by western Europe. Stability throughout central Europe was of
benefit to everyone, including Russia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe anticipated that a binding agreement with Russia for a
far-reaching security partnership could be reached at the highest
level before the July summit of NATO in Madrid. He also foresaw
that there would be a separate special relationship with Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The new NATO to be shaped in Madrid would reflect Europeans'
desire for their own capability to act, Ruehe said. European-led
operations using NATO facilities and forces would be possible in
the future without direct involvement of the North America, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The new NATO reflected a new partnership between the United
States and Europe, which would be expressed in a new distribution
of burdens and responsibilities, Ruehe said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that although the NATO would remain capable of
collective defense, it would in the future concentrate on the
"transfer of stability", on practical cooperation with non-NATO
states and on international crisis management in and for Europe.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM to Visit Lebanon Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati will visit Lebanon next week to deliver a "written
message" to Lebanese President Elias Hrawi from his Iranian
counterpart Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, an Iranian diplomat said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Ambassador to Lebanon Hamaion Alizadah said that
Velayati will be here in the middle of the next week, but noted
that "more coordination" is needed in order to define the date.
</P>
<P>
Alizadah held talks with Thafer Hassan, secretary general of
the Lebanese Foreign Ministry, in the latter's office. The
Iranian envoy said that the talks dealt with bilateral relations
and developments in the region in addition to Velayati's visit to
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A visit by Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri to Tehran "in
the next months" was also discussed, the Iranian diplomat told
reporters at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on why Iran did not supply missiles to
the Lebanese Hezbollah, or Party of God, in order to shoot down
Israeli warplanes in south Lebanon, Alizadah stressed that the
key for the victory of the resistance was the "resolution" rather
than the weapon.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran,
spearheads a guerrilla warfare in south Lebanon in order to oust
Israeli occupation forces from the Lebanese land.
</P>
<P>
"The resistance of the Lebanese people agaisnt the Zionist
enemy in south Lebanon is not with the weapon, we can say that
there is not a military balance between the resistance and the
Zionist enemy," the Iranian ambassador noted.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that all the world and all countries which love the
freedom help Lebanon and support it in all fields," he
said.

the regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi, Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa in a communique
issued in Arusha, northern Tanzania, today praised the
recommendation of the speakers of east African national
assemblies.

The heads of state, who were in Arusha for a one-day summit
of the EAC, noted with appreciation the progress made by the
commission in implementing cooperation programs and activities
since it was launched last year.
</P>

of the three east African currencies.
</P>
<P>
There has also been promotion of trade, investment and the
growth of the private sector by establishment of the East African
Business Council, an apex body comprising all national private
sector organizations in the region.
</P>
<P>
Over the year, mechanisms for enhancing trade among the three
member states has been put up and also the initiation of

<P>
ANKARA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's center-left Democratic
Left Party (DSP) Chairman Bulent Ecevit and center-right
Motherland Party (ANAP) leader Mesut Yilmaz today called for a
new government in which pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) would be
excluded.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders made the call at their one-hour meeting here
as they try to unseat the coalition government and form a new
one.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Yilmaz said: "It is imperative for
Turkey to get rid of the present government at once. There
is talk of the need for an alternative government model, in
fact this model is quite clear. We have reached full agreement
with Ecevit on the fundamentals of an alternative government
model."
</P>
<P>
He said that the real reason for the current political crisis
was the conflict between the unalterable principles of the
Constitution and the Welfare Party (RP).
</P>
<P>
On April 26, Turkey's National Security Council (NSC), the
highest decision-making body of national defense, decided at a
eight-hour-long meeting that the coalition government should work
more effectively to implement the 18-point package to stem the
anti-regime activities of religious fundamentalist movements.
</P>
<P>
The package was made at a NSC meeting on February 28 under the
chairmanship of President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of deputies from the coalition junior partner True
Path Party (DYP) have urged the DYP to withdraw from the
government led by RP leader Necmettin Erbakan as the RP is
opposing secularism advocated by Mustafa Kemal, the founder of
the Republic of Turkey.

WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration and
Congress jointly launched a initiative today to promote trade and
investment, and catch the potential markets in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
In testimony at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich said that he agreed with President Bill
Clinton that their country needs a new economic policy towards the
sub-Sahara.
</P>
<P>
The "Partnership for Promoting Economic growth and Opportunity
in Africa," proposed by the Clinton administration emphasized
support for countries in the region that are trying to open their
markets.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said that the U.S. should lower taxes and increase
investment when developing economic and trade relations with the
area, which was regarded as one of the least developed regions in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the hearing, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky also stressed the importance of the region.
</P>
<P>
"In an increasingly competitive global economy, the United
States cannot afford to neglect a largely untapped market of
some 600-million-plus people, and the world cannot afford to see
a vast region marginalized, " she said.
</P>
<P>
Africa's share of trade in the world for the past 40 years had
declined from 3.1 percent to a 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky indicated that reduction of tariffs and other trade
barriers will help African nations to grow and will also "help
Americans by opening these markets to our goods and services."

<HEADLINE> Rubin Calls for Stronger Anti-Corruption Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) --The U.S. Secretary of Treasury
Robert Rubin called on other industrial countries today to make it
illegal for businessmen to claim tax deductions for bribes.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the 55th meeting of the joint Development
Committee of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), he also said the World Bank and other multilateral lending
organizations should halt funding when corruption is found and
tighten up foreign-aid contracts.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the 29-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD), which groups the industrialized countries,
should "support criminalization" of bribes when it meets in Paris
next month.
</P>
<P>
He also urged all countries that "continue to extend tax
deductibility (for bribes) to act expeditiously to eliminate the
practice."
</P>
<P>
The United States is one of the few countries with laws against
using bribes to advance business deals abroad, and prohibiting a
tax deduction for illegal payments after the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, passed in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said corruption undermines effective use of foreign aid,
encourages others to get involved and scares off foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the transfer of 300 million U.S. dollars from the
Bank's income to the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA), a division of the Bank that insures companies against
political risk in developing countries where they invest.
</P>
<P>
He said the step would promote a greater flow of private
capital to countries primarily dependent on the multilateral banks
and foreign aid from individual countries.

AMMAN -- Jordan and Canada signed a memorandum of understanding
here today on a Canadian grant of 2 million Canadian dollars
(about 1.43 million U.S. dollars) to finance King Hussein's 4-year
training project in the field of environment protection.
</P>
<P>
According to the Jordanian news agency, the project is an
extension of a previous program started in 1989 after King
Hussein's visit to Canada. It involved the training and promoting
of the capabilities of employees engaged in sustainable economic
development in Jordan, including mining, tourism and water.
</P>
<P>
The new project, however, aims at human development and
training to uplift Jordan's environmental management expertise.

<HEADLINE> E. African Leaders Satisfied with Progress in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Presidents Daniel arap Moi
of Kenya, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Benjamin Mkapa of
Tanzania today expressed their satisfaction that the one-year-old
East African Cooperation (EAC) was on the right path.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Daily News, the heads of state
painted a brighter future of their cooperation launched last year
when addressing a mammoth rally at Arusha, northern Tanzania
where they held the EAC second summit today.
</P>
<P>
"I have every confidence that this time round, we are walking
on the right path and the joint measures we are taking will
benefit our east African people even more," noted President Moi,
also the current Chairman of the EAC authority.
</P>
<P>
He said had the region known 20 years ago, when the
former East African Community collapsed, that the rest of the
world would be moving towards greater integration, it would not
have allowed the community to break up.
</P>
<P>
"Had the East African Community survived, we would, by now,
have made tremendous progress in economic development ahead of
any other economic bloc in the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moi called for strengthening the EAC Secretariat so that it
could enroll more staff to carry out its duties even if it meant
increasing its budget by a wider margin.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for participation of the private sector,
saying it should not be limited only to business activities.
</P>
<P>
"We expect them to form regional professional and business
associations in order to advise and influence future cooperation
policies," he told the rally.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan president expressed optimism that once the regional
grouping had achieved the desired economic integration, it was
his hope and dream that political federation for east Africa
would finally be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa noted that the achievements of the EAC so far and the
agreed plans for the future, were all proof that they had hit the
ground running.
</P>
<P>
"The achievements to date, and the plans for the future we have
agreed upon, are all proof that we have hit the ground runing and
that we are on the correct path," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the east Africans were once at a much higher level
of integration than they were now, and he expressed his hope that
they could still recapture the spirit.
</P>
<P>
"In fact we were far ahead of the European economic
integration process. Perhaps we can still recapture the spirit of
the 60s and early 70s and learn from the past errors," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He commended the east African businessmen for taking the
challenge of the EAC head on and striving deliberately to be
ahead of the three governments in translating the cooperation
into practical terms.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa hailed the political understanding between the three
countries, hoping that a political federation of east Africa
would one day come to reality.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said this time the east African heads of state were
not grouping in the dark in terms of regional integration.
</P>
<P>
He said the gradual steps the leaders were taking were steady
and would surely bear fruits in the future, adding that the
region's citizens should also strive for closer cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said the collapse of the East African Community in
1977 was due to lack of a sound local entrepreneurial and
business base, saying local businessmen were few at that time
and, therefore, did not form a large market.
</P>
<P>
"This time there is no faultering because we have many
well-to-do businessmen in the region who need an expanded market
for their commodities," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moi and Museveni left for their respective countries this
evening and Mkapa will leave Arusha for Dar es Salaam tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Southern Manitoba Hit by Century Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Over 25,000 Canadians have been
displaced by the worst flood in 171 years in the Red River Valley
of southern part of Manitoba province, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Ste. Agathe, a small town about 25 kilometers south of
Winnipeg, became today the first Canadian community to be
inundated by the Red River flood since its crest rolled over the
Canada-U.S. border last night.
</P>
<P>
Though there has been some injuries, the flood has so far
caused no human death, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The extensive floodwaters, called the Red Sea, stretches from
the border to the outskirts of Winnipeg and is 30 kilometers wide
in places.
</P>
<P>
The raging water swallowed up almost everything in its path as
it crossed North Dakota, the United States. But Emerson, the first
town in Canada to be hit by the crest of the flood, remained dry.
</P>
<P>
The province has declared a state of emergency and thousands of
Canadian Forces troops have arrived to help the Manitobans fight
the flood.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien inspected
part of the valley and promised federal aids to the flood-stricken
area.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- France's Socialist Party and
Communist Party today made a step closer to each other in
perspective of the coming legislative elections, but fell short of
calling for the establishment of a wide leftwing government if the
left wins the elections.
</P>
<P>
In a common declaration after a meeting, the Socialist Party
first secretary Lionel Jospin and Communist Party national
secretary Robert Hue called for the raise of consumption power of
the people, creating 700,000 jobs for the country's youths,
fighting unemployment, cutting weekly working hours, and stopping
privatization of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
But both of the two party leaders denied that the declaration
is equal to a common program for the elections or a program for
setting up a new government.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said that the leftist force of France is "pluralistic,"
although they are seeking "a movement of unitary dynamic" against
the center-right majority.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Communist Party members will join a new government
if the left wins the election, Hue said, "If a majority comes into
place on the basis of the general orientations elaborated together
(by the two parties), we will define the project of a possible
government."
</P>
<P>
The two parties also failed to agree to present common
candidates in the constituencies where the extreme-right National
Front party threatens to carry away the votes.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Accuses Foreign Countries of Supporting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Brigadier General Kenan
Deniz today accused several foreign countries of supporting the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing here, he said that Iran, Iraq, Syria,
Armenia, Greece, Cyprus and Bulgaria provide support for the PKK,
which stages armed attacks against civilian and military targets
in eastern and southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He added the PKK force has been reduced to "a controllable
level."
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a separatist war in southeastern
Turkey since 1984, in which more than 21,000 people, including PKK
rebels, civilians and government troops were killed.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant General Cetin Dogan said that a total of 32,000 PKK
militants have been disarmed since the beginning of the struggle
against the PKK.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued today by the office of the
Emergency Regional Rule, the Turkish security forces killed 27 PKK
rebels in recent military operations in Dargecit town of Mardin
province and in Ovacik town of Tunceli province in eastern and
southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Considering Sentence Disparity Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
says he is pleased the U.S. Sentencing Commission is asking
Congress to reduce the disparity between crack and powder cocaine
penalties.
</P>
<P>
Under the current law, a federal conviction for possession of
five grams of crack, a concentrated form of cocaine, or 500 grams
of powder cocaine brings the same five-year mandatory prison
sentence.
</P>
<P>
The 100-1 ratio for the same sentence has prompted some critics
to say the federal sentencing guidelines are racist.
</P>
<P>
Crack cocaine is associated with mostly black inner cities,
with 90 percent of all sentenced offenders being black, while
powder cocaine use is associated more with white suburbs or white
urban professionals.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced he has asked Attorney General Janet Reno and
White House anti-drug czar Barry McCaffrey to review the
recommendations and report back to him in 60 days.
</P>
<P>
In releasing its report to Congress today, the commission, an
independent agency of the federal courts, offered a range of
choices.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Doctor Defies Armed Robbers, Kills 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A doctor here showed rare courage
at the weekend when he defied six armed robbers and killed two of
them in a fierce shoot-out, the News Agency of Nigeria reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The robbers carrying locally made handguns, daggers and other
weapons, forced into the compound in Isolo area where the doctor
lives and ordered him to open his door.
</P>
<P>
Instead of obeying the robbers' orders, the doctor brought out
his double-barrel gun and fired at the robbers, killing two
instantly while the rest fled.
</P>
<P>
The robbers had earlier attacked a tenant in the same compound
and took away 7,000 Naira (about 80 U.S. Dollars), the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The police later found 15 shell cartridges and the bodies of
the two dead robbers at the scene, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The police also found that the doctor's house was severely
damaged with windows, doors and walls shattered in the gunfire.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman has commended the doctor for his courage,
lamenting that the "lack of response by law-abiding citizens is
what gives armed gangs to attack with impunity", the report said.
</P>
<P>
The doctor was not identified by the report.

YAOUNDE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A mission set up at the
presidency of Cameroun delivered large quantities of medicines to
the conflict-suffering people in the Bakassi peninsula from April
22 to 26, local radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more food were also handed over to 1000 affected
people there.
</P>
<P>
Some of them are reportedly suffering from skin diseases and
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Prime Minister's Office, the
move is part of the ongoing assistance program launched three
months ago by the Camerounian government.
</P>
<P>
It marks the end of the first phase which included the
distribution of money and tons of food.
</P>
<P>
The phase two, including constructions of roads, hospitals,
houses and schools, will start soon.
</P>
<P>
The government will also provide engine boats, seeds and
fishing materials to help the displaced and other people to make

</P>
<P>
The oil-rich Bakassi peninsula has become a trouble point

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with U.S. National Security
Adviser Samuel Berger at the White House today.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen told Berger that China attaches great importance to
the relations between China and the United States and he believed
the United States will share with China the same goal: to further
improve the Sino-U.S. relationship to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Mutual state visits by Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S.
President Bill Clinton will mark that level, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China and the United States can strengthen their
cooperation in various areas, especially in that of energy and
cooperation on hydro power and nuclear power projects has even
greater potentialities.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen hoped that the Clinton administration can authorize
implementation of a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement signed
by the two countries in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen also explained China's position on Taiwan and Hong
Kong and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Berger said the foundation for the Sino-U.S. relations has been
further consolidated as a result of the efforts contributed to by
the two countries since last year.
</P>
<P>
He agreed that both sides should work together to raise the
level of relations to a new level without creating new obstacles
on their way forward because it is in accordance with the
strategic interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the mutual state visits of the two leaders are the most
important event in the bilateral relations over the past 10 years
and "we will make full preparations" for their successful visits.
</P>
<P>
Berger also expressed his hope that the United States and China
will strengthen their cooperation and dialogue over regional as
well as world issues.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that the United States continues its commitment
to the One-China policy.

<HEADLINE> Cameroun Tries to Curb Spread of AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Cameroun's Minister of
Public Health Charles Etoundi said here today the increasing
number of AIDS cases in the country has made the disease become
the government's preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when presiding over a meeting between the
U.N. agencies concerned and the National Committee for the Fight
Against AIDS in Cameroun.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 people from U.N. agencies fighting AIDS,
non-governmental groups and other bodies took part in the meeting
aimed at redefining strategies and collecting opinions on how to
better manage the "Fight Against AIDS Program" in Cameroun.
</P>
<P>
The program was launched in 1993 and sponsored by the U.N.
agencies.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the minister warned that by 2000, 200,000 AIDS
cases might be officially declared in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said although the government has taken measures to improve
the situation, there is still more to be done.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS prevalence in Cameroun, with a population of 13
million, was up to 5.5 percent last year from 4.8 percent in
1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 90 percent of the HIV infections are through sexual
contacts, Camerounians should change their sexual habits so as
to stop the spread of the HIV, which causes AIDS, he urged.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed for the U.N. agencies to continue their
support for Cameroun's anti-AIDS program. enditem

<HEADLINE> BA to Switch Airports in Paris After Security Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- British Airways (BA) plans to
switch all its Paris services from Charles de Gaulle airport to
Orly following a security row with the French authorities, it
announced today.
</P>
<P>
The airline said in a statement that the move is in protest at
Air Algerie, an alleged terrorist target, being given a check-in
desk next to its own at the airport.
</P>
<P>
"The airline has tonight applied to the French aviation
authority for approval to move its entire operations to nearby
Orly from Thursday in a bid to end disruption for thousands of
passengers," it said.
</P>
<P>
BA said that after weeks of lobbying it has failed to convince
the French authorities to increase security at the airport and
that it has no alternative but to look at shifting its entire
operation to Paris' other major airport until it is satisfied with
the security procedures at Charles de Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that up to 60 services a day involving 60,000
passengers will be affected by the move and the airline has also
appealed to the UK government to intervene in the row.

<HEADLINE> Cross-Border Alliances Surge: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Companies participating in
cross-border alliances, which have increased sharply, enjoy much
greater returns on equity and investment than firms that choose to
work alone, according to a new study released by a new report
available here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 15,000 alliances were formed across international
borders in the two year period between mid-1994 and mid-1996, 75
percent of the total of all corporate alliances, according to
Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton. The global management consulting firm is
holding a seminar jointly with the Conference Board, another major
research group here, in Manhattan today and Wednesday on the
subject of global alliances.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the 6,000 alliances formed by U.S.-based
companies in that time have come across borders, the company
reported.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, the number of alliances by U.S. companies increased
at an annual rate of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Alliances are now a central, essential and permanent engine to
achieve growth," said John Harbison, vice president for Booz-Allen
&AMP; Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
Increasing numbers of companies are pursuing alliances due to
the globalization of markets, the blurring of industry boundaries,
scarce resources and intensifying competition.
</P>
<P>
Global alliances can provide growth at a smaller cost because
they lower investment risks, leverage resources and enhance
efficiency and productivity of existing assets, according to
researchers.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which covered 5,500 alliances and more than 500
companies, found that the average return on investment from
strategic alliances is more than 40 percent higher than the
average return the same corporations earn on other investment
activities.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed that worldwide alliance formations cover
diversed areas such as health services, transportation, energy,
consumer products and even local businesses such as electrical
utilities and telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
Alliances often bring together companies that compete, the
report said, in ways that benefit both companies as well as their
customers. An analysis of 2,000 alliances in the past two years
showed that 52 percent were between competitors.
</P>
<P>
According to the researchers, U.S. companies lag behind
European and Asian counterparts both in alliance magnitude and in
alliance skills. "U.S. firms will need to close their skill gaps
in order to become effective global partners and winners in the
global age of collaboration," said John Harbison.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Calls for Earlier Solution to Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan today called on both leaders of the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities to work with him for an
earlier end to the long division in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief, who was visiting Atlanta, Georgia, told
reporters that he had met both President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
"If all goes well, in June I would expect to have a
face-to-face meeting. We would invite the two leaders. I would
open the meeting," Annan said during a global forum organized by
the CNN cable news network.
</P>
<P>
"I do hope that the two leaders will come prepared to work with
me to resolve this long-standing conflict," the secretary-general
added.
</P>
<P>
The eastern Mediterranean island has been virtually divided
into two parts since 1974 when troops from Turkey took over the
northern part after a brief coup in Nicosia backed by the then
junta in Greece. The United Nations has been mediating for more
than two decades to reunite Cyprus under a federal system.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that if he could not chair the face-to-face meeting
between the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities,
his recently appointed special adviser Diego Cordovez would do it.
</P>
<P>
"If the June talks go well, we would hope to have two more
sessions and hopefully have a clear indication by August or
September whether we are going to make real progress or not," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general's spokesman Fred Eckhard told reporters
in New York that representatives of the five permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council were meeting later at U.N. headquarters
to discuss the long-standing Cyprus problem.

<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Personalities of various circles
in Beijing took a last look this morning at Wu Zuoren, an
outstanding Chinese painter and fine arts educator, at the
Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who passed away on April 10 at the age of 89, lay among
flowers, covered with a satin quilt elaborately embroidered by his
wife Xiao Shufang, also a leading painter.
</P>
<P>
Wu devoted all his life to painting, and art research and
training. He made irreplaceable contributions to Chinese fine
arts and art education.
</P>
<P>
He had held many leading posts, including vice-chairman of the
Central Advisory Committee of the China Democratic League,
chairman of the Chinese Artists Association and president of the
Central Institute of Arts.
</P>
<P>
Wu, born into a poor family in Suzhou, in east China's Jiangsu

Belgium to study art, graduating from Belgium's Royal Institute of
Fine Arts with honors in 1935.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes U.N. Coordination on Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides today welcomed as a "good development" the U.N. Security
Council effort to coordinate action on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here, Clerides was commenting on
Tuesday's meeting on Cyprus of the five permanent members of the
Security Council and representatives of the U.N. Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The meeting called upon Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash to cooperate fully with the U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and to help create a climate of reconciliation and
mutual confidence, so as to promote the holding of direct
negotiations within the next two or three months.
</P>
<P>
"I can see, for the first time, an effort of coordination by
the Security Council, something that was not present in the
past. This is a good development," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted "I believe this coordination should not only
continue but be strengthened."
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the U.N. chief's appeal to both sides to
show good-will, Clerides said "we will continue to show our
good-will."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government announced last week that Greek warplanes
will suspend flying over Cyprus during the forthcoming joint
military exercises as a good-will gesture for the sake of the
U.N-led proximity talks between the two sides on the island.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Resident Representative Gustave Feissel is currently
conducting proximity talks between Clerides and Denktash in an
attempt to prepare the ground for a further face-to-face
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish Troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> ESCAP Urged to Chart Its Future Work Direction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Ministers of Asian and Pacific
countries and regions today suggested that the United Nations
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)
should "consider developing a framework to chart the direction of
its future work on development cooperation in the region in the
21st century."
</P>
<P>
A resolution adopted today, the last day of the three-day
ministerial segment of the 53rd annual commission session of
ESCAP, said ESCAP member governments felt that the work of ESCAP
remained indispensable to the region's social and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
However, they also found it "necessary for the organization to
adjust to the emerging new realities in the region and to give its
activities a sharper focus in order to address the changing needs
of members and associate members," totaling 60.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that the commission called upon ESCAP "to
continue to accord high priority to the integration of the least
developed countries, the Pacific island economies and the
economies in transition into the regional flows of trade and
investment."
</P>
<P>
The commission also urged "the developed and the more dynamic
countries of the region to promote private capital flows to those
disadvantaged groups of countries within the context of industrial
restructuring and relocation."
</P>
<P>
Participants in the commission session also urged ESCAP to
provide policy guidance to developing members and associate
members to deal with the challenges and opportunities arising from
globalization and liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The commission took note of "a general trend towards the
creation of a multipolar system in international relations and a
growing interest among the Asian and Pacific countries in the
harmonization of ties between nations, based on genuine equality
and respect for mutual interests in order to solve global and
regional problems."
</P>
<P>
Taking note of major success in economic growth and social
progress, participants also pointed out, "the region still had
many obstacles and challenges. Economic growth in the past had not
benefited all sections of society; large inequities in income
distribution persisted and were even widening; poverty remained a
major problem and two-thirds of the poor of the developing
countries lived in the ESCAP region. It was thus evident that
growth in itself was not enough."
</P>
<P>
The ministers also pointed out, "growth had to be pursued in a
sustainable manner. Rising demand for food, water, energy and
other resources and the spread of environmental pollution were
threatening the region's sustainable development. Unevenness in
economic growth, prevailing poverty, a weak scientific and
technological foundation, and backward infrastructure were
problems commonly shared by many developing countries in the
region."
</P>
<P>
The commission held the view that, "in addition to improved
commercial facilities to the least developed and other
disadvantaged groups of economies in the region, increased
concessional resource flows and debt relief were of crucial
importance in promoting the integration of those economies into
the world economy," said the resolution, titled "policy issues:
Asia and the Pacific into the 21st century -- opportunities and
challenges for the ESCAP region."

<HEADLINE> Constraints Show in EC Draft Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC),
the executive body of the European Union (EU), proposes a modest
2.9 percent increase in EU spending in its 1998 preliminary draft
budget which was adopted today.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget sets commitment appropriations of 91.307
billion European currency units (104.09 billion U.S. dollars) for
next year, and payment appropriations of 84.727 billion ECUs
(96.589 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
That is 2.4 percent more than this year's commitment
appropriations of 89.137 billion ECUs (101.616 billion dollars)
and 2.9 percent more than this year's payment appropriations of
82.366 billion ECUs (93.897 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The dose of austerity, for a second year running, is believed
to be due to budgetary constraints weighing on member states in
the run-up to European Economic and Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation EU is set to launch a single currency on January
1, 1999, and the first wave of countries qualified for it will be
determined later this year.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 budget is to be finally endorsed by the European
Parliament in December, after two formal readings by the EU
Council of Ministers of Finance, in July and November.
</P>
<P>
The budget proposes 40.987 billion ECUs (46.725 billion
dollars) in agricultural spending, and 4.331 billion ECUs (4.937
billion dollars) in administrative spending.
</P>
<P>
The draft also plans to invest 5.629 billion ECUs (6.417
billion dollars) in internal policies, expanding funds on research
and development, trans-European networks and small and
medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The budget earmarks 5.624 billion ECUs (6.411 billion dollars)
for external relations, most going to the Eastern Europe and
Mediterranean third countries. It provides humanitarian aid to
countries in need, and for help in reconstructing the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It also recommends a financial package of 1.3 billion ECUs
(1.482 billion dollars) to help cope with the mad cow disease
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The budget puts greater emphasis on training and education,
cooperation in justice and home affairs, consumer protection and
the environment.

<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Double Olympic
champion Liu Guoliang beat former world champion Jean-Philippe
Gatien, anchoring China to a 3-1 final victory at the World Table
Tennis Championships here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Liu used his wickedly deceptive serves and
merciless follow-up attacks to defeat the Frenchman 21-19, 21-14
in the fourth game, securing China's 12th Swaythling Cup for the
men's team championship.
</P>
<P>
China's world No. 1 Kong Linghui won the opening game as he
outlasted 1993 world champion Gatien in three sets.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Kong, who edged out Gatien 3-2 en route to
winning the 1995 men's singles championship and beat the Frenchman
in the World Cup four months later, triumphed 18-21, 21-16, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
Gatien, who has regained the best form after winning the
European Top 12 in February, overpowered Kong with devastating
forehand attacks in the first set.
</P>
<P>
Kong, who trailed all the way until he equalized 13-all,
changed the tactics and often hit the ball to the right wing of
left-handed Gatien, whose backhands notoriously lack precision.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese turned up the heat after taking the second set,
outplayed Gatien with ferocious forehands and solid defence,
winning the deciding set 21-17.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Chila evened the score for France as he beat Liu
Guoliang in the second rubber.
</P>
<P>
The 17th-ranked Chila, who had lost to Liu in the World Cup
last year, controlled the game with clever returns to Liu's
deceptive serves and strong topspin forehands, winning the second
rubber 21-17, 15-21, 21-10.
</P>
<P>
Chinese veteran Wang Tao put China 2-1 up as he won the third
game against Frenchman Damien Eloi.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Wang, who had edged out Eloi in five sets at
the last world championships, won the game 21-10, 31-29 as his
variation of spin and speed proved too much for the 29th-ranked
Frenchman.
</P>
<P>
Eloi made a tenacious comeback in the second game, winning five
points in a row to level the score at 20-all, and then extended
Wang to 29-29.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman played an air shot on Wang's tricky serve and
then returned into the net to concede the match point.
</P>
<P>
China reached the final after beating Sweden in the
quarter-finals and South Korea in the semis.
</P>
<P>
France made the history as it reached its first-ever world
championship final by outlasting Germany 3-2 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, South Korea beat Germany 3-0 to win the third
place.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Attacks EU for Playing Childish Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today criticized the European countries for embarking
on childish games.
</P>
<P>
"Iran had long ago stopped critical dialog with the member
states of the European Union (EU)," said the Iranian president
while addressing the first conference on energy.
</P>
<P>
Suspension of the critical dialogue between EU and Iran is
one of the latest decisions made by the EU member states at the
ministerial meeting concluded in Luxembourg Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU also decided to stop the ministerial level contact
between the two sides and continue its arm embargo on Iran.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that the critical dialog, which the Europeans
considered its termination as an achievement for themselves, had
long been non-existent as a result of pressures exerted by Iran.
</P>
<P>
The critical dialogue was initially meant to enable Iran to
express its criticism of certain European countries, but was
later cut off by Iran due to the EU's failure to answer Iranian
questions on various issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Europeans launched propaganda campaign against Iran and
embarked on childish games and at the end they became ashamed and
held up their hands," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president claimed that "this is an indication of Iran's
real might."
</P>
<P>
"This is a shame for those countries which entered into this
game and then admitted that there was nothing in it," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran has been critical of the European countries
for their performance over some issues.
</P>
<P>
One of the questions posed by Iran within the framework of
the critical dialogue was the EU's involvement in providing
nuclear weapons to Israel and chemical weapons to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Other matter for which Iran criticized Europe in its
critical dialogue was prevalence of racism in European
countries. They regard themselves to be of a superior race and
for this reason their behavior is like that of Israel. They
consider other people to be inferior," the president noted.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The wounded Tajik President,
Emomali Rakhmonov, strongly condemned the terrorist attack in
northern Tajikistan early today which killed two people and
injured 49, including the president.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist action "was conducted by some individuals and
agent provocateurs who will be punished," said Rakhmonov, several
hours after the grenade attack, a plot to assassinate him, in the
town of Khudjand, Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov, 44, was wounded in the leg, and his life was not in
danger, his press secretary Zafar Saidov said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the regional theater of Khudjand, the president
expressed deep sorrow for the two dead -- a 17-year-old student
and a woman teacher at the local university.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred at 10:30 a.m. local time (0530 GMT) when a
lone assailant hurled a grenade after Rakhmonov had got out of his
car and was heading to a theater for celebrations marking the 65th
anniversary of the Khudjand University.
</P>

The grenade landed near the president and other local leaders
when they were only a few steps from the entrance to the theater,

<HEADLINE> Greater Care Needed for Disabled People: official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China must include work for the
disabled in its general plan for economic and social development,
a government official urged today.
</P>
<P>
China has scored certain achievements in helping disabled
people, Peng Peiyun, a state councillor and head of a State
Council committee in charge of work for the disabled, told a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"However, to promote our work in this regard, we must include
the work in our general plan for economic and social development,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Peng acknowledged that there still exist many difficulties in
work for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
Deng Pufang, chairman of the China Disabled Persons'
Federation, gave an account of China's progress in this field.
</P>
<P>
He said that a total of 257,000 cataract operations were
performed last year, the first year of a program to advance the
cause of the disabled during the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Also last year, Deng added, 13,000 deaf children were trained,
and 24 million iodine-deficient people got iodine supplements.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that 51,000 crippled limbs were corrected and 114
schools especially for the disabled were built last year, bringing
to 1,493 the number of such schools.
</P>
<P>
China also set up 610 occupational training agencies for the
disabled last year, with 274,000 people trained in the same year,
according to Deng.
</P>
<P>
He said that obligatory proportional employment of disabled
people is now practiced in 226 Chinese cities and 812 counties,
with a total of 162,000 disabled people employed in the urban
areas last year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some 93 percent of the Chinese counties and cities
and 72 percent of townships and towns have drawn up regulations on
assisting the disabled, Deng said.
</P>
<P>
It was decided at today's meeting that a national meeting will
be held on May 13 to commend collective units and individuals who
have made outstanding contributions to helping disabled people,
who currently number 60 million in China.

<HEADLINE> HK Deposits, Loans, Advances Down in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's deposits, loans and
advances decreased in March, partly due to the high base of
comparison in February, according to figures published today by
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).
</P>
<P>
Total deposits fell by 1.3 percent in March, reversing the rise
of 2.8 percent in February. Both HK dollar deposits and foreign
currency deposits dropped, by 2.2 percent and 0.1 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The decline in HK dollar deposits was across-the-board,
including demand, savings and time deposits.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, total loans and advances fell by 2.5 percent
in March, reversing the rise of 2.6 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by currency, both HK dollar loans and foreign currency
loans fell during the month, by 1.4 percent and 3.2 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
As the decline in HK dollar loans was more moderate than that
of HK dollar deposits, the currency's loan-to-deposit ratio edged
up to 109.1 percent at the end of March, from 108.2 percent at the
end of February.

<HEADLINE> HK to Remain International Center of Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will remain an
international center of finance and the best platform for
companies wanting to do business in the Asia-Pacific, said John
Bond, chief executive of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation (HSBC) plc.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the key-note address at a seminar -- Hong Kong at
the Heart of Asia's Finance, he said that he believed Hong Kong
matches the criteria he had listed better than any other financial
center in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council (TDC) in London Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the future, he said that the Basic Law for the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) ensures that after July
1, 1997, the HKSAR Government on its own will formulate monetary
and financial policies, safeguard the free operation of financial
business and financial markets and regulate them in accordance
with law.
</P>
<P>
"I do not know of any other place in the world that has an
international treaty and constitution that explicitly guarantees
its position as an international center of finance into the next
century," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the message today is twofold: first, have confidence
in Hong Kong because of our track record and because we have
confidence in ourselves. Second, there will be a lot of
opportunities opening up over the next 10 years, and Hong Kong
makes sense if you are looking for a financial partner in Asia."
</P>
<P>
According to the TDC, Hong Kong is currently the second largest
banking center in Asia, and is host to 85 of the world's top 100
banks in terms of capitalization.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Party Denies French Oil Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
party today angrily denied French news reports that it had
received millions of dollars in illicit payments from the French
oil company, Elf-Aquitaine.
</P>
<P>
"This is an especially vicious rumor, ... an ugly fabrication
in which there is nothing," said Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
General Secretary Peter Hintze.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the CDU had never received money,
directly or indirectly, from Elf-Aquitaine. The allegations were
probably an attempt to undermine the good Franco-German relations
in the run-up to French general elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
The French newspaper Le Parisien reported on Tuesday that
Elf-Aquitaine had paid 13.5 million marks (about 7.8 million U.S.
dollars) in commissions for the purchase of former East Germany's
state-owned "Minol" gas station chain, and the takeover of the
Leuna refinery in eastern Saxony-Anhalt state after the 1990
German reunification.
</P>
<P>
A large part of the money went to Germany and was meant for the
CDU, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The French news magazine, Le Nouvel Observateur, also reported
that the money had been used to help finance Kohl's 1994
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Under German law, all contributions to political parties over
20,000 marks must be made public.

<HEADLINE> China, France One-all in Men's Team Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Patrick Chila evened
the score at 1-1 for France as he beat double Olympic champion Liu
Guoliang at the men's team final of the World Table Tennis
Championships here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 17th-ranked Frenchman, who had lost to Liu in the World Cup
last year, controled the game with clever returns to Liu's
deceptive serves and strong topspin forehands, winning the second
rubber 21-17, 15-21, 21-10.
</P>
<P>
World No. 1 Kong Linghui had put the defending champion China
one up after beating Jean-Philippe Gatien in the opening game.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Kong, who edged out 1993 world champion Gatien
3-2 en route to winning the men's singles championship and beat
the Frenchman again in the World Cup in 1995, took the opening
game 18-21, 21-16, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
Gatien, who has regained the best form after winning the
European Top 12 in February, overpowered Kong with devastating
forehand attacks in the first set.
</P>
<P>
Kong, who trailed all the way until he evened the score at
13-13, changed the tactics and often hit the ball to the right
wing of left-handed Gatien, whose backhands notoriously lack
precision.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese turned up the heat after taking the second set,
outplayed Gatien with ferocious forehands and solid defence,
winning the deciding set 21-17.
</P>
<P>
Chinese veteran Wang Tao, ranked sixth in the world, plays
against Damien Eloi in the third game. Wang had ousted the
Frenchman in five sets in the last world championships.
</P>
<P>
Kong, reigning world singles champion, will confront with Chila
in the fifth game if both make that far.
</P>
<P>
Kong had downed Chila in a group match at the 1996 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
China, which has won the Swaythling Cup for the men's team
championship for 12 times, reached the final after beating Sweden
in the quarter-finals and South Korea in the semis.
</P>
<P>
France made the history as it reached its first-ever world
championship final by outlasting Germany 3-2 on Tuesday
semifinal.

SHENZHEN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The animal and plant quarantine
departments are to withdraw tomorrow from the Man Kam To and Sha
Tau Kok ports of entry, paving the way for further simplification
of procedures at ports of entry in this, China's first special
economic zone.
</P>
<P>
The border quarantine offices have been withdrawn from the

<P>
The city put forward a pilot reform plan for its port
management system, which has been approved by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
From tomorrow, drivers coming and going through the ports of
entry will not have to stop for the checks they had to undergo
four times before. Instead, they will fill in declaration forms
for the vehicles and goods concerned before exit and entry,
getting ready for spot checks.
</P>
<P>
Drivers and owners of plants and vegetable products are
required to pass check procedures beforehand. The animal
quarantine departments will increase checks at port of entry areas
and cargo destinations.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has three land ports of entry, handling more than
eight million vehicles annually, accounting for 70 percent of the
country's total.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Presidents' Summit for America's Future closed in
Philadelphia Tuesday as it began, with a dizzling mixture of good
intentions, high-wattage celebrity and hyperbolic rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
-- After months of internal debate, the U.S. Sentencing
Commission recommended Tuesday that the wide gap between penalties
for crack and powder cocaine crimes be reduced, saying the current
stiffer crack punishments "cannot be justified."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The authorities said they were highly hopeful of arranging a
peaceful surrender by the militant Texas group that took two
hostages three days ago. But many of the 80 neighbors forced from
their homes by the standoff angrily demanded that the state move
against the group.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Defense Secretary William Cohen said additional base closing
may be among the recommendations of a Pentagon review now under
way, saying troop strength has fallen in recent years and may
continue to do so. The U.S. has already closed 97 major bases
since 1988, and an early reaction in Congress suggests more
closing would face resistance.
</P>
<P>
USA Today:
</P>
<P>
-- A star witness in the Oklohoma City bombing trial Tuesday
described how an angry Timothy McVeigh disclosed his plan to
destroy the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The stock market scored a near-record gain Tuesday on news
that labor costs remain low despite strong wage growth, spurring
hopes that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates
again.

<HEADLINE> Random Drug Testing to Be Held in HK's Pro Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's professional
football players could face random drug testing next season, the
Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA) has ruled.
</P>
<P>
The sport's local governing body came to the decision after the
Asian Football Confederation (AFC) called last Saturday its member
associations to fight against drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
The AFC had encouraged its memberships to start random doping
tests on players in their respective leagues, especially those on
the Olympics and the World Cup squads.
</P>
<P>
And the AFC officials said the organization's medical committee
would formulate rules and regulations for doping tests.
</P>
<P>
HKFA Chairman Victor Hui said that by the latest decision on
drug testing, the association is supporting the AFC on the
anti-drug battle.
</P>
<P>
But Hui said details of the plan are yet to be discussed and
finalized and he did not expect a large-size doping test program
due to HKFA's limited resources and staffing.
</P>
<P>
HKFA Secretary-General Vincent Yuen said random doping tests
might be arranged for all domestic games.

<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) said here today that the CPC is
willing to reinforce its relations with the New Korea Party (NKP),
the ruling party of the Republic of Korea (ROK), in a bid to
further the good-neighborly relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, a standing committee member of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee and a member of the Secretariat of
the CPC Central Committee, met with an NKP delegation here today.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years since China and the ROK established
diplomatic relations, bilateral ties have witnessed smooth
progress, and the two nations' co-operation in various fields has
reaped encouraging results, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the establishment of long-term good-neighborly
relations between the two countries accords with the fundamental
interests of the two nations, and benefits peace and stability on
the Korean peninsula and even Asia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The CPC is willing to make its relations with the NKP closer,
based on the principles of independence, equality, mutual-respect
and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, in an
effort to promote the co-operative ties between the two countries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The NKP delegation is led by Lee Sai Ji, a former member of
the NKP's Party Affairs Committee, member of the ROK National
Assembly and ROK National Assembly secretary-general in charge of
culture, sports and news.
</P>
<P>
The ROK pays close attention to China's development, and the NKP,
while emphasizing its friendly co-operation with the CPC, is
willing to contribute more to the promotion of friendship and
coordination between the two countries, said Lee.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived here earlier today at the invitation of
the CPC.

BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- France's L'Oreal, one of the
world's leading beauty products companies, has announced that it
will increase its investment in China to get a bigger part of
China's make-up business.
</P>
<P>
L'Oreal now has 12 percent of the world's cosmetics market, and
has been exploring the Chinese market since the '80s, and intends
to improve its business in this market, which has great potential,
according to Paolo Gasparrini, general manager of L'Oreal China.
</P>
<P>
In China L'Oreal still faces stiff competition from such
well-known cosmetics companies as the US's P&AMP;G, Estee Lauder, and
Avon, Britain's Unilever, and Japan's Shiseido, said Gasparrini.
</P>
<P>
It has cooperated with the Suzhou Medical College in east
China's Jiangsu Province, setting up a joint venture in 1996 to
produce Maybelline products, the big name American company that
was purchased by L'Oreal.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Macao trade unions will make
further contributions to a stable transition in Macao by working
in cooperation with the government and all walks of life, a top
trade union leader said today.
</P>
<P>
Pun Hun Veng, chairman of the Macao Federation of Trade
Unions, said in a gathering marking the May 1 International Labor
Day that trade unions in Macao are concerned not only in workers'
life, but a stable transition in the territory.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the government to take effective measures as soon as
possible to improve public security environment so that a stable
transition can be achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
A wave of triad-related violence has jolted the territory since
 late last year, causing great concern among local citizens. Local
 security authorities have vowed to curb the spread of organized
crimes and launched several major attacks so far.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the trade union chairman urged the government to
help create more job opportunities to ease the pressure of a high
jobless rate.
</P>
<P>
"Unemployment has become an outstanding social problem," he
said, blaming a continuous economic slowdown in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the government will take concrete actions to help the
unemployed find new jobs, and improve workers' living standard,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Soares Monge, secretary for security of the Macao
government, attended today's reception on behalf of the governor
who is on a visit to Brazil. Other celebrities included Wang

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Lennox Lewis will defense his
first WBC heavyweight title against unbeaten Henry Akinwande on
July 12 in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
Lewis' manager Frank Maloney and Akinwande's promoter Don King
decided changed the site from London to New Jersey after lengthy
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Frank Maloney said Wednesday that Lewis is expected to earn 5.2
million U.S. dollars from the fight.
</P>
<P>
Lewis, 30-1, won the title February 7 in Las Vegas when the
referee stopped the fight after a seemingly confused Oliver McCall
threw only two punches in the fourth round and one in the
fifth. Lewis' only previous loss was to McCall.
</P>
<P>
Akinwande, who has relinquished his WBO title to fight Lewis,
has 32 wins, no losses and one draw. He was ranked fourth by the
WBC behind Lewis, McCall and Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
Akinwande was awarded the mandatory challenge because he was
the highest available contender since Tyson is to fight WBA
champion Evander Holyfield in a rematch June 28.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Portuguese Coordinating Group Established </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The first meeting of the
Sino-Portuguese coordinating group on Macao-Mainland large capital
construction projects was held here today.
</P>
<P>
Xie Houhe, group leader of the Chinese side, said the
convocation of the meeting means the formal establishment of the
group responsible to coordinate large-scale capital construction
between Macao and China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
If necessary, the group can exchange views on other important
issues regarding economic relations between Macao and the inland
areas.
</P>
<P>
Both Macao and the inland areas are close in economic ties and
have advantages in their economic growth. They are now drawing up
plans and engaged in infrastructure construction in order to
improve their environment for investment.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Portuguese governments decided to set up the
group through friendly consultations and earnest preparations for
the purpose of avoiding overlapping construction and reducing the
waste of resources.
</P>
<P>
Leonel Miranda is a group leader of the Portuguese side.
</P>
<P>
Xie said at today's meeting that during the past ten years
since China and Portugal signed the Joint Declaration on the
Question of Macao in April 1987, Macao's society has been stable
and its economy has been growing. One of the main reasons is that
the two countries have cooperated well.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the group represents another example of
Sino-Portuguese friendly cooperation, which will surely exert a
far-reaching influence on their economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xie said the Chinese side is closely following Macao's economic
growth. In the past, "we rendered assistance to Macao in many
aspects including the construction of the Macao International
Airport. In the future we will continue to give necessary
assistance and help to it within our ability".
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the two sides issued a press communique.

today to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia, China's first provincial-level autonomous

scored great achievements in economy, culture, education and
public health, the participants agreed.
</P>
<P>
The Region has contrived a series of effective measures and
ways to promote the autonomy of minority nationalities, foster
cadres from among ethnic minorities, advance democratic reforms in
pastoral areas and develop animal husbandry, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia has thus provided valuable experience for the
establishment and development of the other autonomous areas of
different ethnic groups in China, the forum participants said.

city of Dalian in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Dalian Mayor Bo Xilai met with Goh Chok Tong and briefed him on
the city's situation. The Singaporean prime minister said that
Dalian has witnessed a rapid economic growth and stressed economic
cooperation with foreign countries.

Goh said he hopes that the Singaporean business people
accompanying him on his China trip will find more opportunities
here.
</P>
<P>
Governor of northeast China's Liaoning province Wen Shizhen

time to visit Dalian from his tight schedule demonstrates the
importance placed by Singapore to advancing its cooperation with
the province and the city.

Although Liaoning and Singapore have had successful cooperation
in recent years, Wen said, there is still potential yet to be
tapped.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Opens New Cross-Harbor Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Western Harbor Tunnel
(WHT), Hong Kong's largest cross-harbor tunnel constructed between
Sai Ying Pun and the West Kowloon Reclamation, officially opened
to public traffic today, three months ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Being Hong Kong's first dual 3-lane harbor tunnel, the WHT
increases Hong Kong's combined cross-harbor tunnel capacity by 75
percent.
</P>
<P>
It will also help significantly reduce traffic congestion at
the two existing tunnels and in the urban areas adjacent to them
since queues cause serious interference with non-tunnel traffic in
rush hours.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the new tunnel said that the tunnel's practical
capacity is 180,000 vehicles a day, 50 percent greater than each
of the existing tunnels. This is sufficient to support predicted
traffic levels and is intended to meet Hong Kong's cross-harbor
transport needs well into the 21st century, he added.
</P>
<P>
With a total cost of 7.5 billion HK dollars (962 million US
dollars), the 2-km tunnel connects the major population centers
of Hong Kong with the container ports in Kwai Chung, the new
airport at Chek Lap Kok, and opens up the Northwestern "New
Territories" and then connects with the new super-highway to
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
This is the second major traffic infrastructure Hong Kong
completed this week. On Sunday Hong Kong opened its Tsing Ma
Bridge -- the world's longest suspension bridge carrying both
road and rail traffic.

HAIKOU, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
has called on officials of China's special economic zones (SEZ) to
speed up reforms and expand their exemplary role in experimenting
with China's economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Li made the call in a special letter written to a national SEZ
forum held in Qionghai City, south China's Hainan Province, from
April 23 to 24.
</P>
<P>
Leading local officials from China's five special economic
zones of Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Xiamen, Shantou, Hainan, as well as
Pudong New Area of Shanghai, attended the two-day forum which was
sponsored by the SEZ Affairs Office of the State Council, the
country's highest governing body.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier also urged participants to concentrate their
energy on working out ways for acquiring new experience under
the new situation, and to advance economic restructuring, foster
main local industrial businesses that cater to their respective
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Li asked participants to pay special attention to the
development of high-tech-intensive industrial sectors and to
strive to improve the efficiency and standard of the
export-oriented economy, so as to enhance their respective
competitiveness on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Information from the forum disclosed that last year, the five
SEZ generated 215.5 billion yuan of gross domestic product (GDP),
a rise of 14.3 percent over 1995, or five percentage points more
than the national average growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Pudong New Area also generated 51.02 billion yuan of GDP in

<HEADLINE> Thailand Lowers Economic Growth Predictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has revised the
country's economic growth forecast for 1997 from 7.1 percent to
6.6 percent, and the current account deficit from 7.7 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) to 6.7 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Forecasts made late last year had projected economic growth for
1997 at 7.1 percent, but the figure was later revised downward to
6.8 percent, following the government's decision to make deep
fiscal budget cuts worth 59 billion baht (2.36 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's economic growth was 6.8 percent, the
current account deficit was about 8.3 percent of GDP, and
inflation was 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The National Economic and Social Development Board, the
country's economic and social planning agency, expected that the
current account deficit and inflation situation will be eased this
year.
</P>
<P>
While current account deficit is expected to drop one
percentage point from the forecast made late last December, from
7.7 percent of GDP down to 6.7 percent of GDP, inflation is also
expected to be lower than the earlier forecast of 5 percent, at
4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The revision was made taking into consideration of economic
performance during the first quarter of this year, which slowed
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
The revision was also due to new data on GDP figures dating to
1990 and revised bank of Thailand data on foreign trade, which
showed only a 0.2 percent growth last year. The bank also lowered
its forecast for external trade growth for 1997 from a previous
forecast of 11.6 percent, to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The board suggested that current macroeconomic policies should
be maintained, particularly in the area of fiscal discipline. More
budget cuts by both the government and state enterprises are
likely necessary.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government should work to improve the
performance of state enterprises in a bid to maintain state
revenue levels, the board said.

<HEADLINE> Nokia's First-Quarter Earning Soars Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Nokia, the world's biggest
mobile phone maker, reported a pretax profit of 1.45 billion
markka (284 million U.S. dollars) in the first quarter, triple the
amount in the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic rise was mainly due to a 58 percent growth in the
net sales of mobile phones in the first quarter by the Finnish
company, which amounted to 6.1 billion markka (1.2 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Total net sales during the January-March period came to 11.3
billion markka (2.2 billion dollars), 43 percent up from the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, its first-quarter performance slid a little from the
previous quarter, which registered a pretax profit of 1.6 billion
markka (365 million dollars), and net sales of 12.6 billion markka
(2.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Nokia's pretax profit fell by 21 percent to 3.9 billion markka
(860 million dollars) last year, but its sales started to pick up
at the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Based in Helsinki, Nokia has about 33,000 employees in 45
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel reaffirmed Turkey's active support to Romania's early
accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
According to a joint press statement issued here today,
Demirel and visiting Romanian President Emil Constantinescu
believed that the European integration process should be an
all-embracing one and that a broad congruence should be achieved
among the major Euro-Atlantic institutions, namely the NATO, the
European Union (EU) and the Western European Union (WEU).
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu arrived in Istanbul, the largest city in
Turkey, Monday to participate in the opening session of the
business conference of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC)
and to pay a three-day state visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
This was the first visit to Turkey by Constantinescu since he
was elected as Romanian president.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents said that southeastern Europe should become
a region of peace, stability and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They said that all countries of the region should base their
relationship toward each other on the principle of respect for
territorial integrity, inviolability of border and
non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the two presidents were satisfied with
the level of bilateral relations which are developing on the
solid basis of mutual friendship and understanding existing
between Turkey and Romania.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that the further development of economic and
trade ties should be made between the two countries.
</P>

Turkey and Romania Tuesday signed a free trade agreement and
two accords on cooperation in the fields of animal health and
plant protection following official talks between Demirel and
Constantinescu.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK Airport Authority Awards Contract for Runway Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Airport Authority
(AA) has awarded the contract for Northern Runway works at the new
airport at Chek Lap Kok, the AA said today.
</P>
<P>
The contract was awarded to the ACG Joint Venture (ACGJV),
comprising AMEC of Britain, Fujian of the People's Republic
of China, and Hellit and Woerner Bau AG of Germany.
</P>
<P>
The project includes construction of the Northern Runway and
taxiways, drainage, irrigation, emergency power generation, an
electrical distribution system, potable water and fire mains,
facilities for the Civil Aviation Department and Hong Kong
Observatory, marine approach structures, grassing and
miscellaneous works, AA said.
</P>
<P>
The ACGJV contract, worth 995 million HK dollars (128 million
U.S. dollars), including options for additional projects, will take
19 months to complete.
</P>
<P>
AA Chief Executive Officer Henry Townsend said that the new
airport's Phase 2 project, which comprises of the second runway
and the passenger terminal's northwest concourse extension, will
enable the declared runway capacity at the new airport to increase
from 37/38 aircraft movements per hour to 50 movements per hour
within the first year of commissioning.
</P>
<P>
"Not only will the timely construction of the Northern Runway
benefit the aviation and tourism industries, but the additional
capacity and enhanced efficiency it will provide will flow on
into Hong Kong's wider economy," he said, adding "It will reinforce
confidence in the new airport as a pre-eminent hub for
international and regional aviation."
</P>
<P>
The works would not have any impact on the completion of the
first phase of the airport project targeted for completion and
opening in April 1998, and nor would additional government equity
be required.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Closes Ranks of Muslims, Copts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said today that Christian Copts are always an integral part of
Egypt, in an apparent gesture to placate worries about growing
grudge between the country's Muslims and Copts.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt's Copts are part and parcel of the tightly-interwoven
texture of the Egyptian community," said Mubarak in his speech on
May Day celebrations.
</P>
<P>
But Mubarak warned that there were still attempts to foment and
instigate communal dissensions.
</P>
<P>
"These attempts, however, will never bear fruit because Muslims
and Copts alike are aware that they are in the same boat," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Copts, which make up about 10 percent of the overwhelmingly
Muslim country of 63 million, have been the target of Muslim
militants attacks.
</P>
<P>
The president also urged journalists and writers to steer clear
of playing on "sham differences between Muslims and Copts."
</P>
<P>
"Both Muslims and Copts have been governed by the principle
which guides our national action since 1919, namely that religion
be devoted to good while Egypt be the homeland of both Muslims and
Copts, who are the elements of the one nation," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
He also paid tribute to Muslims and Copts alike for helping in
the fight against terrorism and maintaining the country's national
unity.
</P>
<P>
"The Copts are an inseparable part of Egypt and their rights as
Egyptians are fully protected," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since February, about 20 Copts have been killed in Muslim
militant attacks in southern Egypt. The latest attacks on
Christians a week ago brought to 1,169 the number of people
killed, since Muslim militants declared war on the government of
Hosni Mubarak in March 1992.
</P>
<P>
The government has vowed to strike hard at terrorism in the event
of the February 13 church attack, in which nine Copts were killed
and 6 others injured when gunmen opened fire in a Coptic church in
Minya, 240 kilometers south of Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Working Class, Strong Driving Force for Reform: Editorial (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, China's leading
newspaper, will carry an editorial called "Deepening Reform and
the Working Class" tomorrow to mark International Workers' Day.
</P>
<P>
The editorial first extends warm congratulations and greetings
to workers, farmers, intellectuals of different ethnic groups, and
all the working people around the country, and greetings to
compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, and overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that China made a good beginning last year
for its Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), marked by the
achievement of an economic "soft landing" with curbed inflation
and sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"With reform becoming an irreversible trend in socialist
China," it says, "the working class, as the masters of the country,
are leading the trend as the main force in, as well as a strong
driving force for the reform."
</P>
<P>
After 19 years of experimentation and exploration, the
editorial points out, reform and opening up have begun a period of
smooth development, presenting bright prospects for building
socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
And people's understanding, especially that of the working
class, of reform gets deeper, and their confidence rises, it says,
adding that "sublimation of the understanding is becoming a
tremendous material force to propel the deepening of the reform."
</P>
<P>
Reform of state-owned enterprises is key to accelerating the
two fundamental changes of the economic system and the economic
growth mode, the editorial notes, adding that it is inevitable
that they should encounter some difficulties during the process of
the reform of the economic system and readjustment of the
industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that reform of state-owned enterprises is a major
strategic task in the reform of the economic system, and there is
no return.
</P>
<P>
"The difficulties in the reform process can only be overcome by
deepening the reform," says the editorial.
</P>
<P>
It elaborates that the deep-rooted problems for state-owned
enterprises that accumulated over the years have been fully
exposed, and "it is high time to address these problems;" while
the great achievements of reform and opening up and the sustained,
rapid, and healthy development of the national economy has created
rare opportunities for the reform of state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Working Class, Strong Driving Force for Reform: Editorial (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The guiding principle of "giving full play to the role of Party
organizations in enterprises as the political core, adhering to
and perfecting the system in which factory directors or managers
take full responsibility of running the enterprises, and relying
on the working class whole-heartedly" must be implemented in reform
of state-owned businesses, the editorial points out.
</P>
<P>
Reliance on the working class have been the consistent policy of
the Party, and an important part of Deng Xiaoping's theory on
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, it says.
</P>
<P>
When China started reform and opening up 19 years ago, the
editorial says, Deng Xiaoping pointed out that the working class
were bound to play a pioneering role in these reforms for the
benefits of socialism and China's modernization, and their
association with mass production has decisively shown their high
political consciousness and strict discipline and that they can
play a leading role in economic development and social and
political progress.
</P>
<P>
"We should implement the policy of relying on the working class
whole-heartedly in the whole process of reform and opening up,"
the editorial emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
It notes that relying on the working class is consistent with
showing concern for them, since the goal of reform is common
prosperity, and facts have shown that everybody is the beneficiary
of the reform sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that some enterprise employees' interests might be
affected temporarily in the reform due to adjustment of the
economic structure and new distribution of interests, the
editorial calls for a correct understanding of the temporary
difficulties in terms of the long-term benefits.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it points out that help should be rendered
to redundant and laid-off workers of state-owned enterprises by
carrying out reemployment projects, to reach the goal of good
livelihood of the working class and all the working people.
</P>
<P>
The editorial concludes that the working class, as the masters of
the country, will play even better their role as the main force in
the reform so as to carry forward the cause of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, which was initiated by Deng
Xiaoping.

<HEADLINE> UK's Labor Leader Makes Final Appeal to Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition Labor leader
Tony Blair made a final appeal today to British voters to vote for
him and "vote for a change" in Thursday's election.
</P>
<P>
"We will not stop trying to persuade people to put their trust
in Labor. Between now and when the polls close tomorrow night we
will strive for every vote, in every corner of the country," he
told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
But the labor leader, who seems set to topple Conservatives'
18-year rule in line with opinion polls, warned once more against
complacency when the polling day is approaching.
</P>
<P>
"Because this election is not going to be decided by opinion
polls. It is not going to be resolved by pundits. It is in the
hands of the British people. Their future is in their hands," the
43-year-old Labor leader said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Blair sent out nearly 200 former Labor MPs out of
their own constituencies to the marginals that would decide
Thursday's election.
</P>
<P>
"If people think that Britain could be better they should vote
for a new and modern Labor party," he said. "So I ask the British
people for their support," he added.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls suggest the Labor party, which Blair has dragged
into the center of the political spectrum since taking charge
three years ago, is set to win by a landslide.
</P>
<P>
Today's Daily Telegraph newspaper published its last opinion
poll before the election, showing the Labor a 20-point lead
against the Conservatives with a projected majority of 203 seats
in the 659-seat House of Commons.

<HEADLINE> Woman Candidate Joins Liberia's Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Ellen Sirleaf, Liberia's former
female finance minister, has resigned her post of director for
the Africa region of the United Nations Development Program to
join the presidential election race scheduled for May 30.
</P>
<P>
The only female candidate, who will contest the presidential
poll as candidate of the Liberia Action Party, has tremendous
support from the female population which constitutes about 60
percent of the Liberian voters, a report reaching here said
today.
</P>
<P>
Sirleaf gained international attention in 1985 when late
Liberian President Samuel Doe jailed her for making what he
called derogatory statements about him.
</P>
<P>
She is therefore considered as the candidate who could most
easily gather the support of the international community behind
the monumental task of rebuilding Liberia.
</P>
<P>
However, Sirleaf will also face formidable opponents. Among
them are Charles Taylor, Alhaji Kromah and George Boley, former
leaders of the major three warring factions in the west African
country.
</P>
<P>
Other major presidential candidates include Cletus Waterson
representing a seven-party alliance, Togbanah Tiptoeh, former
planning minister under the Doe administration, and Gabriel
Matthews and Boina Fahnbulleh, former foreign affairs ministers.
</P>
<P>
As preparations are under way for the May 30 polls, lack of
funds is hampering the job of the Independent Electoral
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission has sent a detailed estimate of 12 million U.S.
Dollars to General Sani Abacha, Nigeria's head of state who is
also chairman of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) and the ECOWAS Committee of Nine on Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The commission emphasized that the country would not be able
to source the funds necessary for the elections.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, Abacha sent his foreign minister, Tom Ikimi, and
an ECOWAS delegation to Liberia to assess the preparations
for the elections.
</P>
<P>
The result of the one-week assessment tour is not yet known.
But diplomats said the Committee of Nine is unwilling to consider
any proposal to alter the transition timetable with a view to
shifting the elections date to later in the year.
</P>
<P>
However, how to raise funds for the forthcoming elections
remains a problem for Liberia's peace process.

<P>
SINGAPORE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Education and workers training
will be a top priority in this term of government, Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong said in his May Day Message today, calling on
Singaporeans to be alert to new dangers as the Singapore economy
matures.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the difference between successful
countries and the less successful will turn on how well countries
nurture and use their talent and skills.
</P>
<P>
"If we compete on the basis of numbers, Singapore will lose to
far bigger countries. But on the basis of quality, discipline and
efficiency, we can hold our own and make a living for ourselves,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We need not just individual, but also group performance. We
have to harness Singaporeans into a strong united force to compete
against other national teams," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that one of Singapore's strengths is
its political stability. And as a result, investors can plan
long-term because Singapore is "rational and predictable" in its
approach to challenges.
</P>
<P>
He also said that if workers remain disciplined and
hardworking, continuously upgrade their skills and productivity,
and cooperate with employers as joint venture partners, Singapore
can sustain full employment and continue to earn higher wages.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad today confirmed that the
long-awaited peace talks between Zairean President Mobutu Sese
Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila would still be held on a
South African Navy ship later this week as originally proposed.
</P>
<P>
Pahad made the remarks in a response to reports from Zaire
claiming that Mobutu had objected to using a South African Navy
ship as venue for his first face-to-face talks with Kabila.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the South African Broadcasting
Corporation Radio, Pahad said as far as his government was
concerned, Mobutu and Kabila had earlier agreed to meet on the
navy ship, which would be anchored in international waters off
the coast of Zaire and Angola.
</P>
<P>
The only issues that had to be sorted out is related to
logistics and security, said Pahad, adding his government would
urge both parties "not to hesitated and to move very quickly to
the negotiating table."
</P>
<P>
Both United States special envoy Bill Richardson and United
Nations Special Envoy Mohamed Sahnoun are expected in Zairean
capital Kinshasa, the last major city held by soldiers loyal to
President Mobutu, later today to salvage the peace talks, which
would be chaired by South African President Nelson Mandela.

<P>
CANBERRA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
higher today following the issue of an unusually large parcel of
Japanese Samurai bonds which created fresh demand for the
currency.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 78.17 U.S. cents from 77.91
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency had received its boost from the issue of 40
billion yen worth of dual currency Samurai bonds.
</P>
<P>
Bankers Trust foreign exchange dealer Matt Gilmour said the
issue of Samurai bonds would boost the market's confidence that
there would be continued demand for the local currency from
Japanese investors.
</P>
<P>
Also, news in the United States that inflationary pressures
were not as strong as expected helped the local currency.
</P>

CANBERRA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
closed firmer but well off its earlier Wall Street-inspired highs,
dragged down by profit-takers in late trade.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 8.9 points higher at 2488.0,
well off its intra-day high of 2515.1.
</P>
<P>
"The day kicked off very strongly on the back of a strong
performance on Wall Street, but fell as profit-takers came into
the market in the afternoon," said Reynolds and Co. broker Peter
Struk.

<P>
The all resources index closed seven points firmer at 1395.2,
while the all industrials index ended 11.5 points up at 3906.3.

turnover with 11 million shares traded, worth 200.6 million
Australian dollars (156.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Struk said BHP's strength continued to be driven by Tuesday's

The banking sector recorded another strong day, rising 28.4

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China is making unprecedented
efforts to strengthen dams and dykes along the Yangtze River and
its branches, following estimates that a severe flood is likely to
strike the river this year.
</P>
<P>
Since March, the State Anti-Flood and Drought Headquarters has
sent 12 expert teams to local areas to inspect the preparation
work.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission said
that after two consecutive years of floods in the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze, a bigger flood is imminent this year and
this time, floods could even occur in the upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
Major flooding in the upper reaches of the river has not
occurred since 1981.

<HEADLINE> ADB Invests in Venture Capital Fund for Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
today approved an equity investment of 3 million U.S. dollars in a
venture capital fund aimed at developing the private sector in the
small countries in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
This is the first such fund targeted at these island nations,
the Manila-based ADB said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said economic growth in these countries vitally needs
the private sector, but an acute shortage of equity or risk
capital has affected the sector's development.
</P>
<P>
The generally small size of potential private sector projects
in the Pacific region has constrained the bank's own efforts in
lending directly to such projects, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The investments will be closed for redemption for ten years,
with a provision for extending the period for another two, it
said.

Leghari said that Pakistan is willing to maintain and develop
its good neighborly relations with China, expressing the hope that
government officials, intellectuals, and businessmen of the two
countries will have more exchanges and cooperation, and that
bilateral friendly ties will continue to grow.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Hopes for Closer Trade Ties with China: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Pakistani President
Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari said here today that his country is
eager to bolster its economic and trade ties with China.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting earlier today with Guo Dongpo, president of the
China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Leghari
noted that bilateral trade volume is not commensurate with sound
bilateral political relations, so the two countries need to take
measures to advance their economic and trade relationship.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said he hopes that the two countries' businesses will
explore new ways to expand their cooperation, including setting up
joint ventures and investing in each other.
</P>
<P>
Guo said that the Chinese businesses will make their own
efforts to promote economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries, and expressed the belief that Leghari's current China
trip is sure to promote such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the meeting, Leghari and Guo, together with some
Chinese enterpreneurs, had breakfast, where the Pakistani
president briefed those attending on Pakistan's economic situation
and investment environment, and welcomed Chinese businessmen to
invest in Pakistan and cooperate with Pakistani partners.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Industrialist Describes Trip to Iraq as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Jacques Sarraf, chairman of the
Lebanese Industrialists Association, described today the trip by a
group of Lebanese businessmen to Iraq last week as "very fruitful."
</P>
<P>
Sarraf and his ten-men delegation of leading business figures
from Lebanon's oil, food and clothing sectors returned home from
the week-long trip to the Iraqi capital Baghdad at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published here today, Sarraf said that the
Lebanese industrialist delegation had meetings with the Iraqi
ministers of health, trade, industry and minister of foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We met their chamber of commerce and the union of
industrialists. We also signed several protocols." he said in the
interview with the Daily Star, the only English daily in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that he preferred not to reveal details of
the visit before he met Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz,
who is due to return from a visit in Tunisia later this week.
</P>
<P>
Iraq used to be one of Lebanon's leading trade partners. But
their ties soured after the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein
provided moral and material support for Michael Aoun, the former
Lebanese army general, in the military confrontations with
Lebanese Muslim factions backed by Syria's 35,000-strong forces
in Lebanon during 1989 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon severed its diplomatic relations with Iraq following
the 1994 assassination of Talib Suhgeil Al-Tamimi, a prominent
Iraqi dissenter, in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese judicial authorities arrested three Iraqi diplomats
shortly after the murder. But they were freed in January
reportedly at the request of the Lebanese foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Sarraf said in February that his Industrialists' Association
secured the release of the diplomats after persuading Boueiz into
improving trade links with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by the Lebanese industrialists to renew their ties
with Iraq came despite a U.N. embargo on Iraq in the wake of
its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the U.N. decided to ease the sanctions on Iraq
and allowed Baghdad to sell two-billion-dollar worth of oil over
a period of six months in exchange for food, medicines and
humanitarian supplies.

Minnesota Timberwolves in Minneapolis Tuesday, sweeping into the
Western Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
In the final two minutes, Barkley had three free throws, a key
rebound, fed Mario Elie for a layup and sank a clutch jumper to
give the Rockets a sweep of the best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
Houston awaits the winner of the Seattle-Phoenix series and
will have homecourt advantage regardless of its opponent.

26 points for the Rockets, who had five players with at least 17
points in the highest-scoring playoff game so far. Houston made
15-of-28 three-pointers, while Minnesota sank 6-of-15.
</P>
<P>
Tom Gugliotta had 27 points and 10 rebounds and Dean Garrett

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Rejects German Envoy to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today ordered the Foreign Ministry not to allow the
German ambassador to Tehran to return for a period of time.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei also instructed the Foreign Ministry not to rush
in sending back Iranian ambassadors to their respective countries
of mission in the EU member states.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader made the response one day after the EU
member states decided to send back their ambassadors to Tehran
at the ministerial meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
EU member states recalled their envoys from Tehran for
"consultations" following the ruling of the Berlin court on
April 10, which implicated top Iranian leaders behind the
assassination of the four exiled Kurdish opposition leaders in
Mykonos restaurant on September 17, 1992.
</P>
<P>
EU also decided to suspend ministerial level contact with
Iran and "critical dialog" with Tehran. However, it did not
adopt any economic sanction against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei described western governments as "unfair, ill-intentioned,
shameless and brazen because of their baseless accusations against
the Iranian nation and other nations of the world."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a group of teachers and workers who had called
on him on the occasion of the Teachers' and Workers' Day,
the Ayatollah strongly condemned western governments "for their
aggression against the rights of human beings in the last
one hundred years."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati declared here today that
some European ambassadors, especially German and Danish ambassadors,
are unwelcome in his country.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said at a press conference that Iran will response
the European countries with same the intensity but in opposite
direction. The loser would not be Iran but the Europeans.

<HEADLINE> HK Textile Exports to Benefit from U.S. New Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Trade Development
Council (TDC) said today that the United States' planned
elimination of the single-entry bond requirement will benefit Hong
Kong's textile exports.
</P>
<P>
The single-entry bond requirement, which was imposed by the
U.S. last
June on selected Hong Kong textile exports, will be eliminated at
the end of today, TDC said in its latest Trade Watch report.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the step was purportedly taken to address
the problem of alleged illegal transshipments.
</P>
<P>
Under the old policy, Hong Kong exports of textile products in
those few selected categories must comply with additional
documentation requirements and be accompanied by single-entry
bonds in order to clear U.S. Customs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the U.S. importers had to provide to U.S. Customs
an original textile declaration signed by the importer declaring
that the textile declaration was accurate.
</P>
<P>
As a result, TDC said, Hong Kong's overall textile and apparel
exports to the U.S. declined 4 percent in 1996, a drop attributed
in part to the imposition of the single entry bond system.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hong Kong's domestic exports of seven of the eight
selected categories failed to achieve the same quota utilization
level they did in 1995, TDC added.
</P>
<P>
After a series of discussions between Hong Kong and U.S. trade
officials, the U.S. Customs Service announced early this month
that effective on May 1, 1997, it would no longer require
single-entry bonds on selected categories of Hong Kong textile
exports.
</P>
<P>
However, TDC noted that the retention of a modified version of
the additional documentation requirements, as well as their
extension to all textile categories, may continue to adversely
affect Hong Kong textile manufacturers and exporters.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Agrees to Hold Inter-Korean Red Cross Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean National Red Cross
(KNRC) today informed its counterpart of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) that it agreed to hold an inter-Korean
Red Cross meeting in Beijing to discuss aid delivery issues.
</P>
<P>
KNRC Chairman Kang Young-hoon conveyed his new position
to his counterpart Li Song-ho in Pyongyang through the
direct phone in the inter-Korean Red Cross liaison office in the
truce village of Panmunjom.
</P>
<P>
Kang initiated a proposal on April 18 to hold high-level
representative talks in Panmunjom before he proposed working-level
contacts at the same place six days later.
</P>
<P>
But Li twice turned down the suggestions and counterproposed
Beijing as the venue for the meeting on May 3 without a
working-level contact.
</P>
<P>
Li Song-ho said that the two sides could meet in Beijing
"without any feeling burden."
</P>
<P>
Considering the food shortage in the DPRK, Seoul gave up its
principle of "inter-Korean dialogue inside the Peninsula" and
decided to accept Li's proposal "as an exception," KNRC officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, if happens, will be the first inter-Korean Red
Cross contact after a working-level meeting between the two
organizations was suspended in August 1992.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will send a six-member delegation led by the KNRC
general secretary to Beijing for the meeting, while the site and
date of the meeting would be decided through phone contact between
the two Red Cross societies, Kang said.

</P>
<P>
China produced 1.584 billion sq m of architectural ceramics and
55 million units of sanitary ceramics in 1996, ranking first in
the world, according to Wu Bin, executive vice-president of the
Building Materials Chamber of Commerce under the China Chamber of
International Commerce (CCOIC).
</P>
<P>
The official said that over ten years, China has developed more
than 800 large and medium-sized architectural and sanitary
ceramics enterprises as well as thousands of township-run
enterprises. The cities of Foshan, Tangshan, and Boshan have
become the country's largest ceramics production bases.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that the booming building sector has provided great
opportunities for the development of architectural and sanitary
ceramics production.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the country's annual urban and rural housing
construction averages at 300 million sq m and 600 million sq m,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, China is projected to add 230 new cities and
5,000 towns, which will create huge market for the architectural
and sanitary ceramics products.
</P>
<P>
Widespread Sino-foreign cooperation and technological exchanges
have boosted the upgrading of technology and equipment in the
ceramics sector, according to Liu Jingzhou, senior engineer of the
Building Materials Sub-Council of the China Council for the
Promotion of International Trade.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that more than 440 ceramics businesses have introduced
complete production lines from abroad, including more than 2,000
automatic ceramics press machines introduced from Italy, Germany,
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
An official source expects China to maintain its status as the
world's largest architectural and ceramics producer until the year
of 2010.
</P>
<P>
The source added that the State Administration of Building
Materials Industry and the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade will co-sponsor the International Ceramics
Exhibition scheduled to be held in Guangzhou between May 12 and 16.
</P>
<P>
And over 150 ceramics enterprises from Italy, Germany, Japan,
Britain, France, the United States, Russia, and China will display
their latest ceramics products, technology, and equipment at the
exhibition.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Hospital Staff to Wage Strike Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Hospital staff throughout Lebanon
will go on strike Friday in face of their dire financial woes
largely caused by unpaid bills, the Lebanese Hospitals' Syndicate
announced in a statement published this morning.
</P>
<P>
Public and private hospitals will handle only emergency cases
during a day-long stoppage, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"All institutions, governmental and private, owe us money and
all we receive are promises," Faouzi Adaimi, head of the syndicate
told a press conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The sum owed by the government and private sector since 1995
stands at 500 billion Lebanese pounds (324.7 million
U.S. dollars)," Adaimi said.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the government in setting a low budget share -- some
3 percent -- for health care and for the delays in payment for the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The syndicate chief said that the government's budget failed to
take into account the increase in population and a rising cost of
health care.
</P>
<P>
About one tenth of the country's 4 million population receive
hospital treatment each year, Adaimi said, noting 300,000 people's
medical fare is covered by the government or army.
</P>
<P>
He added most hospitals are unable to pay salaries on time and
some are not even able to pay the monthly wages at all.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets Japanese Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China-Japan relations are in an
important period of inheriting the past and ushering in the
future, Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), said here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in a meeting with a delegation of the
Liberal Democratic Party of Japan led by Yamazaki Taku, chairman
of the party's Political Affairs Investigation Committee.
</P>
<P>
This year is the 25th anniversary of the normalization of
Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and the 20th anniversary of the
signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship.
</P>
<P>
Extending a warm welcome to the Japanese visitors, Jiang said
that relations are now in a significant period that serves as a
link between the past and the future.
</P>
<P>
"To stick to the China-Japan Joint Declaration and the
China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship is an important
guarantee to push forward the bilateral relations in a healthy and
steady way," he said, adding "It is also an important guarantee to
maintain the two peoples' friendship from generation to
generation."
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that in the past 25 years, the Sino-Japanese ties
have yielded profound development in all fields through the
unremitting efforts of the two governments and the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
As the world draws near the 21st century, the Chinese president
said, the two sides, leaders in particular, should take a
comprehensive and far-sighted view of the entire bilateral
relationship, and deal with emerging problems in a sober-minded
and proper way to make the future relations progress in a more
healthy and smooth manner.
</P>
<P>
Yamazaki Taku said his delegation is here hoping to promote the
bilateral friendly relations. It appreciated the great
achievements China has scored in its reform and opening up after
having seen them with their own eyes, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's progress is conducive to that of Asia and the Pacific
and the world at large, he said, adding Japan, as China's close
neighbor separated only by a strip of water, is willing to join
China to continue the bilateral good-neighborly ties with the
understanding that "the past experience, if not forgotten, should
serve as a guide for the future".
</P>
<P>
This will help contribute to peace in the Asia-Pacific region
and the world at large, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li Shuzheng, head of the International Department of the CPC
Central Committee, and Yashiyasu Sato, Japanese ambassador to
China, attended today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Yamazaki Taku and his party arrived here Sunday as guests of
the CPC.

<TEXT>
<P>
The current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will
remain unchanged, and so will its way of life. The laws in Hong
Kong will remain basically unchanged. Hong Kong will retain its
status as a free port, a separate customs territory and an
international financial center. The Hong Kong dollar will continue
to be used and peg on the U.S. dollar. The central government of
China will not collect a single Hong Kong dollar in taxes from
Hong Kong. The government of the Hong Kong SAR will be composed
entirely of local inhabitants and the central government will not
send any officials to Hong Kong. Foreign economic interest in Hong
Kong will be protected.
</P>
<P>
Concerns have been expressed overseas that Hong Kong's
democracy, human rights and press freedom will be restricted in
the future. What will actually happen in Hong Kong, however, is
that after its return, the democracy, freedoms and human rights
enjoyed by the Hong Kong people will be more extensive. They will
be increased rather than decreased. Many such rights are beyond
the reach of the Hong Kong people under the British rule. The
central government will only be responsible for Hong Kong's
defense and foreign affairs. The departments of central government
will not interfere in matters which fall under the authority of
the Hong Kong SAR which enjoys a high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The success in implementing the principle of "one country, two
systems" will ensure Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. It is
not only in the interests of Hong Kong and China, but also the
interests of other countries and regions, including the United
States, that have extensive economic and trade links with Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the Shanghai
Communique. Twenty-five years ago, with courage and statesmanship,
Chinese and American leaders reopened the relationship between our
two countries. Today, after twenty-five years,
China-U.S. relationship is once again faced with a historic
opportunity for improvement and growth. We should once again show
strategic vision and courage, just as our leaders did in those
days, remove interferences and obstacles, and press forward
towards our goal. Thus, when the next century arrives, we will
have a sound, stable and steadily growing relationship between our
two countries which benefits not just our two peoples but the
people of the whole world. Let us join hands and work for the
establishment of such a relationship geared to the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to End Power Rationing Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The seven-month electricity
rationing in Kenya is expected to be over after heavy rains
improved water levels in main supply stations.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) said owing to the
heavy rains, the water levels of Seven Forks and Turkwel dams had
gone up, allowing for stepped-up hydro-generation.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by KPLC noted that the water levels at the
Seven Forks and Turkwel dams had risen by seven meters since the
rains started about four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
KPLC spokesman Mike Njeru said on Tuesday that heavy rains had
helped KPLC step up generation by around 40 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
According to Njeru, five of the eight power units for the
Nairobi South Power Station imported from Britain are already in
Nairobi and the first unit will produce power in June.
</P>
<P>
The diesel-power Nairobi South Power Station will contribute
44.5 megawatts for national consumption.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a barge-mounted thermal plant supplied by Malaysian
company Westmont off the southern port of Mombasa is expected to
be ready in June.
</P>
<P>
On March 9, former Energy Minister Kirugi M'Mukindia said the
power rationing, which started last September, would come to an
end when the 43-megawatts barge power plant and 44.5-megawatts
diesel power plant in Nairobi started operating.
</P>
<P>
The installed power capacity in Kenya is 784 megawatts with an
additional 30 megawatts imported from neighboring Uganda while
the actual power generating capacity oscillates between 570 and
650 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
The deficiency is blamed mainly on poor weather, poor
maintenance and constant breakdowns.

<HEADLINE> "Strike Hard" Campaign Making China Safer (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China's "strike hard" campaign,
which started a year ago, has brought the country's crime rate
down for the first time in many years, Bai Jingfu, vice-minister
of public security, said here today.
</P>
<P>
The campaign included the "joint mission", "winter mission",
and the present "spring rectification mission". Thanks to these
actions and participation by the whole society, China's public
order has taken a turn for the better, Bei said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Public Security Ministry, the number of crimes
investigated by police in the first two months of last year was
12.6 percent higher than for the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The crime rate for all of 1996 dropped 5.4 percent, and that
for the first two months of this year was down 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by Beijing's police bureau, 90 percent of
the people say that public order has improved since the
crackdown. Legislators in the National People's Congress Standing
Committee discovered, during a recent tour, that the public feel
"much safer".
</P>
<P>
China has continued its intensified anti-crime drive since
1983, but this round, unlike the earlier ones, was started by the
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and supported by
party committees, governments at various levels, and the rest of
society.
</P>
<P>
Police and prosecutors, with sufficient help from the
government, have worked harder, increased their efficiency, and
given harsher speedier sentences on criminals in accordance with
the law.
</P>
<P>
Bai noted that a striking feature of this anti-crime fight has
been the rigorous compliance with the law, and that "no matter how
harsh or how quick the sentence, they are always within the limits
of the law."
</P>
<P>
China's laws provide sufficient legal guarantees for the
"strike hard" drive, which protects citizens from being infringed
upon by law enforcers, said Gao Mingxuan, a law professor and
executive director of the China Law Society's Criminal Law Chapter.
</P>
<P>
As for the burdens the drive places on the policemen, Guo Benli
at the Changqiao Substation in Beijing, said, "We just don't have
a day off even on weekends, and some of the men can't even find
time to see their wives if they're sick."
</P>
<P>
But, it was precisely because of this hard work that a large
number of the serious cases were solved, including a notorious
armed robbery of bank vehicles in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
A large amount of potential losses to both the state and the
people has been recovered, causing potential wrongdoers to think
twice, and effectively stopping a great deal of vice, Bai said.

<P>
The public are enthusiastic about the anti-crime
work. According to statistics, during the crackdown, more than 80
percent of the crimes were revealed by leads from the public, and
45 percent of the criminals were apprehended with their help.
</P>
<P>
"The massive public participation means a gigantic camouflaged
police force for China, who have played a vital role in the
anti-crime fight," Bai explained.
</P>
<P>
"'Strike hard' is more our business than the government's," Ma
Hongguan, who is a self-employed key maker and who once helped
police catch a thief, wrote in the public opinion section of a
Beijing "Strike Hard" Achievement Exhibition last year. The
exhibition drew more than 170,000 visitors, including many foreign
journalists.
</P>
<P>
Professor Gao attributed the comprehensive management system to
the "strike hard" campaigns. China is setting up a nationwide
crime prevention system and rapid reaction mechanism with police
linked to communities.
</P>
<P>
The Public Security Ministry has repeatedly said that in spite
of the success of this fight, China still faces a serious public
security situation.
</P>
<P>
Some hardened criminals are defying the crackdown and public
security problems in some places have not been rooted out, the
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Haibo, a researcher at the China Academy of
Social Sciences, China will have a hard and long time to return to
the age when people didn't have to lock their doors at night. But,
he adds, "With an effective crime prevention system and the
continuing 'strike hard' actions, the public will still be
guaranteed of their safety, and China will remain one of the
countries with the lowest crime rate in the world."

<HEADLINE> Tensions Rise in S. Lebanon as International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Tensions shrouds south Lebanon
following a fresh round of exchanging fire between Israeli
forces and Lebanese guerrillas as cease-fire monitors continued a
meeting today to discuss Israeli and Lebanese protests.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources said that the Israeli forces at
positions in a the security strip the Jewish state occupies in
south Lebanon bombarded a number of targets in the areas of
Nabatiyeh and Iglim Al-Toffah over last night.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces at Dabshe and Sweida swept vicinities of
their positions with heavy machinegun fire, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery also shelled Nabatiyeh Fauqa, Habboush and
the Litani river basin in the central and western sectors of
south Lebanon on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese pro-Iranian guerrilla, Hezbollah, or Party of
God, announced that its fighters launched a series of attacks at
the Israeli outposts of Kasarat Aroush, Dabshe, Sweida and
Sejoud "with various weapons" at midnight.
</P>
<P>
As-Safir, a leftist daily published in Beirut, reported this
morning that Hezbollah fired Sam-7 missiles and other anti-air
weapons toward Israeli jet fighters carrying out reconnaissance
missions over Western Beqaa Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli warplanes released hot balloons to avert the
upward ground fire, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire monitoring committee adjourned Tuesday evening
an inconclusive debate on two complaints presented by Lebanon
and Israel over violations of the year-old truce agreement
against involving civilians in military operations in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the five-member monitoring committee,
grouping France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the United States
met for seven hours in the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping
force at the south Lebanese border town of Naqoura to listen to
the Israeli complaint about an cross-border attack by Hezbollah
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Israel said two Israeli soldiers were wounded when two mortar
shells landed at an army base on the Israeli side of the
Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
The committee will meet again at 11:00 a.m. (08:00 GMT) today
to review a separate petition by Lebanon over Sunday's attack on
a school bus packed with children.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon said the bus was hit by six 12.7-mm bullets fired
from a hilltop position held by Israeli troops and the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia in the occupied border
zone.
</P>
<P>
None of the children were hurt, but the attack traumatized
the children, aged between four and 12, who were on their way to
school run by the Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Under the April 26 cease-fire understanding, which ended a
17-day Israeli blitz against Lebanon last year, Israel and
Lebanese guerrillas are barred from targeting civilians or
launching attacks from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese guerrillas are also prohibited from opening fire
across the border.

<HEADLINE> Iran Declares German, Danish Ambassadors Unwelcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian foreign minister
declared here today that some European ambassadors, especially
German and Danish ambassadors, are Unwelcome in his country.
</P>
<P>
This is one of Iran's official responses made by Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati at a press conference to the
declaration of the European Union ministerial meeting in
Luxembourg Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said that Iran will response the European countries
with same the intensity but in opposite direction. The loser
would not be Iran but the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
He said "some European ambassadors are not welcome and
German Ambassador (Horst Beshmann) is one of them. He is not
welcome in Iran."
</P>
<P>
In a response to the statement by Danish foreign minister
about delay in sending his ambassador back to Tehran, Velayati
said, Denmark can take as much time as it needs.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in a hurry to receive their ambassadors. As
a matter of fact, he is not welcomed at all," he added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question posed by Xinhua, the Iranian foreign
minister said, the outcome of the EU ministerial meeting is
predictable and term it as "political backwardness" of the

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Language Keeps Pace with Computer Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Computer researchers in southwest
China's Tibet Autonomous Region have worked out standard coding of
the Tibetan language to keep pace with the information age.
</P>
<P>
"Coding the Tibetan language enables us to directly get access
to computer information and networks," said Nyima Cering with the
Tibet University, who heads a team of computer experts in the
research of coding Tibetan language.
</P>
<P>
The team began their work in 1994, and after three years of
arduous work, their coding standard has been accepted by world
computer organizations, including Microsoft in the United States.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of this coding interface, computer users of
Tibetan language will be able to use the software developed by
many computer companies in the world, Nyima Cering said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with international coding standards, the experts
have also won approval from the State Bureau of Technological
Supervision for their coding of Tibetan characters, keyboards, and
fonts.
</P>
<P>
"On this basis, we will develop application software in Tibetan
language to make the information network serve the development of
the Tibetan language," Nyima Cering said.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of information technology, computer
typesetting of Tibetan has taken the place of stereotyping, and
the diversified types of printing styles of Tibetan had to be
standardized, Nyima Cering said.
</P>
<P>
So far, 22 types of fonts have been approved by state
departments as standard Tibetan printing fonts.

<HEADLINE> Toward A China-U.S. Relationship for the 21st Century: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China wishes to join the World Trade Organization. This serves
China's own interests as it will help deepen its reform and
opening up program. What is more, it meets the interest of the
United States and other trading partners of China. Recently,
progress was made in the latest round of negotiations between
China and the United States in Geneva. I hope the negotiating
teams of both countries will redouble their efforts to reach early
agreement through consultation on an equal footing. After all,
both the MFN treatment and the WTO should be mechanisms for
promoting world trade and cooperation among countries. They should
not be used as a tool to put political pressure on others.
</P>
<P>
We are living in a diverse world. China and the United States
differ in social system, historical background, cultural
tradition, values and level of economic development. It is
therefore not surprising that they have different views on human
rights. Some people in the United States take American standards
on human rights to judge if there is democracy in China. I don't
think this is the right way to go about it.
</P>
<P>
China has its own national conditions, just as the United
States does. Under China's democratic system, the Chinese people
enjoy extensive freedoms and human rights, although they are not
expressed the same way as in the United States. China's democracy
is the choice made by the Chinese people, just as yours is the
choice made by the American people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches great importance to promoting
human rights. In keeping with the principle of universality of
human rights and China's specific national conditions, it has made
great efforts to ensure the rights to survival and development for
the Chinese people. As a result, the Chinese people are enjoying
extensive economic, social and cultural rights. At the same time,
China has stepped up the building of democracy and legal system to
uphold the civil and political rights of its people.
</P>
<P>
China takes an active part in the U.N. efforts to promote and
protect human rights. It has become party to 17 international
human rights instruments, two more than the United States. China
has, on many occasions, spoken positively of the international
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. After
careful consideration, China has decided to first sign the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
As for differences on human rights, it has all along been
China's position that they should be handled through dialogue and
exchange of views on the basis of equality and mutual
respect. Confrontation is not the right choice for addressing the
issue. Instead of solving the problem, it can only make things
more difficult and impair bilateral cooperation in other
areas. Since 1990, the Western countries have tried for seven
years to pass resolutions against China at the U.N. Human Rights
Commission in Geneva, but with no success. This shows that such a
practice is both unreasonable and unpopular.
</P>
<P>
Some people in the United States are concerned that China will
carry out arms proliferation and thus threaten American
security. Such concern is unfounded. The fact is that China has
consistently stood against arms proliferation. It has actively
participated in international disarmament activities and put
forward practical and effective disarmament proposals. China has
become party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons and the Biological Weapons Convention, and signed the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with its international treaty obligations, China has
adopted and implemented corresponding steps on export-control, and
is constantly improving them. As for the export of conventional
weapons, China has all along taken a very prudent and responsible
approach towards it. China's arms export is very limited, taking
up only a very small share of the international arms market. It is
nothing compared with that of the United States, which chalks up
nearly 60 percent of the international arms sales.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Australian Wool Exporters Concerned About </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A surge in wool prices over the
past month in Australia, which has lifted the eastern market
indicator to a 19-month high to 659 Australian cents (514 U.S.
cents) a kilogram, has led to concerns among the wool exporters.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator jumped another 19 Australian cents
per kilogram after auctions last week, bringing to 40 cents the
rise in the three weeks of selling since the Easter break.
</P>
<P>
And now it is at its highest level since September 1995 and
more than 100 Australian cents (78 U.S. cents) above the low to
which it sank eight months later.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the Australian Council of Wool Exporters
Bob Quirk said that the movement was long overdue news for
growers, but there were increasing reports of fabric and garment
manufacturers strongly resisting rises in the prices of raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
"This makes it very difficult for topmakers and spinners to
operate at profitable margins, which ultimately must have an
adverse effect on greasy wool prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The ideal situation," he thought, "would be to have continuous
but smaller increases in price from week to week."
</P>
<P>
Exporters said the market recovery was caused by competition
among local and overseas processors. In addition, a low offering
at auctions also contributed to the market moving up.
</P>
<P>
The wool stockpile is slowly declining, reportedly at 1.8
million bales. Last week, the Wool International sold about 28,000
bales, after selling 25,000 bales the week before.

<HEADLINE> Toward A China-U.S. Relationship for the 21st Century: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China and the United States share the same goal and a great
deal of common interests in preventing the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction. In recent years, the two countries
have held useful dialogues on non-proliferation and reached some
common understanding in this regard. The Chinese side is ready to
maintain dialogue and consultation on this issue with the
U.S. side.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the issue of non-proliferation, what concerns us in
China most is the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. Such arms sales
undermine China's sovereignty and pose a security threat to
China's mainland. They also work against peace and stability in
the Taiwan Straits. We hope that the U.S. government will
seriously address China's concern and strictly abide by the August
17 Joint Communique. It should reduce and halt its proliferation
of arms and related technologies to China's Taiwan region, so as
to create with concrete actions conditions for
China-U.S. cooperation in the field of non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
It should be pointed out that Taiwan is the single most
important and most sensitive issue in China-U.S. relations. It is
also the biggest obstacle to the sound growth of these
relations. Taiwan has been an inseparable part of China's
territory since ancient times. To end the state of separation
across the Taiwan Straits is the strong aspiration and unshakable
national will of the Chinese people, including the Taiwan
compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The formula of "peaceful reunification based on one country,
two systems" and the eight-point proposal made by President Jiang
Zemin on promoting China's peaceful reunification are both the
consistent policy and concrete plan of the Chinese government on
this question. At their very heart is the principle of one
China. It is the basis and premise of peaceful reunification. Not
only China, I don't think the government and people of any other
country can tolerate actions aimed at its division. The American
people have gone through their own Civil War. You should be able
to appreciate the Chinese people's firm desire for reunification
and their resolve against national separation.
</P>
<P>
On many occasions, the U.S. government leaders have reaffirmed
the continued U.S. commitment to the "one China" policy and to
the three China-U.S. Joint Communiques. It is our hope that
these commitments will be honored.
</P>
<P>
It should be pointed out that the Taiwan authorities are using
various means, including money, to split China and pursue
independence. We should stand on guard against such plot and make
sure that the Taiwan issue will not once again stand in the way of
better and closer relations between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
It is now only two months before the Chinese government resumes
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. At present, Hong Kong is
enjoying sustained economic growth, growing public confidence and
an increasing flow of people returning from overseas. Both the
Hong Kong people and the international investors have great
confidence in Hong Kong. The preparations for the establishment of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is progressing
smoothly.

MAPUTO, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's Cahora Bassa Power
Station, located in the northern Tete Province, is expected to
supply electric power to Zimbabwe and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Energy Minister Gastigo Langa said at the end of a

The infected cattle get feverish and die within four days, and
the dissect of the dead cow shows a swollen spleen and yellowed

Local farmers never know such a disease. They claimed the
disease was brought into the country with cows imported by

But some local people blamed the disease on the lack of

<HEADLINE> Israel Further Eases Closure on West Bank, Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army today
"drastically" eased the closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
allowing tens of thousands of Palestinian laborers to enter into
Israel, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Starting from this morning, 28,000 workers from the West Bank
and 27,000 from the Gaza Strip are to be let in to their jobs in
the Jewish state. They must be married, over 29, and have a
security clearance, an army source said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai told Israel Radio
that some restrictions was already lifted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will reach a stage where life will become very
reasonable, with no closure, although we will increase our
security activities," Mordechai said.
</P>
<P>
He was optimistic that ways would be found to enable
continuation of peace talks with the Palestinians, although he
stressed that this would not happen without a crackdown by the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on terror and those who
supported it.
</P>
<P>
"There will not be a closure, but we will increase our
security activity and if the Palestinians also do everything
that is necessary against terrorists, there will definitely be a
different atmosphere to the continuation of the (peace)
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel started easing the closure Tuesday by allowing some
5,000 Palestinian merchants, who are married and over 30, to
enter into the Jewish country, and travel permits were also being
given to 650 PNA officials.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Palestinian hotel workers, medical personnel,
teachers, journalists, and employees of the Israeli Civil
Administration, international organizations and religious
institutions may also travel to Jerusalem from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israel imposed the total closure on the West Bank
and Gaza Strip immediately after a suicide bombing attack in a
downtown coffee shop in Tel Aviv, which left three Israeli women
dead and over 50 other people injured.
</P>
<P>
The closure has barred tens of thousands of Palestinians from
returning to their jobs inside Israel, and from traveling
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Toward A China-U.S. Relationship for The 21st Century: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today made a speech at a luncheon
held in his honor by the Council on Foreign Relations, the
U.S.-China Business Council and the National Committee on
U.S.-China Relations.
</P>
<P>
The full text of the speech, which is entitled "Toward a
China-U.S. relationship for the 21st century," reads as follows.
</P>
<P>
Mr. President,
</P>
<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
I wish to thank the Council on Foreign Relations, the
U.S.-China Business Council and the National Committee on
U.S.-China Relations for their invitation. I also want to thank
you, Mr. President, for your kind and friendly introduction. It is
a great pleasure for me to meet the distinguished audience here
today. Please allow me to take this opportunity to speak on
China-U.S. relations and the Hong Kong question which, I
understand, is of interest to you.
</P>
<P>
As the new century is about to set in, our world is, on the
whole, moving towards greater relaxation. Working for peace,
development and cooperation has become the mainstream of
international life.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there are still some uncertain and
destabilizing factors in the world. Troubles and conflicts keep
cropping up in some regions. The gap between the rich and poor
countries continues to widen. Cross-boundary crime, terrorism and
environmental damage are threatening and undermining the survival
and sustainable development of mankind.
</P>
<P>
What kind of a world should we bring into the 21st
century? This is the question facing each and every one of us.
</P>
<P>
Both China and the United States are permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council. Ours is the largest developing country and
yours is the largest developed country in the world.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, we share a common responsibility in maintaining
peace and stability in both Asia-Pacific and the rest of the
world. We also share important responsibility in promoting global
economic prosperity, improving human environment and many other
important matters. The need for both countries to stay engaged
with each other is increasing, not decreasing. The potential for
both countries to cooperate in various fields is expanding, not
dwindling. We should firmly bear these common interests in mind
and step up cooperation. We should also work together with other
countries to bring a peaceful, stable and prosperous world into
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
I am glad to see that China-U.S. relations have improved a lot
recently. High-level official exchanges have increased
steadily. Bilateral economic relations and trade are expanding.
Military-to-military exchanges have made headway. With support
from our leaders, the first meeting of China-U.S. Forum on
Environment and Development was successfully held in Beijing,
which opened a new field of cooperation between the two
countries. At present, both sides are making preparations for the
state visits to be exchanged between President Jiang Zemin and
President Clinton this year and next. China-U.S. relations have an
opportunity for further growth.
</P>
<P>
However, I must point out that while the relationship is making
progress, from time to time we still hear the sound of discord and
encounter interferences. For instance, some people in the United
States are spreading the "China threat" theory. According to
their argument, China has replaced the former Soviet Union as the
main threat to the United States. Others predict that China and
the United States will move towards confrontation, even conflict,
and therefore call for containment against China. There are also
people who liken today's China to Germany and Japan at the end of
the nineteenth and early twentieth century. They believe that as
its economy and national strength grow, China is bound to pursue
external expansion. These views, I must say, could not be more
wrong.
</P>
<P>
A review of China's history shows China does not have a
tradition of expansion. On the contrary, it was the victim of
repeated foreign aggression, domination and bullying. China has
never occupied a single inch of foreign soil, nor has it stationed
a singly soldier abroad.
</P>
<P>
Today's China is a developing country. What it desires most
is a peaceful international environment, so that it can focus on
economic development and improve the life of its 1.2 billion
people. Because of this, China has firmly adhered to an
independent foreign policy of peace and worked to maintain and
develop friendly relations and cooperation with other countries.
</P>
<P>
China's defense policy is completely defensive in nature. Its
defense spending is the lowest among the big countries in absolute
terms. In per capita terms as well as in terms of the share of the
GNP, it is among the lowest in the world. According to statistics,
the 1996 defense budget of the United States exceeded 260 billion
dollars, averaging 996 dollars per American. China's defense
spending was only 8.7 billion dollars and 7 dollars per
Chinese. Let these basic facts and figures speak for themselves.

<HEADLINE> Towards A China-US Relationship for the 21st Century: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the viewpoint of development, China will still be a
developing country for a long time in the 21st century. It will
not be in a position to threaten anyone, nor will there be any
need for it to do so. Even if it becomes stronger in the future,
China will not pursue aggression and expansion, still less will it
seek hegemony. This, as a matter of principle, has been written
into China's Constitution.
</P>
<P>
China is not the former Soviet Union, nor is it the old-time
Germany or Japan. China is China. It will not follow the beaten
track of other countries. It seems that those people crying "China
threat" don't bother to study either history or reality. They are
only interested in finding a new "enemy" for the United States
after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Even if they can not find
one, they must create one, as if only by doing so can the United
States carry on as a superpower. This, in fact, is the revival of
the Cold War thinking under new conditions today. It is indeed
regrettable that such thinking has resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
Recently, there has been much media coverage about the
so-called "political contribution" made by China in the United
States. We have an old saying in China, "Just as you do not want
others to do things that hurt you, do not do the same thing to
them." In handling its relations with other countries, the Chinese
government has all along strictly observed the principle of
non-interference in each other's internal affairs. Just as China
is opposed to foreign interference in its internal affairs, it
definitely does not interfere in the internal affairs of other
countries. Having suffered greatly from foreign interference,
China does not in any way meddle in other countries' domestic
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Sure, there are political contributions and money politics in
the United States. But they have nothing to do with China. Some
people make groundless charges against China and try to tarnish
its image. They just want to give vent to their opposition to the
improvement of China-U.S. relations. But I am confident that
China-U.S. relations are bound to go forward. Any attempt to
derail them by such low means will get nowhere.
</P>
<P>
Because there are imbalances in China-U.S. trade, some people
fear China will become "another Japan." Actually, China's trade
surplus with the United States has been greatly overstated. As for
the main cause for this issue, I think it is better to leave it to
the experts of the two countries to discuss. But I can say for
certain that China will not become "another Japan" in trade.
</P>
<P>
Japan is a highly developed and industrialized country.
Economically, it is very competitive. But China is a developing
country with a rather weak industrial base. Japan's export to the
United States is mainly made of high value-added,
technology-intensive products. As for China, it mainly exports low
value-added, labor-intensive products such as textiles, footwear
and toys to the United States. Especially such products like
footwear and toys are either no longer produced or produced only
in small amounts in the United States. Therefore, import from
China of such goods will not cost American jobs. Rather, it brings
about a lot of benefits to American consumers.
</P>
<P>
On its part, China imports from the United States a lot of high
technology products such as aircraft, machinery, electronic
products, telecommunication equipment and other products to meet
its urgent needs of economic development. Therefore, China-U.S.
economic and trade relationship is not one of competition. Rather,
it is a trading relationship in which the strong points of one
side complement the other side. In the foreseeable future, China's
economy will not pose any threat to the United States.
</P>
<P>
I am glad to note that China-U.S. economic cooperation and
trade have maintained good momentum of growth. In 1996, the United
States became China's No.2 trading partner, with total two-way
trade reaching 42.8 billion dollars. By the end of 1996, the
United States had invested in over 22,000 projects in China with a
total paid-in capital of 14.29 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
We welcome greater involvement by American businesses in
China's development program and their participation in competition
in China's market. This will fully tap the vast potential of
economic cooperation and trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
And I want to tell you this. As its economy grows, China will
open its market still wider and increase its import from the
United States. At the same time, we hope that the American
government will further liberalize its control over technology
export and credit lending to China, and remove all the man-made
hurdles that hinder the entry of American products into China's
market.
</P>
<P>
The current practice of reviewing China's MFN status annually
not only harms our bilateral economic relations and trade, but
also affects China-U.S. relations as a whole. The American
business community and more and more people with vision in the
United States are calling for a permanent solution to the MFN
issue, so as to base our economic and trade ties on a solid
foundation of long-term stability. I believe what they are doing
is sound and farsighted.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Meets Senior U.S. Officials, Lawmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today held talks with senior
U.S. officials on relations between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Qian
said that he hoped those man-made restrictions affecting the
normal development of Sino-U.S. trade ties be removed, so that
China could import more U.S. goods as it has great potentialities
to do so.
</P>
<P>
Qian also said that the annual review of the most-favored-nation
(MFN) trade status for China is one of the problems that affects
the trade and economic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that the United States has become aware of the
importance of the settlement of the MFN issue and China's entry
into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Defense Secretary William Cohen at
Pentagon, Qian said that the Sino-U.S. military exchanges have
made headway over the latter half of last year.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that the United States upholds the policy of
engagement instead of containment toward China and he expected
there would be a prosperous and stable China emerging in the world.
</P>
<P>
Qian also met several U.S. lawmakers, including House speaker
Newt Gingrich and William Roth, chairman of Senate Committee of
Finance, and explained to them China's policies on Hong Kong,
Taiwan, nuclear non-proliferations and the entry into the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich and other U.S. lawmakers, recalling their visits to
China earlier this year, said they were impressed by the progress
China has made in its economic reforms and they hoped to
strengthen the ties between the U.S. Congress and China's National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
They said that they appreciated Qian's explanation of China's
policies, which they said could help them know and understand more
and deeper about China.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia decided to increase
the government employees' pay by 20 percent as from May 1, a press
report said today.
</P>
<P>
The pay fund in educational and medical units will go up by 25
percent, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia will have to pay 8.6 billion togrog (about 10.8
million U.S. dollars) more for this hike, Health and Social
Security Minister Lhagvajav Zorig told a news conference on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Up to 142,000 employees are paid by the government. The current
monthly pay for a common employee is 20,000 togrog (about 25
dollars) and that for a minister or a province governor is 40,000
togrog (about 50 dollars).
</P>
<P>
People began to go on the streets and asked for higher pay and
improved living standard since the end of last year because of the
decline of the country's economy in the second half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian government has taken some measures, such as
canceling import duties, reducing taxes of enterprises and
increasing employees' pay, to help restore production, attract

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 29 -- The following are the major economic
news briefs from Latin America over past few days:
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Brazilian exports of software will reach 150
million U.S. dollars over the next 5 years, up 50 percent compared
with current amounts. The country's software exports in the
international market have increased since offices of the Softex
(Brazil) Company were opened abroad.
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE -- While 2,106 informal industrial companies initiated
operations in Costa Rica during the 1990-1996 period, only 372
industrial companies did so legally, figures from the Chamber of
Industries of this Central American country showed.
</P>
<P>
This means that during that period, the rate of growth reached
50 percent for the former versus just 8.3 percent for the latter.
</P>
<P>
According to data from the General Statistics and Census
Department, more than 70,000 Costa Ricans or 50 percent of the
economically-active population engage in informal economic
activities.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Argentina exported 322,436 tons of fresh citric
fruit last year which represented an increase of 25.3 percent over
the previous year to establish a new record in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Food
pointed out that this figure makes Argentina the 8th largest
exporter of citric fruits in the world after Brazil, the United
States, China, Mexico, Italy, Egypt and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The harvest for that period yielded 1,825,514 tons versus
2,098,650 tons harvested in the previous growning season.
</P>
<P>
CARACAS -- The Venezuelan government and the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) signed a 14 million-dollar loan in
Washington which will serve to stabilize and fortify Venezuela's
financial system.
</P>
<P>
The loan was approved in 1995 and part of it has been exercised
through a technical group coordinated by Venezuela's central bank.
</P>
<P>
The program is part of an effort coordinated by the IDB, the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to lend technical
assistance to Venezuelan authorities so that they can correct the
weakness in their regulating institutions as well as strengthen
them in the short and medium periods.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Welcomes EU Decision on Easing Trade Curbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry
today welcomed the decision of the European Union (EU) on granting
Serbia trade preferences.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that the EU decision is a major step
toward promoting and developing comprehensive cooperation between
Yugoslavia and the EU.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Yugoslavia believes the time to
accelerate its all-around relations with the EU has come.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from the EU's 15 member states decided
earlier today at a meeting in Luxembourg to ease trade
restrictions on Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The decision means that Yugoslavia will be allowed duty free
access and elimination of tariffs for the bulk of its industrial
products and some of its farm goods to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia exported 1.86 billion U.S. dollars' products to EU
member states last year. But because it did not enjoy special trade
privileges then, its foreign exchange earnings was reduced by 450
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations placed a trade embargo on Belgrade in 1992
after the Bosnian war broke out. It was lifted last October.
</P>
<P>
The EU planned to ease quotas and duties against Yugoslavia
last winter, but cancelled the move because of massive street
protests in Belgrade against the annulment of local elections in
November.

More than 200 people were killed and many schools and education

<HEADLINE> ASEAN FMs to Recommend New Membership Timing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 30 Xinhua) -- ASEAN foreign ministers will work
out a recommendation for their leaders on the timing of the
admission of Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar into the regional
grouping, according to Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn.
</P>
<P>
He said the heads of government of the seven ASEAN countries
would then have to make a final decision on the issue and make
either an official collective ASEAN announcement or individual
announcements of the entry date of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
The leaders will make the political decision based on the
recommendation submitted by their foreign ministers, who will hold
an informal meeting on May 31, and the annual formal one in July,
both in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers will base their recommendation on the
ASEAN Secretariat's assessment report, which is being prepared, on
the situation and readiness of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN Foreign ministers will not make the decision, Prachuab
said in Phuket, where he is holding meetings with his Philippine
and Singaporean counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Late last year ASEAN leaders decided to grant full ASEAN
membership to the three countries simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Their entry has been hoped to take place this year as ASEAN
celebrates its 30th founding anniversary. The inclusion of all 10
countries in the region had been the goal of the ASEAN founders.
</P>
<P>
However, the three countries may not be considered ready for
their admission this year. Cambodia, for example, has not yet
passed legislation essential for its entry because of a row
between its co-prime ministers and domestic instability.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. government has exercised pressure on ASEAN
not to make Myanmar an ASEAN member because of what it calls
"woeful human rights performance."
</P>
<P>
ASEAN countries have announced that their decision on the three
countries' admission will not be influenced by the U.S. stance.
</P>
<P>
Among the three, Myanmar, as a member of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), is reported to be ready to integrate into the
ASEAN economic schemes -- ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). Accession
to AFTA is the key criterion for ASEAN membership.
</P>
<P>
When asked of the possibility of the three candidates not
joining ASEAN this year, Saroj Chavanaviraj, Thai foreign ministry
permanent secretary, said, "Only if something very dramatic
happens."
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN has its own way of deciding one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
One potential way could be "admission first, talks after"
(AFTA), some analysts say.

<HEADLINE> India Unable to Hold Talks with Pakistan in Early May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- India has conveyed to Pakistan
its inability to hold the next round of foreign secretary-level
talks in the first week of May due to logistical reasons," the
Hindustan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to finalize mutually convenient dates for the talks
soon," an External Affairs Ministry spokesman said here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman admitted that certain suggestions for holding the
talks in early May were received from Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Islamabad said Pakistan favored the talks to be
held on May 1-3.
</P>
<P>
"However for logistical reasons this could not be accepted," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, the dates for the next round of comprehensive talks
on all outstanding issues between the two countries would be
worked out during the summit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in Maldives from May 12 to 14 where
Indian Prime Minister I.K. Gujral and his Pakistani counterpart
Nawaz Sharif are expected to meet, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Mid-Term Election Likely in Nepal After Local Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's ruling partner and
biggest party in parliament may call a mid-term general election
if the local polls next month go in favor of the party, a top
party leader said.
</P>
<P>
President of the Communist party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML) Man Mohan Adhikari Tuesday told reporters in a
district of southern Nepal, where he was on a campaign tour for
the forthcoming local elections, that his party might consider the
choice of mid-term polls if the local elections favor the party.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted an overwhelming victory for his CPN-UML party
in the local elections scheduled from May 17, according the local
press here today.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML hopes to win the control of over half of all the
4,000 local administration bodies at village, municipality and
district levels through next month's elections.
</P>
<P>
It currently holds less than one-third of all the local
authorities throughout the country while main opposition the
Nepali Congress (NC) party controls most of the rest.
</P>
<P>
The NC party, once the biggest and majority party in the
country, was overpowered in parliament by the CPN-UML through a
1994 mid-term election called by the then NC government.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML joined the present ruling coalition of Prime
Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand, a leader of the rather smaller
National Democratic Party (RPP), in early March when a NC-led
coalition government lost a confidence vote in the hung
parliament.
</P>
<P>
CPN-UML leaders believe that their party would become the
majority in parliament if a mid-term election be held.

<HEADLINE> NATO Entry Not to Affect Hungary-Romania Ties: Roman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Relationship between Hungary and
Romania would not be affected if NATO decides to admit only one of
the two countries ahead of the other at its July summit, visiting
Chairman of Romanian Senate Petre Roman said today.
</P>
<P>
"It will not have a negative influence on bilateral ties if
NATO should accept only one of these two countries as a member at
its Madrid summit in July," Roman told reporters after a meeting
with his Hungarian counterpart, Gal Zoltan.
</P>
<P>
"But it would be unacceptable if it accepted none of these
two," Roman added. He arrived here Monday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
He said Hungary and Romania share common strategic aims and his
government would not change its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Gal agreed and said relationship between the two countries was
characterized by a breakthrough in establishing mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Hungary would give its full support to Romania's admission to
NATO, Gal said.
</P>
<P>
In January 1994, NATO officially announced its expansion plan
to take in former Warsaw Pact member states from eastern and
central Europe. The Warsaw Pact was NATO's arch rival in the Cold
War era.
</P>
<P>
The plan has triggered strong opposition from Russia. However,
the 16-member alliance is expected to announce in July which
former Warsaw Pact member states are to be included in the first
wave of its enlargement, with Hungary, Poland and the Czech
Republic the front-runners.
</P>
<P>
Romania and Slovenia are considered as the next strongest
contenders.
</P>
<P>
Also today, when addressing Hungary's Elte University, Roman
reiterated that he believed his country would be one of the first
new NATO members.
</P>
<P>
NATO should avoid enlarging itself with discrimination, Roman
said. If excluding Romania, he said, the enlargement would only
result in a dismemberment in central Europe.
</P>
<P>
For central European countries, a NATO membership could help
lighten the burden caused by system transition and guarantee their
future development, Roman added.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Roman also said that without Russia, the
security of Europe was unimaginable, therefore, it was not allowed
to exclude Russia outside Europe. Apart from signing an agreement
with Russia, NATO should also attach importance to cooperation
with Ukraine, he added.

<HEADLINE> About 73 Million Children Work Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey made by the
International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that 73 million
children under the age of 18 work throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
This figure does not include the number of girls who do
housework.
</P>
<P>
Although international organizations, such as ILO and the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), have made great efforts
for years to establish legal standards worldwide for minimum work
ages, the results have been modest.
</P>
<P>
In Venezuela alone, there are more than 350,000 children
between 10 and 17 who are working under poor conditions, said a
UNICEF report entitled "1997 World Situation of Children".
</P>
<P>
Another survey conducted by the National Institute of Minors
(INAM) on child labor reports that more than 72 percent of the
working children are not getting any legal protection because they
are normally working in the informal economic sector.
</P>
<P>
Most of them are exploited and exposed to dangerous situations
with work days that can be described as slavery, says the survey.
</P>
<P>
An average of 69.3 percent of them work double or triple shifts
and 61.5 percent work 6-7 days a week. On average, they work 5.4
days a week and 7.3 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 4.2 percent of the child laborers are involved in
activities that trespass the border between work and crime, like
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
Poverty, family breakdown, labor deregulation and the desire to
reduce costs to compete in a globalized world are reasons for
child labor.
</P>
<P>
In face of the serious situation, the Venezuelan government
prepared a plan of action in 1996 to protect children and improve
the working conditions of those who had to work to help support
their families.

<P>
CARACAS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's international
reserves fell to 15.583 billion U.S. dollars on April 21, a drop
of 303 million dollars from a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's international reserves were 15.461 billion dollars
in January, 15.807 billion dollars in February and 15.976 billion

acronym in Spanish).
</P>
<P>
However, the reserves have still risen 354 million dollars from
last year's close of 15.229 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the drop to the accelerated growth of
imports and the outlays for external commitments as well as
maturities of letters of credit and national debts.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also explained that the stability in the exchange rate
was one factor that encouraged purchases of foreign products.

<HEADLINE> NZ, Japanese Prime Ministers Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and New Zealand Prime Minister Jim
Bolger held what they both described as "frank and wide-ranging"
talks this morning.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after an hour-long
meeting, Bolger said NZ values its trade ties with Japan which is
NZ's second largest trading partner, but the two countries also
agree so much on many areas beyond trade.
</P>
<P>
Beside bilateral relations, he and Hashimoto also touched
matters including APEC, Japan's relations with the United States
and China.
</P>
<P>
Bolger said Japan supports the access to the Euro-Asian
dialogue by Australia and NZ, and NZ backs Japan's bid for
permanent membership in a reformed United Nation's Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
On the reforms NZ experienced a few years ago and now Japan has
expressed much interest, Bolger said he and Hashimoto agreed that
benefits will come at the end of reforms.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the conditions in NZ are different with those
in Japan, so the way of reforms in Japan should not be the same.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said the visit to NZ is "an element of the Asian-
Pacific diplomacy that I have vigorously promoted since taking
office."
</P>
<P>
He said he had a "frank exchange" of views with Bolger which
covered bilateral relations and regional matters.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the close relations between the two countries in
terms of economic and personnel exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Asked by a NZ journalist what assurance he has given to Bolger
about Japan's liberalization in agriculture to allow in more NZ
products, Hoshimoto's reply was not specific.
</P>
<P>
He said the most important issue is to implement step by step
the agreement of the Uruguay Round talks and Japan will not impose
restriction on any country.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, Hashimoto, a keen mountaineer, will go for a
short walk in a forest park with Bolger near Wellington.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Prime Minister, who arrived here late last night,
will fly home tonight after attending a dinner at Bolger's house.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka government has
decided to construct a new harbor in Colombo adjacent to the
present Colombo Port on an urgent basis to enable the country to
meet the challenges of the next century.
</P>
<P>
According to Shipping and Ports Ministry sources today, the
government has taken this decision in order to develop the Colombo
port technologically to meet the increasing market pressures.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that in line with demand studies, it is
estimated that the Colombo Port is required to increase capacity
by 4 million TEUs (containers) in the medium term and provide a
deeper basin capable of handling modern and larger ships.
</P>
<P>
It had also been decided to expand the present Queen Elizabeth
Quay of the Colombo Port to meet the short term capacity by 4
million TEUs in the medium term, the sources stated.
</P>
<P>
The Master Plan for the brand new harbor in Colombo has been
approved by the government. It will be constructed on the southern
side of the existing Colombo Port.
</P>
<P>
The construction costs will be funded by traditional donor
countries and feasibility studies have already been prepared.
</P>
<P>
Volume handled in 1993 was 853,886 containers. It increased to
1,356,301 containers last year, according to the official
statistics.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Malaysia Reach Accord on Islands Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Malaysia Tuesday
reached a special draft agreement on seeking a settlement of the
Sipadan and Ligitan islands dispute through the International
Court of Justice (ICJ), the official Antara news agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the second senior officials
meeting between the two countries held in Bandung, West Java,
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian chief delegate Izhar Ibrahim and his Malaysian
counterpart Dato Andul Kadir Mohamad both said the Bandung meeting
has successfully and amicably drawn up a draft special agreement
which will be forwarded to the foreign affairs ministers of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Izhar Ibrahim said with the results that have been achieved,
the draft special agreement has been completed at senior officials
level.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the document was not yet totally completed,
because amendments or changes were always possible after the draft
has been handed to the foreign ministers of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The first senior officials meeting (SOM) was held in Kuala
Lumpur in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
The SOM constituted a follow-up of an agreement between
Indonesian President Soeharto and Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Muhammad to settle the islands dispute before the ICJ in
the Hague.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders in their agreement reached in Kuala Lumpur in
October 1996 also stated that they would accept any judgment by
the ICJ.
</P>
<P>
The two tiny islands on the border between Serawak and
Kalimantan, have long been become a dispute between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The dispute is a 106-year-old legacy of the two countries'
former colonial rulers -- the Dutch in Indonesia and the British
in Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Beijing To Attack Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's environmental
protection work this year will emphasize on air pollution
prevention and control, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing based newspaper quotes mayor Jia Qinglin as saying
that the municipality determines to abide by the State Council's
requirements on controlling the amount of pollutant discharge and
improving the urban environment by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Starting on June 1, petrol containing a large amount of lead
will be banned in eight urban districts of the capital. The use of
lead-free petrol is expected to reduce lead discharge into the air
by 46 tons this year. It will also enable the installation of
catalytic converters to remove pollutants from vehicle exhaust
gases.
</P>
<P>
The city's agencies in charge of public traffic and
environmental protection should also tighten inspections of auto
emissions. Other causes of air pollution also will be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 million cubic meters of natural gas will be piped into
the city from Shaanxi and Gansu provinces in 1998, which is
expected to eliminate 12,000 tons of sulphur dioxide and 36,000
tons of smog, improving the city's air quality, the paper
reports.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta: U.S. Sanction on Myanmar to Be Ineffective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has stated that the
U.S. sanction on Myanmar will be ineffective while ASEAN is still
considering Myanmar's bid to be admitted as a member without any
pressure from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Foreign Ministry spokesman Ghaffar Fadyl reiterated
here last night a statement made by Foreign Minister Ali Alatas in
Bangkok, Thailand, last week, that sanctions would not be relevant
or workable in the case of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN is a group of independent countries, so that other
countries can not put pressure on the group. Nobody knows better
than ASEAN itself what is good or bad for ASEAN," Fadyl noted.
</P>
<P>
Admitting Myanmar into ASEAN membership was a more effective
way to change the political and economic conditions in the country
than isolating Yangon from the international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States stepped up its pressure on ASEAN (Association
of Southeast Asian Nations) last Friday by openly opposing
Myanmar's entry into ASEAN. Washington also announced economic
sanctions on Yangon as a condemnation of the military regime's
alleged human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, has declared that it
will admit Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos at the same time once they
meet the group's economic and other criteria.
</P>
<P>
The group, which is establishing a free-trade-area, has not set
a date, but analysts believe the three will be admitted this year
to mark ASEAN's 30th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Malaysia and Thailand had also brushed aside U.S.
economic sanctions on Myanmar and pledged to go ahead with ASEAN's
preparations to admit Yangon.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (53-54) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (53-54) in
a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: What governmental posts in the Hong Kong SAR must be
held by Chinese citizens?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Only Chinese citizens who are permanent residents of
the Hong Kong SAR with no right of abode in any foreign country and
have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of
not less than 15 years may fill the following posts: Secretaries
and Deputy Secretaries of Departments, Directors of Buries,
Commissioner Against Corruption, Director of Audit, Commissioner
of Police, Director of Immigration and Commissioner of Customs and
Excise.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive of Hong Kong SAR must be a Chinese citizen
of not less than 40 years of age who is a permanent resident of
the region with no right of abode in any foreign country and has
ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not
less than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Question: What posts are open for non-Chinese citizens among
permanent residents of the Hong Kong SAR?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Hong Kong is an international economic metropolis, and
many people not of Chinese nationality have held public service
posts. The future government of the Hong Kong SAR welcomes these
people to continue working in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, the government of the Hong Kong
SAR may employ foreign nationals serving previously as public
servants in Hong Kong or those holding permanent identity cards of
the SAR, to serve as public servants in government departments at
all levels, except for the following posts: Secretaries and Deputy
Secretaries of Departments, Directors of Buries, Commissioner
Against Corruption, Director of Audit, Commissioner of Police,
Director of Immigration and Commissioner of Customs and Excise.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government of the Hong Kong SAR may employ
foreign nationals as advisers to government departments and, when
required, may recruit qualified candidates from outside the SAR
to fill professional and technical posts in government departments.
</P>
<P>
The above provisions are reasonable. They not only embody
Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong and the policy of "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong" but also dispel misgivings of
non-Chinese citizens among Hong Kong's public servants.
</P>
<P>
These provisions of the Basic Law will no double stabilize the
rank of public servants. But, more important, they aim to maintain
Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
This policy is conducive to the economic development of Hong
Kong and to its developing trade and cultural exchanges with the
rest of the world.

<HEADLINE> Early Persian Ceramics Discovered in East China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Persian ceramics dating back to
the Tang Dynasty (618-907) have been found in some city ruins in
Ningbo city in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the city was one of four major
seaports in ancient China and that the find provides new evidence
of an ancient "ceramic road", similar to the "silk road", on the
sea.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that, from the 7th to the 18th century,
that a route ran from the Arab countries via the Persian Gulf, the
Indian Ocean, and Malaysia to Guangzhou (Canton) and from there to
Fuzhou in today's Fujian Province and Ningbo and Yangzhou in
Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Persian ceramics have been found only in Fuzhou and
Yangzhou. The new finds, which date from the 8th or the 9th
century, are inferior in quality to Chinese porcelain made in the
Yueyao Kilns in Zhejiang, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
They assume, therefore, that the ceramics were not for trade
purposes but were articles brought to China by foreign business
people for their own use.

as all the senior army officers attended the meeting, which was
hosted by the mixed coordination committee of the ruling FUNCINPEC
Party and the Cambodian People's Party.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued after the meeting, Cambodia has
made great achievements in national reconciliation and economic
construction since the government was formed four years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, "the current situation of Cambodia had not only
worried us, but also caused great concerns of the international
community," the statement said, adding that it had seriously
affected the country's stability and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Co-Prime Ministers Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen
agreed to try to stablize the country's situation and resolutely
avoid any military conflict, it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement required all the armed forces to keep neutral,
stay away from party strifes and keep political and social
stability so as to guarantee the coming national elections.
</P>
<P>
The tense situation in Cambodia has begun to ease after the
meeting, according to local media.

<HEADLINE> China Fights Drug Addiction (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A girl of only 20 years old,
Zhang has been addicted to drugs for three years. She sought help
in local hospitals or private clinics to quit drugs four
times, but never succeeded.
</P>
<P>
She is now in the Compulsory Rehabilitation Center under the
Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, where she was sent this
March after being caught by the local police while buying drugs.
</P>
<P>
"Now I hardly have the desire to take drugs, and have gained
eight kg here," said Zhang, who declined to give her full name.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse is one of the social problems that have cropped up
in China since the 1980s. In 1995, China had some 520,000
registered drug addicts. The figure has been on the rise in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Baotong, deputy director of the Anti-Narcotics Office
under the Beijing municipal government, said that last year the
city found 904 local drug addict, up from 36 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government this month launched a nationwide
anti-drug campaign that is scheduled to last half a year. One
major goal of this campaign is to effectively reduce the current
number of drug addicts and control the emergence of new addicts.
</P>
<P>
Located in the suburban district if Fangshan some 60 km from
the downtown area, the Compulsory Rehabilitation Center under the
Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau is the capital's only
medical institution that practices compulsory rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Four other hospitals in Beijing provide voluntary
rehabilitation for drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
Lu Qiulin, head of the center, said that her institution, which
was founded in early 1995, now houses a total of 132 drug addicts,
all directly sent from local public security departments.
</P>
<P>
"The compulsory rehabilitation usually takes three months, and
is divided into two phases -- physical rehabilitation and
psychological rehabilitation," said Lu.

<TEXT>
<P>
The second phase, she said, mainly consists of health and legal
education, with the purpose of preventing cured addicts from
taking drugs again after their rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, we manage the patients in a semi-military manner,
which has reinforced the rehabilitation efforts," she added.
</P>
<P>
China's Minister of Public Security Tao Siju recently announced
that all drug addicts across the country are subject to compulsory
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
The country currently has 628 compulsory rehabilitation
centers, as well as 86 special reeducation-through-labor centers
that accommodate and provide rehabilitation for drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Zhao Baotong, the deputy director of the
center, it is more important for the anti-drug campaign to enable
the entire population to know about the danger of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over 80 percent of the drug addicts in
China today are below the age of 35 years.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, the 20-year-old Beijing girl, recalled that she first
tried drugs because of curiosity and persuasion by her addicted
friends.
</P>
<P>
"I never imagined that a person could become addicted to drugs
so easily," she said regretfully. Having stayed at the center for
more than one month, she still looked ill and had a grey face.
</P>
<P>
Lu, the center manager, said that some 90 percent of her
patients became addicted because of ignorance about drugs and
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, especially since the beginning of April,
newspapers, magazines, and radio and television stations across
China have engaged in a major publicity drive against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Most frequently used in these reports is one short sentence --
"Cherish your life and keep away from drugs".

<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Customs has seized
for the first time 21.5 g of the narcotic "ice" from a package of
imported goods, a Customs source said.
</P>
<P>
Two anti-drug teams under the General Administration of Customs
found something unusual in a package when carrying out a routine
check on a batch of imported cargo April 16.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Customs put the item under close watch, but no
one claimed it until April 23, when an agent of the cargo's owner
came to take delivery of it. With the help of the departments
concerned, Customs officials had the package opened and found in
it a plastic bag hidden in packaging for metal parts for hydraulic
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The bag contained white crystals which turned out to be
deoxidized ephedrine, commonly known as "ice", which is a highly
addictive chemical compound.

<P>
HELSINKI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Sweden maintained its winning
streak by beating Norway 4-1 on Tuesday at the ice hockey world
championship in group B played in Turku, Finland.
</P>
<P>
In Helsinki, Finland kept alive its hope of playing in the
final with an easy 6-0 win against Germany in Group A.
</P>
<P>
Sweden fell behind when Matts Trygg intercepted a long clearing
pass at the blue line and blasted a low slapshot past surprised
netminder Johan Hedberg.
</P>
<P>
But in the second period the Swedes moved ahead 2-1. Defenceman
Marcus Ragnarsson levelled the scores. Michael Nylander set up the
second for Per Eklund with a dazzling move.
</P>
<P>
Nylander sealed Norway's fate just 17 seconds into the final
period when he stole the puck from Jan-Roar Fagerli then broke in
alone on Schistad.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's victory left it at the top of the group with six
points. Norway have lost its opening three matches. Like Norway,
Germany have lost three opening games and both squads look certain
to travel to Tampere for the relegation play-offs next week after
the peliminary round-robin group games.
</P>
<P>
Finland leads group A with four points but still has to play
Russia and Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
Finland's game against a worn-out Germany resembled 60 minutes
of power-play. On Monday, Russia beat the Germans 5-1.
</P>
<P>
After Sunday's loss against titleholders the Czech Republic,
the win was important for Finland to enter the final.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Geothermal Energy in Southwestern Part </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build a number of
medium-sized geothermal power stations in Tibet and the western
parts of Yunnan and Sichuan provinces by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to developing geothermal resources with
reservoir temperatures over 200 degrees centigrade in Yangbajing
of Tibet to increase the efficiency of power generation,
according to Zhang Qi, an energy expert at the Tianjin Geothermal
Research and Training Center.
</P>
<P>
The largest unit capacity in China is only three MWe now. In the
year 2000, the largest unit capacity in Yangbajing will reach
10MWe, he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country will build power stations with a
capacity of 3-5 MWe in Ruili in the western part of Yunnan
Province and explore the geothermal resources in Tengchong in
Yunnan and the western part of Sichuan Province by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
China has discovered 3,000 hot spring sites, about 2,200 of
which are higher than 25 degrees centigrade. High-temperature
resources, which formed two geothermal belts, are distributed
mainly in Tibet, Yunnan, and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The direct use of geothermal energy in China has a long
history. However, large scale exploration began only twenty years
ago. The total energy power utilization is about 2,410
MWt. Geothermal energy have been widely used in space heating,
industry, agriculture, and greenhouses.

<HEADLINE> A Day For China in Table Tennis Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China, which swept
all seven world titles in 1995, continued the dominance of table
tennis by taking the women's team event and booking a men's final
berth at the 44th World Championships on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women trio led by world No. 1 Deng Yaping beat the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea to win the Corbillon Cup for
the 12th time, whearas their men players downed the South Koreans
in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
China had an easy women's final since its top threats Japan and
South Korea had been knocked out in early rounds.
</P>
<P>
World No. 4 Yang Ying put China on the winning track as she
beat Wil Bok Sun in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Deng, who has bagged four Olympic gold medals,
had sent China 2-0 ahead with a convincing win over losing Olympic
semi-finalist Kim Hyon Hui before Li Ju won the third game against
Tu Jong Sil.
</P>
<P>
Chinese veteran Wang Tao, who delayed his retirement to check
South Koreans in the world championships, proved his value by
snatching two points from his longtime rivals at the men's
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Wang, who has excellent record against South
Koreans, completed China's victory by nipping Kim Taek Soo in
three sets.
</P>
<P>
It was a sweet revenge for China, who has lost to South Korea
three times since the 1995 Worlds where it edged out South Korea
3-2 en route to winning the championship.
</P>
<P>
Double Olympic champion Liu Guoliang put China one up as he
beat Kim in a clash of the world best penholders.
</P>
<P>
Wang had grabbed the second game from 72nd-ranked Ou Sang Eun
before Yoo Nam Kyu pulled back one point.
</P>
<P>
South Korean veteran Yoo Nam Kyu, ranked 19th in the world,
outplayed defending singles champion Kong Linghui 21-18, 10-21,
21-18.
</P>
<P>
Frenchmen reached their first-ever team final at the world
championships as Damien Eloi got the advantage of German Steffan
Fetzner in the deciding game.
</P>
<P>
Eloi, famed for his devastating forehand yet notorious for
inconsistency, displayed excellent poise and balance, employing
strong topspin strokes from both wings.
</P>
<P>
After taking the first set 21-15, the Frenchman widened the gap
to a usually unbeatable 17-8 and snatched the second set 21-11 to
seal France's victory.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Philippe Gatien, 1993 world champion now ranked 12th,
overcame midgame setbacks to beat Fetzner 26-24, 9-21, 21-17 at
the opening game.
</P>
<P>
Jorg Rosskopf, former European champion and Olympic bronze
medalist, evened the score with a 21-11, 21-18 triumph over Eloi.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Chila, rated 17th in the world, regained lead for
France as he downed Peter Franz 21-18, 21-13 in the third game.
</P>
<P>
Gatien failed to beat history as he lost the fourth game to
Rosskopf. The ninth-ranked German had beaten Gatien for eight
straight times before going into this match.

<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Damien Eloi nerved
himself in the deciding game against Germany, anchoring France
into its first-ever men's team final at the the World Table Tennis
Championships here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
World No. 29 Eloi beat more heralded Steffan Fetzner in
straight sets, putting France into the final clash with defending
champion China, which defeated South Korea 3-1 in the other
semi-final earlier.
</P>
<P>
Eloi, famed for his devastating forehand yet notorious for
inconsistency, displayed excellent poise and balance, employing
strong topspin strokes from both wings whereas 24th-ranked Fetzner
failed to reach his best form and looked nervous throughout the
game.
</P>
<P>
After taking the first set 21-15, the Frenchman widened the gap
to a nearly unbeatable 17-8 and snatched the second set 21-11 to
seal France's victory.

Rosskopf. The ninth-ranked German had beaten Gatien for eight
straight times before going into this match.
</P>
<P>
Gatien got the first set 21-13 as the German was struggling to
find his form.
</P>
<P>
Rosskopf, whose ferocious backhand is stronger than many of his
peer's forehands, came back strongly with lightning backhand flat
shots and split-second forehand attacks, winning the ensuing two
sets 21-16, 21-19.

<HEADLINE> Major Calls on Voters to Vote for British Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major,
in his last-ditch effort to win Thursday's election, today called
on the voters to vote for the country's unity, sovereignty and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"This election is about the unity of the United Kingdom. It is,
literally, a battle for Britain.... If we lose, Britain will
change, yes -- change forever, change for the worse," Major told
the rally in east London, the last major campaign effort before
the election.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to fight right up to the last minute to keep our
economy booming, to stand firm in Europe and to keep our United
Kingdom one," added the prime minister, who is lagging far behind
the opposition Labor leader Tony Blair in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
Major said a Conservative victory would mean further steps
along the road to a prosperous Britain which his party had already
done much to build over the 18 years it has held power.
</P>
<P>
"The British people -- all the British people -- can go on to
reap the richest harvest we've ever known," he said.
</P>
<P>
The British economy has developed smoothly and healthily these
years with the unemployment rate down and inflation stable. But
the opinion polls show the voters are tired of the 18-year rule of
the Conservatives and want a change in the British politics.
</P>
<P>
Major stressed the importance of the voting which, he said,
would decide whether Britain's current economic success, based on
a low-tax, lightly regulated economy, would continue and whether
the country would escape the twin dangers of fragmentation into
its constituent nations and of the centralizing clutches of the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister earlier spent most of his last campaigning
day to attack the Labor party for their claims that another
Conservative government would scrap the state retirement pension
and put value added tax on food.

<HEADLINE> Dow Surges Back by 179 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
was flirting with its biggest-point gain ever today after a tame
reading on employment cost, a key force behind inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Dow soared by 179.01 to 6,962.03. It was the third Tuesday
in a row that the Dow broke the record for its second-biggest
point gain after a 186.84-point gain that came two days after the
Black Monday crash of 1987.
</P>
<P>
Today, the Dow once made a nearly 188-point gain that would
have been the biggest ever for the blue-chip barometer.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 4-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where NYSE volume totaled
547.67 million shares, much more than 402.42 million in the
previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list jumped 21.09 points to
794.05, and the NYSE's composite index rose 9.94 to 413.63.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 25.61 to 1,242.64, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 6.83 to 548.03.
</P>
<P>
The rally put the Dow within striking distance of 7,000 for the
first time since the start of a nearly 700-point retreat from its
March 11 high of 7,085.16. The Dow has now recovered more than 500
points of that one-month slide.
</P>
<P>
Stocks also gained strength from the bond market, where
interest rates plunged below 7 percent, a psychologically
important barrier after the Labor Department reported that
Americans' wages and benefits rose a modest 0.6 percent in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm over today's employment cost data was bolstered
by two separate reports suggesting that other inflationary
pressures may be easing.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that factory orders for
big-ticket durable goods unexpectedly plunged 3 percent in March,
the biggest decline in seven months. The Conference Board research
group, meanwhile, reported that consumer confidence dropped for
the second straight month in April.
</P>
<P>
Investors have been worried that without signs of economic
moderation, the Fed will raise rates again.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Retreats on Weaker Economic Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell today for
the first time in nearly a week after new data suggested an
unexpected slowdown in economy, reducing possibility the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates at its May meeting.
</P>
<P>
The surprisingly tame economic reports led to strong rallies in
the stock and bond markets and sent the Dow Jones industrial
average up 179.01 points, its second biggest point gain ever.
</P>
<P>
But the data sent the dollar down at the foreign exchange
market where investors locked in profits on the currency's recent
gains.
</P>
<P>
The dollar settled at 1.7243 marks, down from 1.7330 Monday.
The dollar cost 126.87 yen, down from 126.98. The pound cost
1.6316 U.S. dollars, up from 1.6247 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday:
5.8120 French francs, down from 5.8385; 1.4675 Swiss francs, down
from 1.4740; 1,707.00 Italian lire, down from 1,718.00; 1.3977
Canadian dollars, down from 1.3998.

<HEADLINE> EU Admits Turkey's Eligibility for EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
said that it recognized the eligibility of Turkey for EU full
membership after intensive talks with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu
Ciller in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek, EU commissioner for relations with central and
eastern Europe, told a press conference today that the meeting
with Turkey had shown the importance the EU attached to EU-Turkish
relations.
</P>
<P>
Both sides emphasized their concern over the Customs Union
between Turkey and the EU, which entered into force on December
31, 1995, saying that it had to be further developed.
</P>
<P>
Ciller today expressed her disappointment over "a lack of
cooperation" from Greece, which maintained its veto on the EU's
financial aid of 375 million ECUs (some 450 million U.S. dollars)
to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
However, Greece and Turkey have agreed to appoint about two
personalities each, non-governmental and not necessarily nationals
of the two countries, to consider the position and submissions of
both governments on issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said that this was "a step forward in the right
direction," which could help study ways of solving issues
presented by both countries.
</P>
<P>
The Association Council, which Turkey and the EU called their
meeting today, had been boycotted by Greece for 18 months before
it took place in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the EU also raised issues which it said Turkey
should take into consideration if it wanted to further strengthen
its relationship with the EU. The issues included human rights,
rule of law and fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Saying they had conducted "very good" talks, both sides of the
meeting indicated that Turkey's accession to the EU should be
achieved on a step-by-step basis.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government, which has been working hard to pursue
the EU membership, said that Turkey should be judged by the same
criteria in which the EU member states were being judged. It asked
for an "equal and fair" judgement.

<HEADLINE> Britain Not to Be Sidelined by EMU, Says Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
said today his country would not be sidelined at international
economic summits if it did not join the European Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Conservatives' last election rally before the
May 1 election, Major said London was one of the major financial
centers in the world and Britain would maintain its important role
in world economic policy.
</P>
<P>
"London is one of the financial centers of the world, and will
stay that way. The suggestion that the European Union would take
over all representation on economic policy for members of the
single currency is just the kind of danger I have been warning
about," Major said, adding he "would never accept that."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in response to suggestions by European
commissioner for monetary union Yves Thibault de Silguy that a G3
summit consisting of America, Japan and the European Union would
replace the G7 summits of the world's major economic nations,
describing it as "absurd and arrogant."
</P>
<P>
The EMU will be launched on January 1, 1999 and those EU
countries which fail to reach the criteria of keeping their budget
deficits below 3 percent of the gross domestic product are allowed
to join the single currency later.
</P>
<P>
Major has adopted a policy of "wait and see" about joining a
single European currency. The opposition Labor party, which is set
to replace the Conservatives in Thursday's election, also promises
a referendum on whether to join the EMU.
