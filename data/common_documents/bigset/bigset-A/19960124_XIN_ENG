<HEADLINE> UN Called on National Reconciliation in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 24 (xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today called upon all Somali leaders and parties
to return to an inclusive process of consultation and negotiation
aimed at national reconciliation, according to a presidential
statement of the council.
</P>
<P>
In the statement adopted today, John Weston of Britain,
president of the council for January, said that the Security
Council was deeply concerned about the absence of any credible
progress towards national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
While expressing welcome to efforts of the Organization of
African Unity and other international organizations and
neighbouring states, the council reaffirmed that the people of
Somalia bore ultimate responsibility for achieving national
reconciliation and restoring peace, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"In this respect, the council urges the leaders of Somali
factions to reject violence and place the interests of the country
and people above their personal differences and political
ambitions," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The continuing conflict and the resulting insecurity, banditry
and general lawlessness increased the suffering of the civilian
population, the council noted.
</P>
<P>
"The council condemns the harassment, beatings, abduction and
killings of personnel of international humanitarian organizations,
and underlines the responsibility of all parties in Somalia for
ensuring the safety and security of humanitarian and other
international personnel," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The council also called upon the Somali parties and factions to
open the Mogadishu main seaport and other transportation
facilities for delivery of humanitarian assistance, which was a
crucial factor in the overall security and stability of Somalia,
according to the statement.

<HEADLINE> Peres Hopes for New Israeli-Palestinian Ties (By Xie Dongfeng and Wang Yukui) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EREZ, ISRAELI-GAZAN BORDER, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel and
the Palestinians should "convert the Oslo 2 agreement into new
relations" between the two peoples, said Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres here today.
</P>
<P>
Peres was speaking at a joint press conference along with
Yasser Arafat, newly elected President of the Palestinian
Authority, following their meeting.
</P>
<P>
The best way for two different peoples to live together is to
establish a good neighborly relationship instead of war and
violence, said Peres.
</P>
<P>
"We should not only devote ourselves to the continuation of the
peace process, but also should devote ourselves to establish a
new kind of relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
This was the first meeting between the two leaders after
Arafat was elected president on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Peres congratulated Arafat on his success in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The success of the Palestinian elections were "a great promise
for us to go forward with the peace process," said Peres, adding
that the elections have given the world a new image of the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The elections also showed that the majority of the Palestinian
people supports the peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about future steps, Peres demanded that the Palestine
National Council (PNC) abolish clauses in the Palestinian charter
which call for Israel's destruction within two months.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that the Israel would fulfill its military
redeployment in Hebron by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that both sides would start negotiations on the
permanent status of the occupied territories in May and Israel
will begin the second-phase redeployment in October.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, both leaders also discussed the issue of
Israel allowing more Palestinians to work in Israel. Peres told
reporters that Israel would allow 3,000 Palestinians from Hebron
to work in Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres warned that the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) should do more to combat anti-Israeli attacks by Islamic
extremists in order not to "complicate the situation."
</P>
<P>
In his turn, Arafat told reporters that the meeting was
"fruitful and positive."
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the PNA will work with the Israeli government
to strengthen relations between the two sides, not only between
the political leaders, but also between the masses.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader also expressed his hope for
breakthrough in Israel's peace negotiations with Syria and
Lebanon so that there will be a lasting and just peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
When asked about his recent remarks about establishing a
Palestinian state within one to one and half years, Arafat said
he and Peres did not discuss this issue.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Arafat said "It's my right to dream,"
expressing the hope that this goal could be achieved.
</P>
<P>
In response, Peres said that "dream should be one-sided, but
an agreement must be two-sided."
</P>
<P>
During today's meeting, Peres and Arafat held face-to-face
talks for half an hour and were later joined by officials from
both sides.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the meeting were Nabil Shaath and Jamil
Tarifi, who are both newly elected members of the Palestinian
Council, Israeli Knesset (parliament) speaker Shevach Weiss and
Uzi Dayan, head of the Planning Branch of the Israeli army.

<HEADLINE> Major Advocates Elections in Ulster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major announced in the parliament this afternoon that he was
willing to hold elections "as soon as praticable" to provide a
mandate for all-party talks in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Major made this announcement as a response to the report
compiled by the international commission in charge of arms
decommissioning process in the conflict-torn province.
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that rival paramilitary groups in Ulster
will not decommission any arms before all-party talks on the
province's political future start.
</P>
<P>
It maintains that the twin-track approach to the peace process
be carried out simultaneously, namely, some arms decommissioning
be considered during all-party negotiations.
</P>
<P>
And this is opposed to the position of the British government
which has always insisted that the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
must start to decommission at least some weapons before its
political wing Sinn Fein can be admitted to all-party talks.
</P>
<P>
Major told the House of Commons that meausres would be put
before parliament to "clear the way" for an elected body, even
though some people regarded it as a "distraction".
</P>
<P>
He said all-party talks using this "confidence-building" method
was one way of moving on the installed peace process.
</P>
<P>
The other way was for paramilitary groups to hand over their
weapons in advance of negotiations, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that opinion polls in both Ulster and the Irish
Republic had shown overwhelming support for arms decommissioning
before all-party talks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC radio, Major explained that an elected
body in Northern Ireland would not have legislative or
administrative powers.
</P>
<P>
"It will be there for the purposes of facilitating peace and
for that reason alone," he added.
</P>
<P>
Major denied that his "elected body" idea was "the final throw"
in the peace process, saying that it would help achieve the
wishes of the people to bring peace, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mainland Published Tabloid Banned in Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The import of a mainland
published daily tabloid, "Majira" (Times), has from today been
banned in Zanzibar for "tarnishing the image of the Zanzibar
government and its leadership".
</P>
<P>
The newspaper has been carrying articles aimed at destroying
"the good political stand" of the Zanzibar government, local reports
quoted Zanzibar Information Minister Issa Mohamed Issa as telling
a news conference in the town of Zanzibar today.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to ban the tabloid was prompted
by its three issues of January 6, 20 and 21 this year, which Issa
said, carried articles "tarnishing the image of the Zanzibar
government and its leadership".
</P>
<P>
In its January 21 issue, "Majira" carried a front page story
on an opposition rally at Pemba, which said "the Civic United
Front (CUF) maintained its stand not to recognize the current
government and its leadership".
</P>
<P>
Anyone who would
import the newspaper is to be punished accordingly, the Zanzibar
minister warned.

<HEADLINE> Mass Population Movements in CIS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Commenwealth of Independent
States (CIS) is seeking coordinated effort at a conference here to
resolve the problem of mass population movements on its territory
that emerged after the 1991 dissolution of the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
At an expert meeting on the issue currently held here,
documents concerning principles and concrete actions are drafted
and expected to be further considered by governments involved, in
a try to coordinate efforts towards solution of the problem, which
is adding to the difficulties the transition economies in the
region confront.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued Wednesday by the meeting,
the problem of human displacement in the CIS region is found to be
very complex as far as their causes are concerned, which ranges
from regional conflicts to ecological migration.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that regional conflicts in CIS have made at
least 2.4 million people refugees or internally displaced in
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Georgia, Moldova and the Russian
Federation.
</P>
<P>
The release said that returns of people to republics of origin
formed a major trend of the mass migration. It is reported that
some 54-65 million people, or 20 percent of the Soviet population,
were living outside their home republics or regions by the end of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
As far as Russia is concerned, about 2 million among a total of
25 million Russians living outside Russia have so far returned,
with majority of them from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
The release also reported moves of ethnic groups such as
Crimean Tatars and Mekhetians, who and other smaller ethnic
minorities were deported and forced to move out of their homelands
to especially Syberia amd Central Asia during the Stalinist era.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 260,000 Crimean Tatars have returned to Ukraine,
in addition to some 500,000 Ukrainians back from outside the
republic. Up to 220,000 more Crimean Tatars are yet expected to
return.
</P>
<P>
The press release also blamed illegal immigration, transit and
economic migration as well as ecological migrations a as result of
Chernobyl necleur accident and other natural disasters for the
severity of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Still further flows of people for social and economic reasons
are expected, it said.
</P>
<P>
The potential for such movements worries and terrifies the CIS
governments and international communities concerned, said an
official of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) while addressing a press briefing this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
OSCE, together with the International Organization for
Migration (IOM) and the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), organized the CIS Conference
process in early 1995, aiming at devising a comprehensive and
long-term strategy to address the human displacement problem in
the CIS region.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE official described the current expert meeting in
Geneva, a part of the conference process, as "substantive",
however showing not much optimism about an overall solution of the
CIS human displacement problem, saying whatever the result, they
have at least had a try.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Geneva, which is expected to be followed by the
main Conference in late May or early June, was attended by
representatives from all 12 CIS countries but Uzbekistan, and 32
other interested states from the European Union, Central Europe
and other regions, as well as some international agencies.

<P>
GENEVA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Two U.N. agencies proposed today

and communications facilities and sanitation, health and education
services, as well as poverty alleviation and income generation

<HEADLINE> Boutros-Ghali Prepares to Talk with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali held the first meeting
with his senior advisers Tuesday evening to review preparations
for the discussions with the Iraqi authorities on implementing the
oil for food formula.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, the spokesman for the
secretary-general said that the meeting was held following the
Iraqi Government's acceptance of the invitation which the
secretary-general addressed to Iraq, on the basis of the mandate
given to him in accordance with Security Council resolution 986
(1995).
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by the legal counsel, the
under-secretary-general for political affairs, the
officer-in-charge of the Department for Humanitarian Affairs and
representatives of the Secretary-General's office, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of an analytical study prepared for the purpose,
the Secretary-General reviewed in detail the steps to be taken by
the Secretariat to implement the various elements in the oil for
food formula, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The composition of the United Nations delegation was also
examined, as well as other steps to be taken in advance of the
discussions, including recruitment of the technical experts
required, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General would hold further such meetings during
the coming days and expected shortly to be in a position to
communicate to the Government of Iraq his proposal for the date of
the first round of discussions which will be held in New York, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
After reading the statement, Spokesman Sylvana Foa said that
the secretary-general was very concerned with the "desperate
humanitarian situation" in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Reports showed that the alarming food shortages would do
damages to the entire generation of Iraqi children. According to
the World Food Program, four million people, or one fifth of the
Iraqi population, were at severe nutrition risk. That included 2.4
million children under the age of five and 600,000 pregnant or
nursing women.
</P>
<P>
Deaths from malnutrition increased 8 folds for children under
the age of five since 1989. A sample done on children of streets
in Baghdad revealed that 29 percent of children were underweight,
she said.
</P>
<P>
On the question of inflation in Iraq, she said that the price
of wheat flour, a basic food there, rocketed 11,667 times since
July 1990. Other food prices rose 4,000-5,000 times in the past
years.
</P>
<P>
The cost of food for a family of five on the market was 26
dollars a month while the average monthly wage was between 3-5
dollars and a professor earned about 9 dollars a month, she said.
</P>
<P>
Some people were so desperate that they teared down their
houses to sell bricks for food because they had sold out
furnitures and everything else in their houses, she added.

<HEADLINE> S.Leonean Government Declares Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's new military
government today welcomed the ceasefire announced yesterday by
the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and responded by
declaring its own.
</P>
<P>
According to a radio report reaching here this evening, a
government spokesman said the authorities in Freetown were
waiting for indications from the RUF of how soon peace talks
could start and where they could be held.
</P>
<P>
RUF spokesman Fayia Musa said yesterday the rebel group had
declared a unilateral week-long ceasefire to assess how serious
the new Sierra Leonean military leadership was about peace.
</P>
<P>
In a broadcast to the nation after being sworn in as the new
Sierra Leonean head of state on January 17, Brigadier Julius
Maada Bio made an offer of dialogue to the RUF rebels.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier Bio, who ousted his predecessor Captain Valentine
Strasser in a January 16 bloodless coup, appealed to the RUF
leader to "come out and hold dialogue with us and formally
present his case for our people and the international community
to hear".
</P>
<P>
The RUF said on Monday that it was prepared to hold talks with
the government, their first unconditional offer of negotiations
during the nearly five years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The RUF, headed by Foday Sankoh, launched its revolt in 1991.
The civil war has wrecked Sierra Leone's mining-based economy and
driven more than one-third of the country's four million people
from their homes.
</P>
<P>
It had previously demanded that foreign troops (Nigerian and
Guinean) as well as the South African expeditionary force, the
Executive Outcomes, pull out "before any dialogue can start".
</P>
<P>
The government spokesman, however, did not rule out any
postponement of the planned February 26 elections, which the RUF
said was necessary "so that we can have time to restore peace in
the country".
</P>
<P>
The elections had been pledged by Strasser as a way to end the
civil war.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reaction to Int'l Panel's Report on Ulster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain expressed an
attitude this afternoon toward the report compiled by the
international commission in charge of arms decommissioning
process in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The report was submitted to both British and Irish
governments on Tuesday and its main points were made public
this morning.
</P>
<P>
The report maintains two approaches to the peace process
in Ulster be carried out simultaneously, namely, some arms
decommissioning be considered during all-party negotiations
on the future of the troubled province.
</P>
<P>
It suggests that rival paramilitary groups there disarm
while all-party talks are held to break the impasse which
has lasted for seven months.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that this is the reality in Northern Ireland,
which all parties concerned must confront.
</P>
<P>
A senior British government official said that the
international commission's recommendation would not be
acceptable to Northern Ireland's pro-British Protestant
majority.
</P>
<P>
So the British government, which has always insisted that
the Irish Republican Army (IRA) must start to hand in at
least some arms before its political wing Sinn Fein can be
admitted to all-party talks, would urgently explore the
possibility of an elected body in the province as a stepping
stone to negotiations on a settlement of the conflict, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government said that the commission's report
would significantly advance the task of launching all-party
talks by the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
Dublin in a statement said the Irish and British
governments would intensify discussions with the parties to
agree the participation and agenda of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams expressed welcome to tne
report and accused the British government of effectively
dumping the twin-track approach to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said Prime Minister John Major had adopted an
"entirely unionist" agenda in an attempt to buy unionist
votes at Westminster.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP)
which defends British rule over Northern Ireland, supported
elections in Ulster as early as April or May.
</P>
<P>
He said a recent opinion poll had found that 70 percent
of Ulster's voters supported the call for an election.
</P>
<P>
The more radical Democratic Unionist Party rejected the
commission's report as a farce.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Peacekeeping Troops Heighten Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. peace implementation
forces in Bosnia have heightened security after intelligence
reports suggested that militant Muslim groups were planning
attacks against American targets in the region, the New York Times
quoted U.S. officials as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The possible attacks were intended as retaliation for the life
sentence given to Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman by a U.S. Federal judge
in New York earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Sheik was convicted of plotting terrorist acts aimed at New
York City landmarks and conspiring to kill political leaders.
</P>
<P>
The other reason for plots cited in intelligence reports was
the American pressure on the Bosnian Muslim-led government to
expel the foreign volunteers from Islamic nations who have been
training and fighting along with the Bosnian Muslim troops in the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told
reporters that key U.S. military positions in the former Yugoslav
republic had been put on heightened alert and given added
security.
</P>
<P>
If an attack against U.S. targets took place, it would probably
not take place in an urban area such as the Bosnian capital of
Sarajevo or the northern city of Tuzla, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They expected the Islamic groups to try and strike at
American targets in more isolated areas in the northern,
U.S.-controlled sector.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Authorities Impound a Stolen Greek Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A ship under the name "Maria",
impounded by the Cyprus authorities, was found to be the Greek
vessel "Nikolas Pallis" that had illegally departed from the Greek
Piraeus port last year, the police announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Merchant Shipping of Cyprus has forbidden
the ship to leave Cyprus' southern port of Vassiliko, at where
the ship docked, and has taken extra precautions. At the same
time, it has notified the Athens Interpol police on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The ship had arrived in Cyprus on December 24, carrying a
cargo of 500 tons of aluminium, with a Honduras flag and a Greek
crew.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, according to the Cyprus police, the
three-member Greek crew was replaced by five Syrians on an order
from the ship's Limassol based agent, Panayiotis Mavroudis.
</P>
<P>
The police searched the ship Tuesday, after a tip off, and
found that its travelling documents belonged to the vessel
"Nikolas Pallis" and its rescue boats had the same name on them.
</P>
<P>
The ship had illegally sailed from Greece on December 21 and
according to its crew it docked at Vassiliko port on December 23.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus police was informed by Interpol about the theft of
"Nikolas Bellis."
</P>
<P>
According to the Greek Interpol, the Pireaus Naval Court had
impounded the ship following economic disputes between its
ship owners before it illegally sailed off.

<HEADLINE> Convicted US Spy Gets Israeli Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel today offered
citizenship to Janathan Pollard, who is serving a life sentence in
the U.S. for spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
At a brief ceremony held in his office, Interior Minister Haim
Ramon signed the paper of citizenship and a passport and handed
both documents to Polard's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Ramon expressed his hope that Israeli citizenship will help
secure the release of the Jewish spy. "It is another step that
the Israeli government is doing in order to demonstrate our
efforts and commitment to bring Janathan Pollard to Israel and to
release (him) from prison," Ramon stressed.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by Ramon's predecessor, Ehud Barak,
after a series of efforts made to obtain the citizenship by
Pollard's wife Esther Pollard. She said the citizenship would
help Pollard in his efforts to receive a pardon or a parole.
</P>
<P>
Prime Ministers of all Israeli cabinets, Likud or Labor, have
all raised the issue personally to U.S. presidents, Republican or
Democratic, in efforts to secure his release, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Shimon Peres wrote to President Bill Clinton
and discussed the issue again during his visit to the White House
late last year. However, U.S. Vice President Al Gore said in
Jerusalem last week that it was still premature to say how
President Clinton will decide on the fate of Janathan Pollard.

<HEADLINE> Yabloko Takes Offensive Against Russian Government  (by Zhang Tiegang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Yabloko bloc is
gathering lawmakers' signatures in an attempt to force a vote of
no-confidence in Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's government.
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday, it had already gathered 50 of 90 signatures
necessary to force a State Duma (the lower house of the Russian
Parliament) vote.
</P>
<P>
The bloc's spokeswoman, Yevgeniya Dillendorf, said Grigory
Yavlinsky, a liberal economist who leads Yabloko, planned to
present the petition to Duma's next council meeting scheduled for
January 30.
</P>
<P>
If Yavlinsky succeeds, a simple majority would be enough for
anti-government forces to make Chernomyrdin and his cabinet resign.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin would then have to appoint a new prime
minister subject to the approval of the Communist-dominated Duma.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman refused to comment on the report that Yavlinsky
is intended for the post of prime minister.
</P>
<P>
She said Yabloko's petition was mainly against the government's
poor economic policy and its failure in solving Russia's hostage
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The authorities consciously allowed hostages to be killed,"
the petition stated, blaming Chernomyrdin and his representatives
for failing to stop some 200 Chechen militants who took thousands
of hostages from entering Daghestan in the first place.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 20 non-Yabloko people have joined the battle
against the government, including leader of "People's Power"
party, Nikolai Ryzhkov, and Irina Khakamada from the "Regions of
Russia" bloc.
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear why the 46-strong Yabloko bloc mustered only
about 30 signatures from its members for the petition.
</P>
<P>
Whether Yabloko would be able to collect 226 anti-government
votes will depend largely upon whether they can get the backing of
the Communist Party, a possibility that analysts here doubt will
happen.
</P>
<P>
"If the Communists decide to cast a vote of 'no-confidence,'
they will make a big mistake," said the analysts.
</P>
<P>
The Communists set it as their main objective in the coming
months to win the presidential elections. They won 157 seats in
the 450-member Duma in last month's parliamentary elections and
later the post of Duma Speaker.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts called Yabloko's plan "a clever campaign tactic"
to run for the presidency, though the vote of no-confidence may
not succeed in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Yabloko occupies 28 of the Duma's 450 seats.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Free 45 Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels today handed over
45 civilian hostages to the authorities of the Dagestan region in
southern Russia, reported Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
"Buses with 45 hostages crossed the Chechen-Dagestan border at
around 17:00 Moscow time (1400 GMT) in the direction of
Khasavyurt," the agency quoted a top official of the Khasavyurt
district as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the rebels are still holding at least 20 policemen in
exchange for the militants captured by Russian government forces
last week.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of 42 rebels killed in last week's battle in
Dagestan were handed over to the Chechen rebels today.
</P>
<P>
The hostage crisis began on January 9 when the Chechen rebels
stormed the city of Kizlyar in Dagestan and took more than 3,000
people hostage.
</P>
<P>
They have released most of the hostages under strong military
pressure from Russia.

<HEADLINE> Japan Moves Towards Moderate Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Japan's long-time stagnant
economy is moving towards a moderate recovery in various sectors,
despite mounting unemployment, Kyodo News Service today quoted the
Finance Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Summing up reports from its 11 regional bureaus nationwide, the
ministry said as a result of recent government pump-priming
measures, private consumption, corporate capital spending and
housing construction are improving gradually and moderately.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, production is also heading towards recovery and
corporate confidence is growing, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Even in Hokuriku and Chogoku, where economies were reported to
remain at a standstill, the outlook is optimistic with emerging
signs of recovery, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It said the nationwide individual consumption, notably of
durable goods such as passenger cars and consumer electronics, has
generally been on the way to a moderate recovery.
</P>
<P>
Corporate capital investment gradually went up in both
manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors. The public works
projects remain at high levels.
</P>
<P>
Corporate earnings in the fiscal 1995 ending March 31 are
expected to rise as a result of sales increase, cutbacks in
personnel expenses and interest burdens, and the weakening of the
yen.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the ministry's economic assessment, Bank of Japan
Governor Yasuo Matsushita said today that Japan's economy is
beginning to pick up, though the prospect remains uncertain for
smaller non-manufacturing businesses.
</P>
<P>
"Since small and medium-sized companies have continued to
suffer under severe business conditions on a broad front,
especially in the non-manufacturing sector, it remains uncertain
whether the recovery trend will spread to the entire economy,"
said Matsushita.

<HEADLINE> hke-- Feature: New Upper House Speaker Enhances Yeltsin's Power  (by Zhang Tiegang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The election of Yegor Stroyev, a
protege of President Boris Yeltsin, as speaker of the new
Federation Council, the upper house of parliament, adds strength
to Yeltsin for his possible re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
As an influential governor of the Oryol region, Stroyev can
give more support to Yeltsin, who said Monday that he might seek
re-election for presidency in June, in a struggle against some
regional leaders' independence ambitions and in a possible
confrontation with the opposition-dominated State Duma, the lower
house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev pledged at a news conference after his election Tuesday
to advocate the federal state's interests and preserve Russia's
integrity.
</P>
<P>
"I'll stand for Russia's integrity and a single federal
system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev has been reportedly advocating Yeltsin's interests
among regional leaders since he joined the pro-government "Our
Home Is Russia" bloc last May.
</P>
<P>
This is crucial for Yeltsin, whose popularity has sunk after he
launched a military campaign in the Chechnya region, to get
control over the Federation Council in seeking a second term in
office, although the upper house usually approves bills passed by
the lower house, said some observers.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev, a former member of the powerful politburo during the
last rule of the Soviet Communist Party, may serve as not only a
middle-man between Yeltsin and the Communist Party led by Gennady
Zyuganov, but also a loyal supporter of the president in his
political battles for presidency, the observers noted.
</P>
<P>
Since he became governor of the Oryol region, known as the
center of the so-called "red belt" -- a string of pro-Communist
regions in central Russia, in 1993, Stroyev has for many times
shown his loyalty to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
He has refused to join the Communist Party and vowed to have
nothing in common with his old comrades-in-arms.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party won 157 seats in the 450-member Duma as
well as the Duma chairmanship, and also took over at least one of
the four deputy speaker posts and the leadership in nine out of 28
Duma committees.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev, 58, was elected speaker of the upper chamber on
Tuesday by an overwhelming majority of 147 senators.

<HEADLINE> US New Home Sales Down 2.1% in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. new home sales fell 2.1
percent in November, the fourth straight monthly decline, the
Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that sales of new homes totaled 649,000 units
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, the lowest level in seven
months.
</P>
<P>
Sales of new homes have fallen every month since last July.
</P>
<P>
Sales of new homes for the first 11 months of 1995 were 1.7
percent below the same period of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the seasonally adjusted estimate of
new houses for sale at the end of November was 375,000 units,
representing a supply of 7.2 months at the current sale rate. It
was the largest backlog of unsold houses since a similar rate in
June 1989.
</P>
<P>
Today's report was the latest sign of sluggishness in the
housing market.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe the housing industry is suffering from
low job and income growth, which is offsetting the lowest mortgage
rates in nearly two years that have made the cost of buying a home
more affordable.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.35 percent in
November, down from more than 9 percent as 1995 began. By last
week, rates had dropped to 7.02 percent, lowest since February
1994.

<HEADLINE> Probe Launched over Spy Charges Against Polish PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Polish military prosecutors
today formally opened an investigation into allegations that Prime
Minister Jozef Oleksy was a Russian spy, PAP news service reported.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the decision may result in Oleksy's
resignation, who became prime minister in March, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Oleksy, 49, who has denied the charges first brought up by the
opposition last year, said he would address the issue on
television tonight.
</P>
<P>
Wlodzimierz Pospiech, spokesman for the military prosecutor,
said Oleksy is being investigated for allegedly
"passing ... information to foreign intelligence and participating
in foreign intelligence."
</P>
<P>
Last month, former Interior Minister Andrzej Milczanowski said
in parliament that he had evidence that for 13 years Oleksy passed
information, including classified documents, to a KGB agent in
Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
Oleksy denied the charges but acknowledged he had longtime,
close relations with Vladimir Alganov, a Soviet citizen who later
claimed to be a top KGB spy in Poland. He said he did not know
Alganov was a spy.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian cabinet has already
approved of the restructuring of eight government ministries, a
government spokesman revealed here today.
</P>
<P>
Head of the organizing section at the cabinet office Paul

effectiveness of each ministry.
</P>
<P>
"The main aim is to try and find the right size of each
ministry so that it operates well," he added.
</P>
<P>
Those without proper qualifications will be affected although
most of them will be re-deployed in other government departments,
he further disclosed.

thousands of Zimbabwean villagers in central Masvingo Province
while yellow maize lies stockpiled at market places, a senior

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 24 (xinhua) -- Lesotho's college of
chiefs last week designated King Moshoeshoe's eldest son Crown
Prince David Mohato as his successor, the southern African
kingdom's Deputy Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili confirmed
today on state radio.
</P>
<P>
The late king Moshoeshoe II was killed in a car accident last
Monday in the Maluti mountains when his car veered off the road
and went down the hillside.
</P>
<P>
A state funeral of the king is scheduled to take place on
January 26.
</P>
<P>
He will be buried at the top of Thaba Bosiu, the Basotho
national shrine near Maseru.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili said the Lesotho college of chiefs last week named
the 32-year-old prince successor to the late king under the
kingdom's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Moshoeshoe's wife, Gueen Mamohato, is to act as regent and
head of state until Mohato is sworn in.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince's coronation will be arranged by the
government and the royal family as soon as a period of mourning
for the king is over.
</P>
<P>
"A coronation is a joyous occasion, totally different from the
solemnity of mourning," Mosisili said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lesotho Foreign Ministry disclosed that South
African President Nelson Mandela, Botswana President Ketumile
Masire and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe would attend the
state funeral.

WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) --San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo &AMP; Co. and Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp
announced today they agreed on an 11.6 billion U.S. dollar merger,
the largest bank combination deal ever in this country.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after winning a three-month hostile
takeover bid that will create the eighth-largest bank in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The combination is expected to eliminate at least 7,000 jobs in
California, half of them in Los Angeles, and shut down hundreds of
First Interstate branches in California.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has terminated a rival offer for the First
Interstate by First Bank System Inc. of Minneapolis, which now
agrees to receive 200 million dollars in fees for the termination
of its friendly takeover agreement which was reached on November 5
last year.
</P>
<P>
The deal is expected to be completed in the second quarter this
year.
</P>
<P>
Outside California, First Interstate has 710 branches in 12
states with 21,800 employees and the impact of the merger is
expected to be less grave there.

CAIRO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Middle East Development Bank,
which will be headquartered in Cairo, will start operating next
year, an Egyptian official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Foreign Minister for International Cooperation Raouf
Saad Said was quoted by the Middle East News Agency (MENA) as
saying today that about 1.25 billion U.S. dollars out of the
regional bank's total capital of 5 billion dollars have already
been paid.

A meeting on establishing the bank will be held in Cairo on
February 13, he said.
</P>
<P>
He told MENA that he will head the Egyptian delegation to the

</P>
<P>
The bank is expected to give priority to infrastructure
projects which will be established by the private sector without
any government support, he added.
</P>
<P>
Any country that contributes up to 4 percent of the bank's
total capital has the right to have a seat in the board of the
bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority and Israel will
get seats in the board regardless of the volume of their
contributions, he added.
</P>

The United States, Japan, Italy and Russia have been qualified
to have seats in the board, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The three-day "Round Table on
Single Currency" organized by the European Commission(EC) ended
here today, with the official lunching of a EURO information
campaign to make Europe's citizens, businessmen and governments
fully aware of the single currency issues at stake.
</P>
<P>
In an General Conclusion adopted at the end of the Round Table,
the EC announced the "immediate start" of the communication
exercise relating to the single currency.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided to set up, on the initiative of each Member
States of the European Union(EU), a national body responsible for
steering the move to the EURO.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard the consistency of the communication strategies,
the EC is planning to set up at Community level a specialist group
involving the Community institutions and interested Member States.
</P>
<P>
According to the EC, this group will be set up "as soon as
possible" and will be requested to produce an initial report by
the end of June.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also proposed that the information campaign should
deal with countries outside the EU, particularly with trading
partners, private operators and individuals in non-Union
countries, to show "how the introduction of the EURO will make a
significant contribution to greater international monetary
stability and hence to world growth".
</P>
<P>
Some 600 representatives attended the three-day meeting. At the
meeting, High-profile European politicians, in particular Economic
and Finance Ministers, the President of the European Monetary
Institute and the governors of the respective central banks,
opened proceedings by giving their vision of communication
requirements and appropriate resources.
</P>
<P>
The work of the Round Table was organised around three
workshops which respectively deals with the problems and the needs
of consumers, enterprises, particularly in the banking and
financial sector, and public administrations.
</P>
<P>
At the Madrid Summit last December, the European Union leaders
have agreed unanimously that the European Economic and Monetary
Union will be formally launched on January 1, 1999, and that the
single currency is dubbed the "Euro".

<HEADLINE> HK Association Re-names Soccer Team for Asian Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's presence at next
week's Asian Cup soccer qualifying tournament seemed secure, with
a new Hong Kong team named today. But that by no means indicates
the sport's local governing body has settled disputes with a rebel
group.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA) re-named a 25-player
squad for the Asian Cup Group Two qualifying tournament which
kicks off next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It replaced a side the association named on Monday. The HKFA
decided at an executive committee meeting Tuesday evening to
disband the squad, fearing it might be boycotted by a rebel group
which had threatened not to provide players for the Hong Kong
team.
</P>
<P>
Lan Kin-ming, chairman of the First Division club Eastern and
also vice-president of the HKFA, was named as the general manager.
</P>
<P>
Tsang Wai-wah, the team's former coach sacked only days ago,
was called back to reinforce two junior coaches, Lo Kwok-wah,
coach of the Hong Kong youth team, and Yuen Kuen-to, coach of the
women's squad.
</P>
<P>
There were only minor changes in the players, with one defender
and two mid-fielders replaced.
</P>
<P>
Although some of the HKFA officials breathed a sigh of relief
after this afternoon's selection committee meeting at the HKFA
headquarters, a representative of the rebel Association of the
Hong Kong Professional Football Clubs (AHKPFC) thought the other
way.
</P>
<P>
Ken Ng Kin, who is now the spokesman for the nine senior clubs
under the AHKPFC, said after the HKFA selection committee meeting
today: "We have never said that we'll boycott the Asian Cup meet
and we've made continuous efforts in helping forming a Hong Kong
team for the event."
</P>
<P>
He seemed satisfied with the naming of Lam Kin-ming. "Mr. Lam
Kin-ming, as the team's general manager, would serve as a valuable
bridge between the AHKPFC and the HKFA," he said.
</P>
<P>
A Carlsberg spokesman said yesterday a drawing ceremony for the
event would be held tomorrow as planned.

Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin urged the whole Party to
improve its leadership in the country's media and ideology work
here today.
</P>
<P>
"We must stick to the correct direction of public opinion, and
must first help newspapers, periodicals, news agencies, radio, and
television keep to their correct publicity direction," Jiang said
in a speech at a national conference of provincial Party committee
propaganda department heads.
</P>
<P>
"The media must remain firmly in the hands of our Party," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang revealed that the next meeting of the Party's central
committee -- the Sixth Plenum of the 14th Party Central Committee
-- will focus on the building of the socialist culture and
ideology.
</P>
<P>
"Building of culture and ideology mainly means the building of
ideology, ethics, and culture," Jiang explained.
</P>
<P>
"In covering such major issues as those relating to the
interests of the people, Party principles, national security,
unity of ethnic groups, and foreign relations, the media must
follow the Party Central Committee's guidelines," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Promoting reforms, pushing development, and safeguarding
stability must be the criteria and goals of newspapers, news
agencies, radio and television stations, and publishing houses,"
the Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
"While working for the flourishing of the arts, literature, and
publications, we must pay close attention to their
administration," he said, adding that "we must strictly ban the
cultural trash poisoning the people and social atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot sacrifice culture and ideology merely for a short
period of economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese premier Li Peng who attended the meeting, said, "The
media and ideology are not only the work of the Party committees
at all levels, they are also the work of government at all levels."

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian director-general of
the National Atomic Energy Agency, Djali Ahimsa, assured here
today that the government does not need to find another site for
the planned-nuclear power plant in central Java.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after reporting to President Soeharto about
the project.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that a feasibility study carried out by a Japanese
and Swiss consultancy group will be completed in May or June this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. and the U.S.-based
Westinghouse have expressed their interest in building the 7
billion US dollars worth nuclear power plant in Gunung Muria,
central Java, with the planned capacity of 1800 mw.
</P>
<P>
The government has predicted that the nuclear power plant will
be completed in three to four years time starting this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that Indonesia has plenty of uranium deposits in west
Kalimantan and Irian Jaya. However, as uranium exploration in the
two regions are too costly, Indonesia might import uranium at the
time when the nuclear power plant will be built, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the safety of the plant, he expressed hope to make the risk
small by building the plant with eight-cm steel and two-meter
concrete walls.
</P>
<P>
on handling of uranium waste, he assured that the waste will be
kept in the nuclear power plant site but will later be sent to a
remote and uninhabited island in the country.

BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Bateer scored 12 of his 20
points in the second half and pulled down 14 rebounds to pace the
Beijing over Shandong 80-70 Wednesday for all its seven home
victories in the first 13 rounds of the China Basketball League.
</P>
<P>
The result also was Beijing's second win over Shandong this
season. Beijing beat Shandong 63-51 in its first round game in
Jinan last month.
</P>
<P>
Forward Gong Xiaobin scored 26 points and Center Ji Minshang
added 25 points and 10 rebounds for Shandong, who recorded 8 wins
and 5 loss.
</P>
<P>
"We have chance to win the game," said Zhao Xuanmin, coach of
the Shandong team.
</P>
<P>
"We were too nervous offensively in the second half. Also, I
don't think one of two refrees tonight was qualified for his
job. He called wrong fouls as least three times in the last five
minutes -- I'm sure."
</P>
<P>
But Beijing's coach Yuan Chao said: "There were some wrong
calling for both sides. We won the game because we were better in
the offense and defense in the second half. Shandong is a quicker
team."
</P>
<P>
Beijing (11-2) came from a 18-27 behind to take the lead at
halftime with 37-36. And the game became even more harder for the
host away through the game as Beijing didn't widen the margin
until with last two minutes left, using a 7-0 run and building a
78-66 edge.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, the August First scored a lopsided victory over
the Guangdong Hongyuan 108-80, keeping unbeaten with 13rd straight
win.
</P>
<P>
In the other games on Wednesday, Liaoning trounced Jiangsu
107-86; the Jinan Army beat the Nanjing Army 89-71; the Air Force

<P>
SHANGHAI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Suburban areas have become
Shanghai's important development zones, with the best potential
and the best hope, Huang Ju, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal
Party Committee, said today at a local agricultural work meeting.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995, the GNP in the city's suburbs was
65 billion yuan (about 7.8 billion US dollars), 26.4 percent of
the city's total GNP.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, suburban industrial output topped 190 billion
yuan (about 22.9 billion dollars), with added industrial value
accounting for 60 percent of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that agriculture has emerged in the suburbs even
while new manufacturing centers have tended to shift there, with
eight municipal-level industrial zones having been approved.
</P>
<P>
Suburban areas have also become popular spots for foreign
investment. By the end of 1995, 6,129 joint ventures, or
foreign-funded, and cooperative firms had been approved, making up
44 percent of Shanghai's total and attracting 9.67 billion dollars
in foreign investment.

</P>
<P>
Becker, fourth-ranked in the world, served 28 aces during the
match. He crashed Kafelnikov's counter-attacks with his
impressive volleys.
</P>
<P>
Becker shrugged off a disputable line call and rallied from
behind at 1-5 to take the second set. He had the rest of match in
his control.
</P>
<P>
Becker will face Australia's Mark Woodford, the only unseeded
player entering the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
He enjoyed a good chance to win the semi-finals and to face
either Andre Agassi or Michael Chang in his way for the
championship.
</P>
<P>
Since Agassi survived another five-set struggle with world
No.8 Jim Courier of the United States, he is expected to have a
difficult time in coming battle with American Chang, world
fifth-ranked.

<HEADLINE> Jiaohe Restoration Project Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The first phase of a
Sino-Japanese project has been completed to help save the world's
oldest and best-preserved city ruins from natural and man-made
destructions.
</P>
<P>
The Jiaohe Ruins, on a leaf-shaped plateau in the Yarnaiz
Groove, 10 km west of Turfan, in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, date back some 2,300 years.
</P>
<P>
Historical records of the city are scarce before the Second
Century BC when it became the capital of the ancient Jushi Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Situated on the route between the Orient and the Occident, it
was a place of strategic importance during subsequent dynasties
until it was destroyed by fire during fighting of the Yuan Dynasty
(1271-1368).
</P>
<P>
The most attractive parts of the city may have been its
architecture. Many buildings were carved out of the earth, using
bricks or rammed earth.
</P>
<P>
The ruins were listed as the first group of cultural relics
under state protection in 1961, but have always been threatened by
erosion and by tourists more recently.
</P>
<P>
To save the city, a trust fund of one million U.S. dollars for
protection and conservation was organized in 1992 by the State
Bureau of Cultural Relics of China, UNESCO, and the Japanese
Government.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has also collected some one million yuan
for the three-phase project, which is expected to be completed by
2002.
</P>
<P>
The first phase, from 1992 to 1995, involved a detailed plan of
the project, a 710-m dike for flood protection, restoration of the
Northwest Small Monastery, a 3,247-m tourist path with some 1,270
m paved with pottery bricks, 97 signboards, and installation of a
weather and micro-climate monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
"The project's goal is to restore the city to its original
look, extending the 'life-span' of the ancient ruins made of
soil," said Xie Yaohua, former deputy director of the Cultural
Department of Xinjiang and executive manager of the project.
</P>
<P>
Xie recently came to Beijing and gave a talk on the first phase
of the project to some cultural officers from foreign embassies in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the tourist facilities, such as the paved path, may
damage the site, Xie explained that without the pavement the
original earth path will be worn away because some 100,000
tourists visit Jiaohe every year.
</P>
<P>
"We have tried to keep the new structures in harmony with the
ruins," he explained, "The pottery, using the same color as the
ruins, has been made to look old, and those that could have
spoiled the view have been removed, such as the path between the
southern gate and the Great Monastery."
</P>
<P>
According to Xie, the second and third phases will include
preservation of the Great Monastery, the Pagoda Grove, the Great
Pagoda, government offices, the Northeast Small Monastery, the
main avenue, parapet, Yarhu Cave Temples, common dwellings, and
the city's eastern gate, as well as building another dike and an
exhibition hall, and reinforcing a cliff using the earth-anchor
method.
</P>
<P>
Excavations will continue during the projects entirety, he
said. The archaeologists have already excavated a total of 8,300
sq m in the city, and more than 1,000 relics have been unearthed,
such as embroideries, paintings, Buddhist sculptures, coins, and
gold, silver, iron, pottery, bone, wooden, stone and lacquer
ware.

<HEADLINE> Yemen to Be Granted 500 Million Dollars in Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Donor nations and organizations
decided to give Yemen 500 million U.S. dollars in aid, with
the aim of helping it successfully implement its economic reform
program for this year.
</P>
<P>
This came in a statement issued Tuesday by the Donors
Conference for Yemen in The Hague, Yemeni newspapers reported
today.
</P>
<P>
"The Hague conference studied carefully Yemen's need for aid
in 1996 -- which was estimated at 500 U.S. dollars -- and adhered
to the aforesaid amount, which is an exceptional contribution by
some donor nations, in addition to the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund and the Arab Monetary Fund," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a number of the conference participant countries
also committed themselves to giving development assistance to
Yemen, thus meeting Yemen's financial needs this year.
</P>
<P>
The conference announced that a coordination and follow-up
committee made up of Yemen, the World Bank, the IMF and the
government of Holland would be formed to follow up the execution
of the program approved by the conference.

<HEADLINE> Party Members Wearing Insignia in Nanjing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, January 24 (Xinhua) -- On the streets of east China's
Nanjing, visitors these days often see government employees, shop
assistants, taxi drivers, hotel staff, and restaurant owners
wearing a badge with red hammer-and-sickle on their lapels.
</P>
<P>
The badge also bears the words "Serve the people" -- a
quotation from late Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
Wearing the badge is part of a campaign launched by the
organization department of the Nanjing Municipal Communist Party
Committee last September in an effort to remind Party members of
their duty as well as to put them more in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
"During important holidays and political events, Party members
who are on duty in transportation, commercial departments, post
offices, hotels, and public security are required to wear the
communist symbol," Shanghai's Wenhui Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Most Party members have shown enthusiastic support for the
move," said the report, "and have started wearing the badge almost
every day now."
</P>
<P>
"Wearing the Party insignia will always remind me that I am a
Communist and that I should always pay attention to the Party's
image and should never do anything bad to dirty the Party's
image," a man named Zhang was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Taxi drivers who wear the Party badge prominently attract more
passengers and make more money than non-Party-member drivers, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
"I feel safe and will not be overcharged riding a taxi driven
by Party members," a passenger was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Wearing the Party badge is a creative activity for Party
members under the new conditions," Zhang Zhizong, head of the
Nanjing Municipal Party Committee's organization department says.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Offering his own idea of limited government to compete with
the Republican vision, President Clinton Tuesday night challenged
the nation to provide enough educational opportunities, economic
security and freedom from crime to allow Americans to make the
most of an "age of possibility," in his State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
-- House and Senate Republicans agree to delay action on the
national debt limit, but failed to agree on details on a bill
intended to keep the Government from another partial shutdown on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
-- Japan's giant trade overall trade surplus shrank in 1995 for
the first time in five years, led by a substantial narrowing in
its politically sensitive gap with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton last night declared that the "era of big
government is over" and sought to ease middle-class anxieties with
an upbeat vision of a nation pulling together to ready itself for
the new century.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Apple is on the verge of accepting a takeover bid by Sun
Microsystems. People close to the matter say the two have agreed
on the basic outlines of a stock swap valued at about 4 billion
dollars, or 33 dollars for each of Apple share - a tiny premium
over Apple's recent stock price and one that indicates how little
clout the struggling computer maker is perceived to have.
</P>
<P>
USA Today:
</P>
<P>
-- Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole accused President Clinton of
"clinging to the policies of the past" in Tuesday night's State of
the Union address.

<HEADLINE> No Arms Decommissioning Before All-Party Talks: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The international commission in
charge of arms decommissioning process in Northern Ireland has
suggested that rival paramilitary groups there disarm while
all-party talks are held to break months of diplomatic stalemate.
</P>
<P>
A report on Ulster's arms decommissioning process was submitted
by the commission to both British and Irish governments on Tuesday
and its main points were made public here today.
</P>
<P>
The commission, chaired by former U.S. senator George Mitchell,
stressed that its suggestion was made on the basis of the reality
in Northern Ireland, which all parties concerned must confront.
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that two approaches to the peace process be
carried out simultaneously, namely, some arms decommissioning be
considered during all-party negotiations.
</P>
<P>
To push the talks forward, the report proposes six principles
in a bid to build trust among all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
The parties should renounce the use or the threat of use of
force and take effective steps to end the killings and beatings in
recent months, it added.
</P>
<P>
After finalizing the details of the disarmament in practice,
the report indicates that the peace process should suggest neither
victory nor defeat.
</P>
<P>
The report maintains that an elected convention or assembly in
Northern Ireland proposed by the Ulster Unionist Party might also
contribute to building confidence.
</P>
<P>
It says that only when the parties themselves take resolute
action could the peace process achieve progress.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process will move forward or this society could slip
back to the horror of the past quarter-century," it warns.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-two people were arrested
for illegal trade of foreign exchange in the black market in the
past six months, a press report said here today.

illegal trade of over 51 million U.S. dollars and some were

clamp down heavily on illegal trading of foreign currencies in
Iran and also on smuggling of goods.

<HEADLINE> China's Southernmost City Refuses Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANYA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- International tourist agencies
may have concluded that Sanya is still a rare pollution-free area,
but officials of this tourist spot on Hainan Island in the South
China Sea have their worries.
</P>
<P>
"The increasing number of cars, streams of tourists, and
upsurge in industry are all potential causes of pollution," said
Liu Yanming, director of the Environment and Resources Bureau of
Sanya.
</P>
<P>
Many reports have praised Sanya's beaches and sunshine and have
compared it to Hawaii, but people are becoming more and more
worried about pollution as the economy grows.
</P>
<P>
Liu maintains that Sanya will avoid the problems encountered by
many mainland Chinese cities, which have been suffering from
pollution since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
"Our city gives major financial support to two
sectors: education and environmental protection," Liu said,
explaining that the government has promulgated 14 regional
environmental laws in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Xinhua found Sanya to still be a very clean city, with
water so clear that the sea bottom can be seen in many places, and
the stars are always bright at night, in contrast to the dullness
people see in most mainland cities.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, pollution-reduction facilities have been
installed in two cement plants, the only polluters in Sanya, using
an Austrian government loan.
</P>
<P>
The city has even rejected a 250-million-yuan proposal from a
printing and dyeing mill in Guangdong Province, because it may
cause severe pollution.
</P>
<P>
"A highway was designed to go through a forest which had rare
tropical trees. Many deputies of the city's regional People's
Congress complained when they heard of the plan. The government
finally changed the design to avoid the forest after the deputies
submitted proposals," Liu said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Other measures the city has adopted include building sewage
treatment plants and garbage disposal centers, banning fishing and
the selling of green turtles and coral, and requiring drivers and
hotel managers to install anti-pollution devices, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
In addition, tourists might be asked to pay environmental
taxes, as they do in some foreign cities.
</P>
<P>
Liu has developed a good practice himself to go along with
this. Whenever he eats out, he takes the leftovers back home, and
has them there for the next meal. "In this way I reduce
pollution," he explained.
</P>
<P>
He's supported by the director of the city's tourism bureau,
who maintains that "international tourists are avoiding cities
that have bad reputations in environmental protection".
</P>
<P>
Other cities have made an effort to prevent them from becoming
more polluted so as to earn foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has asked tourists to wear special shoes inside the
Palace Museum. Suzhou, an eastern tourist city, built its
high-tech districts at a distance from its famous gardens.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Song Jian said recently that environmental
protection will have a great influence on economic development and
people's living standard by the turn of the century.

<HEADLINE> Handicapped Afghans Protest Road Blockade to Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABD, January 24 (Xinhua) -- About 150 Afghans who became
handicapped in the Afghan war held a demonstration in Kabul today
to protest against the road blockade to the capital, said a report
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Marching through the streets, the demonstrators called for the
opening of roads to Kabul and the holding of ceasefire and peace
talks between warring factions, said the report.
</P>
<P>
They proceeded to a UN agency in the city and presented a
petition appealing UN peace envoy Mahmood Mestiri to put pressure
on the Mujahideen groups to open the roads.
</P>
<P>
The main supply route from Pakistan's border city of Peshawar
to Kabul has been cut off in the past ten days due to dispute on
road taxes among members of the Hezb-i-Islami led by Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, the arch rival of President Buhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
The other three supply routes to the city have also been cut
off by other factions opposed to the Kabul regime.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown has caused an acute shortage of food and fuel in
Kabul, sending commodity prices soaring in the city.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Food Shortage To Be Relieved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maputo, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government and
the World Food Program (WFP) today forecast an increase of food
production this year and hoped for the relieving of the country's
food shortages.
</P>
<P>
According to a state radio report, food production in 1996 is
expected to increase by at least 5.7 per cent to over 1.2 million
tonnes, thanks to sufficient rainfalls.
</P>
<P>
The WPF report said about 1.2 million Mozambicans would not
have to depend on the international emergency food relief if the
target is achieved.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mozambique's food production totaled 1.135 million
tonnes, resulting in food shortages up to 450,000 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
The southern African country is reported to need an annual
1.58 million tonnes of food. The government this year plans to
lower the food shortage to a level of 380,000 tonnes.

<HEADLINE> Major Growth for Construction Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China's construction industry
has had unprecedented growth over the past five years, said
Minister of Construction Hou Jie here today.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), employment in the
industry grew at an annual rate of seven percent, compared with an
average of two percent in other areas, Hou said at a national
conference on construction which opened today.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, China completed 250,000 basic construction
projects, 809 of which were large ones.
</P>
<P>
These included: the Qilu and Yangtze petrochemical projects,
the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, Baoshan Steel Complex's
second-phase, the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan expressway, Shanghai's
Yangpu Bridge, Wuhan's second Yangtze River Bridge, and Beijing's
Western Railway Station. These and a few other massive projects
indicate that China's construction technology is among the world's
best.
</P>
<P>
During this period, China also did work in and provided labor
for 169 countries or districts, earning 17.9 billion US dollars,
1.6 times the figure for the previous period, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that China injected 76 billion yuan
(about 91.6 billion US dollars) in urban residential construction
during the period, completing a total of one billion sq m of
housing, up 58 percent over the previous five-year period.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to 1995, the floorspace of urban residences grew by
200 million sq m annually, something unprecedented in the
country's history, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The country invested 244.1 billion yuan in urban infrastructure
over the last five years, greatly improving the investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
China has also stepped up the urbanization process with
priority being given to developing small towns, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The construction industry in China now employs 32.5 million
people.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Dropped 11.4 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Japan's huge overall trade
surplus posted the first yearly drop in five years in 1995, down
11.4 percent to 107.10 billion U.S. dollars, the Finance Ministry
said today.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts say the decline is likely to continue, helping to
ease tensions with Japan's trading partners, especially the United
States, and to keep the U.S. dollar strong.
</P>
<P>
The politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States
also scored its first decrease in five years, falling 17.0 percent
to 45.56 billion dollars, the ministry said in a preliminary
report.
</P>
<P>
Behind the decline was the rise of the Japanese yen in recent
years, which encouraged imports of everything from American
personal computers to Australian beef, while crimping Japanese
exports of such products as cars and video cassette recorders.
</P>
<P>
On a customs-cleared bases, Japan's overall exports in 1995
rose 12.0 percent to 443.02 billion dollars, posting an increase
for the 13th consecutive year, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Imports for 1995 rose 22.3 percent to 335.92 billion dollars,
marking the third successive year of increase, it said.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Japan's global trade surplus rose 0.8 percent to 120.8
billion dollars, a record high for the third successive year. The
figure also marked the fourth consecutive annual increase.
</P>
<P>
The surplus with the United States in 1994 also hit a record
high of 54.9 billion dollars, prompting stronger political
pressure in the United States to further open Japanese markets.

HONG KONG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A new tourism event, the Hong
Kong-Xinjiang Five-Day Tour, will soon be staged jointly by
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and China Travel Service (Hong
Kong) Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Li Donghui, vice-chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Regional Government, said at a press conference today that the
new tourism event, sponsored at the suggestion of Vice-Premier
Zhu Rongji, aims to further explore the rich tourism resources of
the region and promote economic exchanges between Hong Kong and
Xinjiang.
</P>

Located in northwest China, Xinjiang is known for its colorful
tourism resources, which features cultural relics along the "Silk
Road", wonderful natural views and plain folk custom. Tourism
facilities in the region have been quickly modernized in the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
Li said that in 1995 Xinjiang received over 200,000 tourist
arrivals from overseas, with an income of more than 60 million US
dollars, while the number of domestic tourists exceeded one
million person times, earning 650 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said that chartered planes will be provided for Hong Kong
tourists to join the new tourism event, which is expected to start
in the first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Somali Warlord Welcomes Continued UN Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mogadishu, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A Mogadishu warlord today
called on the United Nations to take the "last chance" to end
Somalia's ethnic.
</P>
<P>
The call came after the United Nations' recent decision to
further operations of its liaison office for Somalia in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi Mohamed, leader of the Somali Salvation Alliance
(SSA), told a press conference here today that he appreciated the
efforts devoted by the U.N Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
The warlord said the United Nations had lost its way following
its failure to disarm the warring factions during the operation
of the multi-national forces in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
"They shouldn't waste the second and last chance again," he
said. "It's high time to act because the vast majority of the
Somali people need a national reconciliation conference with the
help of the United Nations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ghali, in announcing his decision for further U.N. operation
on Somalia on Monday, rejected calls for fresh financial
assistance to Somalia's political factions.
</P>
<P>
His decision was denounced by Somalia's biggest warlord,
General Mohamed Farah Aideed. A spokesman of his faction called
the U.N. office in Nairobi "the centerpoint for Somalia's
misunderstanding".
</P>
<P>
"It should be closed. We have neither recognition nor respect
for them," said the spokesman who accused the U.N. office of
supplying arms and financial assistance to factions opposing
Aideed's government.
</P>
<P>
"We call on Dr Boutros-Ghali to respect our government. We're
not here for fun but to restore the prestige and the existence of
the Somali people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. office was opened in Nairobi since the departure of
the multi-national force and aid agencies form Somalia on March
last year.

<HEADLINE> Champion Bowler Donates Medal to HK Olympic Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Asian Games
tenpin bowling champion Cathrine Che donated her gold medal to the
Hong Kong Amateur Sports Federation and the Olympic Committee
today.
</P>
<P>
"In doing so, I hope more and more people will be encouraged to
devote themselves in the sport," said Che.
</P>
<P>
Che, who won Hong Kong's first ever Asian Games gold medal as
well as a silver medal in the 1986 games in Seoul, South Korea,
was honored at a special ceremony today at which she was awarded
with a momento for her dedication and contribution to tenpin
bowling sport in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A. De O. Sales, president of the Hong Kong Amateur Sports
Federation and Olympic Committee, presented the momento to the
champion bowler.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong sports chief praised Che as a "very dedicated
sportswoman" and said that although she decided to donate the
precious gold medal to the Hong Kong Olympic committee, she "keeps
it in her heart".
</P>
<P>
Che, who started learning to bowl when she was a 15-year-old
high school student, retired after winning a bronze medal for the
women's singles event at last year's 18th FIQ world championships
in the United States. This brought to a happy end her
20-year-long glamorous career which also featured two bronze
medals at the 1978 Asian Games in Bangkok and a gold medal at the
1992 FIQ Asian Zone Championships in Perth, Australia.
</P>
<P>
The former Asian Games champion bowler is now a clerk and works
for the Hong Kong Amateur Tenpin Bowling Association as the Hong
Kong team's manager. The Hong Kong team is now training for the
Far East championships in April this year in Pusan, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not patient enough for the job," Che said when asked why
she did not accept the idea of becoming a coach. "Being a
manager, you'll have less pressure on yourself," she added.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong doesn't have a qualified coach for its bowling team
and I think we'd better get one from abroad," Che said.
</P>
<P>
She had decided to link herself with the sport but has no
definite plan for how long she would work as a team manager.
"Maybe as long as I can," she smiled.

<P>
The newspaper run by the Ministry of Electronics Industry said
China's exports of electronic products will amount to 18 to 20

Among products for export are television sets, computerized
telephone switchboards, computer components, telephones and

MAPUTO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Tention was renewed on Tuesday
between the ruling Mozambican Liberation Front party (Frelimo)
and the rival Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo) over a last
year's attack on a county magistrate.

Dhlakama, who was then in an inspection tour in the county.

Renamo recently demanded the case be put to an end, saying it

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Challenge US If F-16 Not Refunded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said today that it
would look into all options if its payment made for the F-16
fighter planes is not returned by the United States.
</P>
<P>
"If 658 million dollars paid for the F-16s are not refunded we
will look into all the options including going to courts," Defense
Minister Aftab Shaban Mirani told the National Assembly here
today.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the US government has failed to deliver the
aircraft, it is bound to reimburse, in full, the amount paid with
interest.
</P>
<P>
Under the Pressler Amendment, the US has cut off military and
economic assistance to Pakistan since 1990 on suspicion that
Pakistan is making nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The US has refused to either deliver the military equipment
purchased by Pakistan or refund the money Pakistan had paid for
the equipment.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, the US Congress passed the Brown
Amendment to allow a third party to purchase the F-16s and refund
the money to Pakistan.

PARIS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Patrick Bernardini of France kept
his leading position and moved one step closer to his first
victory in the Monte Carlo rally on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After the two last timed stages before the traditional night
finale, Bernardini, driving in a Ford Escort enjoyed a comfortable
lead of three minutes and 29 seconds over compatriot Francois
Delecour in a Peugeot 306.
</P>
<P>
Pre-race favourite Armin Schwarz of German, who has been slowed
down by transmission failure on his Toyota Celica since the race
started on Monday, was third 4:56 back and with slim hope of a
victory when the winter classic ends on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Schwarz kept fighting to clock the fastest time in the day's
first timed stage, a 15-km sprint which cost Bernardini 12
seconds.
</P>
<P>
But Bernardini, who was making only his second appearance in
the race, was back in control with the best time in the next
section over 16 km which saw Schwarz 1:12 behind.

<HEADLINE> Computer Crime Costs Britain 1 Billion Pounds a Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Computer crime could be costing
UK businesses up to 1 billion pounds (1.5 billion U.S. dollars) a
year, according to the Association of British Insurers (ABI)
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ABI, which represents larger insurers, said that insurance
claims alone were running at 200 million pounds (300 million
dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account non-insured losses, lost business
opportunities, lost production and reduced customer service, the
true cost to industry is likely to be much higher than 200 million
pounds.
</P>
<P>
The association warned that constant technological changes and
increasing demand for computer equipment mean that this crime will
continue to rise unless businesses urgently review their security
precautions and upgrade them if necessary.
</P>
<P>
It added that the black market in computers and their parts was
growing rapidly because of fluctuations in legitimate supplies,
the high value of easily removed and concealed parts such as chips
and the international nature of the market for stolen equipment.
</P>
<P>
In many cases thieves do not even bother to steal the whole
machine. Instead, they open up computer cases to steal
easy-to-remove memory chips and other electronic components which
can be concealed in a briefcase, said Tony Baker, the association
deputy director.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loans Fund Eight State Major Laboratories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Eight state major laboratories,
funded by the World Bank and built by the Qinghua University, one
of China's key universities based in this Chinese capital, have
passed state assessment recently.
</P>
<P>
So far, the 13 state major laboratories in Qinghua have all
been finished.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, China's State Education Commission decided to use
World Bank loans to build 75 state major laboratories across the
country, including the eight ones in Qinghua.
</P>
<P>
The eight laboratories will conduct research into such fields
as high-efficiency and low-pollution combustion, micro-wave and
digital communication, large-scale generating equipment,
environment imitation and pollution control.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the 8.53-million-US dollar World Bank loans, the
university has raised another 20 million yuan in building
laboratories and buying research facilities.
</P>
<P>
State major laboratories in China represent the country's
overall standards in scientific research in certain fields. In the
past four years, the eight state major laboratories in Qinghua has
undertaken over 600 research projects of the country, employed 65
post-doctorate researchers and trained 1,345 students with both
master's and doctorate degrees.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Ruling Clergies Threaten to Impeach President (part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's ruling clergies in the
parliament threatened to impeach moderate President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani as their rightist camp broke down five weeks before the
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Ali Movahedi-Savoji, a clergy member of the parliament, said
the parliament would impeach President Rafsanjani if he backed his
ministers against the right-wing group that controls the
parliament, today's Persian-language daily Salam reported.
</P>
<P>
"If the president wants to back his ministers, we would
possibly vote to impeach him," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Under the control of traditional rightist group Society of
Combatant Clergy (SCC), the parliament has criticized Rafsanjani,
rejected his nomination of certain officials and impeached his
cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
But this is the first time that an influential member of
parliament is threatening to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Rafsanjani's 16 top aides last week is
said to have triggered the greatest rift between the government
and parliament since Ayatollah Khomeini's death in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The statement attacked the traditional rightists headed by
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri for monopolizing the
political process.
</P>
<P>
The group, including 10 ministers and four vice-presidents,
also called for a wider participation in the March 8 parliamentary
elections by diverse groups to neutralize the traditionalists'
hold on the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 members of parliament reacted Monday with a harsh
statement against what they called the ministers' illegal
interference in the legislative branch.
</P>
<P>
A political analyst said the source of the conflict between the
traditional Right and modernist Right is nomination of certain
candidates for the fifth parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
President Rafsanjani and Parliament Speaker Nateq-Nouri
recently met to sort out differences between the rightist
clergymen and the executives. But they failed to resolve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
The main point in the dispute is that Speaker Nateq-Nouri did
not approve the idea of issuing a separate list for the parliament
election candidates by the executive officials, the English
language daily Iran News reported.

KUALA LUMPUR, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Education
Minister Najib Tun Razak today announced the establishment of a
Bosnian Education Aid Fund here to raise money for schools in
Bosnia from Malaysian students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
"The money collected will be used to purchase materials or
rebuild school buildings destroyed in war," said Najib after a

</P>
<P>
He said that if each of the 4.2 million students in Malaysia
contributed one Malaysian ringit (about 0.4 US dollar), 4.2
million ringgit (about 1.68 million US dollars) could be raised.
</P>
<P>
The education minister said that students and teachers are
encouraged to make cash donations this month and next month. He
hoped that at least one school could be built in Bosnia with
Malaysia's contributions.

<HEADLINE> 6,500-year-old Underground Dwelling Found in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists
recently claimed that they have found China's first underground
dwelling remains from the Late Stone Age some 6,500 year ago.
</P>
<P>
Located on a hill some 30 km in the east of this capital of
northeast China's Jilin Province, the underground dwelling remains
is rectangular in shape with four round corners.
</P>
<P>
It extends 12.4 m in the north-south direction and 10.8 m in
the west-east direction, occupying an area of more than 130 sq m.
</P>
<P>
Two storage pits, two connected round stoves, and a
50-cm-round, 1.6-m-deep well have been found in the dwelling,
whose floor has been baked.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhongpei and Huang Jinglue, leading archaeologists from
the expert-group of the State Bureau of Cultural Relics, inspected
the site and said that the remains, the only of its kind ever
found in China, is the largest neolithic dwelling ever found in
northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Yet the experts doubt how could the ancestors built such big
structure, which, 1.5 m underground, has left no trace of door
ways and pillar holes.
</P>
<P>
Also yet to be determined is the use of the big dwelling. Some
experts inferred that it might serve as a gathering hall, a
workshop, or a sacrificial site of the ancient tribe.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,200 stone ware have been unearthed from the
dwelling, which is just one of three dwellings found on the hill.
</P>
<P>
At the hill top the experts excavated a total of over 10,000
stone, pottery and bone ware, including a saddle-shaped pottery
support, which is the only intact ancient pottery ever found in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Flocks to Heilongjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province has become the fifth largest province in using foreign
investment as it attracted 1.05 billion US dollars of contractual
investment in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jinyong, director of the Heilongjiang Foreign Investment
Administration, said more than 20 large business groups,
transnationals from the United States, France, Japan, the Republic
of Korea (ROK), Taiwan and Hong Kong inspected Heilongjiang in
1995. A number of the world's 100 largest enterprises have already
invested in the province.
</P>
<P>
Wang attributed the steady growth of foreign investment to the
vast land area and rich resources in the province. As one of
China's major granaries, Heilongjiang is one of China's largest
producers of soy beans, corn, wheat and rice. It is also one of
the country's ten pasture lands and is China's largest forest zone.
</P>
<P>
After visiting Heilongjiang, an overseas businessman commented
the province has solid industrial foundation and expertise. "We
can get the raw materials we want, and processing, packaging and
sales can all be completed in one province," he said.

The press release noted the U.S. claim "dates as far back as
July 1992, and subsequently rejected by Iran in the strongest
possible terms."

"The Islamic Republic of Iran expresses outrage at the absurd
allegation that it minted U.S. dollars in 1992," the report said.

did not elaborate on its medal prospective on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The D.P.R. Korea will compete in Asia's qualifying rounds for

The D.P.R. Korea boycotted the Los Angeles and Seoul Olympic

Shanghai, May 1993, the country has shunned international sporting
events, including the Lillehammer Winter Olympics and the Asian
Games in 1994 as well as various world championships. It was the

<HEADLINE> Tightening Ban on Tobacco Ads Called in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- More stringent control is
urged in Hong Kong over tobacco advertising, which is likely to
lure teenagers to early death, today's Hong Kong Standard
reported.
</P>
<P>
Professor Lee Shiu-hung, chairman of the Hong Kong Council on
Smoking and Health was quoted as saying that "unless something
more drastic is done now in prevention and control of smoking, we
are definitely going to see many young people, who are presently
15 or 16, dying early 30 or 40 years later."
</P>
<P>
Studies showed that 37 percent teenagers at the age of 15 to
16 in Hong Kong have experimented with tobacco. By the age of 16
and above, 61 percent of men and 48 percent of women have tried
smoking.
</P>
<P>
The English daily newspaper said that 11 percent smokers in the
territory tried their first puffs at a younger age of seven.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is planning to expand prohibitions on all direct
tobacco advertising further into the print media, from the
previous restricted zones such as TV, radio and cinemas.
</P>
<P>
Professor Lee said the government proposals do not go for
enough. The ban of tobacco advertisements in all forms is in line
with the World Health Organization's 1995-99 Five-Year Action Plan
on Tobacco, he insisted.

<HEADLINE> China To Start Designing of 100-seat Plane This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China plans to start the
designing of the 100-seat passenger plane within this year, and a
Western partner which will provide necessary technology for the
plane will be selected around March or April.
</P>
<P>
The 100 seater will be the largest civil plane China ever
produced.
</P>
<P>
Chi Wenjun, deputy director of the Department of Commercial
Aircraft of Aviation Industries of China, said China and the
Republic of Korea will claim major shares in the cooperative
project, which is estimated to cost at least two billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
He explained, the plane, named Air Express-100, will be
equipped with the most advanced technologies in aircraft
manufacture, such as "fly by wire" and turbo-fan engines, and the
selection of a partner with the necessary technologies is of great
importance.
</P>
<P>
The director pointed out the shares for this third partner
should not exceed 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since China announced its intention to have a third partner on
the project, the world's chief aircraft manufacturers, including
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the United States, and
Aerospatiale of France and British Aerospace, have showed great
interest in the participation in the project.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Aerospatiale, British Aerospace and Alenia of Italy
announced their intent to form a joint venture company specially
for the competition to be selected as the Western partner on the
100-seat plane program.
</P>
<P>
The market of 150 seaters and above worldwide is now shared by
Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and Europe's Airbus Industrie, and
major manufacturers of 100 seaters include Fokker of the
Netherlands. Industrial experts estimate the world's airlines
needs about 2000 100-seat planes in the next 15 years.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Ruling Clergies Threaten to Impeach President (part II) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The evening paper Kayhan quoted a member of parliament as
saying that if the interference of ministers in the legislative
branch continues, the parliament would consider impeachment of
the ministers as an option.
</P>
<P>
The moderate headed by Rafsanjani and the conservative headed
by Nateq-Nouri have differences in domestic and foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives do not agree with Rafsanjani's shock therapy
for the economy. They say Iran's runaway inflation, caused by the
development plans and massive foreign debt, is weakening the
average man's faith in the Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
While Rafsanjani espouses a moderate foreign policy directed
toward cooperation with the West especially Europe, the
conservatives adopt an isolationist policy.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted the focal point in the fierce power
struggle among the ruling clergymen is that the 61-year-old
moderate president does not want to be replaced by Nateq-Nouri in
the 1997 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani and Nateq-Nouri were comrades-in-arms in their fight
against the ex-Shah starting with the sixties and later in the
early years of the Islamic Revolution. Even now they both serve
on the Central Council of SCC.
</P>
<P>
But during the past three years, the conflict between them
have become more and more articulated as Nateq-Nouri is anxious
to grab the next presidential post by launching merciless attacks
on Rafsanjani for his economic and foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri has criticized Rafsanjani's administration for
pushing ahead with the development programs at the expense of the
poor and attempting to resume relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The constitution does not allow Rafsanjani to run for a third
consecutive term whereas Nateq-Nouri is said to be SCC's
candidate for presidency.
</P>
<P>
A political science professor who spoke on condition of
anonymity said that "more wars are to be fought between the two
factions in the rightist camp" as Iran was preparing for the
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
He said that SCC's aggressive campaign before the parliamentary
elections shows that they also wanted to win next year's
presidential elections.

<HEADLINE> Bigger Living Space for Urban Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The per-capita living space of
urban residents across China has expanded to 7.9 sq. m. by the end
of 1995 thanks to the national boom on residential construction
over the past five years, Minister of Construction Hou Jie
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 55 percent of the urban dwellers have moved into
single-family apartments from houses in which two or three
families shared one kitchen and a sitting room. The interior
design and building quality also improved greatly, Hou said at a
national conference which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
China allocated a total of 760 billion yuan on housing
development during the country's Eighth Five-Year Plan
(1991-95). Projects with a combined floor space of one billion
sq.m. have been completed, providing some 5 million urban
households with new housing.
</P>
<P>
The "Anju Project", a national scheme to provide new houses for
low-and medium income families, has been launched in 59 cities.
</P>
<P>
With a mushrooming growth of residential quarters in recent
years, the country has urged property management departments to
improve services and beautify living environment.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said, the excessive rapid growth has led
to a confusion in real estate development. Measures will be taken
to curb land supply, readjust investment structure, standardize
market operation and crack down on speculations.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996-2000 period, the average living space of urban
residents is expected to reach 9 sq.m. and the rate of
single-family apartment will climb to 70 percent, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Ruling Clergies Threaten to Impeach President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's ruling clergies in the
parliament threatened to impeach moderate President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani as their rightist camp broke down five weeks before
the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Ali Movahedi-Savoji, a clergy member of the parliament, said
the parliament would impeach President Rafsanjani if he backed his
ministers against the right-wing group that controls the
parliament, today's Persian-language daily Salam reported.
</P>
<P>
"If the president wants to back his ministers, we would
possibly vote to impeach him," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Under the control of traditional rightist group Society of
Combatant Clergy (SCC), the parliament has criticized Rafsanjani,
rejected his nomination of certain officials and impeached his
cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
But this is the first time that an influential member of
parliament is threatening to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Rafsanjani's 16 top aides last week is
said to have triggered the greatest rift between the government
and parliament since Ayatollah Khomeini's death in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The statement attacked the traditional rightists headed by
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri for monopolizing the
political process.
</P>
<P>
The group, including 10 ministers and four vice-presidents,
also called for a wider participation in the March 8 parliamentary
elections by diverse groups to neutralize the traditionalists'
hold on the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 members of parliament reacted Monday with a harsh
statement against what they called the ministers' illegal
interference in the legislative branch.
</P>
<P>
A political analyst said the source of the conflict between the
traditional Right and modernist Right is nomination of certain
candidates for the fifth parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
President Rafsanjani and Parliament Speaker Nateq-Nouri
recently met to sort out differences between the rightist
clergymen and the executives. But they failed to resolve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
The main point in the dispute is that Speaker Nateq-Nouri did
not approve the idea of issuing a separate list for the parliament
election candidates by the executive officials, the English
language daily Iran News reported.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: US Carmakers to Re-enter Philippine Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The three largest US carmakers
are considering a comeback to the Philippines nearly 20 years
after they packed up and left because of a serious foreign
currency crunch and a depressed market in the country.
</P>
<P>
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler -- the "Big Three" as they
are known -- are now encouraged by the improving economic
conditions and a liberalized car market in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler International Corp. today announced its plans to set
up an assembly plant in the Philippines this year.
</P>
<P>
Special Projects Coordinator William Valasco said that the
Detroit-based company sought to carve a lucrative niche in the
local market, which has been virtually controlled by Japanese car
manufacturing giants -- Toyota, Mitsubishi and Nissan -- for over
two decades.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler's imminent comeback, announced at the inauguration of
a parts and service center in the Makati financial district, will
make it the first American car company to re-enter the Philippine
market.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is getting increasing attention with the
sustained takeoff of its economy and the improved Filipino family
incomes. "We feel there is a great potential here," said Carlito
Castrillo, president of Philmotors Corp., Chrysler's sole local
distributor.
</P>
<P>
Castrillo said that between 100 million US dollars and 130
million US dollars would be invested in the proposed plant at the
Calabarzon industrial area south of Manila.
</P>
<P>
The plant, to start commercial operations in late 1998, will
initially assemble semi-knocked-down units of only two models --
the jeep Cherokee and the Dodge caravan -- which are popular in
the local market.
</P>
<P>
The plant will assemble between 2,000 and 3,000 units yearly,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler has assembly plants in China, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
General Motors is currently choosing between the Philippines
and Thailand for its Asian manufacturing base. The proposed
facility, estimated to absorb investments of about one billion US
dollars, will assemble some 100,000 units each year for export to
the Asian market.

KUALA LUMPUR, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has issued about 2,000 passports
for use by the Vietnamese boat people to return home.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese boat people are staying at Kuala Lumpur's Sungai
Besi transit camp.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian police field force central brigade commander SAC II
Hanif Ahmad told the press here today that those Vietnamese boat
people would be sent to their home country through orderly

<P>
He said the repatriation would be carried out jointly by the
UNHCR and the Malaysian and Vietnamese governments in stages until
June this year.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR representatives at the camp have compiled the list of the
passport holders, and another 2,000 passports are expected to be

the Sungai Besi Camp waiting for repatriation.
</P>
<P>
SAC II Hanif said the inmates at the camp were still being
housed at the dining halls following last Thursday's rioting,
which left 23 people injured and one dead.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said earlier that
Malaysia could not tolerate those who come to the country and then
create problems, and said those Vietnamese boat people would have
to be sent to their home country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Luong Tap, the visiting Vietnamese director of the
country's Labor and Public Affairs Department, who was taken
around the camp today, said the Vietnamese government was ready to

DHAKA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's export earnings from
jute yarn and twine dropped to 1.15 billion taka (about 28.75
million U.S. dollars) in July-December 1995 from 1.41 billion taka
(35.25 million dollars) in the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bangladesh jute Spinners' Association, the
figures showed a fall of 18.44 percent in value while the volume
of exports also dropped by 18.77 percent during the period.
</P>
<P>
A total of 42,182 tons of products were exported during
July-December last year as against 51,926 tons in the previous
corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
Jute exporters and industrialists blamed the slump on price
hikes of raw jute caused by production shortfalls and the
prevailing political instability, and urged the government to take
some urgent measures to protect the jute spinning industry that
has become in-competitive in the world market.

SEOUL, January 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Samsung Aerospace
Industries has developed a 240-pin semiconductor lead frame,
becoming the world's third developer of the product following
Japan's Shinko and Mitsui Hi-Tech, a company official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The product is essential for making semiconductor chips light,
thin, short and small through high integration of circuits since
the space between leads of the product is a mere 98 microns, two
microns less than the existing 100 microns, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
One micron equals to one-millionth of a meter.
</P>
<P>
To develop the application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
semiconductor, Samsung invested millions of U.S. dollars in the
past 10 months and will start mass-producing two million 240-pin
lead frames per month in the latter half of this year, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The two Japanese firms have not yet put their versions on the
market, so Samsung will be able to begin selling its product at
virtually the same time, he said.
</P>
<P>
The latest product marks Samsung's first stamping-type lead
frame, which compared with existing etching-type, is much lower in
production cost.

<HEADLINE> hke-- S. Korea Reaffirms Claim to Tokdo Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korea reiterated today that
its easternmost island of Tokdo cannot be a subject of territorial
dispute with Japan.
</P>
<P>
"It is evident that Tokdo is our territory and the island is
occupied by South Korea in reality," said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Suh Dae-won.
</P>
<P>
Suh made the remarks in response to recent Japanese media
reports that Japan is considering proclaiming soon its
200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) with Tokdo Island
as a boundary.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that Japan informed South Korea of the
position when Director General of the Asian Affairs Bureau of the
Japanese Foreign Ministry Ryojo Kato met his South Korean
counterpart Kim Ha-joong in Seoul last December.
</P>
<P>
Suh said, "during the meeting between Kim and Kato, Kato just
said that his country was considering declaring a
200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone in accordance with the
Convention on the Law of Sea."
</P>
<P>
He quoted Kim as saying that Kato also expressed the hope that
Tokyo and Seoul will closely cooperate in proclaiming EEZ.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will also consult closely with Japan and China
before declaring its EEZ as its National Assembly already ratified
the Convention on the Law of Sea last December, Suh said.

<HEADLINE> Hakka's Earthen Buildings Attract Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 400,000 tourists from
both at home and abroad have been attracted to the earthen
buildings resided by Hakka people in Yongding county in east
China's Fujian Province since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Hakka people are offsprings of Han nationalities living in
central China who started to migrate to the southeast as early as
the Western Jin Dynasty (265-316).
</P>
<P>
Most of them settled in present-day Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong,
and Taiwan. The Hakka people, refusing to mix with other local
ethnic groups, remained in many ways their 2,000-year-old
traditional language, clothing and customs.
</P>
<P>
Their unique dwellings -- circular or square earthen buildings
that can accommodate tens of households, have always aroused the
interest of other people.
</P>
<P>
In Yongding county where some 410,000 Hakka people are living,
there are some 4,000 square and 360 circular earthen buildings.
</P>
<P>
The "Zhengqi Building", for example, has a floor space of 5,370
sq m, a perimeter of 230 metres and 384 rooms.
</P>
<P>
This four-story circular building, still in use, was built in
1712 and called as the "king of the earthen buildings".
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts say that the early Hakka settlers in southeast
China developed the earthen buildings because they served well as
a castle against attack by wild beasts or bandits.
</P>
<P>
The experts also say that other Hakka things, bearing much
flavor of the ancient Han culture, will contribute to the study of
the customs of the ancient Han people.

<HEADLINE> Announcement of Final Results of Palestinian Elections Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Final vote tallies of
Saturday's Palestinian elections have yet to be released
presumably due to criticism from certain quarters on fraud and
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Central Election Commission (CEC) officials have
reportedly decided that a revote should be conducted in two
polling stations in the Gaza Strip. The new balloting will be
held in January 31. About 2,000 voters are involved.
</P>
<P>
Riyyad El-Khadri, member of the CEC, said the decision had been
made in view of opposition candidates' fraud claims proved
valid. But he gave no other details.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two well-known candidates who narrowly lost in
their districts Tuesday suggested that vote tampering cost them
their seats, as reports of missing ballot boxes turning up hours
and even days after they disappeared have cast a shadow over the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Zahira Kamal, a leading women's rights activist, lost a seat
in Jerusalem district by some 200 votes after appearing to have
won.
</P>
<P>
"I demand an explanation of why the count was completed by 4
p.m. the day after the election and suddenly other ballot boxes
turned up the following morning," she said on Israel Arabic
Radio.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa Barghouti, a leading communist intellectual from the
Palestine People's Party, who lost a tight race for the final
seat in Ramallah to West Bank Fatah council head Marwan
Barghouti, his distant cousin, said that the count exceeded the
number of actual votes, especially in Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
"Some polling boxes took 24 hours to arrive from certain
areas," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bethlehem University Dean of arts Manuel Hassasian, who is
director of the Bethlehem District Election Commission, said, "I
am very disappointed with the international observers. They were
not in the villages, but only in the cities, where everything was
dandy."
</P>
<P>
But he added, during a seminar on the elections, that while
there may have been some cheating in the villages during the
voting itself, he does not think there were any problems in the
counting of the votes, which was done by reputable people without
regard to political affiliation.

KUNMING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China will complete the
track-laying work on Nanning-Kunming rail line, an important
transport artery in southwest China, in April next year, three
months ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Tracks on the 207-km-long eastern section between Nanning,
capital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and the city of

Local rail authorities said that many technical problems have
been solved in the construction of four special bridges and two
long tunnels, which is key to the completion of the railway.
</P>
<P>
Work on electrification, telecommunications, signal service,
water- and power-supply of the rail is being speeded up, officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Becomes World Number One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi regained the
crown of world number one by beating compatriot Jim Courier in a
quarter-final match at the Australian Open in Melbourne on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Agassi is sure to regain his top position in the ATP computer
ranking after entering the semi-finals of the current tournament.
</P>
<P>
His compatriot Pete Sampras topped the world ranking in late
last year when Agassi pulled out of several tournaments due to a
back injury.
</P>
<P>
He beat his opponent 6-7, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 on the center
court at Flinders Park. He will play fellow American Michael Chang
in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who finished runner-up to Agassi in last year's
Australian Open, crashed to young Australian Mark Philippoussis in
the third round of this tournament.
</P>
<P>
Another contender of the crown, Austria's world number three
Thomas Muster, also dropped out of the tournament in the fourth
round.
</P>
<P>
Agassi staged a tremendous comeback during the three hours and
nine minutes match.
</P>
<P>
Courier led by 7-6 (9-7) and 6-2 in the first two sets. But
Agassi broke his service in the second, fourth and eighth games in
the third set to turn the match around.
</P>
<P>
Agassi broke Courier again in the ninth game of the fourth and
went on to win the set.
</P>
<P>
In the final set, Courier seemed to lose his composion and
repeatedly put his shots outside the lines. Agassi led by 4-0
before allowing Courier to hold his first service in the set.
Neither could broke the other's service since then on, but the
outcome had already been decided.
</P>
<P>
Agassi's battle with Courier was re-scheduled Tuesday night
because of a rainstorm and a marathon match between United States'
Chanda Rubin and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other quarter-finals, Amanda Coetzer of South
Africa ousted 15-year-old Swiss Martina Hingis 7-5, 4-6, 6-1,
while German Anke Huber upset second seed Conchita Martinez of
Spain 4-6, 6-2, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
In the semi-finals, Coetzer will play Huber and Monica Seles
takes on Rubin.
</P>
<P>
The other two semifinalists in the men's singles will emerge in
the matchs later on Wednesday. Australia's unseeded Mark Woodford
will meet Thomas Enqvist of Sweden while Boris Becker faces
Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Aims High for Light Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region will strive to develop its light industry
during the 1995-2000 period, with the sector's annual output value
expected to reach 7.5 billion yuan by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
This means that the sector's output value has to increase at an
average annual rate of 10.3 percent in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
To date, there are 1,040 enterprises in Xinjiang's light
industry sector, mainly engaged in sugar refining, papermaking,
and the production of tinned food, chemical detergents, and
leather and plastic goods.
</P>
<P>
They account for 23.3 percent of the region's total industrial
enterprises. Last year the sector's output value was 4.27 billion
yuan, accounting for 13 percent of the region's total industrial
product value.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang now has 3.2 million ha of cultivated land and three
million ha of potentially arable land. During the 1996-2000 period
the region will upgrade 200,000 ha of low yielding land, with
another 200,000 ha of potentially arable land brought under
cultivation.
</P>
<P>
All the newly added land will be planted with cotton or beet,
so as to meet the needs of the local cotton textile and sugar
refining industry.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the region produced 295,000 tons of sugar, which made
the region rank second in China in terms of sugar production.
</P>
<P>
The region's tomatoes also have a good reputation worldwide. To
date, the region has formed an annual processing capacity of
160,000 tons of tomatoes, with 81,000 tons produced last year.
</P>
<P>
The region's output of hops accounts for 65 percent of the
country's total, meeting 70 percent of the demand from China's
breweries.
</P>
<P>
The region has abundant grain and grapes, which are materials
for the wine-making industry. Wine-making will continue as a
pillar of local light industry during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Being one of China's four biggest pastoral areas, the region
also has advantages for developing its leather industry. The
detergents and plastics industries have enough materials and the
local petrochemical industry has been steadily expanded.

<HEADLINE> "Chinese People More Confident About Anti-Corruption Drive" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese people are showing
more confidence in the state's anti-corruption campaign, in which
they are taking an increasing part, senior Communist Party of
China (CPC) official Wei Jianxing said here today.
</P>
<P>
Decisions taken at the fifth plenary session of the 14th CPC
Central Committee indicate that the Party has the ability and
resolution to carry out the anti-corruption campaign and in the
meanwhile has aroused the people's enthusiasm for it, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
Wei, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee, member of the committee's secretariat and secretary of
the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) of the
committee, made these remarks at the sixth plenary meeting of the
CCDI.
</P>
<P>
The fifth plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee
held late last year decided to push forward the task of building a
clean government and Party, and remove Chen Xitong from his posts
on the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and from the
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The people's confidence and enthusiasm can be seen in their
initiative and the quality of their reports of corrupt cases," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that during the first 11 months of last year
the country's discipline departments received 204,737 reports of
corruption by officials at and above the county level, an increase
of 5.1 percent over the same period of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Among the cases 27,087 reports were submitted to the Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection, an increase of 48.1 percent
over the previous year. And 27 percent of the reports bear the
names of informants, up by 29 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"A large number of the reports were clear and detailed, and
some major cases started with such reports," Wei said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wei, the co-operation between the people and
special anti-corruption organs has become an important factor in
fighting corrupt conduct.
</P>
<P>
Local governments and discipline inspection departments
encourage the people to supervise officials and make reports about
corrupt ones.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that China will put more emphasis on people's reports
to further improve its discipline inspection.

<HEADLINE> Birth Rate Falls in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of babies born to
the average Ugandan woman has fallen from 7.3 in 1989 to 6.8 in
1995 while the use of family planning has tripled, according to
an official survey released here today.
</P>
<P>
This dramatic development was made public for the first time
by the ministry of health.
</P>
<P>
Florence Ebanyat, the commissioner for maternal and child
health and family planning in the ministry of health, was quoted
as saying the years from 1988 to 1995 was a period of rapid
fertility decline, adding that this is the first ever evidence of
fertility decline in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The censuses from 1948 to 1988 always showed an increase in
fertility, said Ebanyat.
</P>
<P>
She stated that "it is very exciting because we have to match
our socio-economic level with our birth rate."
</P>
<P>
The 1995 figures are the preliminary results of the
demographic and health survey which was carried out in 38
districts between March and August 1995. About 8,000 households
were surveyed.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that most Ugandan women want to control their
births. Only 23 percent of married women aged 15 to 49 wanted
another child within two years while 36 percent wanted to wait
more than two years and 31 percent did not want more.
</P>
<P>
It showed that 67 percent of Ugandan women were in need of
family planning services.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the percentage of married women who
are currently using family planning has gone up from 5 percent in
1988 to 15 percent in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliament Ratifies anti-US Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's parliament has ratified a
20 million U.S. dollar budget to counter the U.S. covert action
against Iran and finance activities against Americans, a press
report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The morning daily Iran News reported that the budget was
approved by the parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The budget, which was boosted from an initial 16 million
dollars, is a reaction to Washington's move last month to give its
secret service 20 million dollars for action aimed at moderating
Iran's Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Nateq-Nouri, member of the Iranian parliament and brother
of parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, even warned that
confrontation with the United States is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
"Those Iranians who dream of negotiating with Washington are
deceiving themselves. Confrontation between Iran and the United
States is inevitable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Qashaqvi, member of the Plan and Budget Committee of
the parliament, said that some of fund equivalent to 14 million
dollars will be at disposal of the Supreme National Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The budget is also to go toward "enlightening international
opinion on (American) violations of the U.N. charter and the
Algiers declaration" of January 1981 which ended the 444-day
hostage-taking of Americans in Tehran, according to the daily.
</P>
<P>
Under that declaration, the two countries agreed to stay out
of each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Iran's military forces are on red alert against potential
military confrontation with the American forces by assigning
different missions to safeguard land and sea borders
</P>
<P>
Hassan Beigi, member of the parliament Defense Commission,
said "different regions of the country have been divided among
different parts of armed forces in order to fight back against
subversive moves by the United States."
</P>
<P>
The official said that the guarding of southern border and
southeastern border has been assigned to the Army.
</P>
<P>
"The coastal areas are assigned to the Navy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Beigi said the western and northwestern parts of the country
are assigned to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the security measures taken by the Iranian
government have made it impossible for any anti-revolutionary
forces to infiltrate into the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the United States has established bases in
the Persian Gulf countries, it is important for Iran to be more
active and take necessary measures to thwart any external plots.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the latest move by the Iranian
regime indicates that the tension between Iran and the United
States has been intensified following the approval of 20 million
dollar budget by the U.S. Administration to destabilize the
Tehran government.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian regime is getting more and more concerned about
the tightening of the U.S. pressures and escalation of the tension
around its borders.

</P>
<P>

Turkey places importance to the major role that China plays in
the international affairs, Oymen told Qian, stressing that Turkey

and territorial integrity. He added that this is a basic
principle of Turkey in developing relations with China.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Not To Start War With Burundi: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Minister of State
for Defence, Mr. Edgar Maoukola-Majogo, has said Tanzania was not
intending in any way to start war with its neighbouring state of
Burundi or Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The minister delivered that message on Tuesday while touring
the borders with the two volatile states, a visit which also took
him to various army barracks situated in the area, following
reports that units of the defence forces have sealed the border
with Burundi and turned away thousands of new refugees.
</P>
<P>
Despite having issued its warning that it would not tolerate
incursions on Tanzanian soil by Burundi troops chasing rebel
forces, Majogo said, Tanzania nevertheless wished to avoid any
conflict at the border.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania allowed a first wave of some 15,000 Rwandan Hutu
refugees encamped in noratheast Burundi to cross the border
late last week after the clashes near their Mugano camp, around
10 kilometers from Ntamba.

When most of the 17,000 refugees in the Namba camp decided
to follow them, Tanzania closed the border again on Sunday,
and turned back the following day some 500 to 1,000 refugees
who crossed the River Ruvubu.
</P>
<P>
A report from Kigoma in Western Tanzania quoted the minister
as speaking to residents of Kagunga village that the government
would continue to shut its border with Burundi to stop the influx
of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The government was pursuing diplomatic efforts to repatriate
all refugees present in the country, he emphasised.
</P>
<P>
There are about 700,000 Rwandan and Burundi refugees, mostly
Hutus, in the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged villagers to report all foreigners who
enter the country by diverse entry points, saying that such
vigilance would help assure the security of the area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Majogo, who was accompanied by General Robert
Mboma, the chief of defence forces, said the government would do
all in its power to foster good neighborliness, and would not
allow rebel groups to operate from Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai People Drink Less liquor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shanghai, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A liquor lover may find it
less hospitable at Shanghai restaurants nowadays as waiters do not
place a bottle of strong white liquor on the table unless you ask
for it.
</P>
<P>
A new awareness of the importance of health has resulted in the
citizens of Shanghai drinking less strong white spirit both at
home and in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to offend and turn away our clients by placing
white liquor on the dinner table before they order it," a
restaurant owner said.
</P>
<P>
White liquor, which is usually distilled from sorghum or maize,
has traditionally been the major drink for the Chinese at such
grand parties such as weddings, banquets and business dinners.
</P>
<P>
But, according to the Shanghai Tobacco and Sugar Group Company,
sales of white liquor in China's most populous city have been
declining at an annual rate of 10 percent over the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
Sales of white liquor now account for only 20 percent of
the city's total sales of wines and spirits.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 40 alcoholic beverage makers in Shanghai, but
the output of white liquor makes up less than five percent of the
total, according to the Shanghai Liquor Industry Society.
</P>
<P>
During the traditional seasons for drinking strong spirits such
as the year-end and the period around the Chinese New Year, the
number of people taken to hospital because of drinking problems
has also declined dramatically in recent years, according to the
local health administration.

<HEADLINE> Sino-British Economic Ties Called for Further Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Wu Yi, Chinese minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), said today that
the improvement of Sino-British relations has put new impetus to
bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting British minister of Trade of the
Department of Trade and Industry, Anthony Nelson, Wu noted that a
good momentum has emerged since last year following a period of
difficulties in Sino-British ties. The frequent exchange of
high-ranking visits between the two countries would benefit the
growth of bilateral economic and trade relations, she added.
</P>
<P>
Britain is one of China's major trading partners in the
European Union and Sino-British trade volume last year surpassed
four billion US dollars, which was 14 percent more than that in
1994, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
But China is not satisfied with that figure because it doesn't
match the strength of the two economies, Wu told Nelson.
</P>
<P>
The MOFTEC minister voiced the hope that the two countries
would maintain the good momentum in bilateral relations in order
to create better conditions for their economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Nelson said that the current Britain-China ties are turning to
be healthier and more vigorous. He told Wu that Britain hopes to
forge closer cooperation with China in such fields as insurance,
banking, aviation and electronics.
</P>
<P>
Nelson also stated that Britain supports China to become a
member of the World Trade Organization, to which Wu expressed her
appreciation.
</P>
<P>
Nelson is here on a visit as guest of MOFTEC.

<HEADLINE> Jilin to Improve Light Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Jilin
Province, an important heavy industrial base, is enjoying a fast
growth of light industry, with the output value rising 17.2
percent over 1994 to hit 26.5 billion yuan in 1995, five
percentage points higher than the growth rate of heavy industry
during the corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
In the past the province's automobile and petrochemical pillar
industries gave an impetus to the speedy development of local
heavy industry, making its growth rate 20 percentage points higher
than that of the traditional light sector, which mainly relied on
household appliances.
</P>
<P>
To speed up the development of the local light industry the
province, also one of the country's major commodity grain
production bases, has put more effort into the deep-processing of
maize, setting up two processing bases in Huanglong and Xinyuan,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
This made the province's food industry gain 11 billion yuan in
output value last year, accounting for more than 40 percent of the
light industry total.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis has also been placed on the local pharmaceuticals
industry, which has grown annually by 10 percent during the past
five years.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang to Reinvigorate Tea Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang Province, a major tea
producer in east China, has decided to take measures to give a
shot in the arm to its tea industry, which has been sluggish for
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of the province's tea enterprises, mainly in
the processing sector, suffered losses last year. Sources said
that the province produced only 90,000 tons of tea in 1995,
compared with 122,300 tons in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Luo Liewan, an official with the provincial agriculture
department, told Xinhua that Zhejiang tea is now exported at a
price even lower than the cost.
</P>
<P>
Luo said that Zhejiang's tea output accounted for about one
fourth of the national figure before 1994, and its old-established
products, including Longjin Tea and Zhu (Pearl) Tea, have long
enjoyed a good reputation both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
To revive its tea business, Zhejiang will expand the production
of quality tea, issue preferential policies to support tea-growers
and make efforts to upgrade tea processing equipment, Luo said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that Zhejiang should set up enterprise
groups to participate more effectively in the competition in tea
markets.

BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Rong
Yiren met here today with Richard G. Holder, chairman and CEO of
Reynolds Metals Company of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Rong said that it is necessary to well develop the Sino-US
relations, adding that to strengthen cooperation is conducive to
the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Rong expressed the hope that the Reynolds Metals, a leading
company in the aluminum industry, can play a good role in
promoting Sino-US cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Reynolds Metals, the second largest aluminum company in the
United States, signed a draft contract with the Bohai Aluminum
Co. Ltd. of the China International Trust and Investment
Corporation last year.
</P>
<P>
Rong said the cooperation between the Reynolds Metals and China
has a good prospect since Reynolds Metals has advanced technology
and management while China has a big market for aluminum products.
</P>
<P>
Holder said that the jointly funded project between his company
and China will benefit both sides. He added that the good
cooperative relations between his company and China will be
maintained.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Government Urges Harmony In House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Vice-President Dr. Omar
Ali Juma has asked members of parliament to respect and defend
decisions made in the house irrespective of their political
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
Opening a four-day seminar for the legislators in Dodoma,
Central Tanzanian on Tuesday, the vice-president said once a
decision had been passed into law by the majority, it was binding
to all MPs, according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
"We must build a culture of respecting democratically made
decisions since we are ourselves supposed to champion democracy
in this House," he said.
</P>
<P>
Juma reminded the MPs that they were picked from different
legal political parties, but the expectations of their electorate
were the same to lead a better life.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it would serve no purpose for the MPs to
use the House to block government programmes as that would not
benefit the people who elected them.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president reiterated the new or Third-Phase
Government resolve to eradicate poverty, saying this was the
biggest agenda the implementation of which would ensure decent
living in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the major aim of the government was that sufficient
economic development was felt among ordinary Tanzanians through
increased income.
</P>
<P>
He added that the decision by President Benjamin Mkapa to
assign poverty alleviation under his office was an obvious
indication of the Third-Phase Government to deal with the
problem.
</P>
<P>
In his vote of thanks, Prime Minister Frederick sumaye said he
hoped the MPs would advocate for the development of their
electorates.
</P>
<P>
He also said it was not expected that the House would be
turned into a centre of political squabbles but an opportunity to
discuss various development programmes.

<HEADLINE> Thai FM Not to Be Removed: Party Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nam Thai (Thai leadership)
party has no plans to remove Foreign Minister Kasem S. Kasemsri,
who serves under the party's quota, from the cabinet, according to
a spokesman of the party.
</P>
<P>
The Nam Thai party spokesman, Adisorn Piangket, said Tuesday
party executives have appreciated Kasem's work and are happy with
his performance.
</P>
<P>
Kasem, who failed to win a seat in the lower house in the last
general election, was made foreign minister under the Nam Thai
party's quota, with the backing of party leader Amnuay Virawan for
his past foreign ministry work experience.
</P>
<P>
Kasem has been criticized by certain Nam Thai members and a
group of students for allegedly failing to carry out his work
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
Kasem has also been criticized for delays in making decisions
in several crucial cases concerning international relations,
especially the fishing dispute with Malaysia in which Thai crewmen
were killed by Malaysian gunboat.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Kasem has at least played a key role in
backing Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa in all foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
A "black paper" was published recently by an anonymous source
in which Kasem was accused of being unsuitable for the post and
showing weakness in his handling of border problems.

<HEADLINE> Republican Leader Responds to State of Union Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority leader
Republican Bob Dole accused President Bill Clinton of being "the
chief obstacle" to a balanced budget, and the "last public
defender of a discredited status quo."
</P>
<P>
Responding to Clinton's State of the Union address, he said the
president is "careering dangerously off course" in welfare,
education, Medicare and taxes.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Republican leaders and the president have
failed to reach a compromise on the budget impasse.
</P>
<P>
The president offered "only a fantasy" to replace the
Republican bill, Dole said. He promised to "challenge President
Clinton again and again to walk the talk he talks so well."
</P>
<P>
Dole said that Republicans would send Clinton another balanced
budget bill.
</P>
<P>
Taking the opportunity to push his prospects in the
presidential race, Dole, the front-runner for the Republican
nomination, described the differences between him and Clinton as
well as those between Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans will rein in government, reduce the tax
burden, put parents in charge of schools, untie the hands of the
police and restore justice to the courts, he said.
</P>
<P>
At times election-year debates will seem like arguments over
"a maze of conflicting numbers, assertions and high-sounding
words," said Dole.
</P>
<P>
"But what we're really arguing about are the values that will
shape our nation, our nation, our government, and the future of
your child sleeping down the hall."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Dole said "We have different ways to achieve our
goals, different values, different priorities."
</P>
<P>
Dole's campaign portrayed his response to the President's
address as a chance for Americans to contrast the senator and
Clinton. Dole saw Clinton's speech as "a signal that the race is
on."

SHENYANG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- More and more farmers in
northeast China's Liaoning Province are getting access to old age
pensions, which used to be enjoyed only by urban residents.
</P>
<P>
So far, 3.25 million farmers in the province have participated
in the old age insurance schemes, accounting for over 35 percent
of the total number eligible for social insurance.
</P>
<P>
Social insurance for the aged in rural areas began only three
years ago in the province. By the end of last year the province
had collected 150 million yuan in insurance contributions to cover
old age pensions in rural areas. The figure is expected to top 200
million yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
Also, 12 cities out of 14 that are under the direct
administration of the provincial government have set up social
insurance funds for the aged in rural areas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Flow Smoother at Ports of Entry in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The busy ports of entry in
Guangdong Province have handled a remarkable 33 and 70 percent
more passengers and cargo, respectively, over the past five years,
though the number of new outlets built in the same period was less
than in the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
The southern province neighboring Hong Kong and Macao boasts 52
Category One ports of entry open to overseas passengers and
vessels, and 159 Category Two ports of entry mainly serving
foreign trade vessels.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years passengers entering and leaving China
through Guangdong accounted for about 80 percent, the flow of
imports and exports for about 33 percent, vehicles for 90 percent
and the tariffs collected for about 25 percent of the country's
total.
</P>
<P>
Port authorities attributed the progress of the work to reform
measures, mainly the simplification of procedures.
</P>
<P>
In a step to facilitate checks, port authorities have opened
different passages for holders of different passports and
documents. People from Hong Kong and Macao are exempted from the
quarantine examination.
</P>
<P>
In another move, the highway ports in the Shenzhen Special
Economic Zone provide unified customs declaration procedures and
allow vehicles coming in to undergo checks in China instead of at
the ports, to alleviate congestion.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Port authorities have also removed some
checkpoints for small ships to allow them to be examined at ports
of entry.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A two-man Zambian delegation
has been in uganda to study the civil service reforms and
decentralisation, reported the local daily "the New Vision"
today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation led by the deputy permanent secretary in
Zambian ministry of public service P. M. Chikuba was in Uganda
since January 10 and left on Monday after holding talks with
ugandan officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the Zambian team was to study the
Ugandan civil service which is similar to Zambian own. Both
Zambia and Uganda are former British colonies.
</P>
<P>
Areas studied by the team included the relationship between
the decentralised district and the central government, financing
of local authority services by the ministries from the central
government, human resources management particularly at the local
levels, and mechanisms available for fighting corruption.
</P>
<P>
Also studied were management of retrenched workers as well as
their terminal packages.
</P>
<P>
During the last five years, Uganda has successfully
implemented civil service reforms and reduced and rationalised

brought efficiency, reduced operational cost, as well as

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has identified three
issues which it wants to pursue at the forthcoming Asian economic
ministers' meeting next month.
</P>
<P>
Economic ministers from 10 Asian countries -- China, Japan,
South Korea and the seven ASEAN members, namely Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, are to
attend the two-day meeting on February 14-15 in Chiang Rai,
northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is aimed at laying groundwork for the Asia-Europe
leaders' meeting scheduled for March 1-2 in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held earlier this week chaired by Thai Deputy
Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan, Thai officials proposed that Asian
countries should work to strengthen multilateralism focusing on
the World Trade Organization, and to promote regionalism but in a
non-discriminatory way.
</P>
<P>
They were also of the opinion that Asia and Europe should
enhance economic exchanges in terms of trade, investment and
technology transfers.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will also want to promote the idea of an Asia-Europe
business council and will offer to host a meeting to discuss its
establishment.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Urge Joint Development of Southeast Economic Belt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
called for joint efforts to develop an economic belt consisting of
the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta and
Fujian-Jiangxi-Guangdong Economic Zone.
</P>
<P>
The belt includes Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the
eastern part of Guangdong Province, southwestern part of Fujian
Province and southeastern part of Jiangxi Province -- a total area
of 370,000 sq km and accounting for four percent of the country's
total.
</P>
<P>
Its gross domestic product (GDP) accounted for about 30 percent
of the nation's total to about 900 billion yuan in 1994; its
actual use of foreign investment for 40 percent (except Shanghai);
and its foreign trade volume for more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Lei, president of the Guangdong Academy of
Social Sciences and a research fellow, and Ge Xiaoyu, assistant
research fellow, the belt will become a new economic growth area
to lead the economic development of the country.
</P>
<P>
It has the Shenzhen, Shantou, Zhuhai and Xiamen special
economic zones, Pudong, China's largest economic and technological
development zone, and six bonded zones, as well as three chains of
ports led by Shanghai, Shantou, Xiamen, Guangzhou and Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 1.25 million drop-outs
have returned to school since 1989, thanks to a public charity
program, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
The "Hope Project", which aims at helping children in rural
areas who can not afford their tuition fees, has received 692
million yuan (about 83.4 million US dollars) from the public over
the past six years.
</P>
<P>
Money donated by families, companies and other institutions has
helped build 2,074 primary schools, according to the "China Youth
Development Foundation", the sponsor of the program.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Daming, head of the Supervision Committee of the program,
said on today's "Hope Project Supervision Day" that 10 cases
concerning embezzlement of donations have been handled.
</P>
<P>
He revealed a severe case which involved the headmaster of a
primary school in Wuqi County in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province. The headmaster, whom he did not name, had made an
arrangement which ensured that his son and daughter as well as
children of eight local officials were the beneficiaries of the
program.
</P>
<P>
The headmaster has been removed from his post, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Education Commission show that more
than one million children quit schools in poverty-stricken regions
annually.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the public charity program, the central
government also provides funds to help students return to school.

<HEADLINE> Strict Anti-Graft Codes Set for Ministerial, Provincial Cadres (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wei announced that, in addition to carrying out the existing
measures in greater depth, the central authorities has decided
that the ministerial and provincial officials observe three rules:
</P>
<P>
-- They must set themselves as examples in implementing the CPC
Central Committee's anti-corruption policies;
</P>
<P>
-- They must be responsible for possible corruption loopholes
in the areas or departments under their charge; and
</P>
<P>
-- They must prevent their spouses or children, or colleagues
from involving in corrupt practices;
</P>
<P>
Most of all, these cadres "must take the initiative and lead
others to observe and protect the Party's political discipline,"
Wei said.
</P>
<P>
As one of the five measures to beef up the supervision
mechanism inside the Party, the CCDI will send ministerial-level
officials to ministries, provinces, autonomous regions and major
cities to check on how the central policies and anti-corruption
measures are being observed there, and to report directly to the
CCDI headquarters and to the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of major officials of localities and departments
must be with the agreement of the Party disciplinary bodies at the
same level, said Wei.
</P>
<P>
However, China "still faces a harsh situation and extremely
difficult tasks" in the anti-corruption drive, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, some officials have not enough understanding of
the importance and urgency of this job, leading to poor
performances in carrying out the central policies in this aspect
in some areas and departments. Corrupt practices are increasing in
some fields, and economic cases, degeneration cases and cases of
neglect and dereliction of duty are on a rapid increase. Some
judicial bodies are lax in cracking down on major corruption cases
in some places, and malpractices in departments have reappeared
after recent efforts to stamp them out, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the CPC has "the determination to carry out the current
drive to the very end," to create a good political and social
environment for the country's economic construction and social
development.

<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Anti-Corruption efforts
in 1995 made "relatively obvious achievements," and the Communist
Party of China (CPC) has set rigorous codes of behavior for
ministerial and provincial leaders to further the drive this year,
a top Party disciplinary official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Another new measure for this year will be increased efforts to
beef up the supervisional mechanism inside the Party, said Wei
Jianxing, secretary of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection (CCDI).
</P>
<P>
He said last year's anti-corruption drive was carried out with
"more powerful and dynamic strength and impetus than before". New
progress was made in self-discipline campaigns for Party and
government officials, new breakthroughs were achieved in cracking
corruption cases, and good results were maintained in redressing
malpractices in departments and trades.
</P>
<P>
The central authorities' decision in the case of the two
corrupt officials, Chen Xitong, former Party chief of Beijing
dismissed from all Party and government posts, and Wang Baosen,
who committed suicide for fear of prosecution, was "especially
spectacular," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei is also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee and new Party chief of Beijing. He was speaking at the
sixth plenum of the CCDI, which began today.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months of last year the Party disciplinary and
government supervision bodies nationwide handled 204,737 cases of
corrupt officials above the county-head level, 5.1 percent up over
the same period of last year. Over 100,000 were punished according
to the relevent disciplines, 7.5 percent up over the same period
of last year, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Of those punished, 24 were provincial-level officials, 166.7
percent up over the same period of last year, Wei said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Yuan Expected to Stay Generally Stable by Zhou Genliang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese currency, the yuan,
is expected to retreat slightly against the US dollar in 1996,
though it will remain generally stable, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
"The overall situation of the supply and demand of foreign
exchange will continue to be favorable for a stable yuan," said an
official of the State Administration of Exchange Control.
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be identified, agreed with the
popular belief that China's foreign trade surplus, which reached
16.69 billion US dollars in 1995, will shrink this year, due to a
cut of an average 35 percent in the general import tariff level,
starting April 1, and the government's repeated reductions in tax
rebates for exporters.
</P>
<P>
"But the change in the country's foreign trade balance will not
be so great as to destabilize the exchange rate of the yuan," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He disputed the theory that the tariff cut will trigger an
import boom, as China's real tariff level is already much lower
than the nominal figures in recent years. He added that, as an
offset to the tariff cut, China will also eliminate some
preferential policies for tax exemptions and reductions for
foreign-funded enterprises, which is expected to dampen imports.
</P>
<P>
Tao Liming, deputy director of the International Finance
Research Institute of the Bank of China, the country's major
foreign exchange bank, said that the demand for foreign exchange
will rise, as imports are expected to outgrow exports this year.
</P>
<P>
"This, however, will leave the local currency open to the
pressure of slight depreciation," Tao said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he expected China to continue to record a net
inflow of capital this year, though some modifications in the
country's policies on foreign investment, designed to help control
the size of foreign debt, might slow down the influx of overseas
capital.
</P>
<P>
"A Chinese economy that is undergoing sustained, rapid and
healthy development will continue to be attractive for foreign
investment, " Tao said.
</P>
<P>
While there will probably be a balance of foreign exchange in
supply and demand, Tao noted, "The possibility that demand may
exceed supply can not be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
"That is to say the yuan will generally be stable, but a
cheaper yuan is also likely," Tao said, adding that stability does
not mean no fluctuations at all.
</P>
<P>
Qin Chijiang, director of the Finance Research Institute of the
People's Bank of China, the central bank, said that China's
fast-growing foreign exchange reserve, at 73.5 billion US dollars
by December, will be a stabilizer for the exchange rate of the
local currency, which was quoted at 8.3170 to the US dollar today.
</P>
<P>
An official of the People's Bank of China has said that the
central bank will intervene in the foreign exchange market in case
the yuan fluctuates too wildly.
</P>
<P>
Qin also said that a tight fiscal and monetary policy, intended
to bring inflation down to 10 percent this year, will generate a
macro economic environment favorable for a stable yuan.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Shanghai-based China Foreign Exchange Trade
System told Xinhua by telephone that they also expect the yuan to
stay largely stable this year, but declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The yuan's exchange rate climbed from 8.4462 to 8.3174 to the
greenback last year, which translates into an annual gain of 1.56
percent. In 1994, when the dual exchange rates for the local
currency were unified, the yuan appreciated by 2.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> HKFA Disbands Soccer Team in Fear of Rebel Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong soccer team,
named less than 24 hours earlier, was disbanded Tuesday night by
the Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA), which feared that the
team might be boycotted by rebel senior clubs.
</P>
<P>
On a special executive committee meeting, the HKFA decided to
completely re-select a new Hong Kong team to represent Hong Kong
at the Asian Cup Group Two qualifying tournament starting here on
next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new selection was decided to take place on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected move was obvious in wake of the repeated threat
posed recently by the rebel Association of Hong Kong Professional
Football Clubs (AHKPFC), which consists nine out of the 10 First
Division clubs.
</P>
<P>
The professional group last week signed an ultimatum demanding
a swift change in HKFA's power structure. It criticized fiercely
HKFA's management and wanted more say for the development of Hong
Kong's soccer.
</P>
<P>
The decision of re-selection followed the withdrawal from the
Hong Kong team on Tuesday of five players, who are all from the
rebel senior clubs, citing injuries.
</P>
<P>
HKFA chairman Stewart Lee Leung-nang said Tuesday last night
that the new squad would guarantee against withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
The Association's vice-president Veronica Chan said that
mistrust over the senior clubs banded together as the rebel pro
group led to the re-selection of the team.
</P>
<P>
"The nine clubs stated that they are not going to supply
players for the Carlberg Cup (Lunar New Year tournament slated for
February 19 and 22). How can I trust them supplying players for
the Asian Cup?" she was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The HKFA hoped to keep itself from a liable position in hosting
the Asian Cup event. If Hong Kong pulls out of the qualifying
rounds, it faces harsh punishment from the Asian Football
Confederation and FIFA.
</P>
<P>
For fear of a last-minute boycott, the HKFA would like to be
represented at the Asian Cup by a severely weakened side, rather
than naming a side with players from the senior clubs. Now, the
new team is expected to be formed most probably with players from
Second Division clubs and the Olympic team.

<HEADLINE> Asprilla's Transfer Deal Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Colombian striker Faustino
Asprilla said here on Tuesday he could stay at his Italian club
Parma or go to England's Newcastle United since the two sides had
made a deal on his transfer.
</P>
<P>
Asprilla said that the only one thing missing for the transfer
was his signature, adding he has not made the final decision.
</P>
<P>
Asprilla, whose Parma contract expires until 1997, was
reportedly earlier to join premier league leaders Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
The two clubs had differences on the transfer, mainly focusing
on the fees, which was 6.7 million pounds (10.12 million dollars)
from the English club.
</P>
<P>
That fee would beat the previous club record of six million
pounds (9 million dollars) paid to Queen's Park Rangers for Les
Ferdinand.
</P>
<P>
Asprilla helped Parma win the UEFA Cup last season but was on

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Oil Production Expected to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's oil production is
expected to exceed 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) by the end of
1996, officials from the Oil and Gas Development Corporation
(OGDC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The government recently announced duty exemptions for imports
of equipment and machinery related to oil exploration. Meanwhile,
the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources is drawing up a
plan to give further incentives to the country's oil exploration
companies.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the recent duty exemptions and new incentives
being formulated, the oil exploration drive in Pakistan is
expected to pick new momentum," said the officials.
</P>
<P>
The present oil production in Pakistan is around 80,000 bpd, of
which around 35,000 bpd are produced by the OGDC, and 45,000 by
foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Union Texas, an American oil company that entered Pakistan in
1977, is now producing 21,000 bpd in the local oil fields.
</P>
<P>
However, the present domestic oil production in Pakistan can
only meet 37 percent of the local demand. The government has to
spend around 30 percent of its foreign currency earnings on
imports of various petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's main oil belt is located in southern Sindh province
and southwestern Baluchistan province, where oil exploration
activities are facing setbacks because of problems in the law and
order situation.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Airlines to Lease Jet from Greek Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's flag carrier will
soon lease a Boeing 757 jet from a Greek company to serve its
Asian routes after its Airbus 310 was damaged Sunday in an
accident in Dubai, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Top officials of the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC)
Tuesday held an emergency meeting and decided to finalize a deal
with the Venus Company of Greece to procure one B-757 aircraft on
a short-term lease to continue the airlines' international
operations, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
A RNAC A-310 had its right engine damaged Sunday in Dubai when
it crashed into a serving truck at the airport. There were no
injuries in the accident.
</P>
<P>
The accident has disrupted the schedule of the RNAC's
international flights as it would take seven to 10 days to repair
the A-310, according to the RNAC officials.
</P>
<P>
In addition, two B-757s owned by the RNAC will fly to
Guangzhou, China, Thursday for maintenance under earlier
arrangements, which would leave only one jet plane to serve the
airlines' international sector.
</P>
<P>
The RNAC said that all of its European flights would be
canceled till further notice.
</P>
<P>
The new B-757 from Greece will be leased for only about 10
days, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Delivers State of Union Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Tuesday urged the Republican-controlled Congress to "finish the
job" of balancing the budget and "never...ever" to shut down the
federal government again.
</P>
<P>
Laying out his re-election themes in his State of the Union
Address, Clinton challenged Republican stands on welfare reform,
tax cuts, the minimum wage, health insurance, Medicare and
Medicaid, environmental clean-up, crime-fighting and foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
Clinton proposed a number of new initiatives, including a
1,000-dollar college scholarship for top students and combating
criminal youth gangs.
</P>
<P>
"The era of big government is over. But we cannot go back to
the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves,"
Clinton said. "We must go forward as one America."
</P>
<P>
He urged Republicans currently embroiled in a battle with the
White House to balance the federal budget to lock in agreed-upon
budget savings and continue negotiating the differences. "I am
convinced we will balance the budget," Clinton said. "Now is the
time to finish the job."
</P>
<P>
"I challenge all of you in this chamber: never -- ever -- shut
the federal government down again."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government could default on its national debt by the
end of February, unless Congress raises the debt limit by then.
</P>
<P>
Referring to this possibility, Clinton said: "On behalf of all
Americans, I challenge Congress to preserve the full faith and
credit of the United States, to honor our obligations as we have
for 220 years, to rise above partisanship and pass a
straightforward extension of the debt limit."
</P>
<P>
On other issues, Clinton urged Congress to enact a welfare
reform plan, replacing the Republican version he vetoed, and to
increase the minimum wage, which the Republicans have opposed. He
also called for a tax cut for working families.
</P>
<P>
Urging Americans to work together, Clinton said, "None of this
will work unless all of you, every person in America, reach across
the lines that divide us and try to find common ground."
</P>
<P>
Clinton outlined a handful of initiatives, proposing a merit
scholarship for the top 5 percent of all high school graduates.
</P>
<P>
He also challenged Congress once again to give him the
line-item veto it promised and to adopt a campaign finance reform
bill imposing spending limits and lifting broadcast restrictions
on election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Other proposals Clinton called for include:
</P>
<P>
-- Tax incentives for businesses that clean up abandoned
properties.
</P>
<P>
-- Expansion of a federally funded college work-study program
to one million students, up from 700,000 now. He also called for
all schools to be linked together through the information
superhighway.
</P>
<P>
-- An FBI-led war against youth gangs.
</P>
<P>
-- Legislation protecting workers' pensions and insure health
care benefits for employees when they change jobs or have
pre-existing conditions.
</P>
<P>
-- He challenged Hollywood producers to provide entertainment
their own children would enjoy, and urged a TV classification
system much like the movies.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced an executive order banning federal contracts
with companies that hire illegal aliens -- a practice already
outlawed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
Further, he announced a "one-strike-and-you're-out" policy that
would give public housing authorities the power to evict any
tenant found with guns or drugs or continually involved in drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
During the speech, Clinton named Army General Barry McCaffrey,
now head of the U.S. Southern Command headquartered in Panama, to
head the administration's anti-drugs program.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policy, Clinton cited progress in Haiti, Bosnia,
Northern Ireland and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reiterated his call for Senate to ratify the START II
treaty and a chemical weapons accord, and also urged support for a
global accord banning nuclear tests.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Maintain Stable Economic Development in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso today mapped out Brazil's economic and political
goals for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Brazil will maintain an economic growth rate of four percent
this year, after 4.5 percent in 1995, while inflation, a chronic
problem, will drop to 16 percent this year from 20 percent in
1995, the president said.
</P>
<P>
However, keeping inflation down will bring other problems, such
as an imbalance in public finances, an increase in domestic and
foreign debts caused by high bank interest rates and rising
unemployment, he added.
</P>
<P>
To offset these problems, Cardoso said he had already ordered a
series of measures that include reducing the huge financial
deficit through tax and administrative reforms, stabilizing
domestic prices and cutting annual bank interest rates from the
current 35 percent to 12 percent by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would also set up new insurance and
compensation systems for the unemployed and reduce agricultural
taxes.
</P>
<P>
However, some Brazilian economists have noted that the effects
of these measures will not be seen until the second quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
On the political front, the government will strengthen its
relations with political parties and the National Congress so that
they will support constitutional amendments proposed by the
government, Cardoso said.
</P>
<P>
The government has submitted three important amendments for
Congressional approval, covering tax, social security and
administrative reforms, designed to ensure stable economic
development.
</P>
<P>
In foreign policy, Brazil will give priority to the promotion
of economic and trade relations with regions such as Europe and
Asia, said Cardoso, who is scheduled to visit France, India and
Japan in the first half of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Restart Privatization of State-owned  Enterprises </HEADLINE>

<P>
DHAKA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Privatization process of
state-owned enterprises (SOE) in Bangladesh is expected to restart
after the next general elections fixed on February 15, according
to the Financial Express here today.
</P>
<P>
Matiur Rahman, chairman of the Privatization Board, was quoted
as saying that the government has decided to divest most of the
SOEs especially the jute and textile mills.
</P>
<P>
But the board could not make much headway in implementing its
designed task because of the non-cooperative and hostile political
environment, the chairman said, adding that so far 10 to 12 SOEs
have been privatized out of 150 on the privatization list.
</P>
<P>
He said the necessary groundwork including finalisation of
valuation report was on and "we will start the divestment process
as soon as the environment improves.

BANGKOK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign capital flowing into
Thailand last year hit 15.8 billion US dollars, jumping 154
percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
Foreign capital inflows in the form of loans soared 796 percent
to 6.17 billion dollars last year from 689 million dollars in
1994, according to a report from the Bank of Thailand published
today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment in Thailand jumped 44 percent to 831
million dollars last year from 576 million dollars in 1994, the
central bank said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign net investment in securities soared 253 percent last
year to 3.24 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Yet non-resident baht account deposits rose only 38 percent due
to the government measures to curb non-resident deposits, said the
bank.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that foreign inflows are expected to
continue to increase this year, and the huge inflows of foreign
capital will not threaten the stability of the Thai economy.

DHAKA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Activists of Bangladesh's
opposition parties reacted strongly to the prime minister's
address last night by damaging more than 30 motor vehicles in the
capital here.
</P>
<P>
In her address to the nation over radio and television, Prime
Minister Begum Khaleda Zia insisted on the scheduled polling date
of February 15, saying that there was no alternative to conducting
elections within the stipulated time to maintain the
constitutional continuity.
</P>
<P>
The opposition activists took to the streets in large numbers
soon after the prime minister's address last night, chanting
anti-government slogans, witnesses said today.
</P>
<P>
Some demonstrators went on the rampage and attacked motor
vehicles indiscriminately, the witnesses said, adding that police
intervened and brought the situation under control by lobbing
teargas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the mainstream opposition parties held a joint
meeting last night and rejected the prime minister's speech.
</P>
<P>
The speech was full of "contradictions and lies" which proved
that she did not want a solution to the country's political
impasse and evaded her political responsibilities by justifying
the holding of the elections on February 15.

He said arms production facilities could be distributed among

European countries would then be expected to look to Europe

<HEADLINE> One More Club Joins in Rebel HK Soccer Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- In an evening featuring
turmoils for Hong Kong's soccer, a high-ranking official of the
Eastern soccer club threw his support onto the other First
Division clubs in their defiant stance against the Hong Kong
Football Association (HKFA).
</P>
<P>
"I am very disappointed by some of the HKFA senior officials
who are not really trying their best to promote Hong Kong
football," said Eastern president Lam Kin-ming, who is also HKFA's
vice president.
</P>
<P>
"I hope they can solve the problems as quickly as possible," he
said.
</P>
<P>
And, what was worse, Lam threatened to resign, along with
fellow HKFA vice president Albert Hung, if the HKFA fails to
handle the dispute properly.
</P>
<P>
Lam's announcement came after the HKFA took an unexpected
decision to disband the Hong Kong team it named less than 24 hours
ago. It obviously feared that the team, assigned to represent
Hong Kong at the Asian Cup Group Two qualifying tournament
starting here just one week later. The Hong Kong side took its
first training session Monday morning in the Hong Kong Sports
Institute.
</P>
<P>
The new selection was decided to take place today.
</P>
<P>
Lam's announcement meant that all of Hong Kong's 10 senior
clubs are now confronting the HKFA.
</P>
<P>
Last week, nine First Division clubs, banded together as the
Association of Hong Kong Professional Football Clubs (AHKPFC),
issued an ultimatum demanding reforms in the management of the
sport in Hong Kong and, first of all, a change in the power
structure of the HKFA.
</P>
<P>
The group claimed that Hong Kong soccer had been managed in a
wrongly-oriented manner. It blamed the governing body of
neglecting the interests of the senior clubs and having Hong
Kong's standard of play dropped to a historical low with a
management by "a group of amateurs".
</P>
<P>
The dispute has crippled Hong Kong's preparations for hosting
of and competing in the Asian Cup qualifiers. If fails to present
the event, it faces a punishment from the Asian Football
Confederation, a ban in Asia for example, or as harsh as a
worldwide ban, if it is handed down by the International Football
Federation.
</P>
<P>
The HKFA has established a task force to contact the rebel
clubs in its efforts to solve the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Farmers' Incomes Highest in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shanghai, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The four million farmers
living in the suburbs of this, China's most populous city enjoyed
an average income of 4,246 yuan (about 510 US dollars) last year,
making them the richest farmers in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai's farmers saw an annual growth of income of four
percent after deducting price increases last year," the Shanghai
Rural Social-Economic Investigation Team said in a report.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the farmers' incomes come from rural industries
nowadays, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign enterprises, joint ventures and large urban
industries which have been set up in or moved to the rural areas
in recent years have also offered cash-making opportunities to the
farmers, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The by-products of agriculture make up another big chunk of
their incomes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The sales of vegetables, animal husbandry products and other
side-line products last year accounted for 28 percent of the
farmers' net incomes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The farmers' earnings from bank savings interest and selling
real estate grew by 53 percent and 180 percent, respectively, last
year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
But Shanghai economists warned that the income gap between the
rich and the poor is widening.
</P>
<P>
"Among the farmers living in Shanghai's suburbs, 0.2 percent
are still living under the poverty line with annual incomes of
less than 1,000 yuan," an economist said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the families under the poverty line are those with too
many children, or sick or elderly people, he noted. enditem.

discussed by Brazilian President Fernando Enrique Cardoso and
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori who will visit Brazil on
February 26.
</P>
<P>
A protocol of intent on the project was signed in November 1995
between two consortia, Brisa of Peru and Centroleste of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Vivacua, president of Centroleste, said the link between
the two countries will increase trade between the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans.
</P>
<P>
The corridor will also allow Brazil to lower the cost of its
exports to Southeastern Asia, Latin America and the American west
coast.
</P>
<P>
Vivacua estimated that an investment of about 1.6 billion
U.S. dollars would be needed to build a railway line between the
capital Brasilia and Porto Velho, capital of the north west state
of Rondonia.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Costa Rica in "Underwear War" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica will fight a U.S.
decision to reduce the import quota for underwear manufactured in
Costa Rica, Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Francisco Chacon said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The United States has said it will cut imports of men's
underpants and women's panties from Costa Rica to 7.5 million
dozen this year from 14.4 million dozen in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the restriction applies only to underwear made with
cloth from third countries; underwear made from U.S. fabrics will
not be subject to the quota.
</P>
<P>
Chacon said the U.S. decision is aimed at protecting U.S.
underwear manufacturers in Costa Rica which use U.S. fabrics.
</P>
<P>
Such a policy was unacceptable to Costa Rica, the deputy trade
minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Trade representatives from Costa Rica and the United States met
last week at the headquarters of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) in Geneva to discuss the issue, which has sparked an
"Underwear War" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
If no agreement is reached, the case will be referred to a WTO
panel for arbitration.
</P>
<P>
With the highest labor costs in the Central American and
Caribbean region, Costa Rica competes with lower-wage countries
such as the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican manufacturers therefore needed to buy lower-priced
materials from third countries, Chacon said.

<HEADLINE> Chile Hopes for Equitable Development in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo Frei
pledged he will continue the country's modernization program to
strive for an equitable development in 1996 after 12 consecutive
years of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government has made enormous efforts to overcome
poverty, dedicating 70 percent of the public expenditures of its
national fiscal budget to social programs in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the period of 1990 to 1995, the number of those living
in poverty dropped from 40.1 to 28.5 percent of the total
population.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, a recent report by the Santiago-based U.N.
Economic Commission for Latin American (CEPAL) pointed out that
unequal distribution of income in Latin America is prevalent in
the lower middle-class brackets. Brazil and Chile are the
countries where the lower middle class receives just 20 percent of
total earnings.
</P>
<P>
To solve this problem, the Chilean government will try to
reduce the number of the poor, extend family allowance payments,
improve educational facilities, increase health care investment
and better social infrastructure and public works.

<HEADLINE> World Speeds up to Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The pace of global economic
integration is speeding up as multinational companies plan to
sharply increase their overseas investment in the next five years,
French financial ministry reported today after a survey of
international entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure, retailing and telecommunications are gradually
replacing heavy and tertiary industries as main investment targets
of transnational consortia, the report said after quizzing 260
chief directors of multinational companies and international
economists from Europe, Asia and North America.
</P>
<P>
Asia will remain the first choice for multinational investment,
even surpassing North America and Europe, which have seen an
enormous influx of foreign money since 1980. The report estimated
China alone will need 750 billion U.S. dollars of foreign
investment by 2005.
</P>
<P>
It said companies from Japan and the United States will
possibly overtake European companies in grabbing a lion's share of
the Asian market.
</P>
<P>
The report predicts that overseas subsidiaries, with cheaper
production costs, will replace more expensive domestic production
to become the main source of company profits.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed nine out of ten transnational companies plan
to add to their investment aboard and four out of ten expect their
branches aboard to turn out three fifths to four fifths of their
total profit by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures gauged the foreign investment of
multinational companies at 2.5 trillion dollars, almost
quadrupling the 650 billion dollars investment in 1985. The trade
volume of goods produced in their overseas branches approaches a
quarter of the world's total gross domestic product.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Mario Chiesa, Milan Socialist
leader and the first arrested in the Italian Clean Hands Movement,
was sentenced to five years and four months in prison today by the
Supreme Court of Cassation upholding the verdict by the Milan
Intermediate Court.
</P>
<P>
Chiesa, president of a nursing home in Milan, was arrested in
February, 1992, for taking bribes. He disclosed a series of cases
of offering and taking bribes, which led to the Clean Hands
Movement that shocked the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
Chiesa was sentenced to six years in prison by the Milan
District Court in November, 1992. The term was commuted to five
years and four months after Chiesa's lawyer Nerio Dioda appealed
to the Milan Intermediate Court.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on today's verdict, Lawyer Dioda said that the
prison term should be reduced by two years because Chiesa had been
in custody for seven months awaiting the trial. He also appealed
to the Court to convert the sentence from imprisonment to serving
in social services.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Production Expected to Go Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Wool
Secretariat (IWS) predicted that Australian wool production would
increase by 12 percent in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
In a report titled World Wool Supply to 2000, the
Melbourne-based research and promotion organization said that
Australia's wool production would reach 530 million kg clean by
the end of the century, 60 million kg more than the present
two-decade low.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, sheep population is expected to grow to 140
million from the current 120 million, today's Australian Financial
Review reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that wool production would return to the level
in mid-1980s after dropping dramatically from its record high in
1989-90.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, world wool production is also expected to rise by 11
percent, or 162 million kg, from 1,440 million kg at present.
</P>
<P>
IWS predicts that wool production in Australia, South Africa,
Uruguay and Argentina will increase.
</P>
<P>
A moderate price rise and a decline in Australia's wool
stockpile are expected to boost production.
</P>
<P>
"Right now we are in a trough but wool has a future, and that
is important for wool processors around the world in their
investment decisions," IWS manager of information and trade policy
Chris Wilcox said.
</P>
<P>
The plunge in wool prices and production has hit Australian
wool processors heavily in the past year. They are expected to see
a pick up in business in the next few years.

<HEADLINE> Flower Telegrams Bridge Taiwan Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Compatriots on both sides of
the Taiwan Straits can now send flowers to each other through a
new telecommunications service between Taiwan and the mainland,
even though they cannot meet even during the lunar New Year
Festival.
</P>
<P>
The service, called "Flower Protocol Telegraph" is a creation
of the telecommunications departments on both sides of the Straits.
</P>
<P>
The service is already in operation on the mainland among about
400 cities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The service first started between Beijing and Taiwan on
December 1, 1995, due to the cooperation of Beijing Telecom Bureau
and Taiwan's China Data Processing Center.
</P>
<P>
Then all the other capitals of the mainland's provinces and
autonomous regions opened similar services before January 10, this
year.
</P>
<P>
Only central China's Hunan Province and northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region do not yet offer the service.
</P>
<P>
To date, the Beijing Telecom Bureau has received and sent about
50 telegrams of this kind, among which about 10 came from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jianxun, director of the center's Beijing office, said
that the company will promote the service in Taiwan during the
first week of February, and the number of telegrams from Taiwan to
the mainland is estimated to be about 200 just around the Spring
Festival, a traditional time for Chinese families to get together.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Mid-Autumn Festival and Mother's Day will also
see a boom in users of the service, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Now the center is planning to negotiate with its mainland
counterpart on expansion of the service, such as sending
moon-cakes in autumn, according to Huang.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Taiwan ranks second in terms of the
mainland's postal matter and telephone communication volume to
other countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan media have also reported that the mainland has become
its second-biggest market of telephone communications, next to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Last year E-mail service was put in operation across the
Straits, providing various types of information to businessmen on
both sides.

BANGKOK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Thai Labor and Social Welfare
Minister Phisan Mullasartsathorn has said that he would resign if

<HEADLINE> WTO First Ruling: U.S. Discriminates Against Gas Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization
began showing its teeth and its very first ruling was against a
super heavyweight in international trade: the United States was
found to have violated multilateral free trade law by
discriminating against gasoline imports.
</P>
<P>
Trade experts here applauded the result of the first case the
WTO has heard since its founding barely a year ago, deeming it an
evidence of justice demonstrated by the fledgling global trade
watchdog.
</P>
<P>
Development Minister Werner Corrales of Venezuela, which filed
the complaint against the U.S., said in Caracas that "Venezuela is
very pleased with the decision and with the fact that the WTO's
mechanisms have been shown to work correctly."
</P>
<P>
In the U.S., however, Trade Representative Mickey Kantor
expressed disappointment about the WTO decision, saying that the
U.S. is considering an appeal.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Buchanan, a conservative candidate for the Republican
presidential nomination, said, "This decision of the WTO is a
gross-attack on the sovereignty of the United States of America."
</P>
<P>
Trade officials from other WTO member states apparently showed
no sympathy for the U.S. One of them said the U.S. just cannot
always charge others with trade protectionism but cites
sovereignty when that country itself was found guilty of the same
charges.
</P>
<P>
The suit was brought to the WTO in January by Venezuela, which
accused the United States of practicing protectionism in
restricting gasoline imports by setting double standards for
domestic and foreign products.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela charged that the 1993 U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency rules required lower level of dangerous components, such as
sulfur, olefins and benzene, in imported gasoline sold in nine of
the largest metropolitan areas than that produced by many
U.S. refiners.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela is the largest gasoline exporter to the United
States. It first lodged the lawsuit with the General Agreement of
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the predecessor of the WTO, in 1994 and
brought it again to the WTO, which has tougher rules.
</P>
<P>
Brazil also filed a similar complaint with the WTO against the
United States.
</P>
<P>
To look into the case, the WTO set up a panel last April
consisting of three trade experts from Hong Kong, New Zealand and
Finland. After nine months of investigations, the panel submitted
a report last Wednesday concluding that the U.S. double standard
legislation formed discrimination against foreign goods.
</P>
<P>
The report argued that the measures a WTO member nation takes
should not infringe on the free trade law although they are free
to set their own environmental goals.
</P>
<P>
Under WTO rules, if the U.S. fails to appeal within 60 days
after the panel ruling is formally circulated to all WTO members
on January 29, or its appeal is overruled by WTO's appellate body,
it should rewrite its legislation in line with free trade law or
face penalties.
</P>
<P>
During the GATT era, Washington had defied unfavorable rulings
and escaped penalties because at that time opposition from one
party to a dispute could block a ruling or its implementation.
But under the strengthened procedures for dispute settlement of
the WTO, a country, with its appeal overruled, must comply with
the appellate body's final verdict unless it is overturned by
consensus.
</P>
<P>
Whether Washington will comply with the WTO ruling is regarded
by many trade diplomats here as a key test for the authority of
the new world trade body.

<P>
HARBIN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A Manchurian tiger park, the
world's largest, opened to the public yesterday in this
capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
A total of 30 caged Manchurian tigers will be trained here
before they are returned to nature. It is the first zoological
park combining the functions of wildlife breeding and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people visited the garden in cars, where the
tigers were hunting cows, sheep and chickens, similar to their
life in the wild yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Allowing the tigers to hunt live animals is the most effective
way to prepare this endangered species for life in the wild,
according to park officials.
</P>
<P>
The tigers came from the Hengdao Hezi Cat Family Breeding
Center, which is home to 80 Manchurian tigers.
</P>
<P>
So far, only the first phase of the park expected to cover an
area of one million sq m has been opened to the public.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that only 300 Manchurian tigers are estimated to
live in the wild, mainly in northeast China and in Siberia in
Russia.

STOCKHOLM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Danish Football Federation
president Poul Hylgaard denied in Copenhagen on Tuesday the
possibility for the four Nordic states to co-host the 2006 World
Cup soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, officials from the Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and
Swedish football federations made a decision for a joint bid for
the tournament at a meeting in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
Hylgaard described it as a complete unrealistic idea, adding
that it would take at least 20 years to prepare to hold such a
big-scaled competition because about a dozen new stadiums should
have to be built.
</P>
<P>
He said only a few stadiums in these four countries reached the
criteria of FIFA.
</P>
<P>
For their bid to succeed, world body FIFA would have to amend
its rule stipulating that single country host the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Of the Scandinavian countries, only Sweden has ever staged
soccer's premier tournament in 1958.

<P>
WARSAW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Poland's economy continued to
recover in 1995 with industrial output value rising and inflation
and unemployment falling, local press today quoted the State
Bureau for Statistics as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The value of industrial output rose 10.2 percent, a slowdown

</P>
<P>
Of the 29 industrial sectors, 26 sectors, including
metallurgical, mechanical, automobile and electrical, showed

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Portugal's Shoe Exports Fall for First Time in 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Portugal, Europe's second and
the world's ninth largest exporter of leather shoes, last year saw
the first decrease in 20 years of its shoe exports.
</P>
<P>
Shoe exports earned the country 1.74 billion U.S. dollars in
1995, a slight drop from 1.8 billion in 1994, according to a
report released today by the Association of the Shoe-Making
Industry.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the drop to the continued devaluation of
the Italian lira in recent years. The lira's depreciation has
helped Italy, a major competitor in Europe's shoe market, to boost
its exports.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, exports of Portuguese shoes, which are made for
winter and autumn, were affected by the late winter in Europe,
their main market.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said Portugal's shoe exports did very well
in such new markets as the United States, Canada and Japan in
1995, and the country is planning to win a market share in the
Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Israel.

<HEADLINE> hke012404-- Australia's Inflation Up Slightly in December Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government,
expected to call a federal election soon, has received a boost
today as official data indicated that the country's inflation rate
increased slightly in the December quarter.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index (CPI), or headline inflation, rose 0.8
percent in the December quarter, as compared 1.2 percent rise in
the September quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics
reported today.
</P>
<P>
This has maintained the annual inflation rate steady at 5.1
percent in the year to December, the same as that in the 12 months
to September.
</P>
<P>
Underlying inflation, which removes unusual factors, rose 0.7
percent in the December quarter as compared with 1.2 percent in
the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The 0.7 percent rise has translated the annual underlying
inflation rate to 3.2 percent in the 12 months to December,
compared with 3.1 percent in the year to September.
</P>
<P>
Australia's economy grew at a pace of 3.3 percent in the 12
months to September in 1995, much slower than 6.4 percent recorded
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In its budget for the 1995-96 financial year released in May
last year, the Government projected an economic growth rate of
3.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the government revised the growth forecast further down to
3.25 percent in its mid-year budget released last month in a bid
to maintain a moderate growth.

<P>
ROME, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Lamberto
Dini said here today that Italy would support the Czech Republic's
application to join the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Dini, whose country holds the rotating six-month EU presidency,
was speaking after Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus formally
presented the Czech Republic's membership application.
</P>
<P>
"I foresee that it will be among the first to enter after the
intergovernmental conference (IGC)," Dini told reporters at a
press conference after meeting with Klaus Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The IGC, due to begin on March 29, will review the workings and
treaties of the 15-nation EU in preparation for its enlargement.
The review is expected to conclude by mid-1997, and negotiations
with applicant countries are scheduled to begin six months after

<HEADLINE> Australian Couple Ends Year-Long Antarctic Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- An Australian couple has
survived one year of isolation in Antarctic and returned to Horbat
happy and sound.
</P>
<P>
The first things they wanted to do in the city were to take a
hot bath in a hotel and get the feeling of setting their foot on
carpet again, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Don McIntyre, a 41-year-old electronics engineer from Sydney,
and his 35-year-old wife Margie, a registered nurse, are the first
persons who spent winter at the Commonwealth Bay in Antarctic
since Sir Douglas Mawson's expedition there in 1913.
</P>
<P>
They said that they went to the place known as "the home of the
blizzard" out of the spirit of adventure.
</P>
<P>
They stayed in a fiberglass and wood hut within the Antarctic
circle at the Commonwealth Bay, about 2,400 km from the South
Pole. Their hut was just 300 meters away from the station of the
great Australian Antarctic explorer who spent several winters in
the freezer.
</P>
<P>
Loneliness was their biggest enemy. The lasting darkness in
winter during March to October made Margie cry everyday.
</P>
<P>
"It was just normal, when you look out the window every day and
just see white," she said.
</P>
<P>
They suffered freezing toes when the floor of their hut failed
to warm above -5C in the winter. And unstopping blizzards kept
them inside for 20 days at a stretch.
</P>
<P>
They passed time by talking through satellite telephone to
students in America and Australia, making toy bears and
chronicling the breakdown of Mawson's station.
</P>
<P>
They had their first visitors after 301 days, a group of the
United States Cost Guard Officers who flew in a helicopter there
to check an automatic weather station. But in 45 minutes, the
Coast Guard men took off and the McIntyres were alone again.
</P>
<P>
Once they were caught by a white-out one km away from their
hut, and twice they escaped carbon monoxide poisoning by the
built-up fumes from their cooking and heating gear.
</P>
<P>
The couple plan to stay a long time in hotel before deciding
whether they will embark on another adventure again.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Named NBA Player of the Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan was named the
National Basketball Association's Player of the Week after a
stunning seven days in which he averaged 38 points in four Chicago
Bulls' victories.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has Chicago on an 11-game win streak and off to a 34-3
start, matching the league's best-ever mark through 37 games.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls are on pace to break the league record of 69 wins in
a season set in 1972 by the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, the NBA scoring leader with a 31.7-point average,
pulled down seven rebounds and passed out 2.5 assists a game last
week, sinking 52 percent of his shots from the field and 46
percent from three-point range.
</P>
<P>
Two nights after a season-best 48 points, Jordan scored 46 in a
victory at Washington. The seven-time league scoring champion
followed that with a game-high 32 points and seven rebounds in a
116-104 home triumph over Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's 38 points helped the Bulls subdue host Toronto 92-89
on Thursday and three nights later he had 38 points and nine
rebounds in a 111-96 victory over Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Cold Season Increases Colds in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Although Beijing has seen an
increasing number of patients with fevers and bad colds in recent
months, viral influenza has not yet run rampant in the city, an
expert from the epidemic diseases surveillance department under
the Beijing Anti-epidemic Station told " China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Dong Zhenying from the Beijing Anti-Epidemic Station said that
most of the cold cases in Beijing are infections of the upper
respiratory tract which are caused by bacteria and a weak virus
and are easy to treat. Serious viral flu cases are rare.
</P>
<P>
Dong said that, if no new species of flu virus were detected,
the epidemic disease would not spread widely in the municipality
in the coming several months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Influenza Surveillance Centre warned
that the strength of the flu virus has grown in most parts of
North China since the middle of December and has broken out in
Liaoning, Beijing and Tianjin since New Year's Day. The epidemic
disease is spreading to the northwestern regions.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Beijing Children's Hospital sees some 4,500
children daily, about 65 percent of whom have respiratory tract
infections. All 700 beds in the in-ward departments have been
occupied in recent months, most with patients with respiratory
infections like pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
Doctors blamed the situation mainly on the abrupt changes in
weather. The Central Meteorological Observatory said that the
average temperature in northern China this winter has been 4 to 6
degrees higher than last winter.
</P>
<P>
There is also less precipitation this winter; the dry and windy
weather makes it easy for the flu virus to spread.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the centre appealed to the public to be on guard
in case the flu spreads, especially during the period of Spring
Festival, which falls on February 19. The chances of getting the
flu are lessened when the weather gets warmer, the experts
said.

BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 60,000 senior high school
students in Beijing received military training between 1985 and
1995, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The English language newspaper said that about 12,000 students
from 38 pilot high schools have been trained in shooting, drill,
boxing and military knowledge during the summer holidays each year.
</P>

U.S. dollars) a year for the program.
</P>
<P>
"Military training teaches the youngsters self-discipline," the
paper quoted Cai Fujin, vice-principal of Beijing No.65 school as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Cai added that the training program can help the students grow
up.
</P>

Many single-child parents are worried about their children's
ability to endure the setbacks and hardships which they are bound
to encounter as they grow up, the paper noted.

Another factor in the increase in disputes is ignorance of
labor law and poor management, especially among overseas-funded
and private firms, Chen Gang, a director of the Ministry of Labor,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The labor supervisory institutions focused on inspecting
overseas-funded and private firms last year. To strengthen labor
supervision, labor supervisory institutions have been set up in
almost all provinces across the country.
</P>
<P>
Survey of 23 provinces and cities, including Beijing, south
China's Guangdong, east China's Fujian and Jiangsu provinces,
showed that 300,000 enterprises with 50 million workers were under
inspections by the labor supervisory organizations.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent fines of 6.35 million yuan ( abut 765,000
U.S. dollars) were imposed on nearly 5,000 enterprises. Unlawfully
defaulted or embezzled wages of 340 million yuan (about 41 million
U.S. dollars) were recoved for employees.
</P>
<P>
China will launch a nationwide labor inspection from May to
July.

<P>
BRUSSELS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Seoul Olympic gold medalist
Peter Rono of Kenya will return to competition next month after
several years of silence, according to reports reaching here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rono, who won the title of the 1,500 meters event in the Seoul
Olympics eight years ago, will make his debut in a race at the
Belgian national championships on February 4 as a guest.
</P>
<P>
After that, he will compete in the 1,500 meters event at an
international meeting in Ghent, the United States, on February 7.
</P>
<P>
Rono was reportedly training hard in recent months to prepare
for the Atlanta Olympics, five days before which he will turn 29.
</P>
<P>
But the former champion must win a spot in the pre-Olympic
trials in Kenya, likely slated for late June.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Train Bosnian Government Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will train troops and
other military personnel for the Bosnian government under a
military cooperation accord signed Tuesday, Muslim-controlled
Sarajevo radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We and Turkey have long-term military cooperation relations
and we hope to get enormous assistance from Turkey," said Rasim
Delic, commander-in-chief of the Bosnian Muslim army after signing
the accord at the Sarajevo airport.
</P>
<P>
Ershim Yaltsin, Turkish representative who also put his
signature on the accord, said that the accord is only the start of
Turkish military aid to Bosnia and Turkey will train a large
number of Bosnian troops.
</P>
<P>
Like many other Muslim countries, Turkey, a NATO member, had
provided underground military support to the Bosnian Muslim army
during the more than three years of the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's open military cooperation with Bosnia has gained
support from the United States, which is also planning to train
and equip the Bosnian government army, Turkish officials said in
Ankara last month.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. military cooperation plan with Bosnia has drawn
fire from Russia and its allies, which said the military strength
of the Bosnian warring factions should be restricted instead of
being reinforced after the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
Britain expressed support for Washington but proposed to
dislink the military training operation with the NATO-led
peacekeeping mission so as to keep the neutrality of the NATO.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A new five-million U.S. dollar
chess tournament involving 100 of the world's top players will be
held, President of the International Chess Federation Kirsan
Ilyumzhinov said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ilyumzhinov, 33-year-old millionaire of Russia, said the
players would meet one another over three weeks from around the
end of this year and compete for two semi-final places.
</P>
<P>
The other two places would be for Garry Kasparov and the winner
of the match between Anatoly Karpov and U.S. grandmaster Gata
Kamsky. Prize money would total nearly five million U.S. dollars,
including 1.35 million dollars for the winner.
</P>
<P>
The event would unite the best players in a single tournament
administered by the world governing body, known by its French
initials FIDE.
</P>
<P>
Ilyumzhinov said the tournament could begin on December 22 and
close on January 12, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The FIDE chief has pledged to raise the number of member
countries from 154 and increase the number of registered amateur

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Weekend School For Career Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Juying, a 54-year-old
woman real estate agent, hurries to a woman's training school
every Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Even though China officially adopted a five-day work week
already last May, some Shanghai career women like Zhou Juying are
spending much of their two-day weekend getting further training.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, who is vice-president of the Shanghai Real Estate
Bureau's trade union, says, "I should improve my understanding of
economic theory to keep up with China's fast development. The
training school for women provided a good opportunity."
</P>
<P>
The women's training school, the first of its kind in China,
opened early this month, but offers courses only during the
weekend holiday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 100 women in their 40s and 50s have been accepted as
the first group of students in the school, which is run by the
Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
Although Shanghai now has a total of two million women workers,
accounting for 42 percent of the city's total work force, but,
"women workers nowadays make up at least 60 percent of the total
unemployed workers of the city," a trade union official says.
</P>
<P>
Peng Jianming, an official with the Shanghai Federation of
Trade Unions said that they want women to gain new skills or
knowledge about everything from international business, trade, and
law to family planning, fashion design, and rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
"Women with the new knowledge and new skills are less likely to
be dismissed from their job," she pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Sievinen Equals World Swimming Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Finland's Jani Sievinen
reinforced his claim to the title of world's best all-round
swimmer when he produced his second short-course world record
performance in four days in the World Cup swimming meet in
Sheffield, England, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The world 200 meters medley champion, who had cut over a second
off his own 400 meters medley mark in Finland on Saturday,
equalled his world best for the 100 meters medley.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Finn stormed home alone in 53.78 seconds to
equal the mark he set four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Sievinen had earlier won the 400 meters medley in 4:18.38, some
12 seconds outside his new world record, but was clearly saving
himself for an attack on his 100 meters record and his current
form suggests he is going to be the man to beat in the Olympic
medley events.

<HEADLINE> Britain Calls on U.S. to Open Weapon Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Defense
Minister Michael Portillo today called on the United States to
open its weapon market and change its protectionist defense
industrial policy.
</P>
<P>
"As a politician with a district, I understand the local
pressure" on U.S. politicians to support home-made defense
products, Portillo said. "But there should be no illusions:
domestic source restrictions in U.S. legislation will ultimately
harm U.S. industry's prospects of selling to Britain."
</P>
<P>
Portillo, who held high-level talks with U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry on Monday at the Pentagon, told reporters that the
British government believes "a genuine two-way street in defense
trade is an important part of a stable trans-Atlantic defense
relationship."
</P>
<P>
The British defense chief disclosed that his country purchased
a variety of military ware from the United States totally worth of
some 5 billion U.S. dollars in 1995, including Apache attack
helicopters, CH-47 Chinook cargo helicopters and C-130J Hercules
cargo planes.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States buy far less weapons from British
defense industries. Pentagon officials said that they have little
need to purchase big-ticket weapons from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
"This does not always please our domestic suppliers," Potillo
said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Commander Meets Russian Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO Commander in Europe General
George Joulwan met with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev
here today to discuss the multinational peacekeeping operation in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Joulwan told Grachev that the "first stage of the operation has
been completed" and the operation "is going successfully."
</P>
<P>
As many as 42,000 peacekeepers have been deployed in the
conflict area. "Their number will reach 60,000 men in the near
future," Joulwan added.
</P>
<P>
It took about 2,000 flights to deploy the peacekeeping
contingent in the Balkans, the European forces Commander of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) said, adding that some
300 trains delivered more troops and 30 to 40 items of military
hardware each.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the operation now involves 34 countries.
Pakistan, Morocco and other countries are likely to join in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
The conflicting sides are observing the Dayton peace accord
and, particularly, they pulled out heavy weapons from the area of
responsibility of the peacekeepers, Joulwan said.
</P>
<P>
The main problems of the operation, he pointed out, include
"the insufficiently effective exchange of prisoners of war and the
continuing presence of foreign troops in the Balkans."
</P>
<P>
Joulwan arrived in Moscow earlier today.
</P>

Commenting on the operation, Grachev said that "everything
possible must be done to ensure the operation is carried out
without a single shot." The operation will be seriously
complicated, "if servicemen of the multinational forces get
involved in even a single shootout," he noted. Grachev also said
he plans to visit Bosnia-Herzegovina in early February to see the
operation in progress.

<HEADLINE> 660 UNITA Fighters Gather At Assembly Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of 660 UNITA fighters
have so far gathered at Vila Nova assembly camp in the central
Angolan province of Huambo, a United Nations official said today.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Rodrigues do Nascimento, spokesman of the UN Angola
Verification Mission (UNAVEM), told newsmen here these UNITA
fighters have handed over 644 firearms to UNAVEM.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, do Nascimento said, members of the rapid
intervention police force of the Angolan army will begin
assembling in Huambo Province tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Since the intervention police force started the assembly
exercise on January 10 in line with the Lusaka Protocol, about
1,552 members have trickled into the assembly camps in Luanda
Province and the northern Uige Province.
</P>
<P>
Forces of the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) began assembling on November 20, 1995, the first
anniversary of the signing of the Lusaka Protocol between the two
warring sides.
</P>
<P>
The process was suspended early last December following armed
clashes near the northern city of Soyo between the government
forces and the UNITA. It resumed recently under the mediation of
UNAVEM.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Waiter Arrested for "Marrying" Under-Aged British Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- An 18-year-old Turk who has
outraged the British public and sent the British press into a
frenzy by "marrying" a 13-year-old British girl was arrested by
Turkish police today on charges of abducting and sexually abusing
an under-aged girl.
</P>
<P>
Musa Komeagac, a waiter in Turkey's Mediterranean resort of
Alanya, met Sarah Cooke, a high school student, last summer during
a vacation with her parents.
</P>
<P>
The two decided to marry after a three-day romance which
resulted in Musa losing his job since he was kissing and cuddling
his 13-year-old girlfriend all over the place rather than serving
customers.
</P>
<P>
The affaonth for wedding.
</P>
<P>
Since the Turkish Civil Law does not allow such a marriage
with an under-aged girl involved, they held a religious wedding
ceremony with the presence of Imam, or Moslem clergyman.
</P>
<P>
Under Turkish law, a woman has to be at least 15 to be able to
wed legally with parents' consent. Men can marry at 17.
</P>
<P>
The story has appeared on the front pages of British Tabloids
with banner headlines such as "Disgusting" and "Immoral" and
described the marriage as a child abuse case.
</P>
<P>
While Sarah's parents were accused of aiding and abetting
unlawful sex in Britain, Turkish police in the province of
Kaharaman-Maras arrested Musa Komeagac to be charged with
abducting and sexually abusing an under-aged girl, the private
television ATV reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
However, Musa's lawyer said they would demand Musa's immediate
release because there was no force and persuasion involved in the
affair.
</P>
<P>
Under Turkish law, the lawyer said, although the couple cannot
have a civil marriage, the situation in this case is not unlawful
as long as there is no forcible sex involved.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Seizes Truckloads of Arms Believed for PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's interior minister said
today that six truckloads of arms and ammunition had been seized
in the southeast on their way to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Teoman Unusan was speaking at a press conference held in the
province of Sanliurfa where the arms and ammunition were shown to
local journalists.
</P>
<P>
The six trucks with Turkish plates, were seized by Turkish
security forces last week in Sanliurfa and Hatay provinces, both
bordering Syria.
</P>
<P>
Although their manifesto said that they were carrying oil and
paraffin, the barrels concealed kalashnikov bullets, explosives
of tnt, plastic bombs, land mines and six anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
Local reports say all these were loaded in a plant owned by an
Iranian oil company. The trucks were supposed to go through Syria
and unload their cargo in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The address in Lebanon is a false one, which leads us to
believe that the cargo would be unloaded in Syria," said Unusan.
</P>
<P>
The minister went further to blame Syria for "supporting
terrorism" by helping the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) obtain
the arms in their bases which Turkey claimed in Syria or
Syria-controlled Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Syria's attitude of extending support to terrorist
organizations, with a desire to threaten domestic security of
various countries is nothing new," said Unusan.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkey's claim fell short of supporting with
conclusive evidence.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's accusation that Syria has a finger in the
transport of arms comes at a time when Turkey has become
extremely vocal on the issue of Syrian support of PKK, which
has launched a separatist war against Turkey in the southeast
since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the trucks were loaded in Iran, Unusan
said that Iranian authorities had assured Turkey that the loading
could not have been made "with the knowledge of the Iranian
authorities."
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials said they would provide Ankara with
information as soon as they finished their investigation.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Airways Plane Seized In London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A Nigeria Airways DC-10 aircraft
has been impounded in London under the orders of a British court
over a debt of 446,000 Pounds the airline owes a Nigerian
advertising company, Adwork.
</P>
<P>
Airways spokesman Chris Aligbe said here today Adwork has
obtained a court injunction in Lagos and has gone to London to
seek the power of attorney to execute the order.
</P>
<P>
Adwork's lawyer brought a notice of detention of the aircraft
after the management of the advertising firm requested Nigeria
Airways to pay 250,000 Pounds before it could discuss the debt
with the airline.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria Airways offered to pay 100,000 Pounds, which Adwork
refused.

<HEADLINE> Swazi Business Out To End Costly Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Swazilands' business
leaders met tonight in a bid to find solutions to end the
nationwide strike which has crippled the kingdom's economy, the
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The indefinite strike entered its third day today. It was
called by the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU) and
other pro-democracy groups to demand an end to the absolute
monarchy established with the banning of political parties in
1972.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the business community said a delegation would seek
an audience with King Mswati III, who has kept quiet on the
strike.
</P>
<P>
"You can say without doubt that Swaziland has ground to a
halt," one business leader was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The usually-bustling streets of the capital Mbabane and the
second largest city, Manzini, are deserted. Banks and fast food
outlets are also closed. A heavy security force presence is
maintained in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
However, the SFTU claims that the strike would continue until
the Swazi government lifts the ban on free political activity and
agrees to start negotiations leading to a multi-party democracy
in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued by the Federation of Swaziland
Employers and the Swaziland Chamber of Commerce and Industry
appealed to the Swazi government and the SFTU to resolve their
differences.
</P>
<P>
It expressed concern that there has been no movement to
"rectify the situation and restore a normal work environment".
</P>
<P>
"If the situation is not urgently resolved, the direct result
will be continuing financial loss to business and loss of
markets, possibly leading to permanent closure and escalating
unemployment in the kingdom," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Employers Federation Executive Director Musa Hlophe said the
strike has caused an unprecedented total shut-down of the
economy, with serious knock-on effects to the crucial tourism
industry after clashes between police and demonstrators during
the strike.
</P>
<P>
About 75,000 of Swaziland's 90,000 private sector employees
are on strike, with costs to the economy estimated at more than
10 million Rand (about 2.74 million US dollars) a day.

<HEADLINE> Swazi King Mswati III Keeps Quiet On National Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 24 (Xinhua) --Swaziland's King Mswati
III by this afternoon did not make any public statement on a
national strike crippling his country, despite expectations that
he would use a traditional ceremony to do so.
</P>
<P>
Mswati III was expected at the Ludzidzini royal residence in
capital Mbabane to dismiss traditional regiments after the
sacred Incwala ceremony marking the new harvest.
</P>
<P>
The Incwala is one of the most important traditional occasions
on the Swazi calendar. Msqati traditionally addresses the
warriors when dismissing them, and often makes important
announcements which are always broadcast on national television.
</P>
<P>
The event was reportedly postponed to take place on Thursday
or Friday.
</P>
<P>
The national strike, called by the Swaziland Federation of
Trade Unions (SFTU ) entered its third day today with no sign
that employees would regurn to work.'
</P>
<P>
swaziland's main towns were paralysed as the strike continued
today.
</P>
<P>
In the capital Mbabane and second largest city Manzini, power
and water supplies remained cut, few shops opened and petrol was
scarce. Telephone communications were also expected to be
severed.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the SFTU Lwazi Hlope said the strike would
continue until the government moved to meet the strikers' 27
demands, including scrapping a ban on free political activity.
</P>
<P>
The pro-democracy strike was supported by the banned
anti-government political parties, including the People's United
Democratic Movement (PUDEMO) and the Swaziland Youth Congress.
</P>
<P>
Swazi Prime Minister Mbilini Dlamini went on national
television last night to urge the strikers to return to work, but
the call was ignored by the protesters.
</P>
<P>
Pressure has been growing for several years for the Swazi
authorities to dismantle non-party government and allow free
political activity, outlawed by King Sobhuza in 1972.
</P>
<P>
PUDEMO President Kislom Shongwe said six people, including
SFTU President Richard Nxumalo and Secretary-General Jan Sithole
had been arrested since the strike began on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Syria Concerned In Third Round of Negotiations with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Syria is extremely concerned
with the third round of Syrian-Israeli negotiations, slated to
start today in the U.S. State of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
In a political commentary today, Damascus radio expressed the
hope that this round of talks would be decisive as the two sides
are going to deal with security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that Syria had not dispatched its
delegation to Maryland for mere negotiations only, but to seek
appropriate and decisive solutions. To this end, the Syrian
delegation will conduct calm, profound and responsible
negotiations in conformity with its expectation and strategic
option, namely, a just and comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
The radio indicated that the ultimate objective of the Maryland
negotiations is to achieve peace in line with the terms stipulated
in relevant U.N. resolutions. But one ought to realize that this
cherished objective could fail, should inappropriate measures be
taken and the legitimate rights be evaded.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that Syria has spelled out the necessity of
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights to the pro-June 4, 1967
borders, and from south Lebanon. Such withdrawal is a prerequisite
for peace, it added.
</P>
<P>
It is not merely a Syrian prerequisite, but a condition and the
very essence of peace itself, the radio said. Furthermore,
security measures have to be equitable and balanced, free of
injustice.
</P>
<P>
The radio expressed the hope that the U.S. partnership in the
peace process would help in guiding the talks to proceed along
the right direction in accordance with international law and the
relevant U.N. resolutions.
