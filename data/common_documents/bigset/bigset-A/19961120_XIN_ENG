<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) has strengthened emergency health services in the Great
Lakes region in Rwanda to cope with the massive demand for care as
hundreds of thousands of refugees return home to escape the armed
conflict in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
WHO experts believe the health situation in the region is
critical and with more refugees likely to return from Zaire, they
are expecting to be overloaded with work.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen regional emergency health services, the WHO is
stepping up efforts for rapid assessment of the health situation,
strengthening local facilities and improving communication systems
to ensure prompt response to any possible epidemics of cholera,
malaria and meningitis.
</P>
<P>
The health body has stockpiled drugs for several diseases but
warned that the spread of cholera could be only effectively
prevented through providing safe drinking water and improving
environmental sanitation in settlements.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the U.N. health agency confirmed an outbreak of
cholera among the population in eastern Zaire. It is working to
establish a surveillance system to monitor the situation.
</P>
<P>
"The confirmation of cholera is of great concern, but it is
just one of several diseases that can strike the population in the
area, given the poor sanitary conditions", said Ebrahim Samba, the
Director of WHO's Regional Office for Africa.

<HEADLINE> Malraux Honored as Ashes Moved to Pantheon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Andre Malraux, the legendary
French writer, resistance fighter and personal friend of General
Charles de Gaulle, will become the 72nd great name in French
history to be entombed in the Pantheon.
</P>
<P>
Malraux's ashes, currently resting in a cemetery in
Verrieres-le-Buisson, Essonne, will be transferred to the temple
in Paris in a "sober, serene, dignified, and modest" ceremony on
November 23, the 20th anniversary of his death.
</P>
<P>
Malraux will thus follow Jean Moulin, the leader of France's
World War Two resistance movement, who died at the hands of his
Gestapo torturers, as one of the outstanding figures of French
modern history to be buried in the Pantheon.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac will make a speech in memory of the
writer and thinker, after a procession of 200 youngsters carry
Malraux's ashes into the classic Roman-style temple, built in 1744
on the orders of the then King Louis XV.
</P>
<P>
Born on November 3, 1901, in Paris, Malraux had a strong
interest in Asian culture and history from a very early age, and
traveled widely in China, Cambodia and Indochina. He became an
avant-garde of surrealist art in Paris in 1920s and saw the
publication of his first work, "Lune en Papier (Moonlight on the
Paper)" in 1921.
</P>
<P>
In 1928, he published "Les Conquerants," a novel about the
workers' uprising in Shanghai in 1927 which was suppressed by
Chiang Kaishek in collaboration with Western imperialist forces.
</P>
<P>
In 1933, another novel by Malraux on the subject, "La Condition
Humaine," won the prestigious Goncourt Prize.
</P>
<P>
After being wounded in World War Two, Malraux founded one of
the first Gaullist guerrilla groups to fight the Germans, and
participated in the liberation of Alsace in 1945.
</P>
<P>
In 1958, when General Charles de Gaulle returned to power,
Malraux became France's first minister of culture, and launched an
11-year cultural renovation movement which included the reform of
art education in France, promotion of contemporary art, protection
of medieval areas of Paris, and creation of the Palace of Culture.
</P>
<P>
He died on November 23, 1976.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Political Crisis Rocks Belarus Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Belarus' President Alexander
Lukashenko and Constitutional Court Chairman Valery Tikhinya held
urgent talks today to try to defuse the political crisis which has
rocked the country, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko has been locked in a bitter power struggle with
parliament mainly over his proposals for a referendum on November
24 to increase his powers.
</P>
<P>
Members of parliament today began impeachement proceedings
against Lukashenko. This latest move comes in the wake of a
weekend of violent clashes between police loyal to the president
and opposition demonstrators and the resignation of Prime Minister
Mikhail Chigir yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Early today, the Constitutional Court received an appeal signed
by 75 parliamentary deputies for the instigation of impeachment
procedures against Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's current legislation, at least 70 votes are
required to open impeachment proceedings. If the court recognizes
any of the president's decisions as unconstitutional, his powers
may be suspended until parliament considers his future in office.
</P>
<P>
However, two thirds of the votes, or 133 of the 199-seat
parliament, are required to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was generated by disputes between the
president and the opposition-dominated parliament over a
nationwide referendum initiated by Lukashenko to amend the
constitution and greatly increase his powers.
</P>
<P>
Parliament objected and the Constitutional Court backed the
protest. Lukashenko responded by issuing a decree mandating the
dissolution of any body of power hampering the referendum
scheduled for November 24.
</P>
<P>
On November 14, Lukashenko sacked the Chairman of the Central
Electoral Commission Viktor Gonchar, who had repeatedly stated
that he would not sign the final documents of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
In response, Constitutional Court chief Tikhinya sent a letter
to the president, telling him that his decree firing Gonchar
should be revoked since the head of state had exceeded his
constitutional powers. Under the Fundamental Law, the chairman of
the Central Electoral Commission can be dismissed only by the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Prime Minister Chigiry, appointed by Lukashenko in
1994, threatened to resign over Lukashenko's confrontation with
parliament unless the president met a set of demands including the
scrapping the referendum.
</P>
<P>
But Lukashenko accepted his resignation, describing the
premier's move as a "betrayal." He appointed Chigiry's first
deputy Sergei Ling as acting Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting between Lukashenko and Tikhinya was one of the
reasons for the postponement of a session of the Constitutional
Court this morning which was expected to start discussing the
lawmakers' impeachment proposals.
</P>
<P>
Deputy parliamentary speaker Gennady Karpenko said the demand
for Lukashenko's impeachment does not mean that parliament is
refusing to negotiate with the president.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he admitted, the submission of the signatures
to the Constitutional Court "will undoubtedly make talks with the
president more difficult."
</P>
<P>
Karpenko also stressed that whatever the outcome of the
political crisis and the future constitutional referendum in
Belarus, there will be no winners and no losers in the
confrontation between the president and the parliament.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, a close ally of
Lukashenko, is watching developments in neighboring Belarus with
concern.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said that the Russian
president and his Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had a working
meeting earlier today to discuss the worsening situation.
</P>
<P>
They are concerned about the escalating tension in Belarus and
hope "common sense and a search for political compromises will win
over confrontation and ambitions," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> US Housing Starts Drop Sharply in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Housing starts in the U.S.
dropped by 5.1 percent in October to the lowest level in a year,
the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that construction of new homes and
apartments in October totaled 1.37 million at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate, the smallest since 1.35 million in the same
month of 1995.
</P>
<P>
It was the second straight decline following a revised 6.1
percent drop in September which was even weaker than the initial
estimate 6 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
The housing starts reached a total of 1.53 million in August,
the highest since March 1994. And many analysts had expected a
slight increase in home building in October due to lower mortgage
rates.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.85 percent in
October, compared to 8.23 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the continuing decline of housing starts in
October showed that the U.S. economy was slowing down as expected.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Home Builders also said Monday thatousing Market
Index fell in November for
the sixth straight month. All three of the index components
slipped -- current sales, traffic by prospective buyers and sales
expectations over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said applications for
building permits, often a barometer of future activity, declined
by 2.7 percent to a 1.3, about 80 percent of total housing starts
in the U.S. slipped by 4.6 percent to a 1.07 million rate, the
lowest since 1.04 million in June 1995. Construction of apartments
and condominiums also fell by 7.2 percent to a 297,000 rate.
</P>
<P>
Regionally in the country, housing starts fell by 9.3 percent
in the Northeast, 9.2 percent in the Midwest and 8.3 percent in
the South. The only increase was seen in the West.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Warns Against Trouble in Israeli Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak said today the Israeli demands for "hot pursuit" and
closure of Shuhada Street in the West Bank city of Hebron have
blocked the progress in Israeli-Palestinian talks and are
unacceptable to the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after having inaugurated the first stage
of the peace Canal siphon, the president warned that the Israeli
demands would create "very big problems" in the future and lead
to regional violence.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have rejected the right demanded by Israel of
"hot pursuit" of suspected militants in the Palestinian-run area
in Hebron, where 450 Jews living amidst 120,000 Arabs.
</P>
<P>
It will never be acceptable to the Palestinians to have their
houses searched by Israeli authorities, or be arrested and
detained in Israel, he added.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, violence will flare up anew and no solution will be
reached, warned the president.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he discussed the matter with the Palestinians who
feared that such a situation would give Israel the upper hand
over the Palestinian Authority (PA).
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians also demanded a timetable for the reopening
of Shuhada Street, the main artery through the Jewish
settlements. Israel has agreed to reopen the street to
Palestinian business and to through-traffic in stages "in
accordance with security considerations."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side wants any Hebron agreement to link with
further implementation of the signed agreements. But Israel
demanded "reciprocity" from the Palestinians in the observance of
the Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
Calling the closure of the street as unacceptable and
illogical, Mubarak said it is similar to racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to say that this street is permitted for
Jewish settlers only and deny the Palestinians the right to use
it," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Calling for a workable formula to be approved by both sides,
the president reiterated the need for Israel to respect the deals
signed before.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israel-PLO accords, Israel should have handed over
80 percent of Hebron to the PA in March and the Jewish settlers
remained in five tiny enclaves of the city.
</P>
<P>
However, the move was delayed by the previous Israeli

Jiang said that to reach that goal, cold war thinking must be
dropped, and relations between all countries must be handled in a
level-headed way, objectively and practically, and on the basis of
mutual respect, equality, and seeking common ground while
preserving differences.
</P>
<P>
Only when this is done, can the road will followed and all
interference stopped, so as to concentrate on promoting major
interests common to different countries, Jiang said. He noted that
China and the US are two big nations and permanent members of the
UN Security Council, and that their common interests are vast and
important.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have a common responsibility in safeguarding
world peace and stability and promoting world economic development

sound Sino-US relations are in the fundamental interest of the two
countries and the two peoples, as is joining hands in creating a
peaceful, stable, prosperous and wonderful 21st century.

their ups and downs, but generally speaking, have moved
forward. Especially in recent days, relations have improved
somewhat owing to efforts by both sides, and high-level contacts
have increased and some common ground has been reached.
</P>
<P>
He said, "if the two countries' leaders can really look at
Sino-US relations from a strategic height while abiding by the
principles of the three Sino-US communiques, increasing mutual
trust, decreasing problems, developing cooperation and avoiding
confrontation, it is entirely possible to develop a constructive,
cooperative relationship between China and the United States."

advance bilateral relations, ushering in a new chapter.
</P>
<P>
Li cited China and Germany as two important countries, and said
that their individual situations and bilateral relations have a
profound impact on the world. There are no historical problems

China and Germany have had frequent high-level exchanges and
continued development of bilateral economic and trade relations in

satisfactory direction.
</P>
<P>
Although China's economy has developed rapidly since it
introduced the reforms and opening-up, he said, there are still
some problems that need to be studied and dealt with. China is
involved in economic construction, so the Chinese people need a
long-term stable domestic situation, and want a peaceful and
friendly international environment.
</P>
<P>
Li briefed Herzog on the multi-party cooperation system under
the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and the situation
of the CPPCC organization.

ideology will not an obstacle to further bilateral relations, but
on the contrary, will be the basis of expanded exchanges.
</P>
<P>
China is an important country, which is witnessing stability
right now, he said, and the country will enjoy stability and
prosperity in the future, and that the two countries should
develop equal relations and increase contacts between their
leaders so as to promote mutual understanding.
</P>

MOSCOW, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
held talks by telephone with Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko and parliamentary speaker Semyon Sharetsky today over
the growing political crisis in Belarus.
</P>
<P>
According to the press service of the Russian President,
Yeltsin is concerned about the growing confrontation between
Lukashenko and the opposition-dominated parliament.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Belarus was discussed during the talks," the
press service said, referring to Yeltsin's separate telephone
conversations with Lukashenko and Sharetsky.
</P>
<P>
A meeting between the two Belarussian leaders, scheduled for
this morning, failed to take place, according to reports reaching

the president and the legislature who have been locked in a bitter
power struggle over Lukashenko's plans for a referendum on
November 24 to increase his powers.
</P>
<P>
Sharetsky told Yeltsin parliament wanted Lukashenko withdraw
the new draft constitution from the national referendum and in
return parliament would call off its moves to impeach the
president, the press service said.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation between Lukashenko and the lawmakers has been
going on for several months, focusing on constitutional amendments
Lukashenko wants to be decided in the nationwide referendum.
</P>
<P>
The amendments to the former Soviet republic's constitution,
proposed by Lukashenko, would expand the powers of the president.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng held a meeting
with US Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Beijing's Great
Hall of the People this afternoon where he said that sound Sino-US
relations can benefit both countries and some major differences
should not be an obstacle to developing normal relations.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to develop its relations with the United States on
the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial
integrity and non-interference in each other's internal affairs,
the premier noted.
</P>
<P>
The people of both China and the US are great and they have
forged a profound friendship, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The premier and Christopher agreed that important progress has
been made in Sino-US relations over the past few months, and
Christopher said that both sides should continue to make efforts
to improve the relationship.
</P>
<P>
The US attached importance to the noticeable success China has
had scored in the past decade, and respects the determination and
efforts of the Chinese people in the reform and opening-up drive,
Christopher said. The world needs a prosperous, open, stable, and
secured China.
</P>
<P>
Admitting China to the World Trade Organization conforms to the
interests of the United States, which is willing to speed up
negotiations with China so as to enable it to join the WTO at an
earlier date, Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that China has a positive attitude toward its
membership in the WTO and, in implementing its policies of reform
and opening to the outside world, his country is willing to
participate in the competitions on the international market. The
pending issue of China's entry into the WTO is abnormal and unjust
and it is partly resultant from the interference of some political
factors.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the relevant parties will adopt the
forward-looking attitude and, proceeding from a still more
realistic angle, surmount difficulties to resolve this issue at an
earlier date.

Li said, "China's attitude is constructive and flexible, but we
will not compromise on things that are harmful to the country's
fundamental interests. We demand a balance between power and
obligations."
</P>
<P>
The WTO will be more complete with China's entry into the
organization, and all members, including the US, will benefit from
the effort, he added.
</P>
<P>
China has already made a tremendous effort at lowering import
tariffs, something which should draw an active response from WTO
members, especially developed countries, Li said, noting that
market access should go both ways.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of bilateral cooperation in environmental protection,
Li said the Chinese government has been paying great attention to
it, and is ready to work in cooperation with every country
including the United States.
</P>
<P>
Christopher expressed his appreciations for China's great
efforts for environmental protection and admirations for policy
decisions and the subsequent actions adopted by the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the high-level exchanges between the two countries
will help promote bilateral concrete cooperation in the the field
of environmental protection, he added, and that the US attaches
great heed to this.

Christopher arrived in Beijing Tuesday evening for a three-day
visit at the invitation of Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen. They have held wide-ranging and in-depth

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A long-term co-operation
program between European and Chinese aerospace industries has been
announced at a symposium taking place in Tianjin's China Civil
Aviation Institute.
</P>
<P>
It marks for the first time that European aerospace industries
have been grouped under one program to work with Chinese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Organized by Airbus Industrie, the symposium marks the first of
a series of actions to be jointly undertaken by the European
Association of Aerospace Industries (AECMA), the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC), and the Aviation Industries of
China (AVIC), said a press liaison official with Airbus Industries
China.
</P>
<P>
Dong Yuguo said the symposium has attracted about 100 people
from CAAC, AVIC, airline businesses, as well as representatives
from European aerospace companies.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Europe's Joint Airworthiness Authorities (JAA),
Airbus Industrie, and other European aerospace companies, made
presentations on topics ranging from the organization of the JAA,
its regulations and work procedures, to ways of reaching safety
levels through technology, industrial handling, support to
operators and safety management, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two-and-a-half-year program, co-financed by the European
Commission, the European Aerospace industries and the Chinese
government, will provide Chinese aviation personnel with training
courses, seminars and visits to European facilities, according to
a memorandum on aeronautical co-operation signed last week in
China by Wu Yi, China's Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation, and Sir Leon Brittan, vice-president of the European
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The program will focus on the four themes of airworthiness,
certification and regulations, product support and maintenance,
product management, and air traffic management.
</P>
<P>
Aeronautics is one of the priority industries under European
Union business co-operation in China, said a statement by the EC
Delegation in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The overall objective of this program is to promote closer
ties and facilitate direct business contact between the European
and Chinese aerospace industries, particularly in areas of
critical importance to both economies."
</P>
<P>
The biggest co-operation program between the Chinese and the
European aerospace industries is the AE100 project, one to develop
a new generation of 100-seater passenger jets.
</P>
<P>
The 1.7 billion US dollar project is a partnership by AVIC,
Aero International Asia (a joint venture of Aerospatiale of
France, British Aerospace, and Alenia of Italy), and Singapore
Technologies Private.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the whole Airbus Industrie group is to join the
project. Aerospatiale and British Aerospace are two of the four
shareholders in the consortium.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines To Buy Over 100 Boeing Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 20 (Xinhua) -- American Airlines, one of the
major civil aviation operators of the U.S., is expected to upgrade
its fleet by ordering more than 100 jets valued at nearly 6
billion U.S. dollars from Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported today the deal includes firm
orders for 12 Boeing 777 widebody jets, about 75 Boeing 737s and
smaller numbers of 767 and 757 jets.
</P>
<P>
The journal put the number of aircraft involved in the deal at
more than 100. But the New York Times placed it at several
hundred.
</P>
<P>
American apparently planned to replace its 260 McDonnell
Douglas MD-80s with Boeing 737s. The deal would be another blow to
McDonnell Douglas, which last weekend was eliminated from a
Pentagon competition to build a new fighter plane for the U.S.
Navy, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Replacing McDonnell Douglas planes with Boeings would simplify
American's fleet -- the airline currently flies some 235 Boeings,
almost 300 McDonnell Douglas jets, 75 Fokkers and 35 Airbus
planes.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- President Roman Herzog told a
press conference here this evening that he is satisfied with his
brief China trip, and that he had "frank and satisfactory"
meetings with Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
These included President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, and Chairman of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Conference Li Ruihuan.
</P>
<P>
During the past two days, he said, he conversed with them on
China's economic policies, prospects for economic development,
human rights, foreign policies, and a variety of other issues.
</P>
<P>
The goal of his visit was more scientific than economic, he
noted, as was demonstrated by the members of his delegation. These
included Astronaut Ulfmerbold, President of the German Research
Foundation Wolfgang Fruehwald, and Reimar Lust, president of the
Alexander Von Humboldt Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Also, three technical cooperation agreements were signed by the
two governments on technological cooperation Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Helmut Schafer, federal state minister of foreign affairs who
is a member of the delegation, noted after the press conference
that both sides expressed the hope of establishing normal
relations, "like that among friends", and of promoting dialogue on
problems, to do away with "irritation and antagonism."
</P>
<P>
He said many issues were discussed during the meeting with
Vice-Foreign Minister Wang Yingfan on issues concerning Taiwan,
and Hong Kong, and the possibility of setting up a regional
organization similar to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Herzog also visited a national international transport and
commodity fair today, and attended the Second Sino-German
Symposium on Economic Cooperation and Investment, as well as the
opening ceremony of an exhibition of artwork donated by the German
collector Peter Ludwig and his wife Irene Ludwig.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to leave Beijng tomorrow morning for Shanghai.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Pleased with the return of Rwandan refugees, the Clinton
Administration has scaled back plans to dispatch soldiers to
Central Africa and now intends to send fewer than 1,000 troops,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
-- Boutros Boutros-Ghali stood his ground against an American
veto, which officials said would be the first of as many as it
takes to deny him a second term as United Nations Secretary
General.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:

Washington D.C. subway trains last week and a half, have assigned
more transit police to ride trains and are warning passengers to
be more alert.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- In the four years since Mr. Clinton was elected president,
an influential group of his old Arkansas associates has quietly
seized on Asia as a lucrative place for doing business, playing
politics and sometimes mixing both.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Tutsi Rebels Resume Offensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Zaire's Banyamulenge Tutsi
rebels said today they will resume their military offensive
against the country from their stronghold in the eastern Kivu
region now that the Rwandan refugees camped there have left,
Agence France Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
"We were blocked by the refugees. Now that the problem of the
refugees is solved, we will continue to go ahead. We will go
ahead slowly, until Kinshasa (the Zairean capital)," a rebel
military commander told a mass rally in Goma, the eastern Zairean
town bordering Rwanda, which is also in the hands of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The commander, Kisassi-Andre Ngandu, called on Zairean youths
to join his forces and demanded that government troops "lay down
their arms."
</P>
<P>
In response to the increasing discontent of local inhabitants
in Goma who were denied water supply for a month and electricity
for five days, Ngandu said, "Water and electricity supply will be
re-established in Goma in a few days."
</P>
<P>
He said the electricity outage was due to sabotage by Rwandan
Hutu extremists taking refuge in Zaire. He blamed them for
cutting off the electricity supply line linking Goma and Bukavu, a
major city about 100 kilometers south of Goma.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets US Sec'y of State (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, meeting
with US Secretary of State Warren Christopher this afternoon in
Beijing's Great Hall of the People, said that it is indeed
possible for China and the US to develop a constructive,
cooperative relationship.
</P>
<P>
This is Christopher's second visit in China, and Jiang welcomed
him by expressing the hope that Sino-US relations can be improved
and developed during President Clinton's second term.
</P>
<P>
A meeting with President Clinton to exchange views on Sino-US
relations and the international situation will be helpful for
promoting relations between the countries, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher conveyed President Clinton's greetings to Jiang
Zemin, and said that the President is looking forward to meeting
with Jiang in Manila.
</P>
<P>
He said the US side hopes that meetings between the two
countries' leaders will help maintain the trend of improvement in
relations between the two in recent months, and that cooperation
can be expanded. A stable and effective Sino-US cooperation
accords with the interests of the whole international community,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that, since the Cold War ended, the world has
experienced enormous changes, and that a common problem for the
leaders of all countries, especially great countries like China
and the United States, is to figure out the analysis and judgement
of the world's structure and to work out a foreign strategy based
on that analysis and judgement to promote peace, stability and
development in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that because of different social systems, development
levels, historical backgrounds and values in different countries,
it is common for there to be different points of view on certain
issues.
</P>
<P>
China believes that, from the historical viewpoint of
cooperation and progress, and for the sake of the 21st century,
promoting mutual understanding and establishing normal relations
between all countries is of crucial importance for safeguarding
world peace and promoting world economy, Jiang noted.

<HEADLINE> Half Million Coal Miners Jobless Due to Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one million people in
central and eastern Europe will have lost their jobs by the year
2000 due to the privatization of the coal industry which started
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
More than half a million jobs have been lost so far, with
another 400,000 forecast to go by the end of the decade, the
U.N. Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) said in a report
published today.
</P>
<P>
The severe social hardship which has hit these coal-mining
regions is forcing governments to consider measures to make
privatization more acceptable.
</P>
<P>
These countries, trying to transform from a centrally planned
economy to a market economy, were eager to phase out government
subsidies to their coal industries, close down unprofitable coal
mines and reduce coal production for both economic and ecological
reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, specialists have warned that every country should take
into account its own individual conditions in deciding the timing,
speed and mode of privatization in overhauling its coal industry.
</P>
<P>
At a UNECE round table on the issue earlier this month, coal
industry specialists throughout Europe agreed that privatization
was the best way to make the coal industry viable and efficient,
but they noted that the restructuring of the western European coal
industry was a painful process.
</P>
<P>
The British coal industry, the only privatized coal industry in
Europe, has achieved high productivity and is now the lowest-cost
coal producer in western Europe. However, with the industry only
privatized in the early 1990s, it has yet to stand the test of
time, experts said.
</P>
<P>
They believe that to sustain the required level of coal
production to support energy and electricity supply, a feasible
solution might be mixed state and private ownership.
</P>
<P>
Governments might not be able to entirely escape the
responsibility of supporting the coal industry, they said.

<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Artworks donated to China by
German Collector Peter Ludwig and his wife, Irene, have been put
on show today at an exhibition in the China Art Gallery.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and German President Roman Herzog
attended the opening ceremony of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhongde, minister of Culture, said in an opening speech
that the artworks donated by the Ludwigs have provided Chinese
artists and audiences with an opportunity to understand and study
Western culture and art.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the donation has promoted understanding and
friendship between people in China and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Irene, widow of the late German entrepreneur, social activist
and art collector Peter Ludwig, said her husband hoped that the
donation will substantially promote the already increased economic
and political contacts between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Irene Ludwig is reported to have come to China in the name of
the Ludwig Foundation to donate to China Art Gallery 117 paintings
by the world's most famous artists, including four works by Pablo
Picasso.

<HEADLINE> World Economic Forum Enhances East Asia, Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The fifth Europe/East Asia
Economic Summit ended here today, highlighting the theme of
building sustained partnership between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
A mutual understanding and respect for the diversity of
cultures is essential to increasing cooperation between Asia and
Europe, concluded Etienne Davignon, Co-chairman of the regional
conference organized by the World Economic Forum (WEF).
</P>
<P>
At the closing plenary session, he said that the summit, which
gathered 500 political and business figures worldwide, was unique
in giving cultural dimensions its true importance.
</P>
<P>
East Asian economic miracle was a hot topic at the three-day
meeting. Participants believed that East Asia is set to continue
on a high growth path. The World Bank forecast that the annual
growth rate in the region is likely to reach 7.7 percent over the
next decade, doubling the speed in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The summit threw insights into diversified topics centering on
East Asian economy, ranging from financial flows to the GDP
growth, consumer market, monetary cooperation, market
liberalization and pressing issues threatening sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial
meeting in Singapore also drew deep interest from participants,
who felt that the liberalization process should go on while
leaving developing economies room for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
As the year 1997 approaches, the future of Hong Kong comes into
the limelight. In his closing remarks, Klaus Schwab, president and
founder of the Switzerland-based WEF, expressed his confidence in
a successful and harmonious transition of Hong Kong. "When the
'one country, two systems' formula is fully implemented, Hong Kong
will continue to play its crucial role as a financial and economic
hub for the whole region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The WEF president announced that the sixth Europe/East Asia
Economic Summit will again be held in Hong Kong next October. "We
have seen at this meeting how the 'one country, two systems'
formula will work, and we will come to see how it is working next
year," he told the participants.
</P>
<P>
The WEF, comprising 1,100 member companies, organizes an annual
meeting at Davos, Switzerland, and various regional meetings
across the globe.

<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng, meeting with
German President Roman Herzog at Beijing's Great Hall of the
People this afternoon, said that he hopes China and Germany will
make a joint effort to ensure long-term and stable development of
relations.
</P>
<P>
Li said he was glad to meet with the president again in Beijing
and remarked, "You and President Jiang Zemin have had fruitful
talks and I believe your visit will have a great bearing on the
further development of Sino-German relations."
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese-German relations have gone well since the
establishment of diplomatic ties more than 20 years ago and that
cooperation in the fields of politics, economics, science and
technology and culture are making headway. What is more important,
he noted, is that the two countries' leaders have in recent years
kept in constant contact, which has helped deepen mutual
understanding.
</P>
<P>
Li said Germany is China's biggest trading partner in Europe,
and that the two sides have cooperated in many projects, which has
brought enormous benefits to both, and that the two countries have
strengthened their cooperation in international affairs. "We
should continue our joint efforts because there are still many
things for us to do in bilateral relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Herzog thanked the Chinese government and people for their warm
welcome and hospitality, and said that the world is undergoing a
process of readjustment, and that Germany and China can increase
the flow of understanding through exchanges.

Li said that, just as Chancellor Helmut Kohl has his "Asian
policy," China has its own European policy, and, "we pay as much
attention to our relations with Germany as Chancellor Kohl pays to
China," he said, emphasizing that, "All these accord with our
common interests, and are beneficial to stability and development
in the world."
</P>
<P>
He said that at the Eurasia Meeting last spring, Asian
countries, which have the fastest economic growth in the world,
and Western European nations, vowed to develop their relations,
and that this is a "good trend".
</P>
<P>
"In the aftermath of the Cold War, the world is moving toward
multi-polarization, and the time is past when one or two
superpowers dominated world affairs," he said. And, that the
developing countries as a whole are increasing their influence and
elevating their status, which is conducive to world peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
"It is a diverse world," Li said, and the East and West,
different in cultural traditions, history, and social reality,
cannot share the same mode of development.
</P>
<P>
He said he appreciates Herzog's view that the international
community should recognize and respect the distinct
characteristics of every country in politics, economics, history,
society, religion, and culture, and that there should be dialogue
on the basis of equality and mutual respect in order to increase
understanding and to reduce differences.
</P>
<P>
"China has long held that the nations of the world should treat
each other equally and learn to seek a common ground, while
setting aside differences and handle their relations properly," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Li also outlined China's economic development objectives and
policies toward the Asia-Pacific region, in response to a request
from the German President.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese people love peace and want
development, and, more than anyone else, they need a stable
internal situation and a peaceful international environment.
</P>
<P>
"China will never pose a threat to other countries or invade or
bully other countries even when it is developed in the future," Li
added.
</P>
<P>
Song Defu, head of the Chinese government reception committee
and minister of personnel, Mei Zhaorong, Chinese ambassador to
Germany, and other high-ranking officials were present at the

<HEADLINE>   Iranian Supreme Leader Calls US, Israel as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today called the United States and Israel as the
principal enemies of the Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Khamenei ruled out any possibility of conciliation
and dialogue between Tehran and Washington, according to the
state-run Tehran Radio.
</P>
<P>
Addressing representatives of the Islamic Basij (mobilization)
force on the eve of Basij week, Khamenei said :"The Zionists
and the U.S. regime are the principal enemies of the Iranian
nation and the Islamic system."
</P>
<P>
"All the enmity against Iran stems from them," he added, "any
enmity toward Iran from any government, group or person compared
with the U.S. and Israel is secondary."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Khamenei's statement is the official
response from Iran at the highest level to the call from
Washington for dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Local press disclosed that Washington sent a letter to
Tehran through the Swiss Embassy in Tehran and warned the
Iranian government of "taking action" if Tehran continued to
support terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati denied the
receipt of the threat letter from Washington.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said today that the U.S. government is constantly
attempted to intensify its "confrontation, evilness and enmity"
against the Iranian nation and its Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
He said the cause behind the United States' enmity toward Iran
is that it lost its giant economic, military and political base in
this part of the world in the wake of the victory of the Islamic
Revolution in Iran.
</P>
<P>
As for Israel, he said, it is because Iran does not "recognize"
the Jewish state and regards it as an "occupying and
deteriorating regime."
</P>
<P>
He said Iran wants to live "free and independent" and pursue
social justice, welfare and security under the umbrella of Islam.
</P>
<P>
Habibullah Askaroladi, Secretary General of the Islamic Coalition
Society, said Tuesday that the United States should recognize
not only the Islamic system but also Islamic traditions and
values as pre-condition for the dialogue between Tehran and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) last month,
the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for the Near East Robert
Pelletreau, called for a dialogue with Iran.
</P>
<P>
On November 3, Iran staged nationwide rallies against the
United States to mark the 17th anniversary of the takeover
of U.S. embassy by radical students on November 4, 1979.

<HEADLINE> France Launches Inquiry into Channel Tunnel Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- An inquiry was launched today
into Monday night's blaze on a freight train in the Channel Tunnel
in which eight people suffered smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
Judicial officials in Boulogne-sur-Mer have obtained the black
boxes from the engine of the cargo shuttle and all truck drivers
and passengers on the train were interviewed by officials on
Tuesday, the public procurator of Boulogne-sur-Mer Gerald Lesigne
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Channel Tunnel remained closed today and all
Euro-star high-speed passenger trains from Paris to London were
cancelled. Passengers were either put on ferries or given
refunds, the French state railway company SNCF said.
</P>
<P>
French Transport Minister, Bernard Pons, said it could be weeks
before normal services resume.
</P>
<P>
When the fire broke out, 31 passengers and three crew members
were on board the train which was shuttling trucks and their
drivers to England. The injured had been taken to hospital for
treatment and observation but were later released.
</P>
<P>
This was the first major incident since the 35-mile
(51-kilometer) long tunnel opened in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Some witnesses said that a truck on the shuttle appeared to be
on fire before the train entered the tunnel. The flames could
have been fanned as the train accelerated to a speed of up to 140
kilometers an hour.
</P>
<P>
Eurotunnel officials said that safety procedures had worked
well in the first test of coordination between British and French
fire-fighting and security forces.

<HEADLINE> 100,000 Automobiles Turn To Use Gas in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Tehran, one of the most
polluted capital in the world, is to convert 100,000 automobiles
from gasoline to gas consumption as part of the battle against air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Khosrow Jenaqi, director for the fuel conversion project under
the Oil Ministry, said in a report carried in Today's Persian
daily Salam that 15 gas filling stations are under construction
and some of them are nearing completion.
</P>
<P>
The official said that plans are underway for the construction
of 20 more gas stations for the gas-powered automobiles. Each
station is able to accommodate 180,000 liters of gas.
</P>
<P>
Jenaqi said that there are 25,000 taxi-cabs in Tehran, of
which 14,000 have been renovated to use gas instead of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
He said efforts are underway to convert another 11,000
taxi-cabs. The cost for conversion for each car is about 250
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned that Tehran is facing serious air
pollution with two tons of lead discharged into the air every
day. About 80 percent of the air pollution is caused by cars in
the city.
</P>
<P>
Specialists specified that 65 percent of the pollution in
Tehran is produced by vehicular exhaust, 24 percent is
generated by industries and service centers and 11 percent is
attributable to home water heaters.
</P>
<P>
With a population of about 10 million, there are some three
million cars in the city. The contamination by polluting gas in
the air of Tehran city is some six times higher than the level
allowed.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the poisonous gas released by automobiles
in the city will cause various disease related with liver,
kidney, spleen, brain, bones and muscles.

<HEADLINE> Israel Plans to Cut 1997 Budget Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel is considering to
cut additional 660 million U.S. dollars for the 1997 budget, The
Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Dan Meridor is scheduled to meet Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu today to discuss the 1997 budget. He
is expected to present his proposal on further budget cut to the
Knesset (Parliament) by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, Israeli Knesset passed the 1997 budget plan
after stormy debates, which will stand at 190.8 billion shekels
(63.6 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government originally plans to cut 4.9 billion shekels
(1.6 billion dollars) mainly in public expenditure to help
increase Israeli economic growth rate to 5-6 percent from the
current 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the minister as saying that the main purpose
behind his decision was to ensure that the budget deficit would
be reduced to 2.8 percent of the Gross Domestic Product by
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, latest estimates suggested that the cut would be
insufficient to achieve this aim.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt there is a need for this additional cut to
ensure we stay on the right path," Meridor said.
</P>
<P>
But senior government officials have made it clear that the
defense budget would not be targeted for further cut due to the
new strategic assessments on the increasing possibility of war
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The prime targets for further cut are expected to be in social
welfare and education sectors, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Sustained Transformation Into Industrialization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- African countries were
today called to spare no efforts in realizatlion of a sustained
transformation into newly industrializing countries in the
next 15-20 years.
</P>
<P>
The call came from a joint statement issued here by Salim
Ahmed Salim, Secretary General of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU); Mauricio De Mariay Campos, Director General of the
United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and
K.Y. Amoako, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) on the occasion of Africa
Industrialization Day which falls on today.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement, read at a news briefing at ECA Conference
Hall, said: ''Africa is realizing the key role that industry can
play in changing its destiny and the lives of its people.'' ''We
have never doubted that Africa can also make the qualitative
jump, like others have done in the recent past, into the
industrialized world as we are moving into the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
On the current situation in Africa, the statement said that
many countries in the region have in the recent years made
progress towards "establishing political stability, introducing a
liberalized and sound macroeconomic environment and encouraging
private sector development, thus paving the way for more rapid
economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
It recalled the launching of the Alliance for Africa's
Industrialization in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire in October this year
and said ''The alliance should strengthen Africa's position in
the world economy and transform the vicious circle of
udnerdevelopment to a virtuous circle of co-development and
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
Referring to the theme of ''Mobilization of Financial
Resources for Industry'' for this year's celebration, the
statement indicated that foreign direct investment flows to
Africa have actually decreased as a proportion of developing
countries' total inflows from 10 percent in 1987-1991 to about 5
percent in 1992-1995.
</P>
<P>
''It is therefore important for African countries to make
efforts to reinvigorate their own investment activities to
promote economic development,'' the statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
Africa Industrialization Day was celebrated for the seventh
time throughout Africa since its proclamation in 1990 by the
United Nations general assembly.

<HEADLINE> Clinton on US Military Cooperation with Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting US President Bill
Clinton said today that "the defense links between the United
States and Australia had never been stronger in peace time."
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the Australian parliament here this afternoon,
Clinton said that "the agreements our foreign and defense
ministers signed in Sydney this summer authorized the largest
exercise involving our troops since World War II. American
marines will soon begin training in northern Australia."
</P>
<P>
The US president said, "We will continue to revitalize our core
alliances, both bilaterally and regionally."
</P>
<P>
Earlier at a press conference, President Clinton promised to do
everything possible to protect innocent third party countries like
Australia from the impact of his country's trade subsidy programs.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to do everything we can to ensure that any future
use of these programs is not either directly or indirectly working
to the disadvantage of a country that is innocent of wrongdoing,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard had raised the country's
concerns with Clinton about US farm subsidies through its Export
Enhancement Program and Dairy Export Enhancement Program.
</P>
<P>
So far as the outstanding trade dispute is concerned, the US
president said he hoped for a quick resolution to the trade
dispute that follows complaints by two American companies against
Australian firm Howe Leather which won contracts to supply leather
car seat covers to US plants.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived in Australia Tuesday on a five-day visit, ahead
of next week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' informal
meeting in the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> CPC Leader Meets Japanese Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The need for China and Japan
to nurture good neighborly relationships into the 21st century was
stressed at a meeting in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party's (CPC) Central Committee,
said that the CPC is willing to make unremitting efforts for
friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a meeting with a delegation from the
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), headed by its leader Yuki
Hatoyama.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also a member of the Secretariat of CPC Central Committee,
also spoke highly of the commitment and importance Hatoyama
attached to the two-way ties.
</P>
<P>
Hu stressed that it is the common duty of statesmen of the two
countries to ensure the normal development of Sino-Japanese
relations.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan should, on the basis of the Sino-Japanese Joint
Communique and the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship
and from long-term and strategic perspectives, make contributions
to consolidate and develop Sino-Japanese good-neighborly relations
towards the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
On party relations, Hu said the CPC and DPJ have established
friendly ties and exchanged views extensively on some important
issues, which is conducive to increasing understanding, seeking
common ground and eliminating negative elements.
</P>
<P>
Hatoyama said that the DPJ's China visit soon after its
founding shows its wishes to develop friendly relations with
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the 25th anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic relations between China and Japan, DPJ is willing to
settle unresolved problems concerning bilateral relations,
Hatoyama said.
</P>
<P>
He added that most members of DPJ are very young and the party
should face history bravely, by examining the aggressive crimes to
avoid a repetition of the history of aggression.
</P>
<P>
Hatoyama also stressed that the DPJ, with a sense of
responsibility for the future, will maintain and develop friendly
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Over 500,000 Refugees Return to Rwanda from Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 500,000 Rwandan
refugees in eastern Zaire's Goma region have returned home since
last Friday, the U.N.'s refugee agency UNHCR said today.
</P>
<P>
Refugees were continuing to arrive at the Rwandan border town
of Gisenyi at a rate of 1,000 people an hour on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Goma region on the border between Zaire and Rwanda was home
to more than 715,000 of the 1.2 million Rwandan and Burundian
refugees in eastern Zaire before fighting broke out there last
month between government troops and ethnic Tutsi rebels. The
conflict has also left 250,000 Zairean nationals homeless.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the refugees are ethnic Rwandan Hutus who fled
after the ethnic genocide in Rwanda in 1994 carried out by Hutus
on the rival Rwandan Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 other refugees are scattered in the Uvira and
Bukavu regions in eastern Zaire but their exact whereabouts remain
unknown, according to UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Human rights observers say the Rwandan returnees have been
well received and treated by the Tutsi-led Rwandan government. No
arrests of returnees have been reported.
</P>
<P>
A UNHCR press official told reporters Tuesday that the refugee
agency has provided each returnee with food rations for two
months, as well as kitchen sets, blankets, plastic sheeting,
agricultural seeds and tools.
</P>
<P>
The agency is seeking 67 million U.S. dollars in emergency aid
to assist refugees and internally displaced people in eastern
Zaire and help the integration of more than 500,000 returnees in
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR appeal is part of a joint appeal for 260 million
dollars launched by U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
on Monday to fund emergency work for three months in the Great
Lakes region in response to the crisis in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Considering the increased burden on health services as a result
of the mass movement of refugees, the World Health Organization is
strengthening its emergency health services network in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. health agency has confirmed outbreaks of cholera among
refugees and fears outbreaks of other diseases such as malaria and
meningitis.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ministers Sign Protocol on Dispute Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Economic ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) signed here today a
protocol on dispute settlement mechanism to provide a peaceful
environment for economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was signed during a meeting of the ASEAN economic
ministers, who gathered in Manila for the Eighth Ministerial
Meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) scheduled
for November 22-23.
</P>
<P>
The economic ministers and foreign ministers of the
seven-member group also had a joint meeting here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Under the protocol, if consultations fail to settle a dispute
between ASEAN members within 60 days after the date of receipt of
the request for consultations, the matter shall be raised to a
meeting of senior economic officials of the ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
The senior officials will establish a panel to resolve the
dispute, according to the protocol.
</P>
<P>
"This is a step forward in enhancing economic cooperation among
the ASEAN states," said Rodolfo Severino, Philippine foreign
undersecretary, at a press conference here after the ASEAN joint
ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
Severino also said that at today's meeting, ASEAN foreign and
economic ministers expressed their support for Vietnam's
membership in APEC as a three-year moratorium on the admission of
new members expires at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
"Six ASEAN member states support Vietnam's entry into APEC," he
said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, will hold a summit
on November 30 in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. The joint
ministerial meeting here this afternoon was making preparations
for the summit.
</P>
<P>
However, Severino said, the ASEAN summit will have no agenda
and ASEAN leaders are expected to have free discussions on issues
of the group and regional and world affairs.

NEW DELHI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Congress parliamentary party
(CPP) leader P.V. Narasimha Rao today issued a veiled threat to
review its support to the United Front government on the basis of
its performance, especially in the economic and foreign affairs.

Addressing to the CPP general body meeting on the first day of

Charging the Deve Gowda government with slide down in economy
since it came to power, Rao said, "Six months have passed since
the United Front government came to power and time has come to

<TEXT>
<P>
CHAOZHOU, GUANGDONG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- China wants to
speed up the development pace of its womens' clothing industry, to
help survive increasingly severe competition from foreign clothing
businesses. The move will also strengthen China's market share
globally.
</P>
<P>
Dong Binggen, director of China Garment Association (CGA), said
at the opening ceremony of a CGA special committee meeting on
womens' garments that China now has 3,760 factories specialized in
making women's garments, and more than 25,510 enterprises turning
out both mens' and womens' garments. The output of women's
garments accounts for 40 percent of the whole clothing sector.
</P>
<P>
As "an important index" for the country's garment industry, the
business of womens' fashions should be further improved to fortify
China's leading position in global clothing markets and increase
the country's foreign currency earnings, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from more than 100 women's clothing factories
in China reached an agreement at the ceremony that they will hold
two exhibitions for women's clothing designs in the country's big
cities every year. The venues for the first two exhibitions will
be Wuhan and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The special committee will also establish a national training
center for fashion designers, and hold regular cooperation
projects with clothing powers such as France, Japan, Italy and
Hong Kong. Famous designers and scholars at home and abroad
will be hired as consultants by the committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee consists more than 90 major women's garment
makers from 17 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of
the country, ranking among the largest clothing organizations
throughout China.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia is arranging a meeting
to mediate an end to the long-standing conflict between
Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko and his parliament, a
high-ranking Russian official said today.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma (Lower House of the Russian Parliament) Speaker
Gennady Seleznyov said that Lukashenko and Belarussian Parliament
Speaker Semyon Sharetsky have been invited to a meeting on seeking
solution to their conflict.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Federation Council
(the Upper House of the Russian Parliament) Chairman Yegor Stroyev
and Seleznyov himself will also be present at the meeting, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials said earlier that the meeting could be held
in a town on the border of the two countries. But no final
agreement on the venue of the possible meeting or about its date
has been reached.
</P>
<P>
After his two rounds of meeting with Constitutional Court
Chairman Valery Tikhinya on Tuesday, Lukashenko had a telephone
conversation with Chernomyrdin, discussing the situation in his
country.
</P>
<P>
Russia's State Duma also issued a statement today calling on
Lukashenko and the parliament "to show goodwill for the sake of
stabilization of the republic and political situation in the
country."
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Lukashenko and the opposition lawmakers are
continuing to look for a compromise.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation between Lukashenko and the parliament is a
result of a disagreement on the referendum on amendments to the
nation's constitution. The referendum, initiated by Lukashenko,
was scheduled for November 24.
</P>
<P>
The amendments can expand the power of the head of state. The
parliament, supported by the Constitutional Court, has opposed the
suggested amendments.

of Panmunjom today refused the routine test phone call from the
South Korean side, the National Unification Board (NUB) said here.
</P>
<P>
"We tried to make a test call at 9:00 a.m. (local time) today
as usual, but there was no response from the North (DPRK)," a NUB
official said.
</P>
<P>
The liaison office, set up in 1992 to promote inter-Korean
contacts, have virtually ceased function since Kim Il-sung, former
president of the DPRK, died in July 1994 but there had been
telephone contacts for test twice a day, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The NUB official said that Pyongyang's refusal of the test call
was the first since the hot lines were established.
</P>
<P>
"North Korea (DPRK) has never failed to respond to the test
call at 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. every day," he added.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK's refusal of the test call followed Tuesday's
communique of the DPRK to tentatively withdraw delegates from its
liaison office at the border village and suspend their business
there as from November 20.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK said in the communique that the liaison office does
not deserve any further existence because South Korean President
Kim Young-sam adopted a totally negative attitude toward
inter-Korean dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Kim said on November 9 that he would have no dialogue with the
north in an interview with the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul government has suspended all economic exchanges and
aid to the DPRK since the submarine incident took place last
September.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has said that a total of 26 armed DPRK persons
"infiltrated" into the country's Kangwon Province from a grounded
submarine in the East Sea (Sea of Japan) on September 18.
</P>
<P>
Of the 26 DPRK "intruders", one is still at large, while 13
were shot dead by South Korean troops, 11 were found dead and one
was captured alive in a massive manhunt in the rugged mountains.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has been demanding return of the submarine and its
crewmen, saying that the submarine, while on a training mission,
drifted to South Korea because of engine trouble.
</P>
<P>
However, Seoul rebuffed the saying of Pyongyang and insisted
that it was a "carefully premediated act of provocation."

<HEADLINE> Saudi Economy to Grow 6 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian gross
domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow by 6 percent in 1996
compared with 4.3 percent in 1995, the Saudi Arabian Monetary
Agency said in its latest annual report.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was sent to Saudi King Fahd in Riyadh by
Minister of Finance and National Economy Ibrahim Al-Assaf and the
agency's governor Hamad Al-Sayari, said the better performance of
the economy "has been due to the good policies pursued by the
government, the rise in revenues generated from oil exports and
the vitality shown by the private sector," the Saudi
English-language daily Arab News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said strong oil prices this year would help the
world's largest oil producer and exporter move close toward its
goal of a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sayari told Fahd that the better budgetary situation was
also attributed to the fiscal policies designed to boost non-oil
revenues and rationalize public expenditure.
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful that the budget deficit will be completely
eliminated by the fiscal year 1998-1999 as anticipated in the
current sixth Development Plan," Al-Sayari said.
</P>
<P>
He said the deficit accounted for an estimated 6 percent of
the 1995 GDP, down from 1994's 8 percent and 1993's 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
On foreign trade, the report said the balance of payments
registered a noticeable improvement with the deficit in the
current account falling steadily in the past five years. It
dropped from 27.6 billion dollars in 1991 to 8.69 billion
dollars in 1995. Forecasts showed that the balance of
payments will be further improved this year.
</P>
<P>
The report said the value of non-oil exports rose by 19
percent in 1994 and 45 percent in 1995. Indications are that the
non-oil exports will continue their upward trend during the
current year.
</P>
<P>
It said the growth of money supply in the kingdom remained
moderate, which helped maintain a low inflation rate with the
cost of living index increasing by less than one percent during
the first eight months of the year.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Grows in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The total trade of Singapore
increased 3.3 percent in October on a monthly basis, while the
crucial non-oil domestic exports recorded a marginal growth of 1.1
percent, the Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
It said that on a three-month moving average basis, total trade
declined 1.3 percent at current prices in October, while non-oil
domestic exports decreased 3.8 percent to 7.7 billion Singapore
dollars (about 5.5 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, re-exports rose marginally by one percent and
oil domestic exports achieved a strong growth of 16.2 percent as
oil price remained high, the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the decline on non-oil domestic exports was
reflected in the United States, Malaysia, Japan and Hong Kong
markets, while non-oil domestic exports to the European Union
market recorded a marginal growth of 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Oil domestic exports registered a double digit growth of 16.2
percent to reach 1.3 billion Singapore dollars (about 0.93 billion
US dollars) in October as oil price continued to rise. But in
volume term, it dropped 3.9 percent.

Imports amounted to 16.4 billion Singapore dollars (about 11.71
billion US dollars) in October, recording a decrease of 2.3
percent as compared to a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The decrease was largely in integrated circuits, computer parts
and peripherals, parts of diodes, parts of Video Cassette
Recorders, color TV sets and radios, and other chemical products
and preparations, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the TDB added, imports of disk, drives, jewelry, blank

BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A calm life is the number one
priority in China, the ancestral home of the tranquil beliefs such
as Daoism.
</P>
<P>
In a survey among Chinese people in four major cities, the word
"calm" was the most used to describe the attitude of people toward
life in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by a Beijing-based company, involved
more than 1,000 families in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
The results show that Chinese people now have a positive
attitude toward life, and they use "calm" or "happiness" to
describe their recent moods.
</P>
<P>
The result also revealed that even in a calm-tempered mood,
Chinese people still paid great attention to social affairs.
</P>
<P>
Among the topics of general concern were public security,
social insurance, anti-corruption, inflation, housing reform and
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
City residents showed greatest concern to issues related to
themselves, including health, income, child education,
job-seeking, and self-development.
</P>
<P>
Some political issues also drew attention from the public,
including the Taiwan situation, the Diaoyu Island issue, Hong
Kong's return to the motherland, as well as China's entry to the
World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> China's Second-largest Coal Producer Eradicates Illegal Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- China's second-largest coal
producing base, Pingdingshan City, has intensified its crackdown
on illegal mining, today's "People's Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The city has confiscated 228 guns, 64,005 detonators, 11 tons
of explosives, driven off 3,916 unauthorized miners, and handled
two corruption cases since August, according to the report in the
country's leading newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, illegal mining by some individuals or
government-run departments has adversely affected normal coal
production operations, and resulted in many disastrous accidents
in the city, located in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, illegal mining has brought direct losses of 30
million yuan (about 3.6 million US dollars) to Pingdingshan. In
addition, some small illegal mines shelter lawbreakers and
tolerate unlawful activities, the article said.
</P>
<P>
To deal with these problems, the city government has organized
forces from the departments of supervision, geology and mineral
resources, coal, public security, electricity generation, and
industrial and commercial management to be stationed in the mining
area.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 800 law-enforcement personnel and police officers
have been aroused to bury the illegal coal pits.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Raises Penalty for Gas Flaring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government announced
Tuesday a sharp increase in the penalty for gas flaring that leads to
both enormous loss of the precious resources and pollution of
environment.
</P>
<P>
The penalty has been raised from two kobo to 50 kobo (0.00025 to
0.00625 US Dollars) per 1,000 standard cubic feet, in a bid to
stimulate utilization of the nation's rich gas resources, the "Daily
Times" newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Because of gas flaring, the country loses the equivalent of
300,000 barrels of crude oil a day. That means a loss of 4.8
million US Dollars based on the official selling price of 16
dollars per barrel, the report quoted Minister of Petroleum
Resources Chief Dan Etete as saying.
</P>
<P>
At the yearly conference of the National Association of Petroleum
Explorationists held here Tuesday, the minister said Nigeria boasts
gas reserves of between 150 and 300 trillion cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
About 2.2 billion standard cubic feet of natural gas is produced
per day, with 75 percent of it being flared away, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, Nigeria, which ranks first in gas flaring
globally, has lost an equivelent of more than 2.8 billion barrels of
oil as a result of gas flaring over the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 35 billion tons of carbon dioxide have been
released into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The decree on penalty for gas flaring was promulgated by the
Nigerian government in 1979 during the country's oil boom.
</P>
<P>
However, two kobo fine, though worth more than 0.02 US Dollars at
that time, is far from enough to stop oil companies from flaring gas
during production, because it costs much in absorbing it.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Shell Petroleum Development Company Nigeria Ltd
announced it will stop further flaring of Nigeria's gas resources by
the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
Tt is believed that the move would produce positive influence among
oil producing companies in the country, because Shell Nigeria
contributes about 60 percent of Nigeria's annual oil production.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Overseas Construction Orders to Hit New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's overseas
construction orders will exceed 10 billion U.S. dollars this year,
the International Contractors Association of Korea (ICAK) said
here today.
</P>
<P>
South Korean builders had won contracts worth 7.6 billion U.S.
dollars from abroad as of yesterday and are expected to surely
make the excess given the remaining days in the year, according to
the ICAK.
</P>
<P>
On November 18, the country's Dong Ah Construction Company
received a letter of intent for Libya's phase III great waterway
project worth 5.1 billion U.S. dollars. When this project is taken
into account, South Korea will enjoy an all-time high for overseas
construction orders estimated at 15 billion dollars this year, an
ICAK official said.
</P>
<P>
It took 13 years for South Korea's overseas contracts to
rebound to more than 10 billion U.S. dollars, since it received
overseas orders worth 13.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1981, 13.3
billion U.S. dollars in 1982 and 10.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the value of South Korea's overseas construction
contracts stood at 8.51 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Officials Urged to Learn Foreign Languages in Liaoning Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Functionaries of government
agencies and organizations of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
in northeast China's Liaoning Province will have to pass foreign
language examinations in order to be promoted.
</P>
<P>
According to a document issued by the provincial CPC committee
and government personnel departments, the province will launch
foreign language training courses for officials beginning in 1997,
and trainees will have to pass two examinations each year.
</P>
<P>
The document stipulates that officials and workers from CPC
committees and government offices at all levels, and those from
institutions who are managed the same as government agencies, are
included in the group required to attend the language courses.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, all trainees will be asked to
master at least 2,000 foreign words and the basic grammar of a
foreign language, to enable them to listen to and understand a
foreign speaker and engage in simple dialogue.
</P>
<P>
They also will be asked to study commonly-used computer
expressions in foreign languages, and to translate foreign
language telegraph messages with the help of dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
Those who do not pass the examinations will be asked to leave
their posts temporarily to attend training courses, or be removed
from their posts.
</P>
<P>
The province mainly offers training courses in English and
Japanese, but people are also encouraged to learn other foreign
languages.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is an old industrial base of China and an open area in
the country. It now has more than 10,000 foreign-funded
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging cadres to learn foreign languages is an important
step taken by Liaoning toward opening still wider to the outside.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Mining Industry Promising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's bid to market its
huge and virgin reserves has begun to take root and its mining
industry is promising, a Zambian chief mining engineer has said.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen international mining companies have been allowed to
carry out exploration and so far the government has approved 35
individual licenses to tap the mineral wealth, Zambia Daily Mail
today quoted Chief Mining Engineer at the Ministry of Mines and
Mineral Development Willie Sweta as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a lot of hope and future for the mining
industry.
</P>
<P>
Apart from copper, investors are prospecting for cobalt, zinc,
lead, vanadium, platinum, gold, silver, coal and diamonds, said
the engineer.
</P>
<P>
Apart from developing new mines, participation of the private
sector in the development of underdeveloped resources within the
existing Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) properties are
also being encouraged, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that these exploration will increase and diversify
mineral and mineral based production and exports and that long
term economic benefits to Zambia will be maximized. enditem

<HEADLINE> Chinese Prisons Encourage Inmates to Foster Healthy Hobbies (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Large and bright, the room is
decorated with scrolls of ink and color paintings, and works of
calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
Stacked on a broad table in one corner are rolls of paper,
writing brushes, ink sticks, and ink stones.
</P>
<P>
It looks like a normal artist's studio. What makes this
building - and its works of art - more unusual, is its setting, a
Chinese prison.
</P>
<P>
The studio is for the exclusive use of inmates at the No.1
Prison of east China's Shandong Province. In their spare time the
prisoners head to the studio to practice painting and calligraphy,
or to enjoy the works of fellow prisoners displayed on the walls.
</P>
<P>
Located in the capital city of Jinan, the No.1 prison houses
more than 2,600 inmates, most serving sentences of ten years or
more.
</P>
<P>
Prison warden Jiang Xianzhou said his prison has always
encouraged and supported the inmates to foster and develop healthy
interests and hobbies, such as painting and calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
"It could not only enrich the cultural life of the inmates, but
also help them acquire skills to make a living after their
release," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The prison now has two classes that teach art-loving inmates
Chinese traditional painting and calligraphy, and fine art. The
students, around 30 in number, are also studying at Jinan Art
Academy. But instead of going to regular classes they conduct
their lessons by correspondence with their art tutors.
</P>
<P>
But one day a week, on Sundays, they are taken under
supervision to the academy for classes, said one of the inmate
students.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the prison authority, a number of famous
painters and calligraphers have visited the prison and given
lessons. Some of the artists have even taken on talented inmates
as their students.
</P>
<P>
One inmate, who was sentenced to death with a two-year
suspension in 1986, acquired the fame of "calligrapher behind the
prison walls", after winning several domestic and international
calligraphy competitions.
</P>
<P>
"I owe my success to the prison for its support for my study
and practice of calligraphy over the past decade," he claimed.

<P>
At the No.1 Prison, Zhejiang Province, also in east China,
visiting journalists found themselves followed by a young man
wearing the prisoner's orange-blue uniform. Cautiously keeping a
distance from the visitors, he frequently lifted a camera and shot
pictures.
</P>
<P>
Any doubts were answered by his self-introduction: "I am a
member of the inmates' photography club."
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1994, the club now has a dozen members, each has a
"Seagull", one of China's best known cameras. With a green breast
card, they can walk around the prison and snap pictures of the
inmates' everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
They were given permission to set up their own darkroom, while
the color films were developed outside the prison with the help of
the warders.
</P>
<P>
"The prison authority also encouraged us to send our photos to
local newspapers and magazines," a club member said, adding that
most photos were published because of people's strong interest in
prisoners' lives.
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese prisons publish their own newspapers, giving a
chance of practice to inmates who take interest in writing.
</P>
<P>
Published every ten days or twice monthly, the newspapers are
managed by the inmates, who are in charge of news coverage, news
editing, page design, and even printing.
</P>
<P>
Gong Yuhua, 34, reporter and editor of the "Yu Xin (Fostering
the New People) News Bulletin" at the Shandong No.1 Prison, was
excited to see two of his articles published in the "Legal Daily",
a leading national legal newspaper in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"I could be given a reduction of sentence term for this," said
Gong, who has stayed in prison for six years and still has more
than ten years to serve. "Writing gives me confidence and hope,"
Gong added.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Economy Grows Faster Despite US Sanction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Despite U.S. sanction and
economic embargo, Iran's national economy for this year is
expected to record a growth rate of 5.5 percent, or one percentage
point more than that last year.
</P>
<P>
The estimate was made by Mohammad Jaffar Mojarad, Vice-
Governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), at a meeting on the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
But Mojarad, who was quoted by local press today, stopped short
of giving reasons for such economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted the economic growth has been helped by an
increase in Iran's oil export revenue.
</P>
<P>
The oil price on Iran's budget was estimated at 16 dollars per
barrel, but in market, it stands at six or seven dollars higher.
</P>
<P>
Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said that Iran would generate
an oil income of 18 billion dollars this year -- 2 billion dollars
more than the preset target for this year.
</P>
<P>
The banking official also claimed that the drastic roll-back in
imports over the past two years has had no damaging impact in the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Mojarad said that the average level of Iran's imports dropped
from 18 billion dollars in the 1989-93 period to 12-13 billion
dollars during the current year.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran has also made progress in curbing the
runaway inflation, predicting that the annual inflation rate would
 not be more than 25 or 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
But many economists put the figure at above 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to reduce the inflation rate to the level of 13
percent in Iran, which is prevalent in other developing
countries," Mojarad added.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Scientists Unravel AIDS-Triggering Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Japanese scientists have
discovered a kind of aids-triggering mechanism, Kyodo News Service
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted virologists as saying that they have found
out how a protein produced by HIV merges with healthy immune cells
and kills them, triggering the massive immune cell loss that leads
to the development of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The research team led by Akio Adachi, a professor at Tokushima
University's School of Medicine, and Yoichi Fujii, a lecturer at
Nagoya University's School of Medicine, found that the protein,
known as Nef, binds with a certain receptor on the surface of CD4
and T lymphocytes.
</P>
<P>
The findings, to be published in the latest issue of the
British virology magazine Journal of General Biology, indicate
that by inhibiting Nef the depletion of CD4 and T cells and the
eventual onset of AIDS symptoms could be prevented.
</P>
<P>
The declining concentration of CD4 and T cells, the prime
targets of HIV, in the blood serves as an indicator for the
graveness of infection, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The researchers focused their attention on Nef after an
Australian study found last year that HIV in patients who remained
free of AIDS symptoms for more than 10 years lacked the gene
responsible for Nef production.
</P>
<P>
They concluded that the presence of Nef rather than direct HIV
infection kills the cells, which are vital for the body's ability
to fight diseases.
</P>
<P>
In a series of experiments, they infected immune cells with
genetically altered HIV that did not have the Nef gene as well as
with Nef that had been genetically modified.
</P>
<P>
They found that neither of the two had an adverse effect on the
lymphocytes, while regular Nef caused cell death.
</P>
<P>
A study of 32 HIV patients found the Nef antigen in the serum
of all patients and that Nef had leaked from HIV-infected immune
cells and merged with healthy ones.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, almost no Nef antigen was found in the blood of a
control group of 28 people who did not have HIV.
</P>
<P>
Adachi said the findings show that Nef is a direct trigger of
cell death. "But we cannot conclude that Nef is the overall cause
for the development of AIDS " he said.
</P>
<P>
Yasuhiro Yoshikawa, head of the Primates center at the National
Institute of Health in Tokyo, said the findings make Nef a prime
candidate for a live vaccine against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"These are landmark findings given that scientists around the
world are trying to figure out why HIV without Nef is so much less
pathogenic," Yoshikawa said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President meets Japanese Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Rong
Yiren said here today that the Chinese government hopes China and
Japan will make concerted efforts to develop their relations so
that the two sides can enjoy "an everlasting friendship."
</P>
<P>
Meeting with a Japanese delegation from the Sasakawa Peace
Foundation (SPF) headed by Chairman Tabuchi Setsuya, Rong
expressed his appreciation for the work that the foundation has
done since its founding 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Since they formed their diplomatic relations, the ties between
China and Japan have been "generally sound," Rong said. However,
he pointed out, there have also been setbacks.
</P>
<P>
Rong said some people in Japan do not acknowledge the history
of the Japanese militarists' invasion of China. He quoted a
Chinese saying that "history, if not forgotten, serves as a guide
for the future."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-president noted that China takes an approach
of "looking forward to the future" of improved Sino-Japanese ties,
and hopes the relationship witnesses fewer setbacks and more
development.
</P>
<P>
Tabuchi, after talking about the good cooperation between SPF
and the China Association for International Friendly Contacts
(CAIFC), said he was determined to do his best to enhance the
friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese visitors, invited by CAIFC, are here to attend the
18th meeting of the executive committee of the Sasakawa
Japan-China Friendship Fund, which was jointly established by
CAIFC and SPF.
</P>
<P>
Rong said he appreciated the efforts made by the Sasakawa
Japan-China Friendship Fund to promote exchanges between Chinese
and Japanese young people, who should make more contributions to
developing the Sino-Japanese ties.
</P>
<P>
Rong also briefed the Japanese visitors on China's economic
growth and the situation in other fields.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Upset by Israeli Visits to Occupied Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Several recent visits by
high-ranking Israeli officials to an Israeli-occupied border
strip in south Lebanon have angered Lebanese government
officials, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Senior foreign ministry officials were quoted as saying that
the recent visits by Israelis, including one by President Ezer
Weizman, to the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone"
represented a "flagrant breach of Lebanon's sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
"Visits by high-ranking Israeli officials to the border zone
mean Israel considers that the zone has become part of its
territories," one of the officials was quoted by the
English-language Star Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, accompanied by Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, inspected Israeli troops occupying the border strip
after an Israeli soldier was killed and six others were wounded
in a guerrilla attack.
</P>
<P>
"Although Weizman does not have executive powers, his visit is
of considerable importance, especially because his defense
minister accompanied him and explained how the casualties fell,"
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Other official sources were quoted by the pro-Syrian Ad-Diyar
daily as saying that they regarded the visit of Weizman and
Mordechai to the occupied enclave as a "climax of escalation" in
the border area.
</P>
<P>
The sources expressed their fear that the visit came within
an alarm which Israeli military officials advanced to the
political leaders in preparation for a "brute military strike
against Lebanon under the excuse of hitting Lebanon's resistance
movement."
</P>
<P>
They also criticized a visit several days ago by Uri Lubrani,
coordinator for the Israeli activities in Lebanon, to the border
zone.
</P>
<P>
Lubrani said that Israel would not withdraw from Lebanon
unless the Beirut government dropped treason charges against
Emile Lahoud, commander of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia which patrols the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone.'
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese sources noted that what Lubrani said about a
continuity of the Israeli occupation in south Lebanon "indicated
the real intentions of the Jewish state in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the border strip in late 1970s and turned it
into the "security zone" of the Jewish state in 1985 in a bid to
prevent crossing-border attacks by guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government has said that it would not sign a
peace agreement with Israel before an Israeli withdrawal from the
occupied Lebanese land.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Pour 16 Million Yuan to Clean Suzhou River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is to invest 16
billion yuan in the coming years to clean its severely-polluted
Suzhou River.
</P>
<P>
The 53.1-km river, which flows in an east-west direction, has
been contaminated by the inflow of a large amount of
industrial-polluted water and sewage.
</P>
<P>
The river's impurities have had a serious impact on the local
residents' lives, prompting the local government to take measures
to clean it.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve Shanghai's investment environment and help
its economy take off, the municipal government has set up a group,
headed by mayor Xu Kuangdi, to develop a comprehensive plan for
the treatment of the Suzhou River.
</P>
<P>
The group has designed a scheme to put an end to industrial
pollution at the lower reaches of the river by the end of 1997,
and eliminate all pollution sources by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, all urban docks will be dismantled, and cargo
ships will be required to change their routes.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, the city invested more than 14
billion yuan in environmental protection, 1.6 billion yuan of
which was used for the first phase of river treatment. The current
drainage volume of the river's sewage exceeds one million tons
every day.

<P>
LUSAKA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Zambia
Democratic Congress (ZDC) on Tuesday refused to recognise the
results of Monday's general elections won by President Frederick
Chiluba, claiming that there is massive rigging.
</P>
<P>
"ZDC reserves the right to pursue other alternatives to arrest
the fraudulent conduct of Mr Chiluba and the MMD," said ZDC
President Dean Mung'Omba who refused to recognize the government
of the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Inter-Party Alliance, another opposition which
includes the United National Independence Party (UNIP) led by
Former President Kenneth Kaunda, has taken a similar position
and demanded fresh polls.
</P>
<P>
The inter-party alliance had boycotted the elections held on
Monday in protest against the government insistence that the poll
be held under the new constitution, which factually bars Kaunda
from running for the presidency because his parents are
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Early results show that President Frederick Chiluba has won a
sweeping victory in his re-election campaign and his party has
scored most of the parliament seats.

<HEADLINE> Israel Not to Investigate Opening of East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel has abandoned
investigation into the opening of an exit to the underground
archaeological tunnel in east Jerusalem, which sparked the
Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed late September.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset (Parliament) State Control Committee Tuesday made a
decision not to force State Comptroller Miriam Ben Porat to
conduct the investigation as proposed by Member of Knesset Moshe
Shahal from the opposition Labor Party six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in light of Porat's reluctance to carry
out such an investigation for the matter, which is too political
as she believes.
</P>
<P>
After earlier listening to the testimony of various ministers
and representatives of the security services, both Shahal,
Israel's former minister of public security, and Committee
Chairman Ran Cohen found there had been several serious flaws in
the government's decision-making process on the opening of the
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
They charged that too many people were neither consulted nor
even given sufficient notice of the decision to open the exit to
the tunnel near the Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third largest shrine.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence assessments were either not sought or ignored. The
fact that the Army was neither consulted nor informed of the
decision was particularly severe, they said.
</P>
<P>
Shahal said that a surprising discovery was the major role
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert played in the decision to open the
tunnel exit.
</P>
<P>
Olmert was involved in all the discussions on the issue and
had pushed for the opening aggressively, while several key
ministers including Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai was left
out of the loop, Shahal said.
</P>
<P>
On the night of September 23, the Jerusalem Municipality
secretly opened the tunnel exit and immediately triggered the
widespread Palestinian protests in east Jerusalem and the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The protests led to the bloody confrontation between

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Roam on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- More and more Chinese will
roam the Internet, the world's largest computer network, to gain
information, communicate with friends or play games, according to
a report in "China Woman's News."
</P>
<P>
The paper said there will be an estimated 100,000 Internet
users in China by the end of this year. Among them are more than
20,000 people who have discovered the link with Internet via
Chinanet, which is operated by the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
A survey in September showed that China had approximately
40,000 Internet users scattered throughout more than 10 cities and
provinces in the country, including Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
They were linked mostly via six international lines, according
to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The number of Internet users in China has grown rapidly in the
last two years -- ten times more than the figure in 1995.
</P>
<P>
So far, Internet users at home and abroad could read
information and background about many Chinese enterprises or
cities on the international information highway.
</P>
<P>
A new Chinanet, funded by 80 million yuan from the Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications, is expected to open at the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Internet now has a total of 60 million users
in 150 countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> APEC Moves From Vision to Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- From Blake Island in the United
States to Subic Bay in the Philippines, the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum has been moving from vision to action in
the past four years to achieve its goal of free and open trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
Initialed as an informal policy talk shop and a forum for
sector specific cooperation projects, APEC consolidated its
position as a regional economic force when its first informal
leadership conference was held on Blake Island, Seattle, in
November 1993.
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, leaders of the 18 APEC members promoted a
regional economic vision of a community of Asia Pacific economies
where goods, services and capital would flow freely. The vision
was also expected to contribute to an expanding world economy and
support an open multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
In November 1994 at Bogor in Indonesia, President Soeharto took
the organization a further significant step forward by giving
substance to the leaders' 1993 vision. The APEC leaders agreed
that industrialized economies should achieve free and open trade
and investment by 2010 and developing economies by 2020.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the Bogor goal, the APEC member economies
decided to focus their attention on three main areas: trade and
investment liberalization, trade and investment facilitation
measures and economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At the Osaka meeting in November 1995, Japan coordinated the
development of an action agenda for APEC members, which laid out
the guidelines, issues and objectives for achieving the free trade
goal.
</P>
<P>
APEC ministers and officials were instructed to begin the
preparation of concrete and substantive Individual Action Plans
and APEC-wide Collective Action Plans consistent with the Osaka
Action Agenda.
</P>
<P>
The overall implementation of these plans will begin in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, as chair of APEC meetings in 1996, has the
responsibility for coordinating and supervising the development of
these plans.
</P>
<P>
It will lead efforts of the member economies at the eighth APEC
ministerial meetings and the fourth informal leadership conference
to be held in the country and will assemble and present a
successful and complete Manila Action Plan to the ministers and
leaders when they meet in Manila and Subic Bay.
</P>
<P>
As Philippine President Fidel Ramos said earlier, while the
Osaka Action Agenda served as the roadway towards the APEC's goal
of free and open trade and investment, the APEC meeting in Subic
Bay on November 25 will give action.

<HEADLINE> New Service For The Aged in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- During an autumn day at dusk,
the last rays of the setting sun shone on a girl and an old woman
chatting as they strolled along the street.
</P>
<P>
The girl frequently pointed out to the old woman something in
the magazine she held in her hand. Her elderly companion would
then squint carefully at it, and gave an understanding smile.
</P>
<P>
Passers-by would probably have thought the pair as grandmother
and grand-daughter. However, the woman was a client of the girl -
joined together by an "Accompany-the-aged" service that provide
them the opportunity to know each other.
</P>
<P>
"Accompany-the-aged" is a new service in Nanjing, the capital
of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
With an increasing aging population, more and more senior
citizens demand help to fulfill the lack in their spiritual lives.
</P>
<P>
Qin Zhengying, 67, a retired technician, is one of the
pensioners seeking help. Qin's husband passed away years ago, and
her two sons work outside Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
Although her material life is quite comfortable, she often
feels lonely.
</P>
<P>
This September, Xie Hong, a university student was introduced
to her. Every Wednesday afternoon, Xie chats and strolls with her,
or reads books and newspapers to her new friend.
</P>
<P>
To show her appreciation, Qin pays four yuan to the girl for an
hour's service.
</P>
<P>
The people providing "accompany-the-aged" service are mainly
young teachers, college students, nurses and well-educated out of
work.
</P>
<P>
The service mainly includes chatting, strolling and traveling
with the aged, in addition to reading books and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Different from traditional personal nursing services, this
spiritual service does not include health care for the
aged. Therefore its price is quite low and affordable.
</P>
<P>
A number of people even offer such service free of charge as a
charity service.
</P>
<P>
The service not only relieves the loneliness of the old folk,
but also benefits the helper.
</P>
<P>
"The aged people have seen much of the world, and are really
experienced. I've learned much that can neither be attained in
class nor from books," said Xie.
</P>
<P>
Elderly people account for 11.1 percent of the total
population in Nanjing, growing yearly by 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of "accompany-the-aged" in China is a response to
this trend, said Ye Nanke, a research fellow at Jiangsu Provincial
Academy of Social Sciences.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Company, Pritzker Launch Joint Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel Aircraft Industries
(IAI) and the Pritzker organization, which owns Hyatt hotels in
the US, have agreed to form a joint venture company to
manufacture, market and service business-jet aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post said that the new company, to be named
Galaxy Aerospace Corp., will be based based in Princeton, New
Jersey, the site of the current offices of Astra Jet, IAI's
business-jet marketing subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
Pending U.S. government approvals, including those required
under the anti-trust law, the deal should be concluded in the first
quarter of next year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
IAI executives said Pritzker will invest 50 million U.S.
dollars in the new company and will have about 50 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
The partnership is part of a policy determined by the Israeli
Finance Ministry in 1993 for IAI to find strategic investors in
major projects, such as business-jet production.
</P>
<P>
IAI has delivered 450 business jets to operators around the
world, and Astra is the base of the company executive-jet line,
while the company's U.S. revenue for 1995 was 1.45 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report added that Galaxy initially will assume marketing
and product responsibility for the business jets built or
developed by IAI. And once a permanent headquarters for the new
company is found, Galaxy will develop a completion center and
factory service at that site.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Minority Region In China Improving Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The southwestern part of China
-- the Tibet Autonomous Region, Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and the western part of Sichuan
province - is inhabited by many different ethnic minority groups,
whose economy was dominated by agriculture for a very long time.
</P>
<P>
The area has seen some significant changes, however, since
1978, when China initiated its reform and opening-up policy, and
economists say they believe improved industries in the minority
region is a move toward the future, because of the central
government's favorable policies.
</P>
<P>
The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, whose growth rate used
to be lower than the national average, has had an annual growth
rate seven percentage points higher than the country's average
since 1990. Industrial output is 110 billion yuan in 1995, up
from 30 billion yuan in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan and Guizhou provinces recorded an annual industrial
growth rate of ten percent in the 1980s, and that went to 15
percent after 1990.

<HEADLINE> China Finds Wrong Chromosome Connection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUOYANG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A scientist in Central China's
Henan Province has found the first type of cell nucleus in the
world, which contains three wrongly-connected chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
Through the research on a woman patient, who has miscarried or
given birth many times to deformed babies, Ji Ning, a
doctor-in-charge of the genetics laboratory at a family planning
institute in Luoyang City, found that the patient's Chromosomes
No.1, No.2 and No.4 have broken up and reconnected.
</P>
<P>
There are 46 paired chromosomes in a human being's cell
nucleus. The complicated wrong connection of chromosomes refers to
the misconnection of more than two chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
Wrong connection of chromosomes in women's germ cells can
result in miscarriage or deformed babies. A pre-check of
chromosome connection, if it could be achieved, would help people
to decide if they need to stop a pregnancy.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Fuji Heavy Industries ltd. has
won an order to make the main wings of a twin-turbofan business
transport jet being developed by Raytheon Aircraft Co. of the
United States, a Fuji Heavy Industries spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The wings will be installed on Raytheon's Hawker Horizon
aircraft, which will have a flight range of 6,300 kilometers, the
spokesman was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Hawker Horizon, an upgraded version of the existing Hawker
1000 business transport jet of the Kansas-based aircraft maker
Wichita, will have a maximum cruising speed of Mach 0.84 (about
1,000 kilometers per hour), he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, Fuji will be responsible to design and
manufacture the main wings and will provide technological aid to
help Raytheon obtain the Federal Aviation Administration's
certification for the Hawker Horizon.
</P>
<P>
Fuji Heavy Industries has manufactured the main wings of the C1
military transport aircraft of the Japanese Air Self-Defense
Force, and Raytheon may have recognized the company's composite
material technology, although this technology will not be used in
the Hawker Horizon wing.

<HEADLINE> Navigation Management System to Increase Safety on Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 20 (Xinhua) -- China has completed a system to
oversee the safe navigation of vessels traveling downstream on the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The transportation management system maintains a
round-the-clock watch over a 364-km shipping route from Nanjing,
capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, to Liuhekou in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Four navigation mangement centers have been built in the ports
of Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Zhangjiagang and Nantong in the
province. In addition, 12 radar stations, one microwave relay
station, one VHF (very high frequency) relay station, and other
facilities are in service.
</P>
<P>
Since China started to implement the strategy of developing the
Yangtze in 1992, shipping became increasingly busier; every day
100,000 vessels navigate along the river.
</P>
<P>
Ships in the downstream of Nanjing are especially dense, facing
the danger of colliding with each other.
</P>
<P>
The country started building the navigation management system
in 1993, with a total investment of 100 million yuan (about 12
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Construction of the system, a key state project, has introduced
state-of-the-art equipment from Norway, Japan, and the United
States, said an official with the Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
The system will also help organize and coordinate the
navigation order, take part in relief efforts for sea accidents,
deal with vessels that violate traffic regulations, protect the
river ecosystem and provide information services.

<HEADLINE> First State-Level Shipping Exchange Established in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Shipping
Exchange was set up Tuesday, marking the birth of China's first
state-level water transport transaction market.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng pointed out the necessity of the
establishment of the market in January, when he met with shipping
authorities of Shanghai and neighboring Jiangsu and Zhejiang
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Cargo owners, shipping companies, and ports should have a
market to regularize transactions, control trading prices, and
facilitate exchanges of market information, as part of the efforts
to build Shanghai into an international shipping center, the
premier noted.
</P>
<P>
The market is a joint effort of the Ministry of Communications
and Shanghai municipal government, and will provide a site,
facilities, and service for transaction activities including cargo
shipping, ship renting, and ship marketing.
</P>
<P>
All shipping enterprises in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang
will become members of the exchange market, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Similar regional markets will be established in Dalian,
Tianjin, and Wuhan in the future, to form a unified national water
transport market with Shanghai as the center, ministry authorities
say.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Make Brokerages Reflect More Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Finance Ministry
plans to have brokerages reflect more market risk in their
capital-adequacy ratios from April next year in order to enhance
the transparency of their management, Kyodo News Service quoted an
economic daily as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move is in line with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's
financial liberalization plans, and is aimed to give protection to
investors amid increasing competitiveness in the industry, the
Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
Brokerages will be asked to evaluate unlisted securities
according to market prices when they calculate their ratios of net
worth to total capital, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only shares and bonds of listed companies are
evaluated according to market prices, and the evaluation of
unlisted companies are based on their prices at the point of
purchase, a practice which helps raise the ratio.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also have brokerages add the risks of
interest swap transactions to their calculations of market risk,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the ministry is considering making it compulsory for
brokerages to report their ratio of net work to total capital by
fiscal 1998 and punishing those which make false reports, the
paper said.

MEXICO CITY, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee Tuesday announced that whitewater slalom canoe/kayak
event has been dropped from the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games,
according to the IOC and Sydney Organizing Committee meeting in
Cancun, Mexico.

The drop was mainly due to the cost of constructing a
whitewater slalom venue. The whitewater event was part of the
1972, 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Maize Production to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's maize production may
drop by 30 percent in this farming season as most farmers in the
country are shifting to other crops.
</P>
<P>
Ajay Vashee, President of the Zambia National Farmers Union
(ZNFU), was quoted by the local press as saying here on Tuesday
that the decrease in maize production was due to difficulties in
input acquisition.
</P>
<P>
Vashee said, ''Crutial inputs are not yet in place up to this
late time into the farming season.''
</P>
<P>
He said few farmers are able to remain in maize production
because of its expensive cost.
</P>
<P>
ZNFU is still not sure whether the government is buying
fertilizer for the farmers or it has left the responsibility to
themselves, according to Vashee.
</P>
<P>
Zambia reaped a bumper harvest in maize production in the last
farming season, but most farmers were benefited little due to low
selling prices. In some cases, farmers could even not afford to
pay for the expenditure for growing maize. enditem

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: APEC, Informal Dialogue Group to Promote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum is an informal dialogue group working to
achieve the goal of free trade and investment in the Asia Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Conceived in 1989 at the initiative of former Australian Prime
Minister Bob Hawke, APEC began as a loose grouping of 12 Asia
Pacific economies including Australia, Brunei, Canada, Indonesia,
Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South
Korea, Thailand and the United States.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1993, the forum's ranks swelled to include China,
Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Mexico and Papua New Guinea. Chile was
admitted as a member in 1994. Then the forum decided to stop
accepting new members within three years.
</P>
<P>
At present, APEC groups 18 major economies in the region. At
over 13 trillion U.S. dollars, the combined output of the current
APEC members accounts for over 56 percent of the world's output.
APEC members also account for 46 percent of world trade in goods
and some 40 percent of the world population.
</P>
<P>
APEC is served by a small secretariat based in Singapore. APEC
members meet annually, usually in November at Ministerial-level to
discuss ways of ensuring the region's sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the forum has also been meeting at leaders' level.
Each year, one APEC member assumes the Chair of APEC in a process
whereby the Chair is rotated among a member of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the alternate years.
</P>
<P>
This year the Philippines is the Chair of APEC. It will be
followed by Canada in 1997, Malaysia in 1998 and New Zealand in
1999. Last year Japan held the third APEC leaders' informal
conference, preceded by Indonesia in 1994 and the United States in
1993.

<HEADLINE> China Promulgates Travel Agency Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Travel agencies in China who
overcharge tourists face punishment under State regulations.
</P>
<P>
The new rule states that any increase in charges should be
subject to the consent of tourists. The new regulations have been
introduced to govern the management of travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
As China's first official administration legislation on travel
agencies, the regulations apply to travel agencies operating in
China and permanent offices of foreign travel agencies in China.
</P>
<P>
The regulations are designed to strengthen the management of
travel agencies, protect the legal rights and interests of
tourists and travel agencies, maintain order in the tourism
market, and help the tourism industry to develop in a sound manner.
</P>
<P>
With 40 clauses in six articles, the regulations spell out
explicit stipulations on the establishment and operation of travel
agencies, and punishment for violators of the regulations.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, travel agencies are classified into
two categories--domestic and international travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
Applications for establishing a travel agency will be examined
and approved by tourism administrative organs.
</P>
<P>
Once operational, the business has to be subject to the
supervision of the administrative organs.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of Sino-foreign joint venture travel agencies
must be approved according to regulations of the State Council,
and in line with relevant laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect the rights and interests of tourists,
travel agencies should pay quality guarantee deposits which are to
be used for handling claims by tourists against travel agencies
for problems and accidents arising from poor quality.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen clauses are designed to standardize the operational
behavior of travel agencies, including banning them from
malpractices, stressing the protection of tourists' interests, and
how to handle complaints.
</P>
<P>
There are also regulations on the punishment and liabilities
against violators of the regulations.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Head on New Travel Agency Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- New rules on the management of
travel agencies approved by China's State Council will have
far-reaching significance on the country's tourism industry,
commented He Guangwei, Director General of China National Tourism
Administration.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, which call for strengthened management while
offering more business flexibility, will be conducive to
maintaining market order, and at the same time boosting the
business of travel agencies, the Director General said.
</P>
<P>
China now boasts over 5,000 travel agencies, either engaged in
overseas or domestic tourism. The new regulations are designed to
help them enhance their competitive edge in both Chinese and
international travel markets, he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, the travel agencies can be set up
only after examination and approval of tourism administrations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the administrations are empowered to supervise and
examine the work of the agencies.
</P>
<P>
While in the past there has been no asset connection between
the head offices of China's national travel agencies and their
local branches, the new regulations for the first time allow
travel agencies receiving over 100,000 tourists a year to set up
non-legal person branches.
</P>
<P>
The branches will not only be under the management of head
offices, but will be linked with them financially and share common
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
"This will help break up department and regional barriers, and
create a number of more powerful travel conglomerates," He said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulations, travel agencies are classified into
two categories--the domestic and international travel
agencies. The required amount of registered capital has been
raised to higher level.
</P>
<P>
"The classification is in line with international practices,
and is helpful in business expansion of large and medium-sized
travel agencies," the Director-General said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulations, it is compulsory for travel agencies
to pay deposits to guarantee service quality for tourists and to
buy insurance policies against accidents.
</P>
<P>
"This will help lay a solid foundation for the establishment of
a tourist protection system with Chinese characteristics," he
commented.

<HEADLINE> Ostriches Back Home After 30,000 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A total of 129 ostriches have
returned to their hometown in the Ordos Highlands in north China's
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, after a long-distance journey by
air from southern China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Based on research on the fossilized ostrich eggs discovered on
the Ordos Highlands, Chinese experts have concluded that the birds
lived in the area 30,000 years ago. They disappeared from the
region due to the harsh climate and environment.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have invested a large amount of money over
the past decade to harness the Hobq Desert, located in the
northern part of the Ordos Highlands.
</P>
<P>
To welcome the ostriches back home, workers have built houses
with a floor space of 1,000 square meters for the ostriches and
have prepared their favorite fodder.
</P>
<P>
Re-introducing ostriches to their native land will not only
attract tourists, but also help to develop the ostrich-breeding
industry in desert areas, according to sources.

<P>
BANGKOK, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Sentiment in the Stock
Exchange of Thailand (SET) has improved greatly upon the news that
the new government has included the Chart Pattana party and is
likely to appoint Amnuay Virawan to head the economic team.
</P>
<P>
Chart Pattana (National Development) leader and former prime
minister Chatichai Choonhavan has been invited to assume the post
of the chief economic adviser for the government and the party
will take some economic portfolios in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay Virawan is a former banker and a deputy prime minister
in charge of economic affairs in the outgoing government.
</P>
<P>
The two moves have boosted investors' confidence in the new
coalition government, led by the New Aspiration Party (NAP) of
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh which won the mandate to form a new
government in the general elections Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The SET index moved up by 21.85 points, or 2.23 percent, to
close at 964.19, with trading turnover at 8,279 million baht (331
million U.S. dollars) on Tuesday, the second trading day following
the elections.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the SET index fell by 58.39 points, or 5.83 percent,
to close at 942.34, reacting to the prospects that the new
government, with inclusion of the Chart Thai (Thai Nation) party
of caretaker prime minister Banharn Silpa-archa, would have a
similar team as the outgoing one.
</P>
<P>
Later on Monday, the Chart Thai party, which suffers a
tarnished image, was dropped from the new government.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Parliament Refers Speakership Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Parliament voted
to refer the controversy over the Speaker's election to the
Constitutional Court after a marathon 10-hour session Tuesday
night
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary sources said the National Assembly
overwhelmingly approved a compromise formula sponsored by the
government to request the Constitutional Court to rule whether or
not current Speaker Ahmad Saadoun's election is in accordance
with the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Members of the government requested Tuesday morning at the
second session of the National Assembly to hold further
consultations on a letter filed to the parliament's secretariat
by MP Jassem Al-Khorafi, who lost a closely-contested election
for parliament chief to Saadoun during the first session of the
newly elected parliament on October 20.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Khorafi submitted a memorandum officially
protesting against the result and his letter was placed on the
session's agenda Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Khorafi and his supporters were demanding that the case
should go to the Constitutional Court for interpretation of
clauses in the country's Constitution regarding the Speaker's
election.
</P>
<P>
Saadoun won the October 20 speakership battle 30-29 with one
blank vote at the first session of the current parliament when 60
MPs and Cabinet members were casting their votes. Kuwaiti Cabinet
members have an equal right with the MPs to vote in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Khorafi argued that the election was unconstitutional and
demanded a re-run of the vote. He said that according to the
country's constitution, the Speaker should at least win an
absolute majority of the actual votes to hold the post.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that all 15 Cabinet members were among the 36
members who voted in favor of the compromise formula. Twenty-four
members voted against and one abstained.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's session was very tense as members exchanged
personal accusations and conflicting opinions, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Saadoun's supporters tried in vain to quash Khorafi's
objection and reconfirm him as the legitimate speaker. They
lashed out at what they called "an organized campaign to unseat
Saadoun and destabilize the Assembly," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary decision means that the Speaker's post is
now entirely in the hands of the Constitutional Court, which is
not likely to issue a verdict soon. Meanwhile, Saadoun will
remain the parliamentary Speaker.
</P>
<P>
Saadoun, who was Speaker in 1981, 1985 and 1992, and Khorafi,
who is heading perhaps the largest private business conglomerate
in Kuwait and the first time to be elected MP, were the only two
candidates competing for the Speaker's post.
</P>
<P>
The candidates were elected from each of their constituencies
among Kuwait's 25 constituencies on October 7 in all-man
affair. Women are not allowed to vote or run for office in Kuwait
which hosts the only elected parliament in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's current parliament, which has 50 seats, is the eighth
one in the country's history since it became independent in
1961.

<HEADLINE> Farms Acquired to Resettle Black People in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Ministry of Land and
Water Resources has handed over 10 farms for resettlement to the
Ministry of Local Government, Rural and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
The farms, covering a total of 29,000 hectares, were handed over
two weeks ago, bringing in the total number of farms acquired this year
to 33, the Zimbabwe National News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, 23 farms were acquired around the country, but
the government's efforts to resettle thousands of land-hungry people
have been hampered by lack of resources.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Local Government, Rural and Urban Development
indicated that it required about 10 million US Dollars, more than
double the 3.2 million allocated this financial year for
resettlement.
</P>
<P>
''We have handed over another 10 farms for resettlement and are
continuing discussions with people who want to sell their farms for
resettlement,'' Land and Water Resources Minister Kumbirai Kangai
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe government had initially anticipated resettling about
5,000 families every year, but due to lack of resources, it was only
able to resettle about 1,500 annually.
</P>
<P>
So far 60,000 families have been resettled and nearly 80,000 are
awaiting their turn. enditem

Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today told Chinese

Qian said the potential of the nuclear power market in China is
very promising, and that China welcomes US businesses to take part
in China's nuclear power development plan. The participation would
also benefit the US, he said.

China will also abide by the commitment it made in a Sino-US
statement on the issue of missiles, which was signed in October of
1994, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the two countries regarding non-proliferation
have been smooth, he said, adding that China's greatest concern is

<HEADLINE> Parliament Session Likely to Be Stormy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The winter session of
parliament, commencing here today, is expected to generate heated
debates, tacit boycotts and subsequent adjournments, particularly
in the backdrop of the reimposition of the presidential rule in
Uttar Pradesh (UP).
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), the major opposition in the
parliament, is planning to take up the UP issue during the
session. The BJP might also try to rope in the Congress party in
its attack on the United Front government over the UP issue as
both the BJP and the Congress party were opposed to the
reimposition of presidential rule in UP.
</P>
<P>
The BJP is also expected to oppose the "conspiracy" between the
ruling United Front and the Congress, which led to the fall of the
elected S. Mehta government in Gujarat state and the installation
of BJP dissident Vaghela as the chief minister.
</P>
<P>
Opposition members are also expected to raise serious
objections about the United Front government's attitude in
remaining tied to the apron strings of the Congress in the
pursuance of its economic policies. Even the left parties within
the United Front have reportedly decided to criticize the
government's economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Other important issues that would dominate the proceedings of
parliament include the Constitution ( 81st amendment) Bill, 1996,
which has been referred to a joint select committee of parliament,
after differences of opinion perpetuated in the house. The bill
accords 33 percent reservations to women in the Lok Sabha (lower
house) and legislative assemblies of the states.
</P>
<P>
The government is also under considerable pressure from the
Congress to get the patent bill passed in the Rajya Sabha (upper
house). The patent bill was passed by the Lok Sabha during the Rao
government, but it ran into rough weather when it was introduced
in the upper house as the then ruling Congress din not enjoy
majority in the Rajya Sabha. The controversial bill had to be
referred to the select committee of the Rajya Sabha.
</P>
<P>
The left front is strictly opposed to the controversial patent
bill stating that the law would be tantamount to infringement on
the nation's sovereign character.
</P>
<P>
Some reports even said that the BJP is also considering to
table a no-confidence motion against the government in the
parliament.

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Foreign insurance companies
are in a scramble to join hands with the State Bank of India (SBI)
which has announced plans to enter the insurance sector, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The SBI has offered a huge distribution network and a captive
market for general insurance products.
</P>
<P>
"There is a huge amount of business which will be available to
use on the platter. We have 2,100 branches in urban centers which
put us in a strong position to distribute insurance products. I am
not surprised that so many insurance companies keep making
presentations to us," said SBI Chairman P.G. Kakodkar.
</P>
<P>
The SBI is already under negotiations for joint venture
partnerships with multinationals such as Visa, Mastercard and
American Express.

opening up the insurance sector," Kakodkar said.

<HEADLINE> APEC's Main Objectives: Economic Growth and Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- One of the main objectives of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is to sustain the
growth and development of the region through trade liberalization
and investment in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
APEC's most prominent commitments are the achievement of free
trade and investment in the region by 2010 for developed members,
and 2020 for developing economies.
</P>
<P>
APEC was formed in 1989 in response to increasing calls for
closer economic cooperation through increased trade and investment
flows among the economies in the Asia-Pacific region. To date,
APEC has a combined population of two billion and accounts for
more than 40 percent of the world's total merchandise trade.
</P>
<P>
Its main objectives are:
</P>
<P>
-- to sustain the growth and development of the region;
</P>
<P>
-- to enhance the positive gains from increased economic
interdependence and cross-border flows of goods, services, capital
and technology;
</P>
<P>
-- to develop and strengthen the multilateral trading system;
and,
</P>
<P>
-- to reduce barriers to trade in goods and services as well as
investments among participating economies in a manner consistent
with the World Trade Organization (WTO) principles and without
detriment to other economics.
</P>
<P>
APEC groups 18 members: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile,
China, Chinese Taipei, Hongkong, Indonesia, Republic of Korea,
Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the
Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The regional group is distinct from other trade liberalization
fora and arrangements, however, in that it gives equal emphasis to
economic and technical cooperation. This cooperation involves the
transfer of official resources from developed to developing
economies.
</P>
<P>
The November 22-23 APEC ministerial-meeting in Manila will
bring together 18 of the world's economies, including the largest
and richest, the most populous, and the most rapidly growing
economies of the world.

Philippine side were attending the meeting which Malaysian Navy
Chief Ahmad Ramli Mohd Noor is scheduled to close tomorrow night.

<HEADLINE> Bailey, Johnson to Meet Next May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Olympic 100-meter gold
medalist Donovan Bailey is set to meet his U.S. rival Michael
Johnson next May to decide who is the world's fastest sprinter.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Toronto today, Bailey and Johnson said
the venue of the race has not decided, and that they would race in
the spring for a total purse of 2 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Bailey set the world record and won the gold medal in
the 100 meters at the Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, while
Johnson became the first male Olympian to win both the 200- and
400-meter races.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the games, there has been a controversy as to who is
really "the world's fastest man."
</P>
<P>
The Canadians say the title should go to Bailey, while the
Americans insist that Johnson has every reason to be the world's
fastest man.
</P>
<P>
The showdown race, dubbed "The Challenge of Champions", will be
over 150 meters on a curved track, midway between Bailey's
100-meter event and Johnson's 200.
</P>
<P>
Both men will receive appearance fees of 500,000 dollars, with
the winner taking home another 1 million.
</P>
<P>
"It's really the only way to put two guys together who are
different specialists and make it fair," Johnson was quoted as
saying by local media reports.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great opportunity for track and field," Johnson
said. "I think it's a great opportunity for both of us and I look
forward to it."
</P>
<P>
Bailey also welcomed the challenge. "I'm here now, its going to
happen in May so I'm really looking forward to taking on my man
here," Bailey.
</P>
<P>
The race would take place in a North American city, which will
be announced in three weeks. Toronto is one of the cities under
consideration.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chavalit to Wait Longer Than Expected to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who has
won the right to head the new government through the general
election on Sunday, may have to wait longer than expected to
become Thailand's 22nd prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit, leader of the New Aspiration Party, which has become
core of the new coalition government, encountered his first hurdle
on his way to the long-coveted premiership.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, outgoing prime minister Banharn Silpa-Archa
abruptly closed the weekly cabinet meeting, leaving a royal decree
for opening the new house of parliament undrafted.
</P>
<P>
There are several steps to go before a new prime minister is
sworn in, with the first one being for the outgoing cabinet to
draft a royal decree to open the new house.
</P>
<P>
At the first house session, a new house speaker is to be
elected, who, after the king's approval, will submit the
nomination of the prime minister for the king's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
Then the prime minister will present the cabinet list for royal
approval before the cabinet is sworn in.
</P>
<P>
Last year when Banharn won premiership in the election, it took
outgoing prime minister Chuan Leekpai only eight days before the
new house was opened.
</P>
<P>
While Chavalit wants his new government to start work as soon
as possible to take charge of the various major forthcoming
events, outgoing prime minister Banharn said, "just follow the
regulations step by step. We should not rush.... no one is going
to take that (the government) from them."
</P>
<P>
Banharn's Chart Thai (Thai nation) Party has been excluded from
the new coalition government, that is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
Banharn said that he wanted to wait until all 393 new MPs have
reported to the House Secretariat and he gets the list.
</P>
<P>
The reporting will take five to seven days, starting from the
next day of the November 17 election.
</P>
<P>
A Chart Thai Party source was quoted as saying that there may
be three factors behind Banharn's delaying tactics.
</P>
<P>
Banharn wants to have the privilege of receiving U.S. President
Bill Clinton, who will be on a state visit to Thailand on November
25-26, presiding over celebrations marking the king's birthday on
December 5, and to exact revenge against Chavalit for dropping his
Chart Thai Party from the new government.
</P>
<P>
But Banharn denied that he was trying to block Chavalit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chavalit's efforts to allocate cabinet portfolios
have been stalled over the appointment of Amnuay Virawan, a former
banker and deputy prime minister, as head of the economic team.
</P>
<P>
During campaigning, Chavalit stated that if he was to form the
new government, he would appoint Amnuay to head a "dream team" on
economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay, who disbanded his Nam Thai (Thai leadership) Party just
before the general election, did not run in the race.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Chatichai Choonhavan, leader of the Chart
Pattana (national development) Party, has been invited to be chief
adviser on economic and foreign affairs in the new government.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Chart Pattana economic ministers would not be
keen on working under Amnuay.
</P>
<P>
The plan to put Amnuay in charge of economic ministries "should
be discussed seriously," a source was quoted as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-U.S. Joint
Economic Committee ended its Ninth session here today with both
sides highly appraising the achievements.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, co-chaired by Chinese Finance Minister
Liu Zhongli and U.S. Secretary of Treasury Robert Rubin,
discussed macro-economic policy and performance, financial market
reform and supervision, and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the end of the meeting says that
progress was also made in deepening the U.S.-China economic
relationship and increasing bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the achievements marked by Rubin
include additional cooperation to develop programs addressing
market oversight, market disclosure and protection of investors,
consensus on technical cooperation in areas related to tax
administration, U.S. consideration of allowing Chinese banks to
operate branches within the United States under U.S. law, and
consensus on increasing the exchange of information, mutual
training and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the communique says, Liu announced China's
plans to achieve current account convertibility by the end of the
year, China's consideration of the applications of foreign banks
to conduct, on a trial basis, local currency business in Pudong,
Shanghai, China's recent decision to approve applications for
branch licenses from U.S. banks seeking to do business in Beijing
and Shanghai, and the continuation of discussions between China's
Customs Service and its U.S. counterpart with a view toward
concluding a customs mutual assistance agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after the meeting, Liu
said that the two sides discussed, on the basis of full
consultation and with the spirit of cooperation, a wide range of
issues and got a better understanding of each other's positions.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is beneficial to the furthering of economic
cooperation and the expansion of trade which are in the interests
of both countries, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Liu also told Chinese correspondents here that the meeting
is "positive and pragmatic."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the meeting was "highly valuable" and provided "rare
opportunities" to develop a better understanding of each other's
economic views.
</P>
<P>
"The Sino-U.S. relationship would benefit greatly from
frequent meetings of this kind between officials of our two
countries in many areas," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that the next meeting of the Joint
Economic Committee will be held in Beijing, the date is yet to be
set.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Withdraws Officers from Panmunjom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) has decided to tentatively withdraw
delegates at its liaison office at truce village Panmunjom and
suspend their business from today.
</P>
<P>
A report today, by Radio Pyongyang, said the withdrawal was
announced in a communique published by the Korean Central News
Agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The communique claimed that: "The existence of the Panmunjom
liaison office, which is in charge of liaison and technical
consultation for inter-Korean dialogue, has become meaningless"
since South Korea had adopted a "totally negative attitude"
towards dialogue.
</P>
<P>
It cited as facts that South Korea had recently made it a
"policy" to "close the door between the north and south" and
blocked any inter-Korean contact, and relationship at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the South Korean leader had also said in an
interview with the Washington Post, a major U.S. newspaper, on
November 9, that he would have no dialogue with the north.
</P>
<P>
"The South Korean authorities have driven the north-south
relations to a hopeless phase with no possibility of dialogue,"
the communique continued.
</P>
<P>
It added that the South Korean authorities must be wholly
blamed for the suspension of the business of the liaison offices
of the north and south, at Panmunjom, which were installed in May
1992 under an agreement between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> APEC Officials Discuss Final Details of Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) discussed here this morning
the final details of the Manila Action Plan, which will be finally
approved by APEC leaders when they meet in Subic on November 25.
</P>
<P>
Federico Macaranas, chairman of the senior officials meeting,
said at the opening ceremony that at the two-day informal meeting,
the delegates were expected to wrap up discussions on the Manila
Action Plan and other administrative matters.
</P>
<P>
This morning, the participants also went over the draft
declaration of economic and technical cooperation, which will be
issued at the end of the informal meeting of APEC leaders
scheduled for November 25 in Subic, a former U.S. naval base 80
kilometers north of Manila.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Action Plan for APEC is an integration and
summarization of the individual and collective plans for trade and
investment liberalization and facilitation, and economic and
technical cooperation among its members.
</P>
<P>
In their declaration of Common Resolve in November 1994 in
Indonesia, APEC leaders agreed that APEC members should work
toward free trade and investment in the region, with developed
members achieving the goal of free and open trade and investment
no later than 2010 and developing economies no later than 2020.
</P>
<P>
The draft Manila action plan will be submitted to the APEC
ministerial meeting on November 22-23 for further discussion and
will be finally approved by APEC leaders in Subic.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, according to Macaranas, the senior officials
will discuss the issue of lifting a moratorium on the admission of
new members as the moratorium will expire at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss a report on food, energy, environment,
economic growth and population, and the proposed modalities for an
annual review of sustainable development work in APEC, he said.
</P>
<P>
APEC was formed in 1989 in response to increasing calls for
closer economic cooperation through increased trade and investment
flows among the economies in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
It groups together Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China,
Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Malaysia,
Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Chinese
Taipei, Thailand, Singapore and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Bucharest Mayor Nominated as Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of Bucharest was
designated as prime minister Tuesday by the Christian Democratic
National Peasants' Party (CDNPP), the biggest party in a group
which won presidential elections on November 3.
</P>
<P>
The CDNPP, mainstay of the seven-party Democratic Convention of
Romania (CDR), named Victor Ciorbea at a party meeting Tuesday to
head Romania's new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The nomination needs the approval of the president and
parliament, but endorsement seems most likely as the
president-elect, Emil Constantinescu, is the chairman of the CDR.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu, who will be sworn in as president next week,
defeated incumbent Ion Iliescu, who has led the country since
1989, in the recent elections.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea, 42, had worked in judicial departments and educational
institutions before he became Bucharest mayor in June.
</P>
<P>
He joined the CDNPP in March this year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says He Wants To Devote Time To China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton said here today that he intended to devote much time and
energy to building the relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
"I intend to spend a lot of time, a lot of energy, a lot of
effort on that, but not with the view to containing the Chinese,
but with a view to making them a genuine partner," he told a press
conference after he had talks with his host Prime Minister John
Howard in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The president claimed that his country has no interest in
containing China, saying "what the United states wants is to
sustain an engagement with China along with our friends like the
Australians".
</P>
<P>
He said China was a big priority for everyone and was one of
the five big questions which would determine the shape of the
world 50 years from now.
</P>
<P>
"One of those questions would surely be how will the Chinese
define their greatness in the 21st century", he said.
</P>
<P>
"will they define their greatness in terms of the incredible
potential of their people to learn, to produce, to succeed
economically, culturally and politically? or define their
greatness in terms of their ability to dominate their neighbors
and others?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
After saying that the US and Australia can lead other nations
in standing up against the new threats of the 21st century,
Clinton once more repeated his words that he wanted to build a
partnership with China, instead of isolating it.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived in this country yesterday and came to Canberra
this morning and is scheduled to go to Sydney tomorrow and will
have two days holidays in north Queensland before going to Manila
for the informal APEC leadership meeting.

<HEADLINE> Improvement of Higher Education Urged in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Nepali official has
called for significant improvements in the country's higher
education system in this rapidly changing world, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Govinda Raj Joshi said Tuesday that the
quality of the higher education in Nepal should be improved to
enable Nepali students to compete with those of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Opening a week-long workshop on a newly launched three-year
bachelor program in the country, Joshi said that college teachers
should keep updating themselves as well as their curriculum.
</P>
<P>
"The problem with the country's higher education system is we
have not been able to convince the students to study seriously,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the academic calendar of higher education
institutions should be clearly defined and strictly implemented.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the workshop urged the government to assist
private universities which now have nearly 45,000 students and
reportedly have better educational quality than public ones.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the government is now working out a
funding policy for higher education institutions in the country.

<HEADLINE> Relics Thefts Rising in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The number of relics stolen in
Russia has been rising rapidly in recent years as demand for them
grows on international markets.
</P>
<P>
Russian law-enforcing departments recorded 365 cases of theft
involving national-class cultural relics in 1989. But the number
had increased to 4,796 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2285 relics thefts were reported in the first nine
months of this year, according to figures released by the Russian
Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Gangs of thieves often use violence when they go for items
which they believe can fetch a good price on international markets.
</P>
<P>
The gangs mainly attack private collectors as 80 percent of the
stolen relics belong to them.
</P>
<P>
This is because of the lack of state protection for private
relics collectors, who choose not to register precious items they
own.
</P>
<P>
There are about 6,000 private relics collectors in Russia at
present.
</P>
<P>
Items stolen from churches and other religious organizations
account for about 18 percent of the total among stolen relics.
</P>
<P>
A majority of the stolen relics are shipped out of Russia to be
sold on international markets.
</P>
<P>
Interpol's Moscow branch plans to compose a graphic index of
the stolen, national-class relics, which will be distributed to
foreign law-enforcing departments, exchanges, collectors and
merchants, so that stolen items cannot be easily sold.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Slavonia Needs More Than $1 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 19 (Xinhua) -- At least one billion U.S.
dollars are needed for economic recovery in the region of Eastern
Slavonia, according to a senior United Nations military official
here.
</P>
<P>
That sum of money could only afford food, medicine and teaching
aids, but could not cover the rebuilding of the infrastructure
destroyed during the Bosnian War, said General Jacques Klein, the
person in charge of the United Nations Transitional Administration
for Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES).
</P>
<P>
Klein noted that an international conference on the regional
economic recovery would open on December 6. He said the tension
between the ethnic Serbs and Croats in this area had not been
eased and unemployment was as high as 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The UNTAES had achieved a lot in demilitarization in the
region, but it had done little in solving the refugee issue, Klein
said.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian authorities moved slowly in providing the Serbian
refugees' files in Western Slavonia, making it difficult for them
to go home. It would be impossible for the Serbian refugees to
return home without money for living, the general added.
</P>
<P>
The UNTAES, which came into being on January 15, 1996, would
leave the region if Eastern Slavonia began its rebuilding program,
Klein added.

<HEADLINE> China's Reform of Jailed Criminals Aided by Whole Society (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- When his prison was scheduled
to relocate from a remote mountainous area to the outskirts of a
prosperous city in 1993, warden Zheng Ronghua worried that the
local government and people might not approve.
</P>
<P>
"Someone told me that urban citizens wouldn't be glad to see a
prison so close to them, since it could be a `time bomb' for
social security," said Zheng, who is warden of the No.1 Prison of
east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Located in the southwestern city of Quzhou, the prison now
houses more than 2,700 inmates, most of whom have sentences of
more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
"However, facts proved that my worries were absolutely
unnecessary," he said. "Quzhou people not only accepted us, but
also offered maximum support and help to our work of
rehabilitating criminals."
</P>
<P>
Since the state control over grain prices was lifted, the market
price of rice in Quzhou has been fluctuating between 2.6 and 2.8
yuan per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
However, for the inmates at the No. 1 Prison, the price of rice
over the past three years stayed steady at 2.2 yuan per kilogram,
thanks to preferential treatment from the local grain
administration, which took the prison's financial difficulties
into consideration.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the city library loaned 10,000 books to the prison
library, free of charge, and renewed the books every 100 days.
</P>
<P>
And in August, the local education commission named the prison
one of its testing sites for the national examinations for
self-taught students, prompting 72 inmates to take part in this
year's exams.
</P>
<P>
"The commission has greatly aided the re-education, both
ideological and cultural, of the inmates," the warden said.
</P>
<P>
Traditional Chinese thought holds that it takes courage to
correct a mistake, and that a prodigal son is precious.

<HEADLINE> China's Reform of Jailed Criminals Aided by Whole Society (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese government believes the prison system should serve
a dual purpose, existing not only for punishment, but also to
reform individuals.
</P>
<P>
"We have often invited famous local figures, such as model
workers and heroes, to give lectures in the prison, and have
organized prisoners to visit the society outside the walls," said
Zheng of the close ties between his prison and society.
</P>
<P>
One of the lecturers was Kong Xiangkai, the 75th-generation
grandson of Confucius, a legendary philosopher who lived 2,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
After listening to Kong's speech on traditional Chinese morals,
an inmate said that the prisoners should work hard to reform
themselves, especially for the sake of the local people.
</P>
<P>
In China, both prison authorities and the society are trying
actively to provide more job opportunities for released prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The Zhejiang No.1 Prison signed an employment agreement with
Wenzhou, a booming coastal city in east Zhejiang with a highly
developed private economy, for its released inmates.
</P>
<P>
And an enterprise in Taizhou last year approached the prison to
recruit prospective workers, Zheng Ronghua said.
</P>
<P>
Among all released prisoners in China today, some 70 to 80
percent have a job -- an impressive figure given the country's
huge force of urban jobless and rural surplus labor.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Justice said that owing to the
joint efforts of the whole society, China's reform of jailed
criminals has achieved satisfactory results.
</P>
<P>
The recidivism rate of prisoners in China is one out of every
100, far more less than that in the US, which is more than 40
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Among those released from our prison, quite a few have become
entrepreneurs, senior engineers, and even heroes fighting against
crimes," Zheng Ronghua said with pride.

<HEADLINE> APEC Senior Officials Meeting Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum began their informal
gathering here this morning, making preparations for the informal
meeting of APEC leaders scheduled for November 25 in the northern
Philippine port of Subic.
</P>
<P>
According to the APEC 96' News Bureau, senior officials from
the 18 APEC members will discuss the draft Manila Action Plan, an
integration and summarization of the individual and collective
plans for trade and investment liberalization and facilitation,
and economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In their declaration of Common Resolve in November 1994 in
Indonesia, APEC leaders agreed that APEC members should work
toward free trade and investment in the region, with developed
members achieving the goal of free and open trade and investment
no later than 2010 and developing economies no later than 2020.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day senior officials meeting, APEC members will
present their blueprint for achieving the goal.
</P>
<P>
The draft action plan will be submitted to APEC ministers for
further discussion when they meet here on November 22-23. It will
be finally approved by APEC leaders in Subic, 80 kilometers north
of Manila.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the meeting said that the senior officials are
also expected to discuss the issue of lifting a moratorium on the
admission of new members as the moratorium will expire at the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that many countries, such as Vietnam, Russia,
India, Mongolia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, have applied to join
the APEC forum.
</P>
<P>
The senior officials are also likely to discuss, among other
issues, an Information Technology Agreement, a U.S. proposal which
was formally presented to an APEC senior officials meeting last
August in Davao city, the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for zero tariffs on a wide range of computer
and computer-related products in APEC and other economies.
</P>
<P>
The APEC forum was established in 1989 in response to
increasing calls for closer economic cooperation through increased
trade and investment flows among the economies in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
It groups together Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China,
Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Chinese Taipei,
Thailand, Singapore and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sets Ceiling on Shareholding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
set a 15 percent ceiling on individual shareholdings in companies
listed on stock exchanges to prevent monopoly and encourage more
people to buy company shares offered to the public, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Cooperatives Subiakto Tjakrawerdaja, who met
President Soeharto Tuesday, said the president instructed that
individual shareholdings should not exceed 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
"If private companies go public, a more equal spread of
ownership is a primary aim, and these companies should not be
owned by only a handful of people," Tjakrawerdaja quoted Soeharto
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister did not say whether a law had officially been
passed to limit the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
Economists here noted that Soeharto was apparently referring to
the case of Indonesia's leading automotive maker Pt. Astra
International.
</P>
<P>
Putra Sampoerna, chairman of the Sampoerna Cigarette Group,
moved last month to acquire more than 25 percent of Astra
International.
</P>
<P>
But his takeover was foiled by several investors, including
three foundations controlled by Soeharto family which bought many
Astra shares.
</P>
<P>
An analyst from a local securities firm said that restricting
the level of shareholdings would enhance liquidity on the stock
market, and would enhance the competitiveness of Indonesian
bourses in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"From an investor's point of view, a stock becomes very liquid
if it belongs to many parties," he was quoted by the local press
as saying.

</P>
<P>
Qian extended his warm welcome to Christopher for his second
China tour and said that China always believes maintaining a
healthy and stable relationship between China and the US, the two
big countries of major importance, is not only in line with the
fundamental interests of the two peoples, but also in the
interests of the peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region
and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Through joint efforts from both sides, Qian said, high level
exchange of visits have been more frequent over recent years and
bilateral economic and trade relations have been increasing.
</P>
<P>
Those problems besetting bilateral ties are being gradually
settled and the climate for the development of bilateral
relationship has been improved, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He continued that the meeting between Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and US President Bill Clinton several days later in Manila
will provide an opportunity for the further development of Sino-US
ties.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that the key problem in bilateral ties is the
issue of Taiwan, and a proper settlement of the issue will be
beneficial to the development of Sino-US relations, otherwise, the
bilateral relations would be disturbed and harmed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches great importance to the the US
government's committment on the issue, and pays more attention to
the actions of the US side, he added.
</P>
<P>
China highly appreciates the willingness expressed by the US
recently to speed up the negotiations on China's entry into the
World Trade Organization, Qian said, and it is willing to exert
more efforts in this regard, and hopes that the US will adopt a
flexible and pragmatic stand during the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that during last 15 meetings between him and
Qian, they worked together to build a solid foundation for
China-US relations, and important progress has been made across a
wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
He said that US President Bill Clinton recognizes the enormous
importance of China and the great potential of broad cooperation
between US and China for the people of the two countries and for
the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting with press, the two foreign ministers
began their talks at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mystery Disease Strikes Austrian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Austrian President Thomas
Klestil has been diagnosed as having contracted an unclassified
disease after recovering from pneumonia, a United States expert
announced today.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Medsger, a well-known American expert in what was
described as "connective diseases", made the announcement at a
joint press conference after a group consultation with the
Austrian medical team in charge of the president.
</P>
<P>
Klestil left hospital on November 1 after his seven-weeks
treatment for pneumonia, and was readmitted to the hospital with
lung thrombus two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Medsger told reporters that he made his diagnosis on
three bases outside pneumonia: Klestil contracted arthritis this
summer; his finger beds had been damaged from the misfunctioning
of blood recycling in his fingers, and his antibody test appeared
positive.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed the correctness of his Vienna colleagues in
diagnosing and treating the president so far.
</P>
<P>
Asked what kind of disease this was, Medsger replied humorously
that the person who could explain it could get the Nobel Prize. It
was a sort of illness related to problems in the immune system.
</P>
<P>
He said the cause of this disease was still unknown.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the treatment for Klestil, Medsger suggested that
inflammation must be eliminated through different kinds of
treatment, and the immune reaction must be contained.

<HEADLINE> China Installs 13.7 Million Phones This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT) installed 13.7 million new telephone
lines by the end of October, overfulling the annual target two
months ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong, Liaoning and Shanghai claimed the
most installations, each reporting more than 800,000 new telephone
subscribers, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Guangdong has more than 1.269 million new subscribers,
and Jiangsu has 1.16 million new lines.
</P>
<P>
Of the 13.7 million new subscribers, about 2.57 million were
mobile phone users. The number of mobile phone subscribers will be
increased to 18 million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
China's total public telephone exchange capacity reached 84.6
million lines by the end of October, an increase of 12.96 million
lines from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Other telecommunication services, including internet, E-mail,
digital data communications and electronic data interexchange,
jumped 70 percent in the first 10 months.
</P>
<P>
An MPT official predicted that the high-speed growth is likely
to continue in the next decade as the availability of services
tries to meet customers' demands.
</P>
<P>
MPT hopes to have 10 phones for every 100 people by the end of
the century.

<HEADLINE> Seles Retires from WTA Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- World co-number one Monica
Seles quit her opening match at the WTA Championships in New York
Tuesday due to her left shoulder injury, sending Japan's Kimiko
Date into the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Date led 5-4 after 31 minutes when Seles said she could not
continue. That gave ninth-ranked Date her first victory in five
matches against Seles and sent her into a matchup with 16-year-old
Swiss star Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
The loss by Seles likely means world co-number one Steffi Graf
will finish the year atop the WTA rankings.
</P>
<P>
Seles has struggled with a torn left shoulder muscle most of
the year and was in pain when she came to the bench after holding
serve to lead 4-3.
</P>
<P>
WTA trainer Kathleen Stroia treated Seles, putting ice upon the
sore shoulder in hopes of easing the pain enough for the
Australian Open champion to continue.
</P>
<P>
Seles returned to the court, but was far from fit. Her first
service return was muffed. Her next sailed hopelessly long. She
watched Date hit forehand winners on the next and final point,
sandwiched around a miss into the net.
</P>
<P>
Seles then lost her serve on four consecutive points and knew
the cause was lost.
</P>
<P>
A touch of irony came barely 15 minutes after Seles retired
when a ceremony was conducted honoring Date, whose plans to
retire after her final match in the tournament were postponed.
</P>
<P>
Seles fell to 48-8 for the year, suffering her first
opening-match ouster of the year. Seles also lost her prior
match, 6-2, 6-0, to Hingis in the WTA Oakland final 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
Seles won the WTA Championship in 1990, 1991 and 1992 but had
not played in the two million-dollar, season-ending event since
her last title.

VIENNA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Federal Chancellor
Franz Vranitzky said today there is no change in his position that
Austria will not join NATO.
</P>
<P>
The report carried in Die Presse (The Press) today saying that
he has changed his security policy is a misunderstanding, his
spokesman Karl Krammer quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Stressing "my security policy certainly does not change," the
prime minister was quoted as saying that it is both unreasonable
and unnecessary for Austria to enter such a military alliance as
NATO.
</P>
<P>
Austria has already taken an active part in establishing the
European Security System and has undertaken important security
missions according to U.N. resolutions, Vranitzky said.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan Sign Fuel, Energy Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan signed an
agreement Tuesday with Uzbekistan on a debt payment for fuel and
gas supplies, the Kazakhstan Telegraph Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In the agreement, signed by Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister
Dyusenbai Duisenov and Uzbek government officials in the Uzbek
capital of Tashkent, the two sides agreed on the deadline and form
of debt payment which Kazakhstan owed to Uzbekistan for gas and
other fuel supply.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed upon the further supply of gas by
Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came at a time when severe gas shortages caused
by Uzbekistan's cut in natural gas supply had drawn growing
complaints against the government of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan cut off the supply to Kazakhstan because of the
latter's failure to pay an estimated 676 million U.S. dollars in
debts.
</P>
<P>
In some regions in Kazakhstan, the gas supply has been cut for
several months, forcing the inhabitants to fell trees for cooking
and heating.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, two gas explosion accidents caused by
using industrial gas at home have killed 11 and injured dozens in
Kazakhstan.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Opera Enters Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese artists and
technicians have sent the 200-year-old Beijing Opera onto the
information highway.
</P>
<P>
The culture ministry revealed today that it has successfully
put written materials and photos about Beijing Opera on the
Internet this week, with the help of the Beijing Calmar Network
Engineering Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
This will enable computer users worldwide to enjoy and study
the traditional art through networks, said Huang Yudong, a
researcher from the Calmar company.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Opera is considered a national treasure in China -- as
famous as the Great Wall and the capital city's Summer Palace --
for its unique lyrics, recitation techniques, songs, dances,
martial arts and acrobatics. As with much of Chinese folk art, it
is experiencing a setback in today's society.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has been using various modern means,
including television and karaoke, to spread the popularity of
Beijing Opera.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the Internet is a new experiment and will
enable more people to understand the art, according to Lin
Ruikang, director of the Office for Reviving Beijing Opera of the
culture ministry.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the unpopularity of Beijing Opera in recent years
is partly a result of the introduction of high technology and new
entertainment means, which are luring away the young audience.
</P>
<P>
However, more artists who turned a blind eye to high technology
are now catching up with the trend.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that their participation in reviving Beijing Opera
is a by-product of the recent national campaign to promote the art.
</P>
<P>
However, due to technical and copyrights reasons, it is still
difficult to show a movie about Beijing Opera on the Internet, he
said.
</P>
<P>
There are some 40,000 Internet users in China by September of
this year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Can Meet APEC Free Trade Goals: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will have no problem
in meeting the trade liberalization goals of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, Coordinating Minister for
Production and Distribution Hartarto said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that except in the service sector, the liberalization
process of the Indonesian economy was in line with the free trade
goals of the 18-member economic grouping.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore have no problem in meeting APEC's liberalization
moves," he said after meeting President Soeharto who is scheduled
to leave for Manila on November 24 to attend APEC meetings there.
</P>
<P>
Hartarto said the government's series of deregulatory measures
had significantly reduced tariffs and removed non-tariff barriers
in almost all economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, as a member of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), is also committed to cutting tariffs on
manufacturing and processed agricultural products to between zero
and five percent by 2003 to meet the region's free trade
liberalization schedule.
</P>
<P>
However, Hartarto did not say what "action plans" Indonesia
would propose at the APEC leaders' meeting in the Philippines next
week.
</P>
<P>
Last year's APEC meeting in Osaka, Japan, adopted an action
plan for free trade and investment by 2010 for industrialized
economies and by 2020 for developing economies within the
grouping.
</P>
<P>
APEC members are expected to submit their individual action
plans for these goals to the meetings in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Hartarto said the senior officials' meeting, scheduled for
November 20 and 21, would discuss the individual action plans.
</P>
<P>
The APEC forum comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile,
China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan,
Thailand and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Concerned Over Situation in Belarus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The parliament of Ukraine has
expressed "deep concern" over the tense situation in its
neighboring country, Belarus.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian National Information Agency (UKRINFORM) reports
that the Ukrainian parliament advises all the factions in Belarus
to remain calm before the referendum called by Belarussian
President Alexander Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
The referendum seeks to extend Lukashenko's term by more than
two years, and widen his powers over all institutions. It has
created tension between the parliament and the president.
</P>
<P>
The referendum, which is expected to begin on November 24, has
brought about much criticism as well as a request from the
parliament for impeachment proceedings against Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
"We are strictly following the norms of non-interference in
internal affairs but are also strictly following the norms of
parliament (conduct)," said the Ukrainian parliament announcement.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the representatives of executive and legislative
authority in this friendly state to display mutual understanding
and act exclusively in a constitutional way to maintain democracy
and security in the region," it added.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian parliament also expressed its belief that the
Belarussian people would find a constitutional way to keep the
country's sovereignty and independence.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Votes on Boutros-Ghali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- One permanent member of
the United Nations' Security Council today cast a negative vote
during a secret ballot on a draft resolution recommending
incumbent Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a second
term.
</P>
<P>
The draft, which was proposed by Botswana, Egypt, China, Guinea
Bissau, Honduras, Germany, Russia, France, Indonesia and Chile,
gained 14 votes in favor.
</P>
<P>
According to a diplomatic source, the negative vote might have
been cast by the United States, which has been threatening to veto
any resolution recommending a second term for Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased with the results," Egyptian Ambassador Nabil
Elaraby told reporters. "It proved that the whole world was behind
Africa and the candidate Africa chose, which is the current
secretary-general."
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Sylvana Foa said, "The Secretary-General is
deeply gratified and fully appreciates the support of the
overwhelming majority of the U.N. membership as officially
expressed today in the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations
Ambassador Qin Huasun told reporters that the result shows that
a great majority of the member states support a second term for
Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
"We regret that the draft resolution was not adopted, and we
hope the country that cast the negative vote can reconsider its
position so that the question can be solved," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ambassador Wisnumurti Nugroho of Indonesia,
current president of the Security Council, it is agreed in the
council that African countries will continue to have the privilege
of presenting candidates to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Africans have insisted that their continent deserves two terms
of representation in the post, as has been U.N. tradition. Under
the U.N. Charter, the nomination of U.N. Secretary-General should
be recommended by the Security Council and approved by the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The candidate should gain at least nine votes in favor and the
concurrent support of the five permanent members before he or she
can be recommended to the General Assembly for approval. The five
permanent members are China, France, Russia, Britain and the
United States.

<P>
ATHENS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Greek cabinet today
approved the 1997 austerity budget designed to put Greece
definitively on track for the European Economic and Monetary Union
(EMU).
</P>
<P>
The budget includes seven new taxation measures, including
taxes on large real estate holdings, interest on state titles,
interbanks market deposits and derivatives, capital gains of
non-listed firms and an increase in taxation on banks, in an
attempt to produce the nearly 4 billion U.S. dollars needed for
convergence criteria.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after today's cabinet meeting, Greek
Prime Minister Costas Simitis said the fundamental question "which
is not exclusively economic in nature but political" was to what
extent Greece could secure its participation in the European Union
on an equal basis.
</P>
<P>
Simitis underlined that the EMU would constitute "a new center
of gravity in the world which is now being shaped" and would play
a decisive role in all issues pertaining to Greece's national
policy "and consequently Greece should participate in EMU in order
to safeguard its standing and ensure its decisive role in
developments."
</P>
<P>
The budget is expected to be presented to the parliament later
this month for debate and approval.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Physicians to Get More Facilities, Recognition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Young and middle-aged Chinese
physicians should be given much more public recognition so that
shortage of medical talent can be made up, a newspaper report
urged.
</P>
<P>
Many medical institutes in the country are lacking qualified
successors to take up leading positions for clinical work,
teaching and research, today's "China Daily" said.
</P>
<P>
In view of that, the Chinese Academy of Medical Science (CAM)
and the Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) have promised, at a
conference on training young scientific leaders Tuesday in
Beijing, to train a new generation of outstanding and highly
trained physicians in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The academies will give promising young doctors first
consideration when allocating research subsidies, facilities and
living quarters, the report said.
</P>
<P>
More opportunities will be given to young and middle-aged
physicians and researchers to let them display their knowledge
both at home and abroad, and to give them greater public
recognition as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
All hospitals and institutes affiliated with the academies will
increase investment to improve scientists' working and living
conditions, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the CAM and the PUMC have worked to identify
promising young doctors and make sure they get the attention they
deserved.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the CAM has promoted 151 young and
middle-aged medical scientists to professors; the youngest is only
28 years old.
</P>
<P>
The PUMC also has set up a special foundation for young
scientists carrying out research and organizes science forums
every two years.

RIO DE JANEIRO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign

<P>
BONN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Goran Ivanisevic beat former
world No.1 Thomas Muster 6-4, 6-4 in the ATP Tour World
Championship in Hanover, germany Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic, the winner of five titles on the ATP Tour out of
the ten finals he made this year, spent just 51 minutes on court
against the 29-year-old Austrian, the oldest man in the field.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian, 1996's King of Aces on the Tour, broke early in
the first set and followed that up in the second with a break to
move to a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
Muster, who held No. 1 in the world for six weeks earlier this
year, saved three break points in the fifth game, but his form
after fighting back in recent weeks from hip and knee problems was
not enough to beat Ivanisevic, on a high from his recent Kremlin
Cup victory.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic joins fellow white group contender Richard Krajicek
on a win each after the first day of round-robin competition.
</P>
<P>
In the second group, the red, defending World Championship
title-holder Boris Becker beat French Open champion Yvegeny
Kafelnikov 6-4, 7-5, backed by an exhuberant 12,000 strong home
crowd.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes Attacks on Its Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese representative
Zhang Fengkun here today refutes groundless attacks on China's
human rights issue by representatives of the European Union,
Australia and Canada.
</P>
<P>
When exercising the right of reply at the Third Committee
(Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) of the U.N. General Assembly,
Zhang said that no one can deny China's achievements in the field
of human rights.
</P>
<P>
While promoting economic development, the Chinese government
has strengthened building of democracy and legal system, attached
great importance to civil and political rights as well as to
economic, social and cultural rights, and made every effort to
promote and protect human rights of the Chinese people, she
stressed.
</P>
<P>
She said that everyone is equal before law, according to
China's Constitution. Anyone who breaks Chinese law should be
tried without exception. Moreover, China's Constitution stipulated
that its judiciary is independent. No organization nor individual
is entitled to interfere in judiciary. By no means another country
has the right to interfere in it. People cannot but cast doubt
about the motives of the so-called democratic countries that
attack China on this issue.
</P>
<P>
On Tibetan issue, she said that before the democratic reform in
1959, Tibet was under the rule of feudal serfdom. The serf owners
who accounted for only five percent of the population had 100
percent of the farmland, pastureland, forest and other properties.
Serfs, who were like properties owned by aristocrats, had no human
rights at all. Since the democratic reform has eradicated the
cruel feudal serfdom, Tibetan people, like the rest 55
nationalities in China, have become masters of the state. If this
change is considered disregard of human rights, eradication of
Tibetan religion and tradition, the purpose of those who advocate
the so-called human rights is to condemn Tibetan people again to
the status of serf.
</P>
<P>
She noted while ignoring domestic violations of human rights, a
very small number of Western countries, by excuse of safeguarding
human rights, try to impose their own political system and value
on the others, interfere in internal affairs of other countries
and attack and vilify the peoples and governments of developing
countries so as to change the social system and development road
of other countries.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Vows to Go Ahead with Economic, Social Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac,
who is on a five-day visit in Japan, today reaffirmed in Tokyo his
determination to carry out the structural reform of France's
financial, economic, state and social systems, even though it
would lead to a "heavy political cost".
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Japanese business association of Keidanren,
Chirac said that France was carrying out a reform of its financial
system and necessary structural economic reforms because it needed
a healthy financial system to support a strong economy.
</P>
<P>
"There is not another way, there is not another solution. One
should take upon oneself the negative reactions of public
opinion," local media quoted Chirac as saying.
</P>
<P>
The policy of social security reform, and economic and
financial restructuring, including privatization and massive
lay-offs of public employees, which was adopted by Prime Minister
Alain Juppe, has aroused widespread protests in France over the
past one year.
</P>
<P>
"France, as all its European partners, is putting its public
finances in order again and taking up necessary structural reform
to release the spirit of enterprise," said the French president.
</P>
<P>
He said that on January 1, 1999, the European Union would have
a unified and strong currency -- euro, which he said would be one
of the biggest monetary units of the world and "an inevitable
money."
</P>
<P>
The French government has been carrying on austerity social and
economic plans to cut its public deficit to below 3 percent of the
gross domestic product (GDP) by 1997, to meet the European Union's
criteria for entering the European Monetary Union by January 1,
1999.
</P>
<P>
When asked if he and Juppe could convince the French people the
correctness of their policy, Chirac said that in a democracy like
France, the public opinions didn't like many reforms, because they
would require the change of some habits.
</P>
<P>
"I will not go as far as to say that this financial cleansing
is understood by the public opinion. It is not that and this is
normal. This provokes a sort of reaction and has, for the
government, a heavy political cost," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
On the reform of France's state system, Chirac said that
France's current political system which was unfit to the present
time, and was "much too heavy, much too omnipresent and
paralyzing."
</P>
<P>
He condemned the policy of economic nationalization carried out
by former socialist president Francois Mitterrand, which he said
had led to "monstrous deficits which are finally paid by the
tax-payers."
</P>
<P>
But he said that France would not abandon its tradition of
public service in the present social and economic reform process.

<HEADLINE> WEU Takes Step to Strengthen Armaments Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ostend(Belgium), November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Council of the
Western European Union(WEU), which met here today under the
Belgian presidency, saw progress on their cooperation in arms
research and development, with the creation of the Western
European Armaments Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Council meeting, chaired by Belgian Foreign Minister Erik
Derycke, was attended by foreign and defense ministers of the ten
WEU member countries, three associated countries, five countries
with observer status and 10 associated partner countries.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting in the Belgian seaside town of Ostend, the
ministers decided to take further steps to continue the
operational development of WEU by enhancing the close military
cooperation between WEU nations in the fields of space, armaments
and multinational forces.
</P>
<P>
The ministers examined the prospects for WEU's growing links
with NATO and agreed that WEU should become actively involved in
NATO's defense planning process to improve its operational
effectiveness in WEU-led humanitarian and peacekeeping missions
using NATO assets.
</P>
<P>
They also devoted part of their one-day meeting to analyze the
crisis in Africa's troubled Great Lakes Region and showed WEU's
willingness to provide air and logistics support in the
humanitarian aid operations in Rwanda and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
WEU Secretary General Jose Cutileiro is to attend a meeting in
Stuttgart, Germany, on Thursday of countries contributing to the
Canadian-led mission to eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The WEU said it should study what help it could provide and
would act if asked to do so by EU foreign ministers, who meet in
Brussels next Monday.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said the kinds of tasks
the WEU might perform in the Great Lakes Region included providing
transport and possible mine clearing.
</P>
<P>
With setting up a joint arms and development body, whose legal
structure allows it to place armaments contracts, the WEU
ministers hoped the organization would help avoid unnecessary
duplication in producting weapons systems for NATO's European
members.
</P>
<P>
The Western European Union has existed in its present form
since 1954 and today includes ten member countries - Belgium,
France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands,
Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. Denmark, Austria, Sweden,
Finland and Ireland have observer status.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, Norway and Iceland are associated members, and
associated partners are Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Review Arms Exports Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The British government is to
set up a joint committee to examine the country's procedures for
arms exports controls amid claims that British weapons were
supplied to Rwandan Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Office said in a statement issued earlier
today that the British government "was very concerned to learn of
allegations that UK companies had been linked to the selling of
arms to Rwandan extremists in Zaire."
</P>
<P>
A British company reportedly supplied large amounts of arms and
ammunition to the Rwanda armed groups and Hutu militia during and
after the genocide of some one million people in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Some of the shipments appeared to have been designed to
circumvent a UN arms embargo imposed in May 1994 after soldiers of
the Rwanda armed groups and Hutu militia started to slaughter
Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
</P>
<P>
The British customs authorities "are urgently investigating the
background in order to establish whether any offences has been
committed under UK law," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"An inter-departmental committee has been established to
examine rigorously our procedures in relation to trafficking in
arms and to determine whether there has been a gap in our controls
and if so what action needs to be taken," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Committee will investigate if the government should have
extra powers "to prevent supply from third countries by UK
nationals and UK companies."

<HEADLINE> Shalikashvili Blames Military on Protecting Servicemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. chairman of the
joint chiefs of staff blamed the military on Tuesday that it is
not doing enough to protect its own people, which had resulted in
the killing of 19 American servicemen in a bombing in Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"Why is it that this great nation that can build B-2s and the
best submarines... has to use a highway divider to put around a
building as the most advanced, most sophisticated piece of blast
detection that our industry can produce?" Gen. John Shalikashvili
said at a force protection symposium.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military has done substantial soul-searching since the
June 25 truck bombing, which blasted the U.S. military's Khobar
Towers residential complex near Dhahran.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Perry took personal responsibility
for what he said was a "failure of leadership". And a task force
report believed that the military had not given counterterrorism
high enough priority.
</P>
<P>
Shalikashvili noted that some $1.2 million in equipment to
protect crew members goes into every M-1 tank and asked: "Why is
it that at Khobar Towers there was even a discussion about
spending a sum much less than that for putting Mylar (polyester
sheeting) on the windows to protect three or four thousand
people?"
</P>
<P>
Dealing with the terrorist threat "is a continuing
cat-and-mouse game," he said. "If we miss the opportunity... we
will have to wait for the next Khobar Towers," he added.

<HEADLINE> Plavsic, Steiner Meet on Ending Illegal Entrances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb President
Biljana Plavsic urged Tuesday the international community to help
stop forcible entrances from one entity into the other in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Following talks with deputy High Representative of
international community in Bosnia Michael Steiner in Serb city
Banja Luka, Plavsic said in all future cases of settlement in the
separation zone between the two entities, the Muslim-Croat
Federation and Republika Srpska, "the procedure in place will have
to be observed 100 percent."
</P>
<P>
About 600 Muslim refugees, some armed, entered the village of
Gajevi last week in the de-militarized Zone of Separation (ZOS)
between Serb and Muslim territory in the northeast, causing
violent incidents in which two Muslims were killed and several
Serb and Muslims were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The international High Representative Carl Bildt had to halt
the refugee return process in order to avoid further violences.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic also said that the current state commission for
exchange of war prisoners will be dismissed in order to achieve a
more efficient release of prisoners of war and civilians, Tanjug
news agency reported from Banja Luka, the largest Serb city in
northwest.
</P>
<P>
Steiner, meanwhile, told reporters in Banja Luka that in the
future those who have right to settle in the ZOS will be the
people who can prove their ownership over property in that zone
and who accept the laws of the entity to which they are returning.
</P>
<P>
An additional condition, Steiner said, is that they are not
soldiers and do not bring arms. This will be controlled by the
local police of that entity in cooperation with international
police, he added.
</P>
<P>
It will also be necessary, he said, to put an end to the
earlier practice of burning down homes of other nationalities so
as to normalize the situation in the ZOS and rebuild mutual
confidence between different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Steiner also insisted on the dismissal of current commissions
for the exchange of prisoners of war and civilians by all three
sides -- Serb, Muslim and Croat -- and their turning into
commissions for the unconditional release of all living and the
return of bodies of all dead.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senators Wield Human Rights Batons at Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. legislators have
recently urged the Clinton administration that it should brandish
human rights batons in dealing with Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Five senators on Monday demanded the Clinton administration
that it should ban investment in Burma because the Rangoon
government is not as "pro-democratic" as they required.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to White House Drug Control Policy Director Barry
McCaffrey, the senators said a U.S. law should be enforced that
calls for a ban on new investment if Burma's State Law and Order
Restoration Council(SLORC) does not act in accordance with their
human rights requirements in Burma's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"It would be an enormous step forward if, before your departure
for Southeast Asia, the administration were to announce the
administration's decision to impose a ban on new U.S. investment
in Burma. Without such an announcement, we fear your efforts to
convince the SLORC and other governments that the United States is
serious about isolating Burma will fail," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey is leaving shortly for a trip to Thailand and Laos to
discuss cooperation on anti-narcotics efforts.
</P>
<P>
Another 15 senators urged President Bill Clinton in a letter
on Monday that he should raise an issue of what they called "human
rights violations" in East Timor when he meets with Indonesian
President Suharto at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit
in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the occasion of your meeting with President
Suharto at the APEC summit offers an important opportunity" to
raise the issue, they wrote.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is to attend the APEC summit on Nov. 22 during which he
will be meeting APEC leaders including President Suharto.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes Deregulation List to Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
transmitted to the Japanese government a new list of its proposals
for deregulation in Japan, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
The list is an input into the final revision of the current
three-year Japanese deregulation program, which will be finalized
at the end of March 1997.
</P>
<P>
Some issues such as administrative reform have been included in
the list for the first time, but some others, like measures
related to natural mineral water, have been removed due to
significant progress made so far.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this, EU Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan said,
"Progress has been made in the Japanese deregulation program, in
particular in areas such as telecommunications, financial services
(with the exception of insurance), cars and foodstuffs."
</P>
<P>
He expressed "reasonable satisfaction" with the last revision
of the program at the end of this March but said that much had
still to be done.

<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of homes in Britain
are facing a night without electricity on Tuesday after strong
winds and snow brought down power lines, according to a BBC TV
report today.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that around 20,000 homes in north Wales lost
electricity in the first heavy snowfall this winter on Tuesday
morning and the huge volume of repair work means that about 1,000
will remain without power overnight.
</P>
<P>
The first severe weather of the winter also brought chaos to
many roads.
</P>
<P>
The report said that one man had died and two others were badly

<HEADLINE> EC Approves Paper for Reducing Methane Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today approved a strategy paper for reducing man-made methane
emissions in the EU countries from sources such as agriculture,
water and energy.
</P>
<P>
The initiative demonstrates the importance the EC attaches to
the implementation of policies that effectively address the issue
of global climate change, a communique issued here says.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, waste and energy account for practically all of
the EU's methane emissions, their shares being 45 percent, 32
percent and 23 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The strategy developed in the paper could secure methane
emission reductions of about 30 percent in 2005 and 40 percent in
2010. It concentrates on the reduction of organic waste, and the
use and recovery of methane as a source of energy.
</P>
<P>
Methane, CH4, is the second most important greenhouse gas and
accounts for nearly one fifth of the global greenhouse effect.
Being an active gas, it grasps heat and inhibits its release into
space increasing atmospheric and earth surface temperatures.

<HEADLINE> Waste Land for Building  New Homes Suggested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- There is enough derelict land
across England to accommodate all 4.4 million new homes expected
to be needed over the next 20 years without building in the
countryside, a newly published study says.
</P>
<P>
Half a million acres of land, an area larger than that of
Greater London, lie derelict and available for redevelopment
according to the study, carried out for British Gas Properties.
</P>
<P>
This is slightly more than is estimated to be needed for the
4.4 million new house-holds expected to be formed over the next 20
years as a result of population growth, people living longer and
the fragmentation of the family.
</P>
<P>
John Gummer, the Environment Secretary hinted recently that
about 70 percent of the new homes could be accommodated on
already-used land, the same figure as suggested by the Council for
the Protection of Rural England.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the largest amount of derelict land was
in the industrial North West of England, but even in the South
East of England, where it is scare, the amount of derelict land
had increased by 61 percent over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
British Gas Properties, which owns 3,000 sites, including l,000
heavily-contaminated former gas works, has an interest in
promoting the redevelopment and decontamination of the derelict
land.
</P>
<P>
Ralph Ellis, its managing director, said that none of the major
house builders rejected once-contaminated land once it had been
cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
British Gas Properties has found that it costs about l00,000
pounds (160,000 U.S. dollars) an acre to reclaim some of the worst
sites, but urban development land can fetch 700,000 pounds
(1120,000 U.S. dollars) an acre, so the costs can be absorbed.
</P>
<P>
"If you can build on this half-million acres safely and
carefully, why are we still moving people out there into the
green belt and the countryside? Why on earth do you want to build
4.4 million homes in the suburbs or the green belt?" he asked.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Europe's leading stock markets
surged sharply before the close and all ended on a firm note on
Tuesday, propelled by a strong Wall Street opening.
</P>
<P>
A lifeless London market was kicked into action during late
trading, on the back of Wall Street's performance, and the FTSE
100 index finished 16 points higher at 3,978.1, although traders
were still worried about next week's new budget.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that government bonds had provided some assistance
to the stock market during lackluster trading.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt ended marginally up, with the DAX-30
share index 0.25 points higher at 2,764.09. Traders said that the
market was held back by the newcomer Deutsche Telekom, Europe's
biggest phone company, which ended lower in heavy profit-taking
trading.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 share index on the Paris bourse also climbed in late
trading and closed 11.24 points higher at 2,240.05, supported by
firmer government bonds and early Wall Street rise.
</P>
<P>
Market-players said that US gains provided support for shares
to move out of negative territory.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 leading British shares ended up 16 points at
3,978.1. Frankfurt's DAX-30 index closed 0.25 points higher at
2,764.09. In Paris, the CAC-40 share index finished 11.24 points
stronger at 2,240.05.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Premier Hails Opening of Peace Canal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
al-Ganzouri said today the creation of the al-Salam (Peace)
Canal, that is to transport Nile water to the Sinai Peninsula,
will expand Egypt's agricultural map and promote its industry and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the celebrations marking President Hosni Mubarak's
inauguration of the first stage of the canal, Ganzouri said the
project has been under study since 1981 but some difficulties
delayed it for some time.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expressed the hope that Sinai will become
a part of the delta as it used to be before the digging of the
Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri stressed that Egypt respects its quota of the Nile
water and called for rationalizing water consumption in all
fields.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Hadi Radi, minister of public works and water resources,
said the Peace Canal will serve as a principal axis in the
development of the Sinai Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
He said the canal will turn the 134,000 hectares of area east
of the Suez Canal into cultivated land, which is to be
distributed among university graduates and investors.
</P>
<P>
The Peace Canal will run for 86 kilometers, starting from
Faraskour near Damiatta across the Suez Canal and extending deep
in Sinai till south of al Arish.
</P>
<P>
Work on the fourth tunnel of the siphon will be completed in
next May and water will rush across the Suez Canal to Sinai, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Peace Canal, whose construction is divided into two
stages, is to irrigate up to 260,000 hectares of land and run
through six governorates. The first stage of the project will
cover 92,000 hectares west of the canal.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed at fostering Egypt's agricultural
programs by expanding arable land to increase production, reduce
the dependence on food imports and step up export of fruits and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
It is also to make use of the agricultural waste water which
used to be dumped into the sea. The redistribution of water in
Sinai will help ease the pressure on the densely populated
areas.

OSTENDE (BELGIUM), November 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign
Minister Tansu Ciller said today that her country would block the

The Turkish foreign minister was quoted by Reuter as saying,
"Turkey will block all the support of NATO." "The WEU can do
nothing without the support of NATO," he said.

According to Reuter, a Turkish journalist who attended Ciller's

said that Ciller had said Greece did not want Turkey, an associate
member of the WEU, to participate in WEU activities such as
peacekeeping and humanitarian operations.
</P>
<P>
The WEU relies on NATO for equipment for such activities and as
a member of NATO Turkey can block this equipment form being lent.

NEW YORK, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Mattel, the world's largest
toy maker, announced Monday that it would buy Tyco Toys Inc.,
America's third largest toy company and the maker of match-box
cars.
</P>
<P>
The deal valued at 737 million U.S. dollars came nine months
after Mattel withdrew its 5.2 billion dollar offer for its
perennial rival Hashro Inc., America's second largest toy maker.
</P>
<P>
Analysts praised the deal, saying that it would give Mattel an
opportunity to increase global sales of some well-known Tyco
brands.
</P>
<P>
Based in Mount laurel, New Jersey state, Tyco's 709 million
dollars of 1995 sales plus Mattel revenue will give Mattel
worldwide sales of 4.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tyco's international sales account for about a quarter of
revenues, but about 40 percent of the Mattel business comes from
global sales.
</P>
<P>
The merger will give Mattel the makeup of a supercompany,
analysts were quoted by today's New York Times as saying.

<HEADLINE> European Parliament to Give Financial Aid to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament
intends to provide some 700 million U.S. dollars in financial aid
to the Palestinian Authority (PA), Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Klaus Hansch, president of the European
Parliament who is currently on a tour of the region, as saying
that member states of the parliament notice it is in their
interest to make this financial contribution.
</P>
<P>
However, Hansch admitted that it was not easy to convince his
colleagues to vote for it, and not for some other help for
problems such as the unemployment in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We have a complementary role which we have to play in the
interest of Europe, as well as in the interest of the region,"
said Hansch, who arrived in Israel Monday.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is "the role to make peace work by
economic and financial help to the region, mainly to the West
Bank and Gaza Strip."
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament president said his visit was aimed at
supporting those who try to go into the direction of
implementing the agreement they have already reached.
</P>
<P>
Hansch denied that Europe was trying to compete with the
U.S. as mediator in the Middle East, but did note that European
contact in the region should not be ignored by the parties in
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Following meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
today, Hansch said that he was convinced that at least the
Israeli side is ready to sign an agreement on its army's
redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Levy said that it is important that Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is to meet PA President Yasser Arafat
to reach an agreement on the Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Palestine have been blaming each other for the
delay of concluding an agreement on Hebron, following continuous
talks held in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Hansch said that he was going to meet with Palestinian
officials, including Arafat, to hear opinions on how to complete
the Hebron deal in the very near future.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Hansch addressed the Knesset (Israel's
parliament). He was scheduled to travel to the Palestinian
autonomous areas this afternoon and to address the Palestinian
Legislative Council in the West Bank town of Ramallah Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup:  Kenya Takes Steps To Revitalize Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Jinyu)
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Officials of Kenya's tourism
industry are busy with marketing and promoting the east African
country as Africa's premier tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
After participation in the just-concluded Flanders
International Tourism Trade Fair in Gent, Belgium, the Kenyan
officials went to London for the World Travel Market as part of
the efforts to revitalize its fading tourism industry which is
the main earner of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released recently, Kenya suffered a 20
percent drop in tourist arrival last year with the number of
tourists reduced from 863,000 in 1994 to 690,500 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In order to reverse the falling trend, the Kenyan government
has drawn a National Tourism Development Master Plan between 1996
and 2010.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the east African country will allocate about
2.5 billion U.S. Dollars in a quest to lure back thousands of
tourists who have abandoned the country.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Assistant Minister of Tourism and Wildlife,
Wilberforce Kisiero, told the parliament that his ministry is in
the process of implementing the newly-completed plan.
</P>
<P>
The government has also established the Kenya Tourist Board to
promote tourism in the country, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that his ministry has also put in place a
beach management program and set up a tourist police unit
to minimize crime along the beaches and enhance the
safety of tourists.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Minister for Tourism and Wildlife Darius Mbela told
local reporters yesterday that the government of Kenya has set
aside about 50 million U.S. Dollars for the rehabilitation of 556
kilometers of roads and highways leading to national parks and
game reserves.
</P>
<P>
Another 90 million U.S. Dollars will be allocated to
rehabilitate the Nairobi-Mombasa Highway to boost the country's
tourism industry, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Kenya will open tourism offices in Rome,
Italy, and host a "Kenya Day" in Moscow to market the country
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Sources of tourism industry pointed out that one of the
reasons why Kenya's tourism industry is fading is that thousands
of tourists are flocking to South Africa and abandoning their
traditional destinations like Kenya as South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Political stability in Uganda and the opening up of new
tourist facilities in Tanzania have attracted a number of
tourists from Kenya. This has contributed to the Kenya's fading
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Negative publicity abroad caused by insecurity, poor
infrastructure as well as some unsavory utterances by some
opposition leaders have played a big role in scaring away
tourists, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan member of parliament Rashid Mzee recently warned that
unless the government addresses the issue of security, poor
roads, lack of water and the power rationing, the tourism
industry would continue to suffer.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Stands Firm on "Hot Pursuit" Issue in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu said today Israel still stood firm on the
issue of "hot pursuit" in Hebron talks with the Palestinian
side.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting of the Likud caucus in the Knesset
(Parliament), Netanyahu said that Israel has been insisting on
its troop's right of entering the Palestinian-controlled areas
in Hebron after the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The hardline leader claimed that if this objective was
reached, then there would be an agreement on the long-delayed
Israeli troop withdrawal from the volatile West Bank city.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu meanwhile attacked the Palestinian Authority (PA)
for deliberately delaying the signing of the Hebron deal out of
fear that the international opinion would be back in Israel's
favor.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Likud's hawkish Minister of Science Zeev
Begin demanded that the government use the security situation as
an excuse to escape from the responsibility of carrying out the
Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Infrastructure Ariel Sharon, another Likud hawk,
repeated his proposals on Hebron redeployment, which included
Israel' maintaining military and civilian controls over the area
where 450 Jews are living among 120,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, Israel should hand over the civilian
powers to the PA municipal authority after the redeployment,
while maintaining security control over the Jewish quarter
surrounded by Palestinian residents.
</P>
<P>
Sharon said history had shown that Israel could not keep
control over the Jewish holy sites in the Palestinian self-rule
areas, Hebron in particular, unless Jews continued to live
there.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are reconvening the talks
on Hebron this evening, in hope of finalizing a deal.
</P>
<P>
The Hebron talks, which resumed after the late September
bloodshed, have failed to produce results so far despite the
intensive negotiations and the U.S. intervention.
</P>
<P>
Israel's demand on its troop's right of conducting hot
pursuit of suspected Palestinian extremists in the PA-controlled
areas remains the central dispute blocking the final agreement.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, no one doubts that Israel would eventually carry
out the redeployment in Hebron. And Israel troops in Hebron have
begun logistics preparations for the pullback, a senior Army
officer told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers have begun removing furniture from the
military government building in Hebron, a move criticized by the
Jewish settlers as being tantamount to the Army's making a
unilateral political decision.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed to Cut Costs by Closing Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The lockheed Martin
Corporation, one of the giant makers of military aircraft in the
United States, will close eight plants in four states to cut
operating costs.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made following the 9.1 billion U.S. dollar
acquisition of the Loral Corporation, the New York Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The eight plants are located in the states of Californian,
Connecticut, New York and Pennsylvania. The announcement of
closings are expected to come soon.
</P>
<P>
Still, the closings came two days after the Pentagon announced
that Lockheed and the Boeing company would compete for the
development of a new generation of jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the closings, about 1,600 positions will be
eliminated, according to a company spokesman. But even with the
cuts, the report said, the company's workfore of about 190,000
people is expected to increase because of the hiring required to
support existing projects.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Denies Grievances Against UN Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government is
content and has no grievances against U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros Ghali.
</P>
<P>
This was stated here today by government spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides, when asked to comment on consultations taking place
for the election of a new U.N. secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Cyprus government will support the
President of the island's Liberal Party Nicos Rolandis to the
position, Cassoulides said this will be done in the case the
present U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Ghali does not stand for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
Rolandis, former foreign minister, decided in June to stand
as a candidate for the position of U.N. Secretary-General after
the U.S. rejected Boutros Ghali's demand for a second term.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that both the governments of Cyprus and
Greece had expressed their desire to support Rolandis to run for
the post, provided that the present U.N. chief was not to stand
again for the post.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Cyprus believes that whoever will be
the U.N. secretary-general, the international organization will
continue its efforts for a solution to the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Make Progress Despite Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 19 (Xinhua) -- In an apparent bid to appease
frightened foreign investors, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri stressed here today that the Lebanese have made progress
in the process of rebuilding their country in spite of repeated
Israeli aggressions.
</P>
<P>
Hariri made the remarks in an address at the opening session of
the "Conference of Arab Banks and Economic Reform" in the
Lebanese capital and the conference was organized by the Arab
Banks Association.
</P>
<P>
"Our first duty is to guarantee the stability in every field
of life (in this country) and the second duty is to put an end to
the damages created by the Israeli occupation," said Hariri, the
mastermind of Lebanon's multi-billion reconstruction scheme.
</P>
<P>
"12 percent of our land is occupied by Israel and three
percent surrounding the occupied area is areas where residents
do not enjoy rights which are enjoyed by the remaining
Lebanese," Hariri underlined.
</P>
<P>
"The occupation casts its shadow upon the country in one
form or another," the prime minister said, noting that the
government is doing its best to help the residents in the
occupied enclave.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupies a 1,100-square-kilometer border strip
stretching from the Mediterranean coast to the west to the Mount
Hermon to the east.
</P>
<P>
However, Hariri said, "there is still 85 percent of the
Lebanese lands where the Lebanese people are trying to
rehabilitate the country."
</P>
<P>
During the past four years since Lebanon's reconstruction
process was launched following Hariri assumption of office, Israel
 carried out two large-scale military operations against Lebanon,
the first in July 1993 and the second in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
"But the Lebanese managed to absorb the shock and to
continue the process," the prime minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We can say that we have succeeded in these years in
developing the country, putting it on the track of
reconstruction and putting an end to the losses created by
the Israeli occupation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to continue the process until making Israel
realize that there is only one solution to the Arab-Israeli
conflict, that is, a political solution rather than a military
one.
</P>
<P>
"The political solution demands an implementation of
U.N. resolutions and an Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon,
Western Beqaa and (Syria's) Golan Heights to the borders before
June 4, 1967," the Lebanese leader said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Arrested for Physically Abusing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALME, November 19 (Xinhua) -- In a move to repair
its image, Israeli police today arrested two boder policemen
videoed beating and physically humiliating Palestinian workers
caught for illegal entry.
</P>
<P>
The two policemen, suspended from active duty Monday night
under the order of Minister of Public Security Avigdor Kahalani,
have been in detention for 40 hours pending investigation by
the Justice Ministry's special police crime unit.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Television Channel I broadcast Monday night a video
tape showing the two policemen punching, kicking and humiliating
a group of Palestinian workers caught for illegally entry. The
video was shot by a Palestinian who happened to be near
the scene at the Aram junction in northern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The footage showed one of the policemen sitting on the head of
one Palestinian and forcing him to do push-ups. Another
Palestinian man was seen approaching the border policemen trying
to ask why they are abusing the workers and he himself was also
beaten up by the two soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The video caused an outcry from the general public, especially
from Palestinian rights organizations which charged the police
with abusing the Palestinians' rights. They said that Israeli
border police were apparently trying to discouraging Palestinians
from entering Israel illegally by means of violence.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani condemned the violence by the two policemen, whom he
immediately ordered to be suspended from active duty, but he
denied the accusation that such acts were common among the border
police.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu today
made it clear that such acts by the policemen were intolerable,
promising that they would be put on trial. "We cannot accept
such people in our security apparatus ... They have no place
in it," Netanyahu told Israel Television.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, three other Israeli border
policemen were remanded today for physically abusing eight
Palestinian workers caught near Qalqiya over the weekend. Three
of the Palestinian workers were hospitalized after being beaten
up by the policemen.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Former Irish Prime Minister
Albert Reynolds has won his libel case against the Sunday Times,
but failed to claim any damages.
</P>
<P>
A London High Court jury ruled earlier today that the
allegation complained of by the 64-year-old former Irish
government leader was not "in substance true."
</P>
<P>
But the jury decided that neither journalist Alan Ruddock nor
Sunday Times editor John Witherow had acted maliciously in
publishing the story.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Reynolds would have to pay the legal costs
which would exceed 1 million pounds (1.6 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Reynolds has sued over a Sunday Times report in November 1994,
which alleged that Reynolds had misled the Dail (Irish parliament)
and lied to his cabinet colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Reynolds denied deceiving the Irish parliament and some of his
colleagues, saying that it was a "horrible, vilifying article
which it was unnecessary to write."

<HEADLINE> Kenya Determined To Revitalize Tourism Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Jinyu)
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Officials of Kenya's tourism
industry are busy with marketing and promoting the east African
country as Africa's premier tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
After participation in the just-concluded Flanders
International Tourism Trade Fair in Gent, Belgium, the Kenyan
officials went to London for the World Travel Market as part of
the efforts to revitalize its fading tourism industry which is
the main earner of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released recently, Kenya suffered a 20
percent drop in tourist arrival last year with the number of
tourists reduced from 863,000 in 1994 to 690,500 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In order to reverse the falling trend, the Kenyan government
has drawn a National Tourism Development Master Plan between 1996
and 2010.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the east African country will allocate about
2.5 billion U.S. Dollars in a quest to lure back thousands of
tourists who have abandoned the country.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Assistant Minister of Tourism and Wildlife,
Wilberforce Kisiero, told the parliament that his ministry is in
the process of implementing the newly-completed plan.
</P>
<P>
The government has also established the Kenya Tourist Board to
promote tourism in the country, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that his ministry has also put in place a
beach management program and set up a tourist police unit
to minimize crime along the beaches and enhance the
safety of tourists.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Minister for Tourism and Wildlife Darius Mbela told
local reporters yesterday that the government of Kenya has set
aside about 50 million U.S. Dollars for the rehabilitation of 556
kilometers of roads and highways leading to national parks and
game reserves.
</P>
<P>
Another 90 million U.S. Dollars will be allocated to
rehabilitate the Nairobi-Mombasa Highway to boost the country's
tourism industry, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Kenya will open tourism offices in Rome,
Italy, and host a "Kenya Day" in Moscow to market the country
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Sources of tourism industry pointed out that one of the
reasons why Kenya's tourism industry is fading is that thousands
of tourists are flocking to South Africa and abandoning their
traditional destinations like Kenya as South Africa, which for
a long time was shunned by the international community because
of its racist policies, has opened up since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Political stability in Uganda and the opening up of new
tourist facilities in Tanzania have attracted a number of
tourists from Kenya. This has contributed to the Kenya's fading
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Negative publicity abroad caused by insecurity, poor
infrastructure as well as some unsavory utterances by some
opposition leaders have played a big role in scaring away
tourists, they noted.
</P>

unless the government addresses the issue of security, poor
roads, lack of water and the power rationing, the tourism
industry would continue to suffer.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A national "Don't Do Crime"
campaign was launched here today by South African President Nelson
Mandela to instill an anti-crime culture across the country.
</P>
<P>
The high profile launch, hosted by the South African
Broadcasting Corporation, was attended by senior government
officials, including Gauteng Premier Tokyo Sexwale, and high

values need enhancing to repair damage to the fabric of society
torn by apartheid."
</P>
<P>
The campaign, which would strive to get communities to create
an environment hostile to crime and criminals, involved a hard
hitting media campaign to give high profile on buses, taxis and
cars to the slogan "Don't Do Crime".
</P>
<P>
The campaign has already won wide support from the Gauteng
provincial legislature, the South African Police Service, the South
African Council of Churches, the local government structures, Business
Against Crime, and a cross-spectrum of political organizations.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Israeli Confesses to Spying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said today that an Israeli recently detained here has confessed
to espionage in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"Israel denies it has any relations with him but the spy
confessed everything," the president told reporters following the
inauguration of the first stage of the al-Salam Canal in Ismalia,
a city on the western bank of the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
Investigations will finally reveal which country he is serving,
Mubarak said. "We will not leave the issue without identifying who
this spy is dealing with and for which country."
</P>
<P>
Azam Azam, of Arab origin, worked as a mechanic at the
Egyptian-Israeli Tefron textile factory in Cairo. He was held
earlier this month on suspicion of recruiting an Egyptian to spy
for Israel's Mossad secret service.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Egyptian Supreme State Security Prosecution
ordered Azam be remanded in custody for 45 more days for further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer of the Israeli Embassy had offered up to 100,000
Egyptian pounds to bail the accused out but the prosecution turned
down the offer.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Azam insisted on his innocence. Israel has repeatedly
denied that Azam is a spy and has demanded his release.
</P>
<P>
His arrest has strained the already-sour relations between Egypt
and Israel, which insists Azam is not a spy and should be set free.
</P>
<P>
Azam will stand for trial at the Supreme State Security Court
after the prosecutors lodge an indictment against him and the
Egyptian, Emad Eddin Abdul Hamid, this week.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak told an Israeli newspaper Thursday that the Egyptian
had admitted selling information to Azam, who had been caught in
Cairo with invisible ink and other unspecified items.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli consul, accompanied by a lawyer appointed by the
Israeli Embassy, visited the 35-year-old man Sunday. The accused
said he was well-treated by prison warders.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to establish diplomatic
relations with Israel. But the two countries were time and
again at loggerheads, especially over the Israeli intransigence in
its talks with the Palestinians and its nuclear weaponry.

WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Space shuttle Columbia took
off this afternoon for a 16-day astronomy and technology
development mission with a record-setting 61-year-old astronaut.
</P>
<P>
Delayed 11 days by bad weather and concerns over booster
rockets, Columbia blasted off into clear sky from Kennedy Space
Center several minutes after 2:53 p.m. EST, the schedule time for
today's launch.

Musgrave also will be the first to fly on all five of NASA's

flight, blasting off on the shuttle Challenger's maiden voyage in
1983 and taking part in the shuttle program's first space-walk.
</P>
<P>
Not just an accomplished pilot and an experienced astronaut,
Musgrave also found time to pick up two undergraduate degrees,
three master's degrees, one doctorate and he will earn two more
master's degrees next year in psychology and history.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts will release and then retrieve 14 days later an
ultraviolet telescope in the orbit to observe newborn and dying
stars, the moon's atmosphere, and the northern and southern lights
on Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts also will deploy a saucer-shaped spacecraft for
three to four days of free flight. Scientists will try to grow
extremely thin semiconductor film on the satellite.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts also will conduct medical experiments and two
astronauts will space-walk to test new tools the future
international space station.
</P>
<P>
The flight will be the first under the new shuttle operations
program. NASA on October 1 began turning over day-to-day shuttle
operations to United Space Alliance, a joint venture of Rockwell
International Corp. and Lockheed Martin Corp.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scales Down Relief Mission in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
dramatically scale down the size and scope of its contribution to
an international relief mission in the Central Africa, Defense
Secretary William Perry said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Perry, speaking at a technology conference, said the "very
positive development" of hundreds of thousands of refugees
returning home to Rwanda has prompted the administration to change
its strategy.
</P>
<P>
"We are modifying our plans based on this dramatic change," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Washington is now planning to send fewer than 1,000 support
troops to the Central Africa, and would base its operation in
Rwanda, rather than Zaire, Perry said.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the Canadian-led humanitarian operation, which
still requires U.N. Security council authorization, would be "to
facilitate the voluntary, orderly repatriation of refugees by the
U.N. high Commissioner for Refugees," he said.
</P>
<P>
Airlift control teams have been sent to three airfields in
Africa to help provide assistance for the repatriation effort,
Perry said. the three airfields are in Mombasa, Kenya; Kigali,
Rwanda and Entebbe, Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Details of the operation are expected to be resolved at a
meeting in Stuttgart, Germany, scheduled for Thursday, Perry said.
</P>
<P>
But the situation in Africa "still remains very fluid" and the
Clinton administration stands ready to step up its efforts if
needed, Perry said.
</P>
<P>
The United States also announced on Monday that it plans to
provide $140 million for the relief effort.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Invests $700,000 in Liberia's Air Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) is investing 700,000 US Dollars in a mobile
traffic control tower to revive Liberia's ailing air links to the
rest of the world, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a UNDP statement as saying that the tower,
which is scheduled to arrive in Monrovia at the end of this
month, is equipped with basic communications and meteorological
instruments vital for air traffic control as well as a generator
to make the unit self-contained.
</P>
<P>
The statement said an official of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAC) is already in Liberia to receive and
commission the mobile tower.
</P>
<P>
Seven years of civil war has devastated Liberia's airports,
culminating in a series of take-off and landing accidents at the
country's only operational airport, James Spriggs Payne.
</P>
<P>
Factional fightings in Monrovia last April seriously damaged
the James Spriggs Payne Airport, where the air control tower
was destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Release Detained Dissidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is soon
to release several dissidents now being detained, including noted
human rights activists and journalists, the official News Agency
of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a source close to the military government as
saying in Abuja, the national capital, that Lagos-based lawyers
Chief Gani Fawehinmi and Femi Falana are among those being
considered.
</P>
<P>
Femi Aborishade, a journalist and member of the National
Conscience Party, is also likely to regain his freedom, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Fawehinmi has been in detention since January 30, and
Falana and Aborishade since February 14. Nigeria has been under
pressure from the west for the release of them.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the release could be a goodwill gesture
from the Nigerian government as a Commonwealth group is now in
Abuja to assess its human rights situation and the possibility of
resuming Nigeria's Commonwealth membership.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth suspended Nigeria's membership in November
last year after it convicted and hanged nine Ogoni activists.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian newspapers reported today that the government has
released 20 dissidents in the past months, in line with
recommendations of the United Nations (UN) Fact-finding Mission
which investigated Nigeria's human rights situation in April.
