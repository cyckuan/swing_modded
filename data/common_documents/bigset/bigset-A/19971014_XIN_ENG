<HEADLINE> Overseas Investors Looking At Three Gorges Area (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A large commercial mission from
the Paris Chamber of Industry and Commerce today left Beijing for
the Three Gorges Reservoir Area to sign a letter of intent for a
series of projects.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Germany's Song International Trade Company
Ltd. arrived in Beijing several days ago after an inspection tour
of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area and signed an agreement with
China in preparation for funding building materials businesses and
small hydro-electric power stations that will involve 500 million
yuan in investment.
</P>
<P>
The German company has won a bid on another water control
project being built at Xiaolangdi on the Yellow River in Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, an official with the State Council
Three Gorges Project Construction Committee's Bureau of
Resettlement and Development said that, in the past year, large
companies and financial organizations from Germany, France,
Britain, and other countries have shown interest in investing in
infrastructure projects in the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
The Resettlement and Development Bureau has been increasing
efforts to publicize the Three Gorges resettlement principle of
development projects with the idea of getting more funds from
overseas.

<P>
The Three Gorges area begins in the Chongqing municipality and
ends at Yichang in Hubei province. The Three Gorges Project has
attracted worldwide attention partly because of the large number
of residents to be relocated.
</P>
<P>
To make a success of the resettlement work, the Chinese
government worked out policies to encourage people overseas to
invest in the Three Gorges Reservoir area. The State Council Three
Gorges Construction Committee held a special meeting in Beijing
last December to explain resettlement and economic development
there.
</P>
<P>
This year, two economic and technological co-operation tours
have been organized by the committee to brief foreigners on the
project, and an American company is preparing a site for growing
improved varieties of oranges, providing technical training, and
processing fruit juice in Chongqing with an 80 million U.S.-dollar
investment.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government is talking of a sewage treatment project
in Dazu on the upper reaches of the reservoir with 3.9 million
U.S. dollars in loans.
</P>
<P>
A number of infrastructure projects like an airport in Yichang,
an expressway from Wuhan to Yichang, and a number of small
hydro-electric and thermal power stations have been completed, and
automatic switchboards and direct domestic and international
dialing systems have been put into service in 21 counties and
cities of the Three Gorges Reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
Governments in the reservoir area have also simplified approval
procedures of foreign-funded projects, and have worked out
preferential policies to encourage foreign investment. A group of
economic and technological development zones have also been
established in the region.
</P>
<P>
The advantageous investment conditions are attracting more
overseas companies. New Zealand's MIL Company is considering
investing in three expressways there, and another New Zealand
company is showing an interest in the second phase project of the
Yichang Thermal Power Plant and Jiangkou Hydropower Station in
Chongqing.

CAIRO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen today
attacked Egypt's policemen in patrols in southern Egypt, killing
eight policemen and three civilians, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The assailants opened fire on policemen in two separate attacks
at Mawawi and Abu Korkas in Minya, about 230 kilometers south of
Cairo, MENA quoted a source of the Interior Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen escaped and there is no immediate claim of
responsibility for the attack, which is the bloodiest against the
security forces this year.
</P>
<P>
Investigations into the killings are under way. Minya, the
Upper Egyptian governorate, is notorious for frequent terrorism in
the past five years,
</P>

In the latest terrorist attack in Minya, suspected Muslim
militants beheaded a policeman and shot dead a farmer in two
separate attacks on September 30.
</P>
<P>
The latest deaths brought to 1,255 the number of people killed
by Muslim extremists since they launched an anti-government campaign

<HEADLINE> Somali Street Children Given Means to Earn Bread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- It has been a delightful
week for the shoe-shines in the Somali capital Mogadishu this
week.
</P>
<P>
About a hundred boxes, hundreds of brushes, wax and other
shoe-shine polishes have been distributed to nearly a hundred
street children in Mogadishu by Elman Peace Foundation Center
(EPFC),a local peace promoting agency.
</P>
<P>
According to Sudan Ali Ahmed, director of the center, the
children were summoned from the streets for the distribution of
these materials. "No Begging, Yes Work" were printed on top of
the small boxes that were distributed to the children whose age
varied between 9 and 15.
</P>
<P>
During the distribution which continued for two consecutive
days, Ahmed told Xinhua that the distribution of these materials
were just a part of their yearly activities for supporting the
abandoned and orphaned children in the streets of the capital so
as to create some easy jobs for them in which they can earn their
daily lives.
</P>
<P>
Abdirizak Ali Osman, a 13-year-old boy, told Xinhua that he's
confident that he will be able to earn his daily bread with the
box he's given. Osman whose face shone with happiness after
receiving the box and wax said, he's all alone with no parents,
brothers or sisters.
</P>
<P>
"The last of my family was my father who never returned back
after leaving home during the height of the civil war six years
back," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the distribution ceremony which was also attended by
officers from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and
representatives from other 23 local humanitarian agencies, EPFC
officers led the people to four other places where it runs other
vital projects including a large school in which 1,200 students
are taught first aid, mechanic, automobile driving, typing and
other basic knowledge such as arithmetic and English for the
daily use.
</P>
<P>
About 100 former militiamen demobilized and trained by EPFC
are also operating six big electric generators which give
electricity to residential areas in major parts of Hodon, Bulo
Hubey and Zone-K of South Mogadishu. These militiamen live on the
revenue they collect from these generators are now on the
self-sustenance stage.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed, brother of late Elman Ali Ahmed (Somalia's peace
activist killed by Somali gunmen in south Mogadishu in March
1996), also pledged the activities of his late brother will never
die.
</P>
<P>
He said he will continue the peace campaign by teaching and
demobilizing armed militiamen.

<HEADLINE> Thai Woman Lifter Breaks World record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 13 (xinhua) -- Thailand's Suta Khassaraporn
broke a clean and jerk world record in the women's weightlifting
59-kg division on the third day of the Southeast Asian Games on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Suta lifted 125 kilograms to beat the previous mark of 124
kilograms set by Xiu Xiongying of China in Warsaw, Poland, last
year.
</P>
<P>
She already had the overall gold medal secured when her coach
told her to attack the world record.
</P>
<P>
Suta successfully lifted 92.5 kg in the snatch and her 122.5
kilograms in her second lift of the clean and jerk equaled her
previous best and put her far ahead of her rivals.
</P>
<P>
Her total lifting of 217.5 kilograms also broke the SEA Games
record of 210 kg.
</P>
<P>
"I never imagined I would break the world record before but I
always try to do my best," Suta said. "I've been lifting well in
training, from 125 to 127."
</P>
<P>
Her coach, Chang Mei Han, won three world titles in the 85
kilogram and over class for China from 1987-89.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee decided this year to
include women weightlifters in the games for the first time in
Sydney in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"I want to take part in the Olympics once in my life," Suta
said. "I haven't been focusing on the Olympics, but if I get there
I will just try my hardest again."

<HEADLINE> Africa Needs Trained Army Forces, Says S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Although the threat of global
nuclear war has receded, there still remains a number of
potentially explosive situations that could erupt and threaten
world peace, visiting South African Defence Minister Joe Modise
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Modise said it is such potentially explosive situations that
make it increasingly important for the Southern African region to
train its respective forces in specialised peacekeeping and peace
support operations.
</P>
<P>
The South African minister was opening a two-week long
peacekeeping course at Zimbabwe's army headquarters in Harare
being attended by military officers from Zimbabwe, Namibia,
Botswana, Malawi, Lesotho, South Africa, Tanzania, Mauritius and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, he noted, the threat to peace mainfested itself in
the form of unemployment, poverty, hunger and disease, lack of
democratic cultures in some countries, the burden of refugees,
drug smuggling and inter-ethnic or religious conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He said: ''Any one, or a combination of these threats to
stability, could spill over borders and require some form of
military intervention in the shape of peacekeeping.''
</P>
<P>
The instabilities highlighted made it mandatory for the region
to be prepared as it might be requested to participate in
peacekeeping operations by the OAU and the U.N., he said.
</P>
<P>
Joint peace support exercise like exercise Blue Hungwe hosted
by Zimbabwe this year helped strengthen the region's capacity to
respond to such operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said: ''We have a need, therefore, for more
modern weaponry, especially for land, sea and air operations
particularly where a peace support requirement arises which
demands a conventional warfare.''

<HEADLINE> NASA Postpones Saturn Probe Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) today decided to delay
the launch of its Saturn probe, Cassini, due to strong wind and
technical problems.
</P>
<P>
NASA said that it would try again to launch the craft, powered
by 72 pounds of highly radioactive plutonium no earlier than
Wednesday in Cape Canaveral, Florida.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled launch of the Titan 4-B rocket holding the
Cassini spacecraft was pushed back first by technical trouble,
then by stiff wind at high altitudes and other difficulties,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
As the countdown dragged on, a computer problem cropped up with
Cassini and NASA called everything off.
</P>
<P>
Cassini's destination, eventually, is the ringed planet Saturn.
The trip, by way of Venus, Earth and Jupiter for gravity-assisted
speed, will take seven years and cover 3.52 billion km.
</P>
<P>
The entire mission, NASA's largest, most expensive
interplanetary probe ever, will last 11 years and cost 3.4 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
As the craft carries the most plutonium ever, anti-nuclear
activists feared that a launch accident would cause the
carcinogenic plutonium to rain down.
</P>
<P>
Cassini will swoop within 900 km of Earth after having swung
past Venus twice. The spacecraft won't reach Saturn until 2004;
the plutonium is needed to power all the instruments so far from
the sun.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Energy Department and NASA had 34 radiation-monitoring
teams stationed throughout the region to prove that residents were
in no danger in case the rocket exploded.

<HEADLINE> Besieged Tobacco Leads to $32 Billion Merger Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain's B.A.T. Industries,
the world's second largest cigarette manufacturer, is discussing
with Zurich Group for a 32 billion U.S. dollar merger to get rid
of its burdensome link with the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
B.A.T. has decided to let the tobacco portion to survive on its
own and fold the U.S. and British insurance companies into the
financial businesses owned by Zurich Group, the New York Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
There has been relentless litigation over smoking deaths in the
United States and the dispute might be settled in payment of 368
billion dollars over 25 years by the U.S. tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
The stock price of B.A.T., whose tobacco fame concedes only to
the world top cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris companies of
the U.S., has failed to reflect normal valuations for insurance
and financial services companies, its officials complained.
</P>
<P>
The merger plan, acknowledged by relevant parties, may allow
Zurich Group to own 55 percent stake and B.A.T the rest. With a
combined market value of 32 billion dollars, it will be one of the
world's biggest mergers so far, the Times said.

<HEADLINE> Aid for Victims of Terrorism in Egypt Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri has decided to issue an urgent financial aid to the
families of the victims killed in the bloodiest attacks against
the police this year, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 Egyptian Pounds (about 885 U.S. dollars) will be
given to each family of the 11 people killed in two separate
terrorist attacks today in Minya, about 230 kilometers south of
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who communicated the decision by telephone
to Minya governorate Moustafa Abdel Qader, also asked him to put
up marquees at the government's expense to receive people who will
call on the families of the victims to offer condolences.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified gunmen opened fire on policemen in patrols at
Malawi and Abu Korkas in stations in Minya, killing eight
policemen and three civilians and wounding one woman, according to
an Interior Ministry source.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen escaped and there is no immediate claim of
responsibility for the attack, which is bloodiest against the
security forces this year.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear so far if the two attacks, taking place within
30 minutes, were coordinated and carried out by the same group of
gunmen. Minya Security authorities began investigations into the
killings.
</P>
<P>
Minya, the Upper Egyptian governorate, is notorious for
frequent terrorist attacks in the past five years that targeted
the security forces.
</P>
<P>
In the latest terrorist attack in Minya, suspected Muslim
militants beheaded a policeman and shot dead a farmer in
two separate attacks on September 30.
</P>
<P>
The latest deaths brought to 1,255 the number of people killed
in Egypt since Muslim extremists began an anti-government campaign
in March 1992.
</P>
<P>
The government had declared victory in its five-year war
against Islamic militants just before September 18 when a German
tourist bus was blasted in downtown Cairo, which is believed to
upset the purported image of Egypt as a safe tourist heaven.

<HEADLINE> Syndicate Smuggles Sugar into Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- An international sugar
syndicate is flooding Kenya with untaxed sugar, denying the
government millions of shillings in revenue in a complex import
and export sugar racket, local sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The group with bases in Dubai, Mombasa, London and Nairobi
operates from fictitious clearing houses using offshore sugar
plants to rip the country of tax revenue while making in return
billions of tax-free money in sugar sales, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Upwards of some 30,000 tons of illegal sugar are imported into
Kenya every two weeks and are sneaked through the customs as
"goods on transit" to the Preferential Taxation Area (PTA) member
countries.
</P>
<P>
Some of the sugar is recorded from the transit points as
"industrial wares" from donor countries while others are merely
marked "on transit" to PTA countries as agricultural produce and
spares.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Kenya Revenue Authority and the Kenya Sugar
Authority have been cowed by the sugar barons who claim to have
"state immunity".
</P>
<P>
The sugar barons have even gone ahead to dupe the PTA by
setting up an offshore "sugar factory", where tons of the
imported sugar from Brazil and Europe are stocked before they are
shipped into Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The offshore sugar company has been set up just to defraud the
government and hoodwink inspectors to avoid paying duty levied on
non-PTA members. PTA has its preferential rates paid on
commodities imported from members states.
</P>
<P>
From January to August, the Kenyan government lost a colossal
sum of money through the importation of over 11,000 tons of sugar
into the country, said the sources.

<HEADLINE> New Development Corridors Planned in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe plans to have more
development corridors linking it with South Africa and the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Industry and Commerce Minister
Nathan Shamuyarira said today.
</P>
<P>
The corridors, which are transport and communications
passageways supposed to be incubators for economic development,
are in addition to the Beira Development Corridor between
Zimbabwe and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The minister told participants to a one-day workshop on
Zimbabwe-Japan economic relations that the Zimbabwean government
is also looking at the Beitbridge-Gwanda-Bulawayo Corridor to
increase cooperation with South Africa on mining in the Limpopo
Valley and in tourism.
</P>
<P>
The third corridor from Harare to the Democratic Republic of
Congo through Zambia would be used to mobilize resources from in
and outside the country.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are looking at a corridor that will have lines of
communication like railway lines, road and telecommunications
alongside tourism and mining."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are inviting Japanese companies and entrepreneurs
to join us in our country's industrialization." Zimbabwe has two
Japanese companies currently involved in the country's motor
industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the southern African area, with a population of 175
million people, is a new growth area to which the Japanese should
respond and support.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian Government Submits 1998 Fiscal Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 13 (Xinhua)--The Norwegian government
submitted today to the parliament a tight budget proposal for 1998
in an effort to dampen the continued strong growth in the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian economy is in its fifth consecutive year of
steady growth. Mainland GDP, which excludes the petroleum and
shipping sector, accounts for about 85 percent of the total GDP
and is estimated to grow by 3.5 percent this year and 3 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The total GDP is estimated to grow by 3.9 percent in 1997 and
4.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The growth is broadly based, with private consumption and
investment as the main driving forces. The export growth will
remain strong. Unemployment is estimated at 4.2 percent in 1997
and 3.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Expenditure will grow by 1 percent in real terms from 1997 to
1998. The growth in expenditure is mainly caused by increased
investments in the provision of care for the aged and of health
services.
</P>
<P>
The government also proposes to increase the allocation of
funds for priority areas like the primary school reform, child
care and foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian monetary policy will continue to be oriented
towards maintaining a stable krone exchange rate against European
currencies.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UK Economy Back on More Balanced Path </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain's economy has been back
on a more balanced and sustainable path as the latest balance of
payments figures revealed healthy surplus on the current account
in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The second quarter's current account surplus of 0.9 billion
pounds (1.44 billion US dollars) was much larger than expected,
although smaller than the first quarter's surplus of 1.5 billion
pounds (2.4 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Over the Summer months, there has been a concern of a gap
between the strong consumer spending and the sluggish industrial
activities in Britain.
</P>
<P>
However, apart from the healthy balance of payment, the last
few weeks have seen some positive signs that the gap is starting
to narrow, and Britain's economy is back on a more balanced and
sustainable path.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, the manufacturing sector looked in clear danger
of dipping back into recession, with the official figures
revealing a small fall in output in second quarter and another
fall in the third quarter looking a real possibility.
</P>
<P>
However, manufacturing output is now estimated to have grown by
0.6 percent over the last three months and by around 2 percent
compared to a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The prospects for the manufacturing sector going forward have
been improved by the slip in the exchange rate over the last
several months prompted initially by the Bank of England's hints
that interest rates are on hold for a while.
</P>
<P>
At the same time as the danger of recession in industry appears
to have eased, there have been hints that the consumer sector is
starting to lose a little heat.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey from the Bank of England and MORI suggested
that the majority of windfall-induced spending may now have taken
place, with about 5 billion pounds (8 billion US dollars) of the
payouts having been spent by August.
</P>
<P>
There are also tentative signs that the recent base rate hikes
may be starting to have an impact. In particular, the housing
market recovery may now be starting to show the strain of the
recent increases in mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Bank of England reveal that the total number
of net new mortgage commitments fell to 103,000 in August, the
lowest level since March.
</P>
<P>
However, financial experts here believe that for the time
being, the consumer sector has enough momentum to ensure that any
slowdown is too little and too late to prevent interest rates from
rising again over the next month or two.
</P>
<P>
While Britain's economy is now on its way to the balance, the
strong sterling in foreign exchange markets remains a headache for
its economy.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that even after its recent fall, the
pound is up by nearly 20 percent in a year suggests that it must
now be over-valued.
</P>
<P>
They warn that the current level, if sustained, will do great
damage to British industry, possibly even bringing another
recession.

Pakistan air force. They are now serving in the Pakistan air
force.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 4,000 Diamond Miners Banned in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Over 4,000 small-scale miners
in northwest Tanzania's Shinyanga District, have been ordered to
stop mining diamond at Maganzo Village.
</P>
<P>
The miners, who were accused of causing serious environmental
destruction to the village's arable land since last year, have been
ordered to stop mining activities immediately and cover all pits in
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The ban, effective last Saturday, was given by the Shinyanga
District Commissioner, Simon Massaga, Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The district commissioner said that unlicensed miners have illegally
excavated over 10,000 mining pits at the village which are likely to
become breeding grounds of communicable diseases such as cholera and
dysentery in the coming rainy season.
</P>
<P>
Messaga told the newspaper that over 90 percent of the estimated
5,000 hectares of the village farmland have been destroyed by the
miners who came from various areas.
</P>
<P>
As a result, over 2,000 families have been made landless and the
villagers are likely to experience hunger next year, he said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Air Botswana, the national
airline in Botswana, made a profit for the first time this year since
its inception in 1981, reporting 3.020 billion Pula (808 million U.S.
Dollars) for the year to March 31, according to sources reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
"It's a modest one at this stage, but it shows that we have turned
the corner," Air Botswana General Manager Joshua Galeforolwe said.
</P>
<P>
Air Botswana recorded a loss of 18.655 billion Pula (4.96 billion
dollars) in 1993. Losses dropped steadily to 1.875 billion Pula (499
million dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Galeforolwe attributes the recovery to "restructuring,recapitalization
and rationalization".
</P>
<P>
Air Botswana owns two aircraft and leases a third. The core route
remains between Gaborone, the capital of Botswana, and Johannesburg,
a commercial and trade center in South Africa, and customers are
mainly business people.
</P>
<P>
These passengers are "high yield, less price sensitive and
non-seasonal", Galeforolwe said. The airline is now targeting state
officials to get them out of cars and on to planes, he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Slackens Security Ties With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Deputy Prime
Minister Jawad Anani said today that Jordan had slackened its
security cooperation with Israel over the Mashaal affair.
</P>
<P>
Anani said in an interview with Israel Radio that security
staff in Israeli Embassy in Amman had been decreased at Jordan's
request following the assassination attempt of Khaled Mashaal, a
Hamas leader in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the number of security staff in the Israeli Embassy
has decreased as a result of that thing. So this is the indicator
of the slackening of security cooperation in that area," he said.
</P>
<P>
Three agents of Mossad, Israeli intelligence service, attempted
on September 25 to kill Mashaal outside his Amman office. But the
operation failed and two of the agents were arrested by the
Jordanian police and confessed their identities.
</P>
<P>
Anani accused Israel of violating the peace treaty signed in
1994 between the two countries, stressing that Jordan was angered
by the Israeli move which he said infringed the kingdom's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
But he expressed belief that despite the Mashaal affair, the
bilateral relations would return to normal. He disclosed that
Jordan had received Israel's assurances that such incident would
never occur again.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Anani slammed Israel for its hesitation in
implementing the peace treaty, including blocking Jordan's trade
with the Palestinian National Authority, delaying the construction
of a joint airport in the Red Sea port city of Aqaba and joint
development of the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
To mend the bilateral ties, Israeli cabinet decided on Sunday
to accelerate the negotiation pace of the construction of the
Aqaba airport.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said
today that he expected to visit Jordan shortly in a bid to amend
the ties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in the Knesset (Parliament), Mordechai
praised King Hussein and Jordanian government for promoting peace
with Israel, adding that he was optimistic about the resumption of
full security cooperation with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"I think Jordan and Israel have highly intention to continue
the peace. I'm looking forward, in a very short time, to visit
Jordan to continue negotiation and cooperation on all security
subjects," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 13 (Xinhua) - British Prime Minister Tony Blair
met Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams today, the first encounter
between a British prime minister and Irish Republican leader since
1921, according to reports from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Blair's decision to meet Adams has drawn fierce criticism from
Northern Irish Protestant leaders and political opponents in
London.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist Party leader, expressed pity
for a prime minister to meet the head of "a terrorist
organization" that had killed so many British soldiers, policement
and civilians and had still not forsworn violence.
</P>
<P>
Tony Blair defended his meeting with Adams by saying that
"genuine progress" was being made towards a lasting political
settlement.
</P>
<P>
All parties in the peace talks had a "great degree of common
ground", he added.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the meeting, Adams said he hoped the
Northern Ireland peace process would lead to a united Ireland.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that Tony Blair would be the last British Prime
Minister with jurisdiction over the province.
</P>
<P>
The Sinn Fein leader hailed the meeting as "the best
opportunity for peace and to bring about justice and freedom".
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein was granted entry to the talks for the first time
last Tuesday when they resumed after a Summer recess because the
IRA had called a ceasefire.

ATHENS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 5.5 on
the richter scale shocked the Greek capital this afternoon, but no
damages have been reported.

the Athens Seismological Institute and the Geophysics Laboratory

<P>
Seismologists advised local residents to evacuate their older
homes for the next 48 hours as a precaution because they were not
sure whether today's quake was the precursor to a stronger one.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Goes On in S. Leone Despite Call for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Fighting continued today in Sierra
Leone between the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) and
soldiers loyal to the military junta despite plans to resume talks on
resolving crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
While attacking an ECOMOG military base near the capital Freetown
in the past three days, the junta took similar actions against ECOMOG
bases in the southeast towns of Bo and Kenema, the British
Broadcasting Corporation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The junta troops started in the early hours of Saturday to attack
an ECOMOG base in a town several miles from Bo, the second largest
city of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Fighting went on through Saturday and Sunday, and again this
morning, with intermittent firing and heavy explosions.
</P>
<P>
Around 11:00 this morning, a Nigerian jet flew over and dropped
three or four bombs at the junta soldiers.
</P>
<P>
However, each time the soldiers launched attack over the past three
days, they had been driven off and the base has still in the hand of
ECOMOG, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a number of ECOMOG positions in this area
are believed to be small, probably around 300 and may be supported by
the Kamajors, a group of traditional hunters fighting to restore
ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Total casualty of the junta soldiers is not yet known but the
report said six dead bodies have so far been brought into the hospital
in Bo, along with the injured.
</P>
<P>
Reinforcements are also reported to have been brought in on Sunday
to help the attacks.
</P>
<P>
There are similar attacks in Kenema to the northeast of Bo but the
junta soldiers have failed to take the ECOMOG position there.
</P>
<P>
The junta claimed at the weekend that it had overrun a Nigerian
military base outside Freetown and captured some Nigerian soldiers,
who constitute the bulk of ECOMOG forces.
</P>
<P>
Describing the claim as "wishful thinking", ECOMOG said it still
held the position allegedly overrun by the junta.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG accused that the junta attacked the base aiming at holding
hostage soldiers and civilians taking refuge there as human shield and
using them to bargain in future negotiations for the return of rebel
leader Foday Sanko.
</P>
<P>
West African countries decided on Saturday to resume dialogue with
the junta toward peaceful settlement of the crisis in Sierra Leone
triggered off by the the May 25 coup that toppled the legitimate
government led by President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Before they made the decision, west African foreign ministers had a
three-hour "very useful" closed-door meeting with Sankoh, who has been
detained in Nigeria since last March.
</P>
<P>
The junta has been demanding Sankoh to be sent back to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
So far there has no response from the junta toward the re-opening
of the negotiation it has asked for.

<HEADLINE> Greek Defense Minister Accuses Turkey of "Wasting Time" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos today accused Turkey of wasting its time in
infringing Athens flight information region (FIR) and calling into
doubt Greece's sovereign rights.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the NATO military
exercise "Dynamic Mix'97 " which ends today near Thessaloniki,
Tsohatzopoulos said that Turkey was wasting its energy and putting
the lives of its pilots in "unnecessary danger."
</P>
<P>
He urged Turkey to realize that its interest lay in
strengthening "domestic stability" and its relations with the
European Union (EU) by developing good neighborly relations and
recognizing the principles and values that all U.N. member states
were obliged to accept in practice.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Greek military exercise "Toxotis" and the
Cypriot exercise "Nikiforos" are under way in the southeastern
Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Athens claimed that a large number of Turkish jet fighters
infringed the Athens FIR in the same area and violated Greek and
Cyprus airspace over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
The exercises confirmed the two countries' joint defense
doctrine, he said, adding that no one could prevent them from
successfully conducting these exercises.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said today that Turkey's attitude would not change Greece's
policy.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's position was making its relations with Greece and its
course towards the international community more difficult, he
said.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that Greek-Turkish rapprochement would be
meaningful only on the basis of rules and, in that sense, if
Turkey conformed, a meeting between the two countries' prime
ministers in Crete on the sidelines of the two-day Balkan summit
starting on november 3 could serve as "an opportunity for a new
rapprochement."

DAMASCUS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Swedish Foreign
Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen said here today that all parties in the
region should try to save the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In her statements to newsmen after having talks with her Syrian
counterpart Farouk Sharaa, She said that Syria is an important
country in the peace process, but the process itself has been
stalled.
</P>
<P>
"We ought to be constructive and should endeavor to do more,"
she said, expressing hope that all parties in the region would try
to make further effort to save the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish Minister said, "we have discussed the relationship
between Sweden and Syria and ways and means of promoting bilateral
ties. Likewise, we exchanged views about the situation in the
Middle East and the prospects of putting the peace process back on
track."
</P>
<P>
On the role of Sweden in salvaging the peace process, she said
that being a member of the European Union and the U.N. Security
Council, Sweden is seeking more facts about the situation and
developments in the region. This will help Sweden do something
through the U.N. and the EU, she said, adding that she wishes the
EU will have greater presence in seeking for a resolution of this
conflict.

The Swedish Minister arrived in Damascus last evening on a
three-day official visit to Syria.

NICOSIA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos arrived here today to demonstrate his country's
staunch support for the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival at Larnaca Airport this afternoon,
Tsohatzopoulos said "we have big challenges ahead of us and we
must be optimistic that we can make next year the year of big
positive changes in the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus affair has remained unresolved since 1974 when
Turkey sent troops to the island following a failed pro-Athens
coup. Effort are now underway to bring together the Greek
Cypriot-controlled south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north.
</P>
<P>
Attacking Turkey as a "destabilizing factor," the Greek
minister said "Turkey is accountable for the continuing occupation
of part of the Republic of Cyprus and Turkish threats for the use
of force are nothing more than attempts to legalize the status
quo."
</P>
<P>
Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus, which was
declared by Turkish Cypriots in 1983 as the "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus," recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos said the recent Turkish warplanes' violations of
Greek and Cypriot airspace were part of its offensive designs
against Greece and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Athens said that it has recorded more than 60 violations by
Ankara's jetfighters Sunday and Monday as the Greek-Cypriot joint
military exercises were going on and nearly all the violators were
intercepted by Greek jets.
</P>
<P>
"We are strong enough to ensure that Turkey's designs will not
get through," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos came to Cyprus to review the final stage of the
ongoing Greek Cypriot National Guard annual military exercises
code-named "Nikiforos (Victorious) '97."
</P>
<P>
The five-day military exercises, in its fourth day today, are
participated by the Greece's air and naval forces.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos will join Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides to
review a military parade in Larnaca at the end of the maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a defense pact in November 1993,
under which the Greek armed forces will provide Cyprus with
assistance in case the island is attacked.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls for Speedy Transfer of PNA Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat today in Gaza urged
Israel to speed up the transfer of the taxes owed to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after his meeting with Israeli
ex-coordinator of negotiations with the PNA Aron Shahor, Arafat
accused Israel of not fulfilling its promise made in the past
despite his recent secret talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
During today's meeting, Arafat and Shahor discussed the latest
developments of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that nothing special has been offered so far by
the Israeli side to the peace process although his talks with
Netanyahu were "good."
</P>
<P>
Israel has frozen the transfer of tax revenues to the PNA
following the July 30 suicide bombings in Jerusalem which killed
18 people and injured 151 others. PNA officials said that Israel
so far has transferred about 40 percent of the total revenue to
the PNA, and the remaining 110 million U.S. dollars are still in
Israeli hands.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Netanyahu met last Wednesday at Erez checkpoint
between Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip and the two discussed ways
and means for reviving the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In another development, over 1,000 Palestinian young people
and college students demonstrated today in the West Bank city of
Nablus to protest against the Israeli occupation and closure of
the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, some of them waving Palestinian flags and
assault rifles, pledged to rally around Arafat and fight to the
end against the Israeli occupation.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Hyacinth is threatening a new
bridge in Kafue river of Zambia, an environmental official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Inspector of natural resources of the Environmental Council of
Zambia (ECZ), Willy Kalunga, said that the weed is spreading at a fast
rate exerting pressure on the new bridge, thereby shortening its life
span.
</P>
<P>
He said unless something is done immediately to bring the weed
under control other infrastructures such as the Kafue Gorge dam walls,
the rail bridge and the water works facilities along the river might
be affected.
</P>
<P>
He said the Environment Ministry in conjunction with ECZ, the
National Council for Scientific Research and the University of
Zambia will spray chemicals to supplement the biological method
to control the weed.
</P>
<P>
Kalunga said in 1995, the ECZ tried to control the weed using the
weevils but that these have resorted to eating reeds instead of the
weeds.
</P>
<P>
He said it is difficult to control the weed because it doubles
itself every fortnight.
</P>
<P>
It is said that five square meters of the weed exerts pressure
equal to one tone of weight on each of the bridge's pillars.
</P>
<P>
The weed is clogging the river, Zambia's lifeblood for water
resources. The river from its upper reaches in the Northwestern
Province down to its confluence with the great Zambezi river in the
South also supports a great deal of Zambia's economic activity like
agriculture, fishery and power.

<HEADLINE> Russian Foreign Minister to Make Mideast Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov is to visit Lebanon on October 24 on a mediation mission
to the Middle East, Russian ambassador Oleg Peressypkine announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz,
Peressypkine told the press that during his trip to the region
Primakov will seek ways to help revive the stalled Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador said that the trip will also take
Primakov to Syria, Israel, the Palestinian self-ruled Gaza Strip,
Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Primakov will set off his tour one month after the
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made to the region her
maiden trip, which has brought the Palestinians and Israel back to
negotiation while the Syrian-Israeli talks and Lebanese-Israeli
talks are still deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador said regional issues will top the
agenda in Primakov's talks with Lebanese officials, followed by
discussion of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to disclose if Primakov will put forward any new
initiative for the peace process, saying that he will let the
foreign minister himself answer the question.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Confirmed as CDU Chancellor Candidate for Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LEIPZIG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
was confirmed today by his ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
party as its chancellor candidate for the next general election
due in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the national congress of the CDU in the eastern
German city of Leipzig, Kohl announced the start of the election
campaign and called on party members to firmly united behind him
in order to defeat the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD)
again next year.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who has been in office for uninterrupted 15 years,
already ranks as Europe's longest-serving political leader and as
the most durable German chancellor this century.
</P>
<P>
He stressed today that he felt obliged to seek another term to
guide Germany into the next century which is full of challenges.
</P>
<P>
"What I want to do is to take responsibility and do my duty. For
this reason, I will again be the chancellor candidate," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
His 90-minute speech was received by long-time applauses and
standing ovations from the 1.001 delegates, some of whom had until
recently been challenging Kohl's leadership.
</P>
<P>
During his speech, Kohl also branded the main opposition Social
Democrats (SPD) as a party of outmoded ideas, which could not
properly follow the great changes at the end of the 20th century
and wanted to block key reforms needed to keep the country
competitiveness in a world of globalization.
</P>
<P>
"If we did not make preparations for the next century, we would
be left behind by the development," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that if re-elected, he would again make it a top
priority to push through his failed tax reform which had been
designed to bolster business confidence, investment and hiring.
</P>
<P>
Predicting that the German economy was set to grow between 2.8
and three percent this year instead of the 2.5 percent growth
predicted earlier, Kohl also cautioned that economic growth alone
would not be enough to bring down the country's record high
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"We must stress both: growth and structural reforms," he said.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policy issues, Kohl reiterated his commitment to the
planned single European currency, the Euro. "We will make sure
that the Euro will come punctually and as a stable currency, with
strict adherence to the legally binding criteria," he said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the leadership issue, the three-day CDU congress
will also adopt a working agenda for the period until 2002 which
will center on employment, crime, education and Europe.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Reduces Malawians' Life Span </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- AIDS will further reduce
Malawians' average life span to 44 years by 2010 from current 45
if its spread remains unchecked, the World Bank has said.
</P>
<P>
According to its latest assessment of the impact of disease on
the country, about 13 percent of Malawi's population has been
infected with the HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The current life span could be 57 years if Aids is put under
control, said the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of disease, the current population of about 10
million will increase to 16.7 million in the year 2010, said the
study of the bank.
</P>
<P>
By July of this year more than 50,000 Aids cases had been
reported to National Aids Control Program and the actual number
of cases is much higher than the reported cases, it said.
</P>
<P>
At the root of the problem is the high rate of sexually
transmitted infections which account for the majority of the
HIV/AIDS cases in the country, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Malawian Health Minister Harry Thompson was quoted as saying
that the Malawian government will do its utmost to protect those
who have not contracted the disease but people should change
their behavior or the efforts will be useless.
</P>
<P>
Last year 10.5 million U.S. dollars was spent on Aids in the
country and more than 95 of the money came from foreign donors.

<HEADLINE> China Calls on to Establish True Global Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (xinhua) -- It is essential to
establish a true global partnership on the principles of mutual
benefits and common but differentiated responsibilities so as to
promote common prosperity and development of developing countries
and other countries in the world, Qin Huasun, Chinese Permanent
Representative to the United Nations stressed here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the Second Committee at the
fifty-second session of the General Assembly, Ambassador Qin said
a total of 1.3 billion people in developing countries are yet to
be free from poverty.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the unfavorable external environment is still
hampering the efforts of developing countries for economic and
social development: there have been frequent tendencies of trade
protectionism and unilateralism by developed countries; heavy debt
burden has slowed the development pace of the developing
countries; Official Development Aid has dropped to a new all-time
low; the gap between the developed and the developing countries is
further widening; and in the tide of the globalization, the least
developed countries are in a real danger of being marginalized,
while developing countries with fairly good development are
frequently confronted with new challenges and adversities.
</P>
<P>
Qin said in the United Nations, the tendency of paying
inadequate attention to development issues has yet to be
corrected, development resources have continued to decrease, and
the institutions involved in economic development activities have
suffered further weakening.
</P>
<P>
Qin said though an Agenda for Development has been adopted and
the Special Session for the Comprehensive Review of the Outcome of
the Conference on environment and Development had been convened,
the consensus reached by the international community at a series
of major international conference on strengthening international
development cooperation remains, to a large extent, on paper.
</P>
<P>
Qin said when economic inter-relations and interdependence
among states are ever deepening, it is impossible for the
prosperity and affluence of a few countries to be built on the
continuous poverty and backwardness of a majority of countries.
Developing countries need developed countries, developed countries
also need developing countries. Developing countries are
indispensable as markets for products and capital from the
developed countries, and are sources for the raw materials
developed countries require.
</P>
<P>
Qin stressed it is essential to observe the principles of
equality and mutual benefits, to adhere to the correct orientation
of international development cooperation, to constantly revise the
content of international development cooperation in light of the
new features in today's world economy and new needs arising
therefrom, and to strengthen UN's role in promoting international
development cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Qin Huasun on Reform of the United Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The strengthening of
UN's role in promoting international development cooperation is
closely linked to the current UN reform process, Qin Huasun,
Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the Economic and Financial
Committee at the fifty-second session of the General Assembly, Qin
said reform of the Organization must grasp the theme of the times
and bring the question of development back to the center of the UN
agenda together with the question of peace.
</P>
<P>
Qin said reform should follow a democratic principle. The
reform of the UN is a matter for the entire membership. questions
relating to the reform of inter-governmental machinery, in
particularly, should be subject to in-depth discussions by the
member states and acted upon the basis of general consensus.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said reform measures should focus on the
strengthening out relations, improving efficiency in the UN
system, which demanded a prompt solution.
</P>
<P>
he said effective settlement of serious inadequacy of
development resources is an important component of the UN reform,
particularly reform in the economic and financial field. It is
necessary to take the question of resources into overall
consideration as part of reform so as to ensure a reliable and
stable basis for development resources.

<HEADLINE> Otis Confident in China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Otis, the world's largest
elevator manufacturer, is expanding its Chinese market, which it
believes has a great need for its products.
</P>
<P>
"China is a very important market to Otis as it is the fastest
growing elevator market in the world," said Stephen Page,
president and chief executive officer of Otis Elevator.
</P>
<P>
"An estimated 200,000 elevators are expected to be needed in
China over the next five years," he said during a recent interview
with Chinese reporters. He said that China is now second only to
Japan as the largest market for new equipment units.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Otis sold about 5,000 units in China, more than 20
percent of its worldwide yearly average of 42,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Otis Elevator's long history in China began in the 1900s with
the installation of two elevators in Shanghai's Peace Hotel by the
Huangpu River in 1907. But during the several decades afterwards,
Otis was unable to make much expansion on the China market.
</P>
<P>
Otis took the opportunities brought by China's economic reforms
and opening-up policies, and set up its first manufacturing joint
venture in China at Tianjin in 1984. The Tianjin venture
manufactures a full range of products, Page said. In the following
years, Otis has other manufacturing joint ventures in Guangzhou
and Hangzhou, and sales and service joint ventures in Beijing and
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
On September 8, Otis announced the formation of Otis China
Limited, a joint venture holding company that will manage its
five operations in China. Its partners are CITIC Development
Company Ltd. and Tianjin Tai Kang Industrial and Commercial Co.
</P>
<P>
"The linkage of our various operations around China will help
us achieve synergy in managing our marketing, manufacturing and
product development resources," he said. "It will also enhance our
abilities to provide better services to our customers throughout
China."

<HEADLINE> American Singer John Denver Dies in Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- American singer John Denver,
whose songs "Rocky Mountain High" and "Take Me Home, Country
Roads" gained worldwide appeal, died in a single-engine plane
crash Sunday in California.
</P>
<P>
Denver was piloting the two-seat experimental plane that
suddenly nose-dived and smashed into Monterey Bay. The body was
recovered Sunday from Monterey Bay, according to reports today.
</P>
<P>
The plane took off from Monterey Airport shortly after 5 p.m.
local time Sunday, with the first reports of crash at 5:27 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Denver established himself as a star in the 1970s with his
melodic, light folk-pop.
</P>
<P>
He scored hits with songs like "Sunshine on My Shoulders" and
"Thank God I'm a Country Boy" and was named Country Music
Entertainer of the Year in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen of his albums went gold and eight platinum, and he had
many gold and platinum sales overseas.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he toured the Soviet Union to perform as a cultural
exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union. He became
the first artist from the West to do a multi-city tour of China in
October 1992, and similarly in Vietnam in May 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Music does bring people together," Denver once said. "No
matter what language we speak, what color we are, the form of our
politics or the expression of our love and our faith, music
proves: We are the same."
</P>
<P>
In 1976, Denver co-founded the Windstar Foundation, a
non-profit environmental education and research center that works
toward a sustainable future for the world.

<HEADLINE> France's Top Boss Resigns to Protest 35 Hour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- In a dramatic showdown with the
Socialist government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, Jean
Gandois, the president of France's national employers' association
CNPF, resigned today to protest the plan of Jospin to reduce
workweek time to 35 hours from the year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
Jospin announced the plan last Friday at the national jobs
conference, which were attended by Gandois and representatives of
trade unions.
</P>
<P>
Gandois, who was the first man to resign from the presidency of
CNPF in the group's 50-year history, said later that he became the
victim of a "conspiracy" between Jospin and union leaders, who
he said "fooled" him by asking him to attend the conference and
then telling him about their plan on 35 hours.
</P>
<P>
In a bitter statement issued today after announcing his
resignation, Gandois said that he quit the job because he was
"more a negotiator than a killer."
</P>
<P>
He said the 35-hour plan would harm the competitiveness of
France's enterprises, "condemn the bosses," deteriorate France's
unemployment, harm European construction, and suspend the dialogue
between employers and employees.
</P>
<P>
Gandois also predicted a ``hard battle'' between the bosses and
the Socialist government over the 35-hour plan.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would continue to fight against the plan in
order to let "the corporate spirit triumph and let the country
escape the danger of ideologies and intolerance."
</P>
<P>
The government refused to comment on his resignation.

<HEADLINE> Washington State to Vote Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Voters in the Western state of
Washington of the United States will have a say next month on
whether a gun control initiative should become law.
</P>
<P>
The state's decision to put the gun control measure before
voters came amid high accidental shooting incidence and strong gun
lobby activities in the Capital Hill, the New York Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would require handgun owners to pass a safety test
to obtain a license to possess a gun and all pistols to be sold
with trigger-locking devices, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
"If we were to pass an initiative of the people that bypassed
the gun lobby and did so in a Western state, it would be truly
historic," an initiative advocate was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The state government estimates that nearly one in five people
in a population of 5.5 million own handguns.
</P>
<P>
Washington is among the country's eight states where more
people are killed by guns every year than in car accidents.
</P>
<P>
The rate of people killed by accidental shooting in Washington
is 4.5 times higher than that of the 25 leading industrial nations
combined and the overall rate for the U.S. is nine times higher
than the other countries combined, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"Backed by a Congress that has blocked any new restrictions on
personal firearms, gun supporters have found the nation's capital
to be a friendly place of late," it added.
</P>
<P>
The National Rifle Association, which campaigns against gun
control, has said it would broadcast television advertisements
five times that the initiative supporters would do.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Urges Cyprus Parties to Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy for Cyprus
Richard Holbrooke urged here today all parties concerned in
Cyprus to avoid actions which might increase tensions.
</P>
<P>
Following a two-hour meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem this afternoon, Holbrooke said holding military
exercises at this moment would not be conducive to the Cyprus
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Greek and Greek Cypriot troops are now conducting one-week
joint exercises, code-named "Nikiforos '97", in the Greek
Cypriot-controlled area.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said that he had exchanged views with Cem over the
Cyprus situation and other related issues. But he declined to
disclose the contents of his talks with Cem, saying "confidential
talks have to remain confidential."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem failed to turn out for
questions following the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke denied that he came to Ankara with a specified
peace plan from the White House and that the Cyprus issue is a
problem between the United States and Turkey, saying that Turkey
is a close ally of Washington.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy said that he and Thomas Miller, U.S. State
Department's new coordinator on Cyprus issue, came to Ankara
to find out Turkey's position on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke and Thomas arrived here Sunday on a shuttle mission
for the protracted Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Thomas will fly to Athens Tuesday to meet Greek leaders for
the Cyprus issue, said Holbrooke. It remains unclear when
Holbrooke will leave Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Holbrooke also met with Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, who just
returned from Strasburg, France, for a council of Europe meeting.
</P>
<P>
Demirel has said that Turkey always supports a political
solution to the Cyprus issue, saying a bizonal and bicommunal
federation might be a settlement to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Yilmaz, Holbrooke said that the
talks were positive, saying the U.S. government hopes that Greece
and Turkey improve their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He added that he will meet Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash in New York later this month.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into rival Greek Cypriot community in
the south and Turkish Cypriot community in the north since 1974
when Turkish troops took over the northern third of the island in
the weak of an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The situation on the small eastern Mediterranean island has
become worse after the Cypriot government signed a deal to buy
anti-aircraft missiles from Russia in January.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and international community have been
making efforts for a peaceful solution to the thorny issue, but
no tangible results have been achieved so far.

<HEADLINE> Africa Faces Challenges of Educating Consumers: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior official from the
International Advertising Association (IAA) said here today that
educating consumers is vital to the ultimate success of the
health growth of the African economies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the on-going Third Africa Congress of the IAA, IAA
World President Senyon Kim noted that Africa faced challenges to
educate consumers to the value and benefits of free market
economies.
</P>
<P>
He told the four-day meeting started here today that
advertising and marketing would be at the forefront of the
development of the African continent in the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
Advertising and marketing would go hand in hand with the
notion of a borderless continent, he said at the meeting which
has the theme "Creating a Borderless Continent: Africa's 21st
Century Communication Challenge".
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that a borderless African continent
means borderless communications which is "a way to promote the
economies of Africa."
</P>
<P>
He explained that advertising is the vital conduit for that
information between producer and consumer and no one else has the
motivation to do it.
</P>
<P>
Advertising has so often been described as just the vested
interest of business, said Kim, adding that it has rarely been
seen as the voice of the free market economy and the servant of
the free-choosing consumer.
</P>
<P>
The IAA is the world's only partnership of advertisers,
agencies, media and specialized services. it has 3,700 senior
members and 1,000 associate members in 95 countries.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Needs $1b to Repair Refineries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has to spend one billion U.S.
Dollars if it wants to put the four on-and-off refineries back in good
shape so as to eradicate haunting fuel scarcity, according to latest
studies.
</P>
<P>
The report of the technical assessment, carried out by oil
giants Mobil and Shell, is now being studied by the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation and the National Economic
Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
The four refineries, three in the south and one in the north, were
built seven to 32 years ago, with total daily capacity of 445,000
barrels.
</P>
<P>
Because of the old age and the lack of regular maintenance for
fund shortage, most of the units of the four refineries are
either out of order or become obsolete, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the production has been reduced to half of their
capacity, which caused acute fuel scarcity that slowed down business
activities in many parts of the country between March and July this
year.
</P>
<P>
The government had to resort to import to ease the situation and
part of the foreign product were recently confirmed by Environmental
Protection Agency to be toxic, producing a bad odor hazardous to
people's health.
</P>
<P>
However, the deadline for importation, originally scheduled for
September, is expected to be extended beyond December this year as it
will take months to finish maintenance of a plant even though it
starts right at the moment.
</P>
<P>
It is the hope of Nigerians that the government shall take an early
decision for the repair job in order to put an end to fuel shortage
in this largest oil producing country of Africa.

Under the program, Thailand will soon set a financial
restructuring agency and a financial management company to help
handle the problems of these finance firms.
</P>
<P>
The program will also allow foreign investors to hold a stake
of more than 50 percent in any of the troubled 58 finance firms
for a period up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the program requires finance institutions in the
country to increase their capital to keep themselves stable, while
the government will push amendments of the related laws to enable
it to play a greater role in handling financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation program also covers many other fields,
including the introduction of significant measures to promote
exports, tourism and services businesses and reduce imports to
curb the country's inflation and the current account deficit.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Announces Further Budget Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government today
approved a further cut in the 1998 fiscal budget by 100 billion
baht (2.75 billion U.S. dollars) to meet the demand of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) for support to help revive its
troubled economy.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Virabongsa Ramangkura announced the new
cut at a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
Plus an earlier cut of 59 billion baht (1.6 billion dollars),
the country's budget for fiscal 1998 has been reduced to 823
billion baht (22.64 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has been under pressure from the IMF to
reduce government spending and increase revenue in return for a
standby 17.2-billion-dollar credit to help Thailand revive its
ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Today, the deputy prime minister also unveiled an economic
rehabilitation package which covers the restructuring of industry,
agriculture and services, and supporting introduction of new
technology, new management know-how, and privatization of state
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
If these measures are implemented strictly, Thailand's economic
growth for 1998 will be at 3.5 percent, and 6-7 percent in the
following two years, Virabongsa said.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate for this year is expected to be 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Current account deficit next year will drop to 3 percent of
gross domestic product from 5 percent this year under the rescue
plan.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, foreign exchange reserves will increase to 24-25
billion dollars from 23 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's fiscal 1998 began on October 1 this year.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria's Foreign Debts Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's foreign debts have
dropped to their lowest level in 20 years, said Suranyi Gyorgy,
chief of the Bulgarian Nemzeti Bank.
</P>
<P>
Gyorgy said that by the end of last June, Bulgarian foreign
debts totalled 10.5 billion U.S. dollars. He predicted that by the
end of this year, the figure could be further reduced to 10
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In this way, Bulgaria would change from a heavily indebted
country into a middle-indebted country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gyorgy also noted that the inflation rate had dropped from 23
percent to 18 percent, and probably to 17 percent by the end of
this year. Bulgaria will try to lower its inflation rate to less
than 10 percent when it enters the European Union in 2001- 2002.
</P>
<P>
He estimated this year's fiscal deficit at less than 1.7
billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 3.5 to 3.6 percent of the
gross domestic products (GDP) figure.

<HEADLINE> HK Faces up to Challenge of Information Age: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has to face up to
the challenge of the information age in order to retain its
competitiveness in the new era, a senior official of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception marking the 125th anniversary of the
British company of Cable and Wireless, Donald Tsang, financial
secretary of the HKSAR, said that Hong Kong had a long history of
facing up to challenges and embracing new technology.
</P>
<P>
"From a policy perspective, the way Hong Kong is connected to
the rest of the world is a serious matter indeed," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"Questions arise at a very basic level: for example, what role
do we wish Hong Kong as an economy to play in future? How can we
best manage the transition of our community to an information
society? How can we assist our country, China, in considering
these issues?" Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government has determined to place priority on
addressing these questions, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the HKSAR, expressed a vision
of Hong Kong assuming a leadership position in the information
industries in his first policy address delivered last week.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said the government must facilitate the establishment of
an open common interface information infrastructure and the laying
down of an appropriate regulatory framework to remove obstacles to
 interconnection.
</P>
<P>
The government should also develop a policy for promoting
information technology applications, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"The developments in the information industries are likely to
change the very way in which mankind lives and works and the way
business, trade and commerce are conducted globally," Tsang said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Tests Unmanned Plane Successfully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today
that an unmanned plane built by Iran itself had a successful
test flight in the Persian Gulf today.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA reported that "Stealth", the
domestically built unmanned plane, was test flown in the
Persian Gulf Tuesday as part of the war games being conducted
by Iranian navy.
</P>
<P>
Ashkbus Danekar, commander of Khatam al-Anbia Headquarters, was
 quoted as saying that the unmanned plane successfully carried
out its mission at the third stage of the Victory-8 military
exercise in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
He said the reconnaissance aircraft which cannot be detected
on radar screen has served to complete the offensive and
defensive capability of the Iranian navy.
</P>
<P>
During its surveillance mission, the plane is also capable
of detecting other flying unmanned aircraft within its range,
taking photos and transmitting information about their place,
movement and speed, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, a new training warplane "Dorna"
which has been manufactured by Iran's Air Force experts will
conduct its first test flight soon.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade Minister Urges Market Economy Recognization (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese minister of foreign
trade and economic co-operation Wu Yi today urged the European
Union (EU) to respect China's practical situation and remove the
country from EU's list of non-market economies at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The action of terming China as a non-market economy in
disregard of China's development is either out of prejudice or for
the deliberate purpose of confusing black with white, and will
seriously impede the further progress of Sino-European economic
and trade ties, Wu said in her talks with Leon Brittan,
vice-president of the EU Commission.
</P>
<P>
Brittan, who is here to discuss China-Europe relationship and
China's membership to the WTO, responded that it is incorrect to
describe today's China which is undergoing rapid economic growth
as a non-market economy.
</P>
<P>
EU emphasizes its relations with China both politically and
economically, and hopes to view China's progress in a practical
and friendly way, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that as an EU official in charge of China affairs,
he will try all efforts to make EU member countries better
understand China.
</P>
<P>
Wu reaffirmed China's stress on its economic and trade
relations with EU. She hoped that Brittan's current visit will
help deepen mutual understanding, promote bilateral economic and
trade ties, and accelerate China's accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
EU stands so far as China's fourth largest trade partner with
bilateral trade volume reaching 39.7 billion US dollars last
year. The figure for the first eight months of this year amounted
to 25.31 billion US dollars, up 5.2 percent over the same period
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, by the end of this June, EU member countries have
carried out 7,758 co-operative projects in China, with a total
commitment of 10.48 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
China's broad market and great developing potential will surely
provide EU with more co-operation opportunities in economy and
trade, Wu said, citing such sectors as new science and technology,
infrastructure construction, and sustainable development. In these
sectors, she said, EU could expand its investment and
technological transfer, and governments and administrative bodies
of both countries should render encouragement and support.

<TEXT>
<P>
Wu expressed her gratitude to Brittan and EU for their efforts
in talks concerning China's entry to the WTO, and her appreciation
over EU's independent position on this issue.
</P>
<P>
She hoped that EU would show more sincerity to produce
substantial progress in bilateral negotiations with a view to
reaching an early conclusion through joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
On the reduction of tariffs, Wu stressed that China has always
pursued an independent policy, and has made a big stride forward
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
According to her, China's general tariff rates have dropped
from 35 percent of 1995 to the present 17 percent, with a
reduction rate of over 60 percent. Moreover, China has committed
to cut the figure to the average level of that of the developing
countries by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the opening of China's service trade, Wu noted
that China has adopted a cautious attitude on this matter, and
believes opening of this sector can only be carried out step by
step instead of at a single move.
</P>
<P>
Wu mentioned EU's anti-dumping action against China, saying
this has aroused public concern and affected bilateral economic
and trade ties. It is learned that in the past two years, EU took
ten anti-dumping actions against China, bringing the number of its
registered anti-dumping cases to 69.
</P>
<P>
She suggested an anti-dumping consultative mechanism be
established under the China-Europe Mixed Committee so as to carry
out consultations and take preventive measures to avoid
confronting actions.
</P>
<P>
Regarding EU's unilateral quantitative limitation on China's
exports, Wu held that this is part of the EU's discriminative
trade policy against China. "China is the only sufferer of this
policy among all EU trade partners.
</P>
<P>
China opposes such discriminative trade policy, Wu said,
expressing the hope Brittan would work for an early cancellation
of such limitations and to remove obstacles for the long-term
development of bilateral economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Brittan emphasized that on China's membership to the WTO, EU
will not impose its position on others, nor will it allow others
to force their views on itself. EU hopes China's early entry to
the WTO and will continue to work for this end together with the
Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Wu and Brittan signed a memorandum of
understanding on co-operation and a financial agreement on three
co-operative projects.

<HEADLINE> Military Court Opens Hearing on Cairo Bus Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Amid tight security, two
Egyptians accused of killing nine German tourists and their
Egyptian driver in a deadly attack last month were put on trial at
a military court here today.
</P>
<P>
The two men, Saber Farahat Abu el-Ela and his brother Mahmoud,
had been caught red-handed at the scene of the appalling shooting
and petrol bomb attack on a tour bus in front of the renowned
Egyptian Museum in downtown Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Along with them in the trial before the Higher Military Court
were other seven men on charges of selling them weapons and
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The first hearing was held at 11 a.m. today in a
heavily-guarded courtroom thronged with Arab and foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the session, the Farahat brothers asked the
court to assign a lawyer for their defense. They face charges of
manslaughter, arson, sabotage, illegal possession of weapons and
attack on police officers.
</P>
<P>
The mental status of Saber, who had been declared insane by a
Cairo court in a previous trial for murdering three foreigners in
a Cairo hotel in 1993, is yet to be determined by the military
court.
</P>
<P>
Citing that Saber was a madman who escaped from a lunatic
asylum just three days earlier, the Egyptian authorities
laboriously denied hints that Islamic extremists were behind the
attack as in the previous cases, in a bid to contain damages to
its multi-billion-dollar tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
After being overpowered by police, Saber claimed his attack was
to avenge blasphemous posters in Hebron that insulted Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The court ordered four of the defendants be medically examined
after their lawyers said that they have been tortured during
police interrogation.
</P>
<P>
The judge then ordered the court adjourned until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Farahat brothers were arrested by security police shortly
after they opened fire and threw petrol bombs into the bus of
German travelers at noon on September 18.
</P>
<P>
Cairo was quick to ban media coverage on the investigations of
the military court into the incident, which it said was different
from previous attacks carried out by the anti-government Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,255 people have been killed since 1992 by
fundamentalist militants in a violent campaign against Egypt's
secular government.
</P>
<P>
The military prosecutor took over the case from the state
security on September 22, after President Hosni Mubarak ordered
the transfer for a speedy trial.

pavilions exhibiting China's major oil-fields, gas-fileds and the
petrochemical industry.
</P>

progress since the country launched its reform and opening drive
in 1979. China has made achievements in off-shore oil prospecting
and exploration in recent years, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He praised the Daqing Oilfield for its outstanding
contributions to the country in the past decades, expressing the
hope that Daqing would make still greater achievements through
technological progress.
</P>
<P>
China is relatively deficient in petroleum resources and should
further its cooperation with foreign countries in oil prospecting,
drilling, refining and research.
</P>
<P>
The leader praised the sponsors for holding such an exhibition,
saying that it could increase mutual understanding and exchanges
between China's oil industry and its foreign counterparts, and it
will also help boost the development of the country's oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is held at the China International Exhibition
Center and attended by 400 companies from 24 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
All major Chinese oil companies are participating in
the exhibition, displaying their latest achievements in the
petroleum industry.

<HEADLINE> China Concerned About Vietnamese Refugees in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is very
concerned about Vietnamese refugees still remaining in Hong Kong,
Meng Xianying, head of a Chinese delegation, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Meng was speaking at the ongoing meeting of the executive
committee of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR). She thanked the UNHCR for its efforts in seeking a
solution to the problem of Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
But she stressed that the Chinese government is "very much
concerned" that there are still about 2,100 Vietnamese refugees
after the conclusion in 1996 of the Comprehensive Plan of Action,
first agreed upon at the meeting of the International Conference
on Indo-Chinese Refugees here in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Meng said: "We hope that the parties concerned will take
further measures for the early repatriation of the remaining
Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope that the relevant countries could adopt a more
positive and cooperative attitude in providing resettlement to the
remaining refugees in Hong Kong," she said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about China's role as an asylum country, Meng said
China has provided asylum for nearly 300,000 Indo-Chinese refugees
for almost 20 years despite its own limited resources. China had
persistently adhered to the principle of voluntary repatriation
and never repatriated refugees forcibly, she said.
</P>
<P>
"As for those refugees who wish to stay in China, we will help
them as ever. We hope that the international community and the
UNHCR will continue to support China's efforts in this regard,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Meng also expressed satisfaction over the relationship between
China and the UNHCR, which upgraded its branch office in China to
a regional office this year.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government would like to further strengthen its
cooperation with the UNHCR and join other countries in the efforts
to seek solutions to the refugee problems worldwide," she added.

<HEADLINE> ITTF Suggests Mixed Doubles for Sydney Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A Table tennis top official
suggested on Tuesday that the mixed doubles should be added into
the agenda of the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yinsheng, president of the International Table Tennis
Federation (ITTF), submitted a letter of proposal on behalf of
ITTF to International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Juan
Antonio Samaranch during their meeting today.
</P>
<P>
The IOC chief, who was invited by the Chinese Olympic Committee
to present for the Chinese Eighth National Games, said IOC will
"take it into serious consideration" and suggested that ITTF
should win the support first from the Organizing Committee for the
Sydney Olympic Games (OCSOG) at the point.
</P>
<P>
Then, it will be easier for IOC to make a decision with a
formal application from OCSOG asking to add the event to the
Games, Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
In the proposal, the ITTF president suggested that the number
of paddlers can remain unchanged with the inclusion of the mixed
doubles into the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting was Deng Yaping, the best paddler
in the world with four Olympic table tennis golds in the last two
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"She has won all but a mixed doubles in the Olympics," Xu said.
"She is awaiting the chance."
</P>
<P>
Table tennis has four official Olympic events of both men's and
women's singles and doubles.

<HEADLINE> Two American Professors Share 1997 Nobel Economic Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 14 (Xinhua)--American Professor Robert
C. Merton and Professor Myron S. Scholes won 1997 Nobel Prize in
Economics today "for a new method to determine the value of
derivatives."
</P>
<P>
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced here that these
two professors, together with the late Fischer Black, "developed a
pioneering formula for the valuation of stock options."
</P>
<P>
"Their methodology has paved the way for economic valuations in
many areas. It has also generated new types of financial
instruments and facilitated more efficient risk management in
society," the Academy said.
</P>
<P>
In a modern market economy, it is essential for firms and
householders to select an appropriate level of risk in their
transactions. However, it is a prerequisite for them to adopt
scientific instruments for efficient management of the risk.
</P>
<P>
"A new method to determine the value of derivatives stands out
among the foremost contributions to economic sciences over the
last 25 years," said the Academy.
</P>
<P>
Robert Merton, born in 1944 and now professor of economics at
Harvard University, and Myron Scholes, born in 1941 and professor
of finance at Stanford University, developed the new method of
option valuation in close collaboration with Fischer Black, who
died in his fifties in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1973, Black and Scholes published what has come to be known
as the Black-Scholes Formula, which thousands of traders and
investors now use every day to value stock options in markets
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Besides the valuation method, Merton and Scholes have made
several significant contributions to financial economics.
</P>
<P>
The Nobel Prize in Economics was instituted in 1968 by the Bank
of Sweden in memory of the Swedish dynamite inventor Alfred
Nobel.

<HEADLINE> Teenager Chen Completes Gold Double at National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Chen Yan, who broke the world
record in the 400m individual medley yesterday, completed her gold
double by taking the women's 200m freestyle at the National Games
here Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Chen of Liaoning province clocked her career and the year-best
of one minute 57.30 seconds, two hundredths of a second ahead of
local star Wang Luna. The bronze medal went to Olympian Shan Ying
of Chinese Army in 1:59.43.
</P>
<P>
"I was very tired in the last 50 meters," Chen said. "But I
managed to hold on for the gold. I have four other events in the
Games, and I will continue to try my best."
</P>
<P>
"Chen's timing is the best in the past two years," said Zhou
Ming, vice head coach of the Chinese national swimming team. "Wang
also has the calibre to win the gold. She staged fierce challenge
in the last 50 meters."
</P>
<P>
Local teenager Wang Wei overcame a cold to capture the gold in
the women's 100m breaststroke in an Asian mark of one minute and
8.26 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Teammate Zhang Yi finished second in 1:08.61 and Yuan Yuan of
the Chinese Army was third in 1:09.60.
</P>
<P>
Han Xue of Beijing, who holds the 50m breaststroke short-course
world record, came in a modest seventh place.
</P>
<P>
"The 100m event is not my favorite," Said Wang. "The gold and
the time are beyong my expectation. Only three days ago, I caught
a fever with a tempreture of 40-degree centigrade."
</P>
<P>
Chen's coach Han Jiayan failed to show up after the competition
due to illness. In his place, Zhang Yanmou who pinned high hopes
upon the 16-year-old, said that "Chen was an inborn swimmer with
1.78 meters in height at the age of 16. Hardworking and talented
as she is, the girl is sure to catch the limelight in her next
four events."
</P>
<P>
In the men's 400m individual medley, Xiong Guoming, who won six
gold medals in the last National Games four years ago, retained
his title with an Asain mark of four minutes and 19.03 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Jin Hao of Shangdong province finished second in 4:23.13 and
Wang Wei of Shanghai came third 0.22 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
Xiong and Wang also claimed the gold in the 4X200m freestyle
relay for Shanghai along with Ye Liangchen and Chen Zhou, the gold
medalist in the 200m freestyle on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Coach Zhou said the swimming competitions in the National Games
reached a very high level.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very glad that the swimmers, especially the youngsters,
achieved such good results," Zhou said. "But do not be astonished
at it. After two years in low tones for the Chinese swimmers,
it's the right time for the new bloods to emerge as the stars."
</P>
<P>
Zhou said the Chinese swimmers are expected to achieve good
timings and even world records in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Should they keep training hard and steeling their nerves at
home and abroad, the new stars are sure to make the splashes in
the World Swimming Championships next January in Perth, Australia,
the coach said.

<HEADLINE> Intel Increases Investment in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corporation, the world's
largest computer chip maker, is set to add 99 million US dollars
to its production base in Shanghai's Pudong New Area.
</P>
<P>
This comes from Gerry Parker, the company's vice president, who
made the announcement at the inaugural ceremony at the Intel
international sales network's China branch.
</P>
<P>
The addition will increase Intel's investment in the base to
198 million US dollars, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
The demand for personal computers in China has increased at an
average annual rate of 40 percent over the past few years, and
China is expected to become Intel's third largest market in the
world pretty soon, after the US and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Intel built the production base at Pudong last December and the
first products are expected to be ready early next year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President, PM Meet to Soothe Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman met today with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid
reports about their differences over resuming the peace talks
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The two met for only 19 minutes at the Presidential residence
in western Jerusalem. Both the President's Office and the Prime
Minister's Office described the meeting as a "good one."
</P>
<P>
Weizman reportedly briefed Netanyahu on his talks last week
with United States President Bill Clinton in Washington, which
focused on ways to push forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks and resume the stalled peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The president said he asked Clinton to invite both Netanyahu
and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
to visit Washington in order to advance the peace process, that
has just been restored following a seven-month freeze. He said
Clinton had accepted his request, but he did not elaborate when
Netanyahu and Arafat would be invited.
</P>
<P>
Weizman repeated his denial that he hinted in his meeting
with Clinton that Netanyahu was ready to give up the
occupied Golan Heights in order to resume the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The reported Weizman's remarks on Golan concession created an
uproar between the President's Office, the Foreign Ministry and
the Prime Minister's Office. Weizman charged Israeli Ambassador
to the U.S, Eliyahu Ben-Elissar for leaking his remarks to the
media, denying that he had ever talked about the Golan issue.
</P>
<P>
Despite being the ceremonial head of state, Weizman has
been outspoken about politics, especially on the government's
policies on the peace process. He is often at odds with
Netanyahu over controversial remarks he made to foreign guests
that revealed their differences over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace process has been suspended since early
last year following a wave of suicide bombings launched Islamic
militants and the access to power in May last year by the
hardline Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
Israel has repeatedly called for unconditional resumption of
peace talks, but Syria insists that the talks should be restarted
from the point where they were left off last year with the
previous Labor government, namely on Israeli promise to fully
withdraw troops from the strategic Golan Heights taken by Israel
in the 1967 War.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged deadlock in the peace track has led to fears about
possible armed confrontation between the two sides, and Israel
believes that Damascus is preparing for a military attack aimed at
forcing Israel to resume the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Rural Women Key to Food Security and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- October 15 is named by the
United Nations as "World Rural Women's Day". Starting from 1996,
the day has been observed one day before "World Food Day" to
increase awareness of the need to focus on rural women as a key
to food security and sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that rural women who comprise more than one
quarter of the world's total population, is a vital force in food
production and rural development.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that women produce 60 to 80 percent of basic
foodstuffs in sub-Saharan Africa, process 100 percent of basic
household foodstuffs and meet 90 percent of household water and
fuel needs throughout Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, rural women are easily neglected in this regard, not
to mention many small-scale food producers and subsistence
farmers living in food-deficit countries where their potential
contribution to improve food security and vital contribution to
society are largely unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, most rural women live in poverty and lack basic
education and training from one generation to the next. They also
lack technologies and credit or equal rights to land tenure and
inheritance.
</P>
<P>
African women receive less than one percent of the total
credit available to agriculture. They often suffer from anaemia
and general poor nutrition and health. An estimated 1.3 billion
people live in extreme poverty of less than one US dollar a day,
most of whom are women and children living in the least developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Fund for Agricultural
Development, the number of rural women living in absolute poverty
had increased by 50 percent over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
It is noteworthy that development of rural women is not only
related to the food security and rural development, but also to
the eradication of poverty in the world.
</P>
<P>
To promote the development of rural women, experts suggest
that first, they must be provided with opportunity to receive
education and training and let them learn modern technologies and
reduce the tremendous daily workload in their households and on
farms. Secondly, governments must provide inputs and credits to
support their agricultural production. Thirdly, better access to
markets will be offered to enable them to derive more income from
their labour.
</P>
<P>
Through the observation of "World Rural Women's Day", the
United Nations has called on governments all over the world to
ensure rural development is given higher priority and that more
national income reaches the rural poor.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that if rural women's role is fully recognized,
it will certainly promote the food security and sustainable
development in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Date Set To China's Yangtze River For Dam Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council today
approved a plan to block the Yangtze River, China's longest, on
November 8 for the giant Three Gorges Dam project.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the 63rd meeting of the State Council
Executive Committee, following a report by Guo Shuyan,
Vice-Chairman of the State Council Three Gorges Project
Construction Committee on work in progress.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng chaired Monday's meeting of the committee in
Beijing to discuss a report on preparations. Li said the project
has gone smoothly for the past five years and the design for
blocking the river is feasible and the resettlement of local
people has gone well.
</P>
<P>
Li said these attest to the correctness of the central
government's policies and principles on the Three Gorges project,
and the adoption of international practices like the legal-person
system, the bidding system, project supervision, and investment
management have had positive results, and the cost has stayed
within the budget.
</P>
<P>
He said the blocking is an important part of the Three Gorges
Project as the end of the first phase and start of the second, and
that there should be good preparation to reach the goal.
</P>
<P>
The dikes in the second phase should be built as quickly as
possible in order to ensure safety during the flood season in
1998, he said, and attention should be paid to installation of the
turbo-generators and to completing the power transmission and
transformation project and supportive projects, to see that they
will go into operation with the opening of the permanent shiplock
by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Li also spoke on the resettlement project, ecological and
environmental protection, agricultural development, and protection
of cultural relics in the project area.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen met with Prime Minister Lester Bird of
Antigua and Barbuda today.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his delightedness to meet with Bird in Beijing, Qian
said that since Bird's last visit to China, China has experienced
great changes and made remarkable progress as a result of reforms and
opening up.
</P>
<P>
However, with a large population and a poor foundation to start
with, China remains a developing country, he said, adding that
China will concentrate on expanding its economy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the international arena, China holds that all
countries should respect each another, not interfere in each
other's internal affairs and conduct mutually beneficial
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He praised the people of Antigua and Barbuda for their
achievements in national construction. He stressed that China will
continue to actively push forward friendly cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Bird said that 12 years have passed since he first visited
China. He is impressed by the amazing and admirable development of
China. He said that China has always been a reliable friend of
other developing countries. He noted that China's support to his
country's effort to develop the economy in the past years has
greatly encouraged his people.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that since its return to the motherland some 100
days ago, Hong Kong has maintained social stability and economic
prosperity. The international financial and business communities are
optimistic about Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
He said that these facts have proved that the "one country, two
systems" principle is successful. He said that the successful
implementation of the principle in Hong Kong will have a
significant impact on China's great cause of reunification.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China's reunification of China is an
inevitable trend and that the "one China" policy has been
understood by an overwhelming majority of countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian and Bird also exchanged views on regional and
international issues.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Bird attended a banquet given at noon by Yu
Xiaosong, president of the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade. He briefed Chinese entrepreneurs on tourism,
finance and free trade zones of his country. He invited Chinese
entrepreneurs to invest and launch cooperation projects in his

<P>
MOSCOW, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Victor
Chernomyrdin said today that foreign investors in Russia will
enjoy special treatment in being charged only half the normal
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency reported that Chernomyrdin, speaking
at a regular meeting of foreign investors, said a presidential
decree to this effect has been drafted.
</P>
<P>
He said the decree aimed to make sure that accords signed
between the Russian Ministry of Economy and big foreign investors
can be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Since last December, there have been a lot of legal disputes
because of the elimination of some preferential terms for foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said he was optimistic about the future of foreign
investment in Russia. Judging from the development of the Russian
economy in the past nine months, Russian could attract 20 billion
U.S. dollars in investments annually by the year of 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
There has been direct foreign investment of four billion
U.S. dollars in Russia this year. So far, the overall foreign
investment in the country has surpassed 20 billion
U.S. dollars.

of sovereignty over Macao on December 20, 1999," he stressed. "It
will never interfere in the Portuguese administration in Macao
that will last until December 19, 1999."
</P>
<P>
Chen said that he is confident the establishment of the
committee will have the active participation and support of Macao
residents and the full understanding and cooperation of the
Portuguese side.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory committee is widely expected to be set up early
next year. But details on the founding of the body, including the
number of committee members, the exact time of its founding, are
yet to be announced.
</P>
<P>
According to a decision of China's National People's Congress
(NPC), the preparatory committee will be composed of members from
the mainland and "no less than 50 percent of Macao members."
</P>
<P>
Chen explained that, based on the experience of the Hong Kong
SAR Preparatory Committee and the specific situation in Macao,
more than half of the committee members will be local Macao
residents, and they will be representatives of all walks of life
in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory committee will be responsible for matters
related to the establishment of the Macao SAR, including the ways
to form the first administration, the first legislative assembly
and the first judiciary organs, according to the NPC
decision.

<HEADLINE> Future Business Leaders of Asia Must Be Far-sighted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Asia needs far-sighted young
business leaders to meet the challenge of the information age of
the next century, a Singaporean entrepreneur said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a plenary session in parallel of the 1997 East Asia
Economic Summit, Ho Kwon-Ping, chairman of Wah-Chang International
of Singapore, said that the young generation of business leaders
should heed the wind change rather than scramble when typhoon
arrives.
</P>
<P>
He believed the young generation of business leaders can create
a better and stronger Asia. However, this is not a second "Asian
miracle" but a vision which can be achieved through idealism and
hard work, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yoshimasa Hayashi, member of the House of Councilors of Japan,
said that the difference between the industrial age and the
informational age lies in the change from a free global market
promoting free trade for products to a free global network
promoting communications and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A cooperative culture for global cooperation should be
developed in the next century so as to coordinate the values of
the Western and Eastern countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
The next generation of business leaders in Asia should adopt a
new way of thinking and a new way of management, said Tian Wei,
managing director of Hong Kong's China Civil Engineering
Construction Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Tian stressed the importance of localizing the cooperation in
order to explore business opportunities. That means more
compromises than confrontations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Every country has different standard of value and different
economic and social background and overseas investors should try
to gain local support, he said, adding that foreign investors are
hard to work in Asia without local support.
</P>
<P>
Kim Sung Joo from South Korea, the only businesswoman to speak
at the session, said that Asian women should play a more important
role in the next century.
</P>
<P>
She urged Asian businessmen to pay close attention to the role
of highly educated women and promote specialized training for
women through updated techniques.

<HEADLINE> Serb Leaders Committed to Solving Political Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 13 (Xinhua) - - Bosnia's Serb President,
Biljana Plavsic, and Serb member of the Bosnian presidency Momcilo
Krajisnik have reiterated commitment to their recent agreement
aimed at resolving the political crisis in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Meeting today with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who
mediated in the agreement on September 24, the two leaders said
the agreement is of great importance in solving the problems in
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Plavsic and Krajisnik agreed to take all
necessary steps to stop any conflicts that would threaten the
unity of Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to hold elections for the republic's
parliament on November 15, and for the presidency and the Serb
member of the three-man Bosnian presidency on December 17.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the two leaders adopted the suggestion from
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to
defer the parliamentary election to November 23.
</P>
<P>
The present political crisis within the Bosnian Serb leadership
began in early July, when Plavsic dissolved the parliament despite
strong opposition from its members.
</P>
<P>
Then Plavsic's exposure of high-level corruption led to further
conflict with Bosnian Serb hard-liners who expelled her from the
Serb Social Democratic Party and demanded her resignation as
president.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Urges Quicker Localization in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official in charge of
Hong Kong and Macao affairs said here today that the localization
of civil servants, law and the use of Chinese as an official
language should be quickened for a smooth handover of power.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
 Office of the State Council of China, urged the Macao government
in a speech today to "truly take the responsibility" for resolving
 the three major issues that are vital to the smooth transition
and handover of power in Macao.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Macao government has taken some measures, and
the localization process has made progress. But, he pointed out,
the progress has lagged behind the schedule for a smooth handover
of power in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"It is an urgent task to solve the three major issues," he
stressed. "The localization of senior and middle ranking
officials, in particular, should achieve a breakthrough this year
and next. A favorable condition should also be created so that
leading posts of the SAR government will be held by Chinese
citizens from among Macao's permanent residents."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the Chinese language should be used more
widely so that it will enjoy the same official language status as
the Portuguese in such spheres as administration, legislation and
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
As to the localization of laws, he said, the civil law, the law
of civil procedure, the commercial law and some other important
laws should be localized as soon as possible, thus establishing a
set of laws that are in conformity with the Macao Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
More law professionals who are needed by the Macao SAR should
also be trained, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen arrived here on Monday for a five-day visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese guerrillas wounded two
Israeli soldiers in an attack in south Lebanon today, Lebanese
Orient Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Iranian Hezbollah said today its fighters fired rockets
and machine guns at several military outposts of Israeli troops
and South Lebanon militia allies in the Israeli-occupied enclave.
</P>
<P>
In a response to the attack, two Israeli warplanes blasted at
1:30 pm (GMT 11:30) the village of Jenta in the country's northern
province of Baalbek, where Hezbollah's headquarters are believed
located.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, no further detail of casualties was reported for the
Israeli attack, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a guerrilla
war to oust Israeli troops and their local militia allies from the
1,100-square-kilometer "security zone," which was set up by Israel
in 1985 to prevent cross-border attacks.

The 18-year-old strongwoman lifted 112.5 kgs in snatch and
137.5 kgs in jerk for a combined total of 250 kgs, all surpassing

the second East Asian Games in May 1997, the jerk mark of 125 kgs
was set on Monday by Thailand's Suta Khassaraporn in the South
East Asian Games in Indonesia, while the two-lift total record of

Hiroshima in 1994.
</P>

snatched up 115 kgs to break the Chinese national record of 110.5

ISLAMABAD, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Ahsan Iqbal, chief
coordinator of Pakistan's 2010 Program, a socio-economic
development program, will leave here Wednesday for Berlin,
Germany, to attend a two-day seminar to celebrate the Golden
Jubilee of Pakistan's independence.
</P>
<P>
Iqbal told the press today that he would present a paper of the
2010 Program at the seminar, which is organized by the Institute
of Industrial Economy, Germany, and will be attended by German
economists and Pakistani intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
He said the program was designed "to respond to the global
challenge and to allow us to leap forward and catch up with the
Asian nations that have done so well."
</P>
<P>
The program is catching the attention of the international
media and global economic circles, said Iqbal, adding it would
help the rest of the world to know how Pakistanis visualize the
next century.
</P>
<P>
The main goals of the program are investment in the country's
infrastructure, promotion of human resources including education
and health care, and creation of new industries, according to
Iqbal.
</P>
<P>
The paper of the program quoted Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif as saying that "we want to double the per capita income to
1,000 U.S. dollars and to make sure no child is without schooling.
 We want universal health care, clean water and sanitation."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan needs to give the country a social-economic
foundation, Iqbal said.

<HEADLINE> IOC Chief Says Olympics Needs Commercialization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Juan Antonio Samaranch,
President of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), said here
Tuesday that commercialization was an indispensable part of the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"We need commercialization in sports. We need commercialization
in Olympic Games," said Samaranch, who was invited by the Chinese
Olympic Committee for visiting the Eighth National Games.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the IOC chief warned that "we must be aware that Olympic
Games must be run by sports officials, not by commercials."
</P>
<P>
For this reason, he said, the Olympic Games is the only sports
meet in the world that has no advertising boards inside the
competition venues.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch, who cut the ribbon for the Chinese Fourth Sports
Arts Exhibition on Monday, said sports culture is very important
in the Olympic Movement.
</P>
<P>
"We have said many times that the Olympic Movement is not only
dealing with sports, but also dealing with culture and arts," he
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He added that golfers are unlikely to take part in the Olympic
Games before 2008 though he vowed to open the Olympic door
thoroughly to the professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
"We want to have all the best athletes in if they respect the
Olympic Charter," he said. "We're talking with international golf
organizations but golf will not be in the Games before 2008."
</P>
<P>
The president also appreciated China's efforts in sports
development.
</P>
<P>
"We are very interested in the People's Republic of China's
efforts to promote high-level sports competition and at the same
time promote sports education for the people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch praised the opening ceremony of the Chinese Eighth
National Games as one of the best he'd seen in his life. "It was
at an Olympic level," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China should apply again for hosting the Olympic Games.
"Today, I'm sure, as President of IOC, that China has the ability
to present an excellent Games to the world."
</P>
<P>
On the doping issue, the IOC chief said the International
Amateur Athletic Federation ruled right to reduce from four to two
years against those cheaters, saying "it was a good decision. The
punishment must be the same in all internaitonal federations. I
think two years is enough."

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's First Private Power Company Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has formed its first
private power company to build and operate a 108 megawatt (MW)
power barge in the country's southwest region, a local newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newly-formed company, Khulna Power Company Ltd. (KPCL), is
composed of Wartsila NSD Power Development Ltd., a U.S.-based
independent power developer, and its two Bangladeshi partners,
the Financial Express said.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture company will invest about 100 million U.S.
dollars for putting in place a barge-mounted power plant on a
fast-track basis by mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement to be signed soon, Wartsila will have a 75
percent stake in the company while the two local investors will
each have a 12.50 percent share in the company.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 100-million-dollar investment, the company expects
to raise nearly 70 million dollars from different international
financial agencies and the remaining 30 million dollars will come
as equity from the co-investors.
</P>
<P>
The KPCL power barge will be located at Goalpara near Khulna
town 140 kilometers from Dhaka, and the plant is expected to go
into operation eight months after the signing of necessary
agreements with the authorities.

the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese government
attach great importance to the growth of the friendly ties with
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of

meeting with a delegation from the National Democratic Party (NDP)
of Egypt, led by the NDP deputy secretary-general and minister of
the Egyptian People's Assembly and Advisory Council, Kamal

</P>
<P>
On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, Li expressed welcome
to Shazli and his delegation, saying that the friendship between
the two peoples dates back to ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Since China and Egypt established diplomatic relations 41 years
ago, Li said, bilateral friendship and cooperation in various
areas such as politics, the economy and culture have developed
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The two countries share identical or similar views on many
major international issues, and have always supported each other
and cooperated with each other closely in international affairs,
added Li.
</P>
<P>
Li said he is convinced that with concerted efforts, the
relations between the two parties and the two countries will be
furthered on the basis of the Four Principles guiding
party-to-party relations and the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-Existence.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese government is ready to further economic
and trade relations with Egypt on the basis of equality and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that relevant departments of both
countries should decide on cooperative projects through
investigations and negotiations, according to the Premier.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Chinese government highly appreciates
the important role played by the Egyptian government and
people in supporting the Palestinian people's just cause, advancing
the peace process in the Middle East, and enhancing unity and
cooperation among Arab states and African nations.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Egyptian President Mubarak and the NDP, Shazli
congratulated the CPC on the successful convocation of its 15th
National Congress and the return of Hong Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Shazli said that the Egyptian ruling Party and government have
a high opinion of China's achievements, appreciate the Chinese
government's and people's position on supporting Arab people's
just cause, and are willing to make further efforts to promote the

countries.

<HEADLINE> Airbus Group to Become Corporation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The four-nation European Airbus
Industries consortium today formally announced that it will
streamline its structure by becoming a corporation with one single
management, at the beginning of 1999.
</P>
<P>
An Airbus single corporate entity would be formed on the basis
of the current structure consisting of Aerospatiale SNI of France,
British Aerospace PLC, Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain and
Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG of Germany, the companies said in a
joint press release.
</P>
<P>
The four partners had agreed to integrate all activities needed
to define, develop and produce the present and future Airbus
product line under the responsibility of one management, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
The integration has been seen as an effort to counterweigh the
merger of the Boeing Company and McDonnell Douglas of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Edzard Reuter, current chairman the Airbus supervisory board,
has announced that he would step down at the beginning of 1998 at
the latest to enable Airbus parters to nominate a new president
for the integrated management, and a new chairman for the
supervisory board.
</P>
<P>
One of the presidents of the four Airbus partners would be
elected as future chairman of the supervisory board, the companies
said.

<HEADLINE> Four Former East German Coaches Sent to Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Four former East German swimming
coaches were sent to trial Tuesday with giving banned anabolic
drugs to minors without telling either them or their parents,
according to prosecutors here.
</P>
<P>
Dieter Lindemann, who coached world and Olympic champion
Franziska van Almsick until last year, Volker Frischke, Rolf
Glaser and Dieter Krause, who all coached at the Dynamo Berlin
club were sent for trial.
</P>
<P>
The quartet were alleged to have administered drugs to teenage
swimmers from 1974 to 1989 with the agreement of the East German
sporting authorities.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday Joerg Hoffmann, who won the 400 and 1,500 meters
freestyle world titles for the newly-unified Germany in 1991 in
Perth, was quoted as saying that he was given pills containing the
banned anabolic Oral-Turinabol in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Hoffmann said on Monday that he did not know at the time what
the pills were and added he would probably not enter the world
championships next January in Perth, Australia.
</P>
<P>
Another former world record holder, Karen Koenig, said last
week popping pills was part of everyday life for swimmers in East
Germany.

<HEADLINE> Long-Term Unemployment Increases In Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Official figures today
revealed that more than one in three jobless Australians were
stuck on the long-term unemployment queue in September, sparking
opposition calls for the federal government to halt skilled
immigration.
</P>
<P>
The is the biggest monthly rise in long-term jobless numbers in
four and a half years, despite unemployment improving last month
to 8.6 percent from 8.7 percent the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics said the number of people
who are jobless for 12 months or more rose to 264,900 in September
from 247,800 the previous month. More than half of these had been
out of work for at least two years, according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said long-term unemployment as a proportion of total
unemployment rose to 33.5 percent in September from 31 percent in
August.
</P>
<P>
Federal Employment Minister David Kemp said the coalition's
employment service reforms would help cut long-term unemployment.
But he refused to put a date on when the figures were likely to
fall.
</P>
<P>
"The government is putting into place a major reform to assist
long-term unemployed people, with the contracting out of the
employment service office," he told reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
Opposition employment spokesman Martin Ferguson said the
long-term jobless queue had risen by 58,800 since the coalition
government cut Labor's Working Nation program in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson today met with West Australian nurses concerned about
federal and state government plans to bring in foreign nurses to
fill a shortage.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian government's got to say to employers 'No, we
are not prepared to let you resort to the easy option of bringing
workers in from overseas, we have got worsening unemployment in
Australia,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should adopt job policies which give local people the
skills, the training or the re-training," he added.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Business Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The joint Jordanian-Syrian Yarmuk River Committee
ended two days of meeting here today by agreeing to go ahead with
plans to construct Al Wahdeh (unity) Dam on the river to provide
the two countries with irrigation and drinking water,
semi-official Jordan Times reported.
</P>
<P>
It would take up some 400 million U.S. dollars to complete the
project, which will totally be built on Syrian territory, said
Dureid Mahasneh, the secretary-general of the Jordan Valley
Authority.
</P>
<P>
After the dam was constructed, Jordan would get 85 million
cubic meters of water annually from the river, according to
Mahasneh.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed in 1987 to build the dam but it was
postponed due to the developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Yarmuk River mainly crosses the border of Israel and
Syria and spreads branches into the territory of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- German is to provide Jordan with technical assistance
worth nearly 6 million German Marks (about 3.2 million
U.S. dollars) to finance the country's development projects,
according to four memoranda signed here Monday, semi-official
Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The memoranda were signed by Jordanian Minister of Planning
Rima Khalaf and German Ambassador to Jordan Peter Mende.
</P>
<P>
German has been extending help to the kingdom in recent years
by providing grants and aid.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan has said that political tension in the Middle
East soured a favorable outlook for its tourism industry for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies caused
tension in the region, which scared off some visitors and upset
healthy growth forecasts for Jordan's tourism in 1997, Tourism
Minister Akel Beltaji told reporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
"If the situation in Israel was what it had been in 1994 and
1995, this year 1997 we would have reached double-digit growth,"
Beltaji said.
</P>
<P>
Now Jordan forecasts for 1997 a modest 2 to 5 percent rise
from last year's 1.13 million tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Jordan managed to maintain at least modest growth this year
by marketing itself as a sole destination rather than part of a
wider Middle East tour, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has been the pillar industry for the kingdom, making
up respectively 37 percent of its foreign currency income and 11
percent of its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT, October (Xinhua) -- A three-day conference, organized
by Lebanese central bank and the banks association, urged
bankers to extend loans to small businesses, Lebanese
English-language newspaper the Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speakers from international banks, including representatives
from Egypt, the United States and Germany, highlighted the
potential for lending to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the conference, which opened Monday, said that
in other parts of the world, small business loans are mostly
extended by banks.
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon, however, the majority of the estimated 3 million
U.S. dollars of small loans is provided by non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The paper said banks in Lebanon have been reluctant to lend to
small enterprises because the banks are used to dealing with
established businesses, and lending on collateral basis.
</P>
<P>
Judith Brandsma, a World Bank specialist, said Lebanese banks
would have to toughen up their collection procedures when
dealing with small businesses.
</P>
<P>
"Banks have to be tough and serious, knocking on the
shoulders of borrowers if they are one day late," she added.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Launches Rural Travel and Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is launching a rural
travel and transport program (RTTP) to improve its road network
throughout the country for sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Officiating a workshop to launch the RTTP here today, Bennie
Mwinga, minister of local government and housing told the
participants that the poor infrastructure and deterioratig
situation of Zambia's road network, due to overloading and
insufficient funds for rehabilitation and regular maintenance,
have hampered the country's economic development and people's
daily life.
</P>
<P>
The RTTP, with the assistance of the World Bank and
coordination by the ministry of local government and housing,
aims at promoting the "immediate means of transport" in the
country. It will run a two-year period starting from 1998 and is
supported by the governments of Denmark, Norway, Sweden and
Switzerland, said a pamphlet released at the workshop.
</P>
<P>
The RTTP is a component of the sub-Saharan Africa transport
policy program (SSATP), which is a collaborative effort between
many bilateral and multilateral organizations to assist
governments to formulate and implement improved transport
policies in the region.
</P>
<P>
During his speech, Mwinga said in order to promote the travel
and transport system in the rural areas, his ministry is
addressing the "rural isolation" by formulating and putting in
place a coherent policy framework and institutional focus for the
planning, funding and maintenance of rural roads.
</P>
<P>
All the stakeholders and targeted beneficiaries are supposed
to share responsibilities within clearly defined roles and the
RTTP related costs in order to make the programs sustainable, the
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the funds to be given will be put to "good
use", Mwinga called on donor countries and organizations to
provide the "much needed financial support" to the RTTP by
adequately directing the "much desired funds" to the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
"Without donor support," said Mwinga, "it will be extremely
difficult for us to implement this well intentioned program."
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which will end on Thursday attracted more than
100 people, including the resident representative of the World
Bank, many senior government officials as well as road experts.

<HEADLINE> 3 Giant Water Projects Kicked off in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today gave the go-ahead to implement three new water and sewerage
ventures with a total cost of 1.3 billion Egyptian pounds (382.3
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
While inaugurating a housing and construction exhibition fair
on prospects of construction held at Cairo International
Conference Center, Mubarak gave the green light for the projects
through closed television circuits linked to the construction
sites.
</P>
<P>
The first project involves a sanitary drainage plant in Port
Said, the second transfers Nile water to the Red Sea resort of
Hurghada for the first time through a pipeline and the third
implicates operating untreated water pipeline from the Suez Canal
city of Qantara to Port Said.
</P>
<P>
The first project, which was build in cooperation with the
United States Agency for International Development, is among the
world's largest with a treatment capacity of 3 million cubic
meters of sewerage water per day.
</P>
<P>
The fair, entitled "Prospects of Construction", shed light on
the government's achievements and plans to provide further
potable water and sewerage networks at the national level.
</P>
<P>
Since Mubarak took office in 1981, the government has been
investing over 11 billion pounds (3.2 billion dollars) in 138 new
drinking water projects, according to Minister of Housing and
Utilities Mohamed Ibrahim Soliman.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing achievements in the past 16 years, he said the
sewerage projects in Egypt increased from only nine in 1952 to 26
in 1981, to 125 in 1997 and are expected to reach 568 in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Drinking water projects, he added, standing at 52 before 1952,
rose to 173 in 1981 and shot to 1,083 today. The target is 1,389
drinking water projects by the year 2017.

And of the 78 percent increase over 50 years ago, when some
1,387,000 criminal cases were reported, 60 percent was related to
road incidents.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Marginally Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian dollar ended
marginally weaker today as the jobs data had prompted the market
to revise its rate cut expectations, and many market participants
now think the Reserve Bank of Australia is more likely to leave
rates on hold for the time being.
</P>
<P>
The Australian currency ended at 73.78 US cents, down from
73.82, and off an intraday high of 74.15.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar rode higher on the back of a surge in the
New Zealand dollar exchange rate against the US dollar before
options- related selling saw it grind steadily lower.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand dollar rose to an intraday high of 65.19 US
cents before it closed at 64.82, up from 64.66 previously.
</P>
<P>
"Since it hit the highs, the Aussie has seen steady selling,"
said a trader. "There is good options-related selling up around
that 74.10-15 area."
</P>
<P>
Traders also said the Australian dollar continued to be
supported by a more positive economic outlook and should be able
to sustain most of the gains made last week.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank of Australia global trading manager foreign
exchange Rick Lloyd said the market is no longer expecting the
Reserve Bank of Australia to cut interest rates in the short term.
</P>
<P>
Last week's strong September labor force figures effectively
capsized previous high expectations in the market that the Reserve
Bank of Australia would move to ease monetary policy in the short
term.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 89.53 yen, compared to 89.16,
and at 1.2926 marks, from 1.2964 previously.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Optimistic About Southeast Asia Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister of Singapore
Goh Chok Tong today expressed his optimism about the Southeast
Asian economies, saying countries affected by the recent financial
turbulence in the region will be able to recover fairly quickly.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech at the 1997 East Asia Economic Summit being
held here, Goh argued that the current financial turmoil
represents only a temporary, though painful, setback to the onward
march of Southeast Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
"Just as the haze which blankets the region will clear, the
miasma of uncertainty which has affected sentiment in Asia will
after a while evaporate," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that while near-term growth in East
Asia will likely slow down, the economies in the region will not
stall because of good economic fundamentals. Most East Asian
economies run fiscal surpluses, have high saving and investment
rates and have some of the highest ratios of trade to GDP in the
world.
</P>
<P>
"Growth in foreign direct investment in the region will
continue," he said, stressing that the recent currency devaluation
in the region is unlikely to have a lasting impact on foreign direct
investment flows.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said East Asian economies have benefited
from economic globalization and financial liberalization. Although
the relaxation of capital controls by the East Asian economies has
made them vulnerable to the vicissitudes of the global market, the
governments need to liberalize their economies further rather than
to restrict the flow of trade in goods and service.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that Singapore will continue to invest heavily in
the economies of its neighbors and East Asia as a whole because it
has faith in the growth prospects of the region.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Tumble Below 17,000 Level, Then Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the stock market
here tumbled below the 17,000 line for the first time in two years
but rebounded on bargain hunting in blue chips to close the day.
</P>
<P>
During the morning session today, the key Nikkei average of 225
selected issues on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange
briefly fell below the 17,000 line for the first time in two years.
</P>
<P>
The index was the lowest since August 15, 1995, when the
average dipped as low as 16,869.15.
</P>
<P>
Traders were quoted by Japanese media reports as saying that
market participants moved to sell because of disappointment at the
government's proposed measures to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the Nikkei average rebounded to gain 101.69 points, or
0.59 percent, from the previous day's close to end at 17,306,39.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX),
covering all issues on the First Section, edged down 0.57 points,
or 0.04 percent, to 1,337.90.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the First Section came to an estimated 400 million
shares, up from Monday's 328.02 million shares.

<HEADLINE> Rural Poverty Eases in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Based on income measure, the
proportion of Bangladeshis living in poverty in rural areas fell
from 57.5 percent in 1987 to 51.7 percent in 1994, a local
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed in a recent report of an ongoing study on
rural poverty at the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies,
The New Nation said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, while 39 percent of rural households
saw improvement in their economic conditions, 17 percent saw
deterioration, and 44 percent said there had been no changes.
</P>
<P>
An important factor behind the improved rural economic
conditions has been the drastic fall in the growth of rural
population due to rapid rural-urban migration and a drop in the
natural growth of population, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The report added that migration from rural areas to cities
reduced rural population by nearly 1 percent per year during
1987-94.
</P>
<P>
Another factor is that over 80 percent of rural males and
around 70 percent of rural females now have access to emergency
credits, mostly soft loans, the report stated.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world, is now
implementing a poverty alleviation program with the assistance
from the World Bank and other donor institutions and countries.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Gas Export to Grow 20-Fold in 15 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Middle East region's gas
exports will most probably increase by about 20 folds in the 15
years to 2010, international researchers forecast here today.
</P>
<P>
Middle East is expected to sell around 140 billion cubic metres
of gas overseas a year by 2010, compared to 6.8 billion cubic
metres in 1995, according to forecasts by researchers from the
Iranian Petroleum Institute and National Iranian Oil Company.
</P>
<P>
The researchers presented their results to the ongoing 15th World
Petroleum Congress here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to their paper, Middle East gas production and marketed
consumption have shown remarkable vigour in the past decade, but are
still "anaemic when compared with the region's formidable gas
reserves".
</P>
<P>
Of the world's two major natural gas provinces, the largest one,
namely Russia, is being exploited, while the other, the Middle East,
is rather untapped, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that Russia accounts for 34.4 percent of the world's
total proved gas reserves and the Middle East 32.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Russia produced 26.6 percent of the world's total gas
output while the Middle East made up only 6.6 percent of worldwide
production.
</P>
<P>
According to researchers, the Middle East countries have worked
out plans to increase their gas production and a number of gas
development projects are under way.
</P>
<P>
During the next decade or so, they said, "market forces will be
prevalent in the decision-making process leading to large gas
export projects in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
In the first decade of the 21st century, the Middle East's
share of world gas exports, either by pipeline or in the form of
liquified natural gas, is bound to rise considerably, they said.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese leader said
here today that China is implementing its foreign policy in
conformity with the long-term interests of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, told visiting
Prime Minister Lester Bird of Antigua and Barbuda that the
independent foreign policy of peace pursued by his country is
"not an expedient measure."
</P>
<P>
It is in the interests of the people that China develops
friendly relations with all the countries in the world, including
Antigua and Barbuda, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the 20th century has witnessed rapid
economic growth, scientific progress and great suffering caused by
war.
</P>
<P>
Based on the historic experiences, Li went on, "we have to
focus on seeking world peace and common development."
</P>
<P>
He added that the Chinese government regards economic
development and the improvement of the people's living standards
as its central tasks.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC leader added that China attaches importance to its
cooperation with Antigua and Barbuda in bilateral sphere and in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
China also admires Antigua and Barbuda's role in regional
affairs, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Bird told Li that he held fruitful talks with Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has always treated other countries equally,
adding that the relations between his country and China demostrate
that big and small nations can forge equal and friendly
relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said his country is making effort to
eliminate poverty and strive for development. He added that
his country and China can conduct more economic and technological
cooperation toward this end.

<HEADLINE> Memorial to Chinese, American Pilots To Be Built in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
province has plans to build a memorial hall in its capital city of
Kunming, to the historical contributions of Chinese and American
pilots during World War Two.
</P>
<P>
It will contain wreckage of a military cargo plane discovered
earlier this year on Gaoligong Mountain by two hunters. The right
wing was broken off by a tree, part of the left wing broken off,
and the fuselage destroyed, but the characters for "China
Airlines" can be seen clearly.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts verify that it flew the "hump" over Burma
carrying war supplies during China's anti-Japanese war from 1937
to 1945. It crashed on March 31, 1943. The captain was American
and two other crew member were a Hong Kong man and a Cantonese.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese authorities on World War Two, the air
route between Kunming and India's Assam State was regarded as the
most dangerous air route in the world. The 1,100-km route passed
over the southern side of the Himalayas. The peaks there are very
high and planes had to navigate among them. Because the terrain
along the route resembled the back of a camel, the route came to
be called the "hump".
</P>
<P>
During World War Two, about 70 tons of cargo were sent to China
across this very dangerous air route, greatly contributing to
China's anti-Japanese war, and 514 planes, more than 400 of which
were American, crashed on the perilous route in a three-year
period, taking the lives of some 1,500 crew members, about 1,400
of whom were Americans.
</P>
<P>
To commemorate the friendship of the American people and the
assistance given in wartime, Yunnan province decided to build a
memorial hall and a special monument for the "hump" flights in a
suburban Kunming park.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Seeks Higher OPEC Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, Africa's number one oil
producer, now seeks to aggressively raise its crude oil
production quota set by the Organization of Petroleum Export
Countries (OPEC), the daily Champion reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Nigeria's OPEC quota has remained static at
1.865 million barrels per day (BPD) since 1984, while the actual
production had hit 2.2 million BPD last December and further rose
to 2.34 million BPD by mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
The country's oil production is expected to increase further
in the future, with the finding of new oil on the sea, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian authorities projected that the country's oil
production would hit three million BPD by the year 2000, and
shoot to four million by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper said, Nigeria's possibility of having
substantial increases in its OPEC allocation is doubtful, given
the projection that demand for OPEC oil which is currently about
28 million BPD will rise by a marginal seven million by the year
2010.
</P>
<P>
As 10 other OPEC countries are also demanding quota rises, the
possibility of Nigeria being such a leeway is doubted in OPEC
circles, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It gave the example of Saudi Arabia, which has a production
capacity of 12 million BPD, but is allocated only eight million.
</P>
<P>
Chief Mike Olorunfemi, former OPEC director of research and
senior official of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation,
projected that the world demand for crude oil would rise by only
four to five million BPD between now and the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
According to him, environmental considerations, improved
energy efficiency and increased usage of alternative energy
resources will check the demand for crude oil.
</P>
<P>
While Asia's strong economic growth will help prop up the
world demand, the report equally pointed out that former Soviet
Union and other arising oil producers will compete for the market
share with OPEC countries.
</P>
<P>
Given the gloomy possibility of a substantial rise in its
quota and the great dependence of the national economy on oil
income, the country's long-term planning body, Vision 2010
Committee has examined the scenario of Nigeria's pulling out of
the OPEC, the report said. But no further details about this were
given.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Eliminating Root of Refugee Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China has always maintained that
the refugee problems should be solved by eliminating the root
causes and providing humanitarian protection and assistance, said
Meng Xianying, head of the Chinese delegation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual meeting of the Executive Committee of
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) here
today, she said that peace and development, the two major tasks
facing the international community, are also important
preconditions for the solution to the refugee problems.
</P>
<P>
"Only by seeking peaceful settlement of disputes, promoting
economic and social development, eliminating poverty and
establishing a fair and rational new international economic order
can we create the necessary political and economic conditions for
the thorough solution to refugee problems," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the international community should adhere to the
principle of international solidarity and burden sharing by
providing humanitarian protection and assistance to refugees ad
creating conditions for the voluntary repatriation, local
integration or resettlement of refugees.
</P>
<P>
"This requires the concerted efforts of the countries of
origin, asylum countries, and countries of resettlement as well as
donors and the relevant international organizations," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that China stands for voluntary repatriation and calls
on the international community to actively promote the ideal and
most practical solution.
</P>
<P>
"In order to avoid forcible repatriation of refugees to the
countries of origin where conditions for return are not ready,
asylum countries should respect the principle of non-refoulement
and fulfill the obligation of protecting refugees," she said.
</P>
<P>
She urged the international community to support the asylum
countries in protecting refugees through sharing the heavy burden
of those economically backward developing countries hosting large
refugee populations.
</P>
<P>
When the domestic political and economic situation of the
countries of origin so permits, these countries should assume the
responsibility to accept refugees who volunteer to return and help
them reintegrate into the society, she said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Briefs HK Summit on Situation in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said here today that his country has avoided the recent
overheating currency crisis "pretty well," describing its economy
as "structurally sound."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Sixth East Asia Economic Summit organized by the
World Economic Forum, Ramos said the political and economic
situation in his country now is normal.
</P>
<P>
"our economy is structurally sound and it has avoided the
overheating that has built up in some economies (in East Asia),"
he said, quoting the World Bank as judging that Philippines has
weathered the currency crisis "pretty well."
</P>
<P>
"Given the slowdown we expect from the combined effects of the
regional currency turmoil, we have scaled down our forecast for
GNP (gross national product) growth this year from 7.5 percent
down to 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent. This rate -- while below last
year's 6.8 percent -- should keep us well within the East Asian
league," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the Philippines has been
experiencing a surge in investments, which have so far multiplied
more than five times over last year's total.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 major reform laws have been enacted in the country
during the last five years -- 63 of them on economic reform, 57 on
social reform and 38 on political reform, Ramos said, adding that
"all of these laws have resulted in a more open market system."

<HEADLINE> French Guard Injured in Brazzaville Shelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A French military guard was
slightly injured today by shells which fell near the residence of
French ambassador in Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of
Congo, reported Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
The residence of French ambassador was located in a district
controlled by Congolese President Pascal Lissouba and his ally,
Mayor of Brazzaville Bernard Kolelas, who are waging a war with
their rival, General Denis Sassou-Nguesso.
</P>
<P>
About 30 French military police are staying in Brazzaville to
guard the French embassy in central Brazzaville and the residence
of the ambassador, Bernard Cesaire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 50 French expatriates living in the
Pointe-Noire, a port city west of Brazzaville still controlled by
the forces of President Lissouba, were banned from leaving the
town by "Congolese military authorities," the report quoted French
consul in Pointe-Noire as saying.
</P>
<P>
"For three days, about 50 French civilians have been going to
the airport of Pointe-Noire to quit the city. They were prevented
from taking the planes," said the consul in a communique.
</P>
<P>
About 1,600 Frenchmen and 250 other foreigners are living in
Pointe-Noire, a main base of oil exploration of the Elf-Aquitaine
oil group of France.
</P>
<P>
No explanation had been given by "competent Congolese
authorities," the consul said, and the decision to stop the
Frenchmen from leaving was made by "a military authority instead
of the authorities really exercising the power in Pointe-Noire."
</P>
<P>
Pointe-Noire is calm now and there is no problem of security
there, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a dozen other Frenchmen and some others were
prevented from leaving two other Congolese cities, Dolisie and
Nkayi, by local military authorities, the AFP report said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Expects East Asia to Resume High Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said here today that he expects the whole of East Asia to
resume its high growth after the recent currency turmoil, noting
that the economic fundamentals of the region remain strong.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Sixth East Asian Economic Summit organized by
the World Economic Forum in the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center, Ramos pointed to the possibility of turning
this financial crisis into an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the whole of East Asia to resume its high growth
after this turmoil," the Philippine president said. "We expect
investors to be looking more closely at the political and
socio-economic regimes of East Asia from now on."
</P>
<P>
He said the question before this three-day summit, as it was
before the world's financial leaders last month here at the World
Bank/International Monetary Fund Annual Meetings, is whether or
not the currency turmoil is a turning point on the path of high
growth for the East Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
"The short answer is 'no'," Ramos emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He explained: "First, the economic fundamentals of the
countries of the region still are strong. And there still is a lot
of room for opportunity and benefit in their strategic effort to
catch up with the more advanced nations."
</P>
<P>
"Second, the security underpinning regional stability is still
in place. And it is increasingly bolstered by the economic
independence being generated by the market system that nearly all
our (East Asian) countries have adopted," he added.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the World Bank has just forecast an average gross
domestic product growth rate of 7.6 percent for East Asia over
1997-2006, he said, noting that the figure, although low compared
with those of the early 1990s, will still make East Asia the
fastest-growing region in the world over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
However, Ramos warned, the next year or two will be difficult
for some countries in the region. But he said, quoting a Chinese
proverb, "Deep worry inspires wisdom."

<HEADLINE> Genetic Engineering Mistakes "Genie in Bottle": Greenpeace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Many mistakes are occurring in
the laboratory and the environment as a result of genetic
engineering, but the warning signs are being largely ignored,
Greenpeace's European Unit alleged in a report published today.
</P>
<P>
Entitled Genetic Engineering: Too Good to Go Wrong? the report
is the first compilation of a number of different genetic
engineering developments around the world which have produced
quite unexpected and often alarming results.
</P>
<P>
The results include genetically engineered bacteria, which
unexpectedly killed beneficial soil fungi, escaped into sewers
through human error and unanticipated pathways, and have become
toxic to plants or survived when they weren't expected to.
</P>
<P>
Author of the report, Doug Parr, said it shows that things will
inevitably go wrong in genetic engineering against all the best
predictions.
</P>
<P>
As genetic engineering deals with living organisms which
reproduce, and as most of the industry is focused on engineering
plants for agricultural applications, the mistakes will be very
difficult to control once out in the fields, he added.
</P>
<P>
"It's like the genie in the bottle: once it's out, you cannot
put it back. There is very little appreciation of the inherent
unpredictability of the science of genetic engineering. Already
there are too many cases of things going wrong," said Parr.
</P>
<P>
Susan Leubuscher of Greenpeace's European Unit in Brussels
said, "the science of genetic engineering is unpredictable, but
few, from scientists to governments, dare raise the fact that
today's 'Golden Goose' of industry is laying some rotten eggs."
</P>
<P>
"In a few years' time, it will be easy to say 'we shouldn't
have done it.' Do we have to have a disaster on the scale of BSE
before the European Commission finally wakes up and ban genetic
experiments in our agriculture and our food?" said Leubuscher.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Urges Growth Networks for Asia-Europe-America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos stressed the need here today to build networks for growth
among East Asia, Europe and America in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Sixth East Asia Economic Summit organized by
the World Economic Forum, Ramos said: "The triangular relationship
among Asia, Europe and America can be a decisive influence on
global stability and progress."
</P>
<P>
"The three regions together generate almost 80 percent of
global GNP (gross national product) and some 70 percent of world
trade. There are strong synergetic possibilities in their leading
industries," the Philippine president noted.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the new century will demand that "we Asians
ensure the sustained participation of our American and European
partners in maintaining an equitable balance and continued
economic partnership."
</P>
<P>
Believing that East Asia's economic prospects will continue to
be bright, Ramos called on the related countries to begin building
 a bridge across the Asian, European and American regions for the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit started in the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Ambassador Intervenes in Trial of Ex-Vichy Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Ambassador to France, Avi
Pazner, will tour Bordeaux to support Jewish groups during the
trial of former Vichy official Maurice Papon.
</P>
<P>
Pazner and Daniel Saada, a first secretary of the embassy, are
scheduled to meet representatives of Jewish groups on Wednesday,
said an Agence France-Presse (AFP) report.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, "reliable sources" were quoted as saying, will be
at the groups' support commission near the Palace of Justice of
Bordeaux where Papon is standing trial.
</P>
<P>
Papon was accused of crimes against humanity for his role in
the deportation of some 1,500 Jews from the Gironde Prefecture in
southwest France to Nazi death camps from 1942 to 1944.
</P>
<P>
At the time, he served as the secretary general of Gironde
under the Vichy collaboration regime.
</P>
<P>
Two days after the opening of his trial, Papon, 87, was
released from jail by the Assize Court of Bordeaux on health
reasons, triggering strong protests from Jewish and civil groups.

<HEADLINE> Bright Outlook for East Asia Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- In spite of the recent
financial instability battering East Asia, bankers attending an
economic summit here were still bullish over the region's
long-term economic growth provided adjustment policy is adopted by
governments.
</P>
<P>
Five senior banking executives were present at a panel
discussion today entitled "Is the era of fast growth over in East
Asia?" as part of the East Asia Economic Summit held between
October 13 and 15.
</P>
<P>
Manu Bhaskaran, director of SocGen-Crosby, a renowned
investment bank in Singapore, pointed out that the recent
financial crisis didn't break out overnight, and instead it was an
inescapable result of accumulation of economic strains after years
of high growth.
</P>
<P>
The crisis will bring about an adjustment policy to be
implemented for about 18 months, he said, predicting that the
regional economy will return to the fast growth track in the
second half of 1999 as a result of good economic fundamentals and
a long tradition of high savings rate.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Courtis, first vice-president from Deutsche Bank Group
Asia, Japan, told the discussion that Southeast Asia's problem is
an emerging market problem.
</P>
<P>
His prescription is to liberalize the economy further, tighten
supervision, and increase investment in education and other sectors
with a vital bearing on the economic development.
</P>
<P>
If the "open approach" is adopted, the long-term outlook for
Southeast Asia is "fantastic", he said.
</P>
<P>
British-funded Jardine Matheson, as a group based in Hong Kong,
has participated in Asia's development for quite a long time.
According to the group's managing director Alasdair Morrison, the
recent crisis is "not the end of the growth". But he noted,
"growth itself is not enough, the important thing is the quality
of that growth."
</P>
<P>
His company views East Asia as "an exciting place to do
business" in the long term, he said.
</P>
<P>
The optimistic sentiment was shared by Mitsuo Sato, president
of the Asian Development Bank and Gautam Kaji, managing director
of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
East Asia doesn't lose its steam as fundamentals underlining
the growth "continue to be strong", Sato said, while Kaji believed
that "we will enter into the next millennium with the bulk of East
Asia seeing better and stronger growth."
</P>
<P>
But the two businessmen pointed out that the region is facing
challenges such as an aging population, globalization and capital
market development.
</P>
<P>
The three-day East Asia Economic Summit was organized by the
Geneva-based World Economic Forum in partnership with the Hong
Kong Trade Development Council, with the theme being "the
Asia-Europe-America triangle: building networks for growth".

CANBERRA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian shares closed
marginally lower today in a market lacking direction and looking
overseas for leads, and the market appeared cautious over spending
data due from the US this week.
</P>
<P>

Brokers said investors were holding back ahead of the float of
telecommunication giant Telstra Corp next month. "Telstra has
really taken a lot of money out of the market," they said.
</P>
<P>
"People continuing to sell the market down to pay for Telstra
was the main feature today," said Gordon Barrett of Henderson
Charlton Jones Ltd. "It was a pretty lackluster day, (with) no
driving influence."
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index finished 1.3 points lower at 2662.0.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 345.57 million shares, valued at 988.13
million Australian dollars (728.63 million US dollars), with falls
exceeding rises by 658 to 446.

<HEADLINE> CIS Participants Expects Closer Ties with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Participants from the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) at the ongoing 15th World
Petroleum Congress (WPS) showed strong wishes to increased
cooperation with China's petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
Ander Gorbunov, head of the New Technology's Center of Russian
Oil and Gas Research Institute, told Xinhua that "our institute
had good cooperation with China in the past, and we once lend a
hand in the exploration of such large Chinese oilfields as Karamay
Oilfield. Wang Tao, ex-president of the China National Petroleum
Corporation, paid a visit to our department only one month ago. We
expected the cooperation between the two sides could enter a new
phase in the future."
</P>
<P>
Grygorily Brazhyna, vice-president of the State Committee of
Oil, Gas and Oil Refining Industry of Ukraine, deemed that China's
petroleum industry has made remarkable achievements after the
country initiated its reform and opening-up drive. "Even though
the two countries have not yet conducted any project, we can
further our understanding of China's oil industry through the
WPC," he said. Before the congress, he had already visited the
Dagang Oilfield in north China's Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan is China's important partner in the domain of oil
and gas exploration. The governments of the two countries recently
signed three documents, namely the agreements on state-level oil
and gas cooperation, joint exploration and development of Uzen
Oilfield in Kazakhstan, and laying of a 3,000-km oil pipeline
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the recent three documents signed between the
governments of the two countries were of international
significance, Sarmurzina, head of the eight-member Kazakhstan
delegation, said that "we are convinced that Sino-Kazakhstan
cooperation in the 21st century will have wide prospects and great
potentials," she said.
</P>
<P>
Other delegations from CIS attending the 15th WPC include
Russia, Uzbekistan, Kirghizstan and Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
Apart from China's cooperative efforts that have made with
Russian and Kazakhstan, Chinese workers have also undertaken to
repair 100 oil wells and conduct anti-sand projects in the western
part of Turkmenistan.

<HEADLINE> Family Relationships, Major Concern of Australian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian children yearned
for more affection and understanding from their parents at a time
when family relationships were under increasing pressure, a new
national survey showed today.
</P>
<P>
A study of phone calls to Kids Help Line over four years also
showed an alarming increase in the number of callers who said they
had attempted or at least contemplated suicide.
</P>
<P>
Suicide still represented just over one percent of all calls
received, the Australian Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
"The most common theme in these calls is the need for more
affection and time from parents," Kids Help Line Research Manager
Wendy Reid said.
</P>
<P>
The study showed more than one-third of calls received in the
past four years centered on concerns about family relationships,
particularly with parents.
</P>
<P>
Kids Help Line, which celebrates four years as a national
counseling service for young people this year, has answered about
440,000 phone calls in that time.
</P>
<P>
Young females represented the largest proportion of callers to
the service, making 70 percent of all calls received.
</P>
<P>
More than half the callers were aged between 10 and 14 with the
majority of callers from the larger states -- New South Wales,
Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia.
</P>
<P>
Other significant issues of concern to Australia's youth were
sex-related, with pregnancy and contraception representing a
significant proportion of calls, Reid said.
</P>
<P>
But of deep concern was a 37 percent increase over four years
in the proportion of calls received specifically about suicide.
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent of these callers reported having attempted
suicide at least once in the past, with 22 percent reporting an
immediate intention to harm themselves, the study found.
</P>
<P>
Reid said the figures were alarming and would provide the basis
for a in-depth report to be released next year under the federal
government's Youth Suicide Prevention Project.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of calls, meanwhile, relating to child abuse
declined from 11.3 percent in 1993 to 7.7 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Problems at school, particularly victims of bullying, was also
an increasing concern among callers.
</P>
<P>
Other issues of concern to children were drugs, self-esteem and
self-image, eating disorders, grief and employment.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Israel to Jointly Make Missiles: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Israel are planning a
joint project to produce Delilah long-range missiles, local
newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Israeli Defense Forces Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin
Shahak and his Turkish counterpart Ismail Hakki Karadayi discussed
the issue during their Monday meeting, a senior military official
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
Turkey and Israel have been planning to produce long-range
missiles due to their concerns over the rising missile threat
from Iraq, Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are expected to reach an agreement on the
production of the Delilah missile with a range of up to 500
kilometers, he added.
</P>
<P>
On a return visit for the one to Israel by Karadayi last
February, Shahak arrived here last Sunday on a three-day visit to
Turkey aimed at enhancing bilateral military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Shahak is believed to have persuaded the Turkish military to
replace its tank units with Israeli-made Merkava 3 tanks, one of
the world's most advanced types.
</P>
<P>
The specific arrangement of a joint naval exercises involving
Turkey, U.S. and Israel slated for November or later is also a
major topic for Shahak's talks with Turkish officials, newspaper
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military chief's tour has drawn great attention
from the Arab countries, which have expressed their grave
concerns over the rapidly expanding Turkish-Israeli military
alliance.
</P>
<P>
In a move to downplay the Israeli military chief's Ankara
tour, Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sermet Atacanli said
Monday that Shahak's visit is a regular one.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government had repeatedly stated that the
Turkish-Israeli cooperation in military field is not directed
against any other countries.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral military cooperation was initialed in February
last year, when the two countries signed a strategic agreement in
which Turkey allowed Israeli pilots to train in its
airspace.

YANGON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Wealth Bank, a Myanmar
private bank, has initiated a call deposit account in its banking
business, becoming the first bank to introduce such service in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chairman of the bank U Aik Htun said at a press conference

bringing down the inflation rate and preventing instability of
commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Wealth Bank is one of the 25 private banks in Myanmar,
which are allowed to engage in banking business after the country
reformed its financial management system to keep in line with the

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Continue Fuel Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The importation of petroleum
products which began last June in Nigeria in the heat of the
acute fuel scarcity is to continue until April next year.
</P>
<P>
The move is to allow time for the refurbishment of the
nation's four on-and-off refineries which either have broken down
or are operating under half capacity, Petroleum Resources
Minister Chief Dan Etete said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
There are four refineries in Nigeria which were built seven to
32 years ago with total daily capacity of 445,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
Because of the old age and lack of regular maintenance due to
fund shortage, most of the units of the four refineries are
either out of order or become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the production has been reduced to half of their
capacity, which caused acute fuel scarcity that slowed down
business activities in many parts of the country, especially
between March and July this year.
</P>
<P>
The government had to resort to import to ease the situation,
and part of the foreign product was recently confirmed by the
Environmental Protection Agency to be toxic, producing a bad odor
hazardous to people's health.
</P>
<P>
As part of the efforts to put the refineries back in good
shape, the government has signed a 200-million-U.S.-Dollar
agreement to allow the French oil company Total to repair and run
the Kaduna Refinery for two years.
</P>
<P>
Oil giants Mobil and Shell have jointly carried out a
technical assessment of the maintenance work, saying that the
entire job will cost one billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report of the study is now being considered by the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and the National Economic
Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
As it will take months to finish maintenance of a plant, the
deadline for importation, originally scheduled for September, has
to be extended.

<P>
Thanks to the efforts of the UNHCR and the resettlement
countries, some 143,000 Vietnamese refugees have been resettled
over the years, she told the Executive Committee annual meeting of
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
About 67,000 migrants have been screened out as non-refugees
and returned to Vietnam through either the UNHCR Voluntary
Repatriation Program or the Orderly Repatriation Program run by
the Hong Kong government, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The cost of the Vietnamese refugee and migrant program to Hong
Kong has often been ignored or underestimated," she said. "We have
spent 8.17 billion HK dollars (over one billion dollars) by way of
direct expenditure on the program."
</P>
<P>
In addition to this, Hong Kong has advanced to the UNHCR
another 1.17 billion HK dollars (150 million dollars), she said
</P>
<P>
Apart from this fairly heavy financial burden, she said, Hong
Kong has also contributed to resolving the problem as a place of
resettlement.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, Hong Kong absorbed some 14,000 displaced
people from Indo-China. About 1,700 boatpeople have been resettled
in Hong Kong under various schemes since that period.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are still about 1,300 Vietnamese refugees,
800 Vietnamese non-refugees and over 1,000 Vietnamese illegal
immigrants in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
She said that the UNHCR is actively pursuing resettlement
opportunities for the refugees remaining in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
She called on the international community to help resettle this
final group of Vietnamese refugees stranded in Hong Kong for
years.

<HEADLINE> World Gas Trade to Grow Five Percent Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- International gas trade is
expected to grow at an average annual rate of nearly five percent
in the next 15 years as world gas consumption expands, according
to the ongoing 15th World Petroleum Congress here.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, international gas trade will amount to 400 to
510 billion cubic meters, compared to 396 billion cubic meters in
1995, Olivier Appert, a senior researcher with the French
Institute of Petroleum, said at a forum of the congress this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The figure will continue to rise to 710 to 730 billion cubic
meters by the year 2010, Appert said.
</P>
<P>
"After more than two decades of steady and sustained growth,"
he noted, "worldwide natural gas demand shows bright prospects for
further expansion."
</P>
<P>
He forecast that natural gas share in world energy balances will
increase up to 25 percent by 2010, compared to 23 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas is seen as a clean fuel, with powerful and
appreciated assets when compared with other fossil fuels, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the increase in the use of gas is closely linked to
the performances of gas technologies, mainly in the power generation
sector where the use of gas in combined cycle power plants and in
cogeneration is developing rapidly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Annual gas demand worldwide should reach around 2,500 billion
cubic metres by the year 2000 and around 3,000 billion cubic
metres by 2010, compared to 2,200 billion cubic metres in 1995,
Appert said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to note that such a global gas expansion will
concern all geographic areas, including the four main markets of
North America, Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) and the Far East.
</P>
<P>
Gas expansion will be more pronounced in the developing
countries than in the traditional markets, especially in Asia
where robust economic growth leads to stronger gas demand, he
said.

<HEADLINE> China's Central Bank Increases Duration of Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese central bank has
moved to loosen credit restrictions on some businesses by increasing
the duration of loans for operational funds.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China has called for commercial banks to
grant more loan support to large profitable enterprises
with normal production orders, a proven market for their products
and adequate capacity to pay debts.
</P>
<P>
The longest term of loans for operational funds was capped at
one year in the past. The bank has now increased that limit up to
three years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts hailed the extended loan term as a move to improve
financial services and agreed that it would play an active role in
boosting the economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the new definitions, the bank loans fall into three
categories: temporary loans for three months or less; short-term
loans between three months and one year; and medium-term loans
from one to three years.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates for the medium-term loans for operational funds
will be the same as for loans for fixed assets. For the
state-designated 512 large and medium-sized state enterprises, as
well as some others with state support, no increase in interest
rates will be permitted.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Researchers Test New Flu Cure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli researchers have for
the first time immunized a group of old people against the flu
with a nose drop containing killed strains of the flu virus.
</P>
<P>
The clinical trials were conducted by Professors Zichria Zakay
Rones and Reuven Levy from the Viology Department of the Hebrew
University's Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem, English daily
The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The nose drop, developed by Rones and Levy after years of
search for a new form of flu vaccine, is meant to create
antibodies to the flu virus in the respiratory system, through
which it enters the body and blood to provide extra protection.
</P>
<P>
It was hoped that the new clinical trials would lead to an
easy-to-use weapon against the flu. Last year, the nose drop was
proven successful in protecting healthy medical students against
the disease.
</P>
<P>
Now the medicine is being tried on a group of elderly, whose
immune systems do not react fully to an injected vaccine, but who
are most at risk for complications of the flu.
</P>
<P>
If the nose drop proves effective among the elderly, it could
save them from pneumonia and other infections that result from
flu, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Banks Urged to Fund Small Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October (Xinhua) -- A three-day conference, organized
by Lebanese central bank and the banks association, urged
bankers to extend loans to small businesses, Lebanese
English-language newspaper the Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speakers from international banks, including representatives
from Egypt, the United States and Germany, highlighted the
potential for lending to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the conference, which opened Monday, said that
in other parts of the world, small business loans are mostly
extended by banks.
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon, however, the majority of the estimated 3 million
U.S. dollars of small loans is provided by non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The paper said banks in Lebanon have been reluctant to lend
to small enterprises because the banks are used to dealing with
established businesses, and lending on collateral basis.
</P>
<P>
Judith Brandsma, a World Bank specialist, said Lebanese banks
would have to toughen up their collection procedures when
dealing with small businesses.
</P>
<P>
"Banks have to be tough and serious, knocking on the
shoulders of borrowers if they are one day late," she
added.

Minister Lionel Jospin announced a 35-hour workweek plan, Jean
Gandois submitted Monday his resignation from the presidency of
France's national employers' association CNPF, saying that he is
"more a negotiator than a killer." Gandois will be replaced by a

</P>
<P>
-- In an embattled posture to show his determination to gain a

Le Figaro:

-- Presenting his resignation from the presidency of the
national employers' association CNPF, Jean Gandois said that the
enterprises have no choice but a very hard battle without pity
with the government over the 35-hour workweek plan. Since the
national jobs conference held last Friday, Gandois had not ceased
to attack the decision by the government on 35-hour workweek.
</P>
<P>
-- The government decided Monday to choose the Alcatel Alsthom
telecommunications group as the "strategic partner" in the
privatization of state defense electronics enterprise Thomson
CSF. The government also invited the Dassault Electronics company
and the Aerospatiale airspace group to join the restructuring of
Thomson.

to 700,000 km of gas transmission lines and more than two million
km of distribution lines in the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The gas chain is in fact highly capital intensive, he said,
adding that a long-distance pipeline with a capacity of 30 billion
cubic meters a year requires an investment of 10 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than 85 projects representing about 142,600 km,
equivalent to more than three trips round the world, are being
contemplated worldwide to accompany the growth in international
trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
International projects with a short-term completion date will
generate an additional export capacity, mainly to Europe, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, new grassroots projects will be necessary to ensure
the progression of liquified natural gas trade. Appert said that
nearly 20 projects are being set forth at present, but they
haven't entered the state of development yet.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that gas projects are likely to face a
shortage of available capital, due both to the competition of many
other infrastructure projects, especially in Eastern Europe and
Asia, as well as the reduction of financial possibilities of the
traditional lender companies.
</P>
<P>
"Faced with the huge sums to be invested and the extremely long
period required for setting up new gas projects, only those
offering a good rate of return and incurring limited risks will
find the necessary financing," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Speed Up Rural Development Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
allocate 50 million Zimbabwe Dollars (four $million) to each of
the country's 10 provinces for rural development projects this
financial year, President Robert Mugabe has said.
</P>
<P>
He told hundreds of ruling ZANU (PF) officials at a meeting in
Gwanda, south Zimbabwe Monday that he directed the Ministry of
Finance to make provisions in the budget for rural development.
</P>
<P>
"For a start, 50 million will be earmarked for development
projects in each province. I want to see the money go into
projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
None of the money, he stressed, would go toward payment of
salaries. It would only be used on actual projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that while the land was important, there was need to
develop projects in rural areas like water for irrigation.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no development in rural areas unless we empower
the people. We have to give the people the means to use the
land," he explained, adding that the Ministry of Rural Resources
and Water Development had been set up, especially to spearhead
development in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe started his one-week-long meet-the-people tour which
will cover the country's eight provinces.

<HEADLINE> French Oil Developers Want Increased Cooperation with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- French oil developers attending
the 15th World Petroleum Congress (WPC) have voiced a strong
desire for closer ties with their Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"ELF group expects a fourfold increase in sales in China by the
year 2000," said Antoine Jonglas, senior vice-president of the
Department of Refining and Marketing Business Development of the
ELF, a large international oil company in France.
</P>
<P>
The ELF sold 44.8 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil products
last year, making it one of the top 10 private oil and natural gas
companies in the world, Jonglas said, adding that his company will
work in cooperation with China on more than 40 projects, including
a lubricator production base in Guangzhou and petroleum products
sales in Zhengzhou.
</P>
<P>
Another leading French oil company, TOTAL, is expected to
provide liquefied natural gas to China, and to jointly develop a
transport network for natural gas, according to Gerare Choux,
representative of TOTAL China Company.
</P>
<P>
Choux cited TOTAL as one of the first companies engaged in oil
drilling and production in China, and said that its technology
caters to the country's needs.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, another official from the French Petroleum
Institution expressed optimism about the development of the
Chinese market, which he said is "full of vigor."

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urged to Curb Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has been
urged to increase fraud penalties to curb vices like smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Two visiting World Customs Organization (WCO) technical
advisors said here Monday that Zambia, like many other developing
countries, is losing huge sums of money from transit fraud and
smuggling and therefore needs to increase criminal penalties, the
Times of Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
One of the two, Harry Waskiewicz, said, "customs should become
an agency to protect borders against the bringing in of
contraband like drugs. But right now customs are concentrating on
collecting revenue," said Waskiewicz.
</P>
<P>
He said communication equipment and record systems between
ports need to be improved for increased monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Zambia suffers most from smuggling and transit fraud where
goods passing through are diverted, off-loaded secretly and sold,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia has geographical problems because of the vast
land border and it is therefore prudent to station customs
officers alongside or increase mobile anti-smuggling teams.

<HEADLINE> 2 Suicide Foreigners Attack Philippine Military Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Two foreign suicide bombers
today attacked an army camp in the southern Philippines, killing
three soldiers before being shot dead, military spokesman Captain
Noel Detoyato said.
</P>
<P>
The bombers were identified as an Egyptian man and his
colleague who was holding "Saudi Arabian-Pakistani" travel papers,
Detoyato said, adding the attackers were aided by two Filipinos
who later fled the scene.
</P>
<P>
He said the attack on the camp was believed to be the first of
its kind involving foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The two bombers first killed the camp sentry and then forced
their way into the camp in South Cotabato province, armed with two
bags full of grenades, Detoyato said.
</P>
<P>
They began to fire guns and throw grenades when found by the
camp defenders, killing two more soldiers before being shot dead,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The military believed that the two foreigners were working with
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), a 10,000-member rebel
group which has been waging a separatist campaign in the southern
part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The MILF opened low-level peace talks with the government
earlier this year, but the two sides so far have made little
progress toward forging a peace deal.

<HEADLINE> China's Petroleum Exploration Theory Paying Off in Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- After four decades of research
and practice, China has explored and developed a number of large
oil and gas fields based on a unique petroleum exploration
theory, according to a senior oil official.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tao, senior adviser to the China National Petroleum
Corporation (CNPC), told Xinhua on Monday at the 15th
World Petroleum Congress, that the contents of the "oil
exploration theory with Chinese characteristics" include
research on continental petroleum geology, multi-layered oil and
gas concentration belts, Guqianshan oil and gas reserves, marine
oil and gas reserves found in Paleozoic Era levels, and
continental deposits found in Mesozoic and Cenozoic era geologic
layers.
</P>
<P>
China has verified five billion tons of recoverable oil
reserves by using the theory of continental petroleum geology,
Wang said. Seventyfive percent of the reserves are in China's
large oil fields, whose annual output usually exceeds 20 million
tons each.
</P>
<P>
The exploration and development of Daqing and other large
oil fields in China have ratified the theory of continental petroleum
geology, he said. Currently, 95 percent of China's crude oil and 44
percent of its natural gas come from the fields found by using
the theory.
</P>
<P>
Using the theory on multi-layered oil and gas concentration and
rolling development techniques, Chinese geologists have developed
160 oil fields in north China's Bohai Sea region, whose geological
structure is complicated.
</P>
<P>
Chinese geologists have detected more than 40 oil-bearing areas
in Renqiu and the Dongshengbu-Jing'anbu belt of north China by
using the Guqianshan oil and gas reserve theory.
</P>
<P>
Based on the study of sedimentary rock formed during the
Paleozoic Era (570 to 230 million years ago), China has found
recoverable oil reserves in the Sichuan, Tarim and
Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia basins.
</P>
<P>
Wang said Chinese scientists in recent years have made
breakthroughs in knowledge about the formation and distribution of
oil and gas reserves. Geological surveys have proved that large
gas fields similar to those in Canada's Alberta could be found in
China.
</P>
<P>
China by early next century could build up a number of large
bases with annual production ranging from 5 billion to 10 billion
cubic meters in Sichuan, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Xinjiang and the
South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
"China's oil exploration theory and practices indicate that
petroleum exploration in the country is promising," Wang
said.

of the cases were Ugandans above 12 years while 3,754 were
children below 11.
</P>
<P>
By December 1996, a cumulative total of 51,344 cases were
reported to the Surveillance Unit, of which 47,555 were people
above 12 years, while 3,789 were children below 12, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the reported cases represent a small fraction of
the actual number of AIDS cases in the country.
</P>
<P>
Opio Alex, an epidemiologist in the Health Ministry was quoted
as saying that about 95 percent of AIDS cases are acquired
through sexual transmission.
</P>
<P>
It is now a decade and a half since the first cases of AIDS
disease were reported in Uganda. And now Uganda ranks top in
Africa in suffering AIDS.

<HEADLINE> World's Oil, Gas Demand Expected to Remain Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The demand for petroleum and
natural gas is expected to remain stable, said a senior official
at the 15th World Petroleum Congress (WPC).
</P>
<P>
Miguel Bechelli, vice-president of WPC, told Xinhua Monday that
the price of crude oil is expected to fluctuate between 18 and 22
U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum will remain one of the main energy sources until the
year 2050, he predicted. "Gas production in this period will
increase, but not by a big margin," he said.
</P>
<P>
Data from western oil companies indicate that the world's
proven oil reserves in 1996 rose by 2 percent over 1995. Of those
reserves, the Middle East has 65 percent; Latin America, 12
percent; Europe, 9 percent; Africa, 6 percent; and the remaining 4
percent each in the Asia-Pacific region and North America.
</P>
<P>
Bechelli, of Argentina, said the reserves in Latin America
totaled 166 billion barrels, of which 90 percent is in Venezuela
and Mexico. "The resources in our continent allow developers to
explore for 23 years," he said, adding that the 270 billion
barrels of super-heavy oil in Venezuela may extend the development
period to 62 years.
</P>
<P>
Bechelli said that the 15th WPC offers an opportunity for China's
petroleum industry and their foreign counterparts to enhance their
mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
In the six years after Argentina was host for the 13th WPC, he
said, a large amount of foreign capital poured into that South
American country. Argentina's oil output increased by 85 percent
after that, and natural gas production by 30 percent. In 1994
Argentina became a crude oil exporter and "started to export
natural gas," he said.

<HEADLINE> Road Accidents Rise in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Road traffic accidents in
Zambia have soared to 1,000 deaths per year and the situation may
worsen unless efforts are made to reverse the trend, "Zambia
Daily Mail" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted London Ngoma, director of the National Roads
Safety Council (NRSC), as saying here Monday that things on the
Zambian roads are getting serious and will result in a
complicated traffic situation especially in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Aeron Thomas, a road safety consultant, attributed the safety
situation to the increased number of cars on the roads coupled
with poor traffic regulation enforcement, said the daily.
</P>
<P>
Ngoma advised that to alleviate road problems on the Zambian
roads, the NRSC has taken measures to make all road traffic stake
holders have an input in a proposed road safety action plan.
</P>
<P>
She also noted that traffic law enforcement in Zambia is
inadequate because there are several loopholes that enable
offenders to get away with offenses.
</P>
<P>
A workshop will open soon to cover subjects on road safety
management, accident data system, road safety engineering,
traffic law enforcement and traffic legislation, according to the
daily.

<HEADLINE> First Wafer Fabrication Plant to Be Ready in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will have its
first wafer fabrication plant ready by the end of 1999 to push its
electronics industry to a new high.
</P>
<P>
The semiconductor wafer fabrication plant is a joint venture
between Malaysia's Khazanah Nasional Bhd (National Treasury
Limited) and the United States' Atmel Corporation, a leading
manufacturer of a broad range high performance, low power
non-volatile memory and logic integrated circuits, for which an
agreement was signed here today.
</P>
<P>
Khazanah, the government's investment arm, takes up 40 percent
equity in the joint venture while the other 60 percent would be
taken up by Atmel, Khazanah's managing director Mohd Sheriff Mohd
Kassim said.
</P>
<P>
The initial project cost is 830 million U.S. dollars, of which
275 million U.S. dollars will be funded by equity, he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to start ground work in February 1998
and will take about 18 months to complete.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will process and fabricate eight-inch wafers,
using initially 0.35 micron CMOS technology and subsequently
migrating to 0.25 micron technology, thus giving Malaysia a
leading edge wafer fabrication facility.
</P>
<P>
It is capable of producing 7,000 wafers per week and generating
a revenue of 400 million U.S. dollars per year after full
production.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture has a 100 percent buy back guarantee from
Atmel for a 10 year period.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Seek Ways to Curb Deterioration of Sown Pasture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists here have
succeeded in controling the degeneration of sown pasture lands in
the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau after seven years of research efforts.
</P>
<P>
The conservation of pasture in the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau has
been listed as one of the major state science and technology
research programs.
</P>
<P>
Wang Gang, a professor at a state laboratory on arid land
agro-ecology attached to Lanzhou University, said after years of
experiments his lab had discovered ways to effectively control
weeds and the deterioration of pasture land. Those methods include
fertilizers, grazing as well as weed removal.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that one-tenth hectare of pasture in the plateau was
sufficient to feed a sheep, matching the level of countries with
advanced animal husbandry such as New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Adopting the newly developed techniques, Wang said, virtually
eliminates weeds and more than 90 percent of the grass is sown
forage grain.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the Chinese government has decided to expand use of
the techniques into 25,000 hectares of sown pasture in the
Yunnan-Guizhou plateau.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, the Chinese government has promoted a
large-scale operation on developing pasture in south China. After
chopping or burning down shrubs on pasture lands in the
Yunnan-Guizhou plateau, scientists and technicians sowed quality
grass seed. One county in Guizhou province had 10,000 hectares of
forage grassland seeded by air. In the first two or three years,
the sown forage grass grew very well. However, the sown pasture
faced a large scale invasion of weeds and a reduction of forage
grass. Wang's lab dedicated years to solving the problems
hindering further development of sown pasture.

<HEADLINE> Siamese Twins Separated Successfully in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- South African doctors at
Soweto's Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital on Monday successfully
separated two Siamese girls after a 12-hour operation, South
African press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Conditions of the Siamese twins were "very stable" after the
operation on Monday night, said Dr John da Fonseca, head of the
operation team.
</P>
<P>
"They are both doing well and have all the vital organs they
need. If they don't contract an infection, they will be out of
intensive care within four to five days," he said.
</P>
<P>
The six-month-old girls had multiple abnormalities, but they
would be able to lead normal lives, said the doctor.
</P>
<P>
The twins had been joined from the abdomen down to their legs
and had had fused genitalia, fused livers divided by a septum,
and had shared a large bowel and part of a small bowel.
</P>
<P>
Due to the absence of anuses, the doctors had to give each
twin a colostomy -- use a piece of colon to create an anus. The
pelvises of the girls were also reconstructed.
</P>
<P>
However, they were found during the operation that they were
not sharing a bladder as previously feared. They also had two
normal kidneys each.
</P>
<P>
They also had two vaginas each. Da Fonseca said they would
need both vaginas in their later years to avoid the accumulation
of menstrual blood.
</P>
<P>
The girls would have to walk with a gait because both would
have one short leg, their spines were deviated and they were
club-footed.
</P>
<P>
But these problems could be addressed with, among other
remedies, physiotherapy, Da Fonseca said.
</P>
<P>
The girls were born on April 14 and were transferred to the
hospital two days later.

<HEADLINE> World Gas Trade to Grow Five Percent Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- International gas trade is
expected to grow at an average annual rate of nearly five percent
in the next 15 years as world gas consumption expands, according
to the ongoing 15th World Petroleum Congress here.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, international gas trade will amount to 400 to
510 billion cubic meters, compared to 396 billion cubic meters in
1995, Olivier Appert, a senior researcher with the French
Institute of Petroleum, said at a forum of the congress this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The figure will continue to rise to 710 to 730 billion cubic
meters by the year 2000, Appert said.
</P>
<P>
"After more than two decades of steady and sustained growth,"
he noted, "worldwide natural gas demand shows bright prospects for
further expansion."
</P>
<P>
He forecast that natural gas share in world energy balances will
increase up to 25 percent by 2010, compared to 23 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas is seen as a clean fuel, with powerful and
appreciated assets when compared with other fossil fuels, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the increase in the use of gas is closely linked to
the performances of gas technologies, mainly in the power generation
sector where the use of gas in combined cycle power plants and in
cogeneration is developing rapidly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Annual gas demand worldwide should reach around 2,500 billion
cubic metres by the year 2000 and around 3,000 billion cubic
metres by 2010, compared to 2,200 billion cubic metres in 1995,
Appert said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to note that such a global gas expansion will
concern all geographic areas, including the four main markets of
North America, Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) and the Far East.
</P>
<P>
Gas expansion will be more pronounced in the developing
countries than in the traditional markets, especially in Asia
where robust economic growth leads to stronger gas demand, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Survey Reveals Pollution Data in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A survey on industrial pollution
in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China has revealed that most of
the township enterprises in the region pose no major threat to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The survey, the first done among some 1,000 local township
firms, says only 128 enterprises, or 10 percent of the total
surveyed, cause pollution. They are mostly mines, cement
factories, wollen mills and lumber and grain processing
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"But the scale of those enterprises are small, with some only
having a couple of people, and they are scattered in 42 counties
of seven cities," states the report. "At present they constitute
no threat to Tibet's ecological environment."
</P>
<P>
Rural firms in Tibet each year discharge 450,000 tons of
industrial waste water, 11,000 cubic meters of
waste gas and 2,000 tons of industrial dust, the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Those enterprises also produce 51,000 tons of solid industrial
waste annually, of which more than 30,000 tons is recycled.
</P>
<P>
Ecologists say that rural firms in Tibet cause little pollution
compared with like companies in other parts of China. However,
they caution that as more township enterprises are being set up in
cities in the region, they will sooner or later
have a negative effect on its environment.
</P>
<P>
"Tibet will never develop its local economy at the cost of its
environment," said Locang Puncog, head of the Tibet Environmental
Protection Bureau. He said the local government is working on a
series of regulations on pollution control in township
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from enhanced monitoring, we will take measures to limit
the number of mines, gradually phase out outdated techniques and
equipment, and promote recycling technology," Locang said.

a new post to flex his muscle in market competition: chairman of a
joint venture company.
</P>
<P>
Hunan province held a trade fair in September, at which the
American Rice Tech-AG signed a contract with the province's Hybrid
Rice Research Center, where Yuan is working. The two sides agreed
to invest 10 million U.S. dollars to establish the Yuan Longping
Hybrid Rice International Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will aim at spreading the use of hybrid rice
technologies, raising rice production efficiency and promoting
world grain growth. It will bring large, stable and lasting
returns to the partners, an official at the research center said.
</P>
<P>
The company will have sales of 67.8 million yuan this year,
including profits of 5.69 million yuan, according to feasibility
studies.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to plant hybrid rice on 3.3 million hectares
in China by 2000, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Some people expressed concern about losing an excellent
scientist, but Yuan said the joint venture would help expand the
use of hybrid rice to the rest of the world. By doing business he
will have more capital to support his research, Yuan said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's GDP Forecast to Grow by 6.8 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Institute of
Economic Research (MIER) has forecast that Malaysia's real gross
domestic product (GDP) will grow by 6.8 percent next year with
inflation higher at 4.8 percent, its executive director Mohamed
Ariff said here today.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic growth for this year has also been
revised downwards to 8.0 percent from 8.2 percent, he told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
In the first and second quarters of 1997, Malaysia's real GDP
growth rates were 8.5 percent and 8.4 percent respectively
compared to the corresponding quarters in 1996, and the inflation
rate for the first half of 1997 was at less than 3 percent,
according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The sharp depreciation of the Malaysian ringgit against the
U.S. dollar and most of the other major currencies since July has
cast a cloud of uncertainty over the economic prospects for the
rest of this year, particularly in the final quarter, Mohamed
Ariff said.
</P>
<P>
However, he was confident that the export sector will continue
to grow for the rest of 1997 and 1998, although at a slower rate.
He said it was not all a bad year as the MIER had also forecast
that exports of goods and non-sector services would grow by 11.7
percent in 1998 as a result of a boost from the weaker ringgit.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, import of goods and non-sector services is
expected to grow by 10.5 percent next year with some form of
domestic substitution expected in view of the higher cost of
imports from a weak ringgit.
</P>
<P>
He said that the labor market is still expected to be in a
healthy state with unemployment rate up at 2.6 percent next year
from the present 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Private investment is projected to grow by 7.1 percent in 1998
while private consumption growth is forecast at 5.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Has Enough Water Reserve: Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- South African water
reserve is "sufficient for two to three years" to withstand
drought likely resulted from the coming El Nino weather
phenomenon, the Department of Water Affairs has said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the best storage levels in 77 years at major
reservoirs, water delivery was not expected to become a problem
for at least two to three years, which matched El Nino's life
expectancy, said the statement issued on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The department said South Africa experienced above-average
rainy seasons during 1995/96 and 1996/97, and the current storage
state at major reservoirs was the best on record since 1920.
</P>
<P>
El Nino, which is expected to cause a warming of the Pacific

<HEADLINE> China to Face Shortage in Domestic Gas Supply in 2020 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Domestic supply of natural gas
is likely to be unable to meet demand in China in the year 2020, a
group of Chinese researchers predicted.
</P>
<P>
By 2020, the annual output of natural gas is expected to reach 58
to 85 billion cubic meters, while consumption will hit 88 to 105
billion cubic meters, according to the researchers' paper submitted
to the ongoing 15th World Petroleum Congress.
</P>
<P>
But in the short term, supply and demand of natural gas will be
basically balanced, with output estimated at 26 to 35 billion
cubic meters and consumption at 26 to 29 billion cubic meters in
2000, according to researchers with the China National Star
Petroleum Corporation.
</P>
<P>
To date, a total of 138 gas fields have been discovered in 21
sedimentary basins in China, with annual production standing at
20.13 billion cubic meters last year.
</P>
<P>
The researchers shared the view that potential increase of
natural gas use in the future will be concentrated in residential
and commercial sector that is expected to account for more than 30
percent and 50 percent of the national total in the years 2000 and
2020 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they noted that natural gas will also play an
important role in the chemical industry, which will account for 26
percent and 23 percent of the nation's total gas consumption in
2000 and 2020 respectively.
</P>
<P>
To meet the future demand for natural gas, particularly beyond
the year 2020, they said, explorations and developments of
conventional natural gas should be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is necessary for China to seek other sources of
natural gas, including increased imports, coalbed methane, tight
sandstone gas and deep gas, they said.

<HEADLINE> Advanced Oil Sands Technology to Make Canada Growing Oil Supplier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Alberta, one of the ten
provinces and two territories in the country, has found oil sands
reserves of 1.7 billion barrels of bitumen in place, and is thus
blessed with a huge potential for large-scale exploration by using the
new-generation oil sands processing technology.
</P>
<P>
Stephen West, minister of energy of Alberta Province, made this
remark while addressing the ministerial panel of World Petroleum
Congress today.
</P>
<P>
West noted that among the province's oil sands reserves, 300
billion barrels -- the equivalent to the entire proven reserves of
Saudi Arabia -- are considered potentially recoverable.
</P>
<P>
Pioneering in oil sands extraction technologies, Alberta was the
inventor of the steam-assisted gravity drainage technology, which is
helping open up the province's oil sands to development.
</P>
<P>
The latest breakthroughs in the sands processing industry, such
as the SAG-D technology, could triple the oil sands production of Alberta
to as much as 1.2 million barrels a day, according to West.
</P>
<P>
"This would mean a total oil sands investment of up to 25 billion
US dollars over the next 20 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Alberta now produces 905,000 barrels of conventional oil and
100,000 tons of bituminous and subbituminous coal, accounting for
72 percent and nearly 50 percent, respectively, of the total of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
The city of Calgory of Alberta Province is elected the host for
the 16th World petroleum Congress in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Juma Appeals for Aid to Health Delivery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma has appealed for reduction of debt burden of
developing countries for the interest of better health delivery.
</P>
<P>
Debt burden has seriously affected provision of health
services in third world countries, Juma said when he opened the
Eight Congress of the World Federation of Public Health
Associations in Arusha on Monday, according to a news dispatch
reaching here today from the northern Tanzanian town.
</P>
<P>
He noted that developing countries needs support of the
industrialized world in providing better health care but "debt
burden has adversely affected provision of health services in
third world countries".
</P>
<P>
Juma cited example of Tanzania which is currently servicing an
external debt of more than 6.4 billion U.S. Dollars, saying that
the debt servicing is expected to reach 422.4 million US Dollars
by the end of December this year.
</P>
<P>
"Easing of debt burden is a crucial area of support," said
Juma, adding that "we cannot continue to shoulder our debt burden
and to meet our social and economic responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
He urged developed countries to meet their commitment of
setting 0.7 percent of the GDP for assistance to developing
countries.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela, China to Cooperate in Emulsified Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela and China will
jointly exploit and produce emulsified oil for mutual benefit,
said Carlos Borregales, president and chief executive of
Venezuela's Orinoco Bitumen Company, at the 15th World Petroleum
Congress (WPC) Monday.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela has 40 billion tons of bitumen reserves, while China
has worked out a plan for energy development. The Orinoco bitumen,
a new type of fuel, has found favor with power stations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Orinoco emulsified oil -- a term invented by Venezuela -- is a
mixture of bitumen, water and some chemicals, and has become a
preferred fuel for power plants and other industrial uses.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China and Venezuela signed an agreement for 320
million U.S. dollars to cooperate on the production of emulsified
oil, now widely used in Shangdong province and Shanghai
municipality in east China.
</P>
<P>
Borregales said Venezuela-China cooperation has been effective
so far and offers encouraging possibilities.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela is the world's largest bitumen producer and has set a
goal of 20 million tons annually of emulsified oil. It had 4.17
million tons of exports last year and expects 4.7 million this
year.

<HEADLINE> Importance of Environmental Protection Stressed at WPC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Participants to the ongoing
15th World Petroleum Congress have reached consensus that it is
vital for the industry to make more efforts to tackle
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
They have held shared concern about maintaining the momentum of
global economic growth while promoting environmental protection
worldwide, Paul Tempest, director general of the congress, said at
a press conference here this morning.
</P>
<P>
But as conditions differ from country to country, it is
impossible to impose a single global standard on the issue and
countries have to deal with it in line with their own conditions,
Tempest said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Tempest said, stepping up environmental protection
provides immense opportunity for the world oil and gas industry as
it develops into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, participants have been fully aware of the
process of globalization and called for acceleration in
technological transfer on the global market.
</P>
<P>
World economic growth has been dependent on supply of oil and
gas, and countries need to increase cooperation in the field,
Tempest said.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Oil Industry Ready to Open Wider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran has survived the US
sanction and is actively pursuing international cooperation in its
petroleum industry, said Seyed Mehdi Hosseini, advisor to the
Minister of Petroleum on international affairs today at the 15th
World Petroleum Congress (WPC).
</P>
<P>
He said Iran recently signed two petroleum projects with
France, Malaysia and Russia, and has extended its international
cooperation to both the on-shore and off-shore sectors.
</P>
<P>
The names on Iran's favorite investor list also include China
and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS). Hosseini said that his country has established a sound
cooperative relations with China in petrochemical area, and will
negotiate some oil exploration projects in the near future.
</P>
<P>
He said he thought that the Iran-China cooperation in oil
exploration is of good prospectives, though it is still on a
beginning stage.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hosseini said that his country's oil sector recovered
from the Iran-Iraq War by increasing its daily oil production
capacity from 2.4 million tons to 4.1 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In August, 1996, the United State passed a law in opposition to
no-American companies which invested 40 million dollars or more in
Iranian oil and gas sector. The investment ceiling dropped to 20
millions in last August, Hosseini said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria To Remain A Key Player in Oil Production For 40 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- With the application of
advanced techniques, a lot more oil will be found in the Niger
Delta and other basins, and Nigeria will remain a key player in
crude production for the next two decades or more and about 125
years for gas, a senior Nigerian oil official said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ministerial panel of the ongoing 15th World
Petroleum Congress here today, Chief Dan Etete, minister of
petroleum resources, said that Nigeria is the world's tenth
largest oil exporter with proven reserve of about 25 billion
barrels and 124 trillion cubic feet of gas.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the Nigerian petroleum industry has
benefited from the world-wide technology advancement. In the
upstream operations, activities above moved from the onshore to
deeper offshore.
</P>
<P>
And hydrocarbon reserves have correspondingly increased from
about six billion barrels in the 1960s to about 25 billion barrels
of oil today, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the oil and gas industry accounts
for about 85 percent of the country's total government revenue, 95
percent of foreign earnings and 20 percent of the Gross Domestic
Product.
</P>
<P>
The official said that in line with recent growth world-wide,
the Nigerian government has continued to encourage private sector
participation in order to facilitate the development of the
petroleum industry in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He said that with average production of about 2.2 billion
barrels of oil per day, Nigerian will remain an important oil
producer and exporter in the world.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Urged to Further Devaluate Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has urged
Bangladesh to have a competitive exchange rate for its currency by
further devaluating the taka in relation to the U.S. dollar, now
standing at less than 45 taka to 1 dollar.
</P>
<P>
The foreign currency reserves of Bangladesh, which stood
recently at 1.7 billion dollars, were at a critical level, said
the bank's annual economic review on Bangladesh, which was
prepared for the annual Bangladesh Aid Consortium meeting
scheduled for early next month.
</P>
<P>
Calling further devaluation of the taka essential, the review
pointed out that a 4.6-percent devaluation of the currency since
July last year was not enough to outweigh a 4-percent appreciation
of the real effective exchange rate of the taka.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country's export competitiveness did not
improve and practically eroded following sharp devaluation of
currencies in the neighboring South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
However, owing to a healthy 14-percent export growth and a
phenomenal increase in remittances from abroad, the current
account deficit in external trade came down from over 5 percent of
the GDP during 1995-95 to less than 3 percent during the last
fiscal 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Imports last year also declined to 3.5 percent from 18 percent
in fiscal 1995-96. The drastic decline in imports slowed down
rapid erosion of the government's foreign currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
But low aid disbursement at 1.8 billion dollars last year and a
120 million dollars capital flight from the stock market offset
further improvement in the current account deficit, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
It said pressure on foreign exchange reserves might continue
and even soar with recovery in industrial activities and ensuing
pickup demand for imports.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed the need for rebuilding the reserves and
said the competitive exchange rate would strengthen the country's
export base.
</P>
<P>
It recommended steps for improving the capital accounts
balance, saying it is essential for the country to expedite
foreign aid utilization by removing bottlenecks to project
implementation, meeting policy commitments and attracting more
private foreign capital inflows.

<HEADLINE> British Queen Asks India, Pakistan to End Hostility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- British Queen Elizabeth II on
Monday called upon India and Pakistan to bury "historical
hostilities" for good, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The queen made the remarks even as India and Britain mounted a
damage control exercise to defuse a diplomatic row over Kashmir
which threatened to mar the third state visit to India by the
British monarch.
</P>
<P>
In her speech at a banquet hosted by Indian President Kocheril
Raman Narayanan here last night, the queen referred indirectly to
the hostility that continued to exist between India and Pakistan
after 50 years of their independence by calling for better ties
between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"If countries in the region share a goal and understand that by
working together they give themselves a better chance of achieving
it, then historical hostilities can be buried for good," she said
in her speech.
</P>
<P>
Her remarks, however indirect, can only lengthen the shadow
cast upon her visit by the diplomatic row between India and
Britain over Kashmir, the local press said.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic crisis arose on the eve of the queen's arrival
in India from Pakistan, the first leg of the queen's South Asia
tour.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who is
accompanying the queen on her current tour, offered in Islamabad
to mediate on the Kashmir issue, a move which has been strongly
opposed by India.
</P>
<P>
In response to the reports, Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral,
who was visiting Egypt, reportedly said in Cairo on Saturday
evening that "a third-rate power" like Britain was "presumptuous"
in saying it had a historical responsibility to resolve the
Kashmir issue considering that it had created it in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent damage control exercise, both India and Britain
denied such reports on Monday prior to official meetings between
the queen and Indian leaders.
</P>
<P>
The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, arrived here on
Sunday night for a week-long state visit on the occasion of the
50th anniversary of India's independence.

<HEADLINE> 18 more Dengue Cases Reported in New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The dengue virus is steadily
expanding in the Indian capital of New Delhi with 18 more cases of
the disease reported on Monday, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The total number of dengue cases in various hospitals in the
capital has risen to 181. Two patients, including a nine-month-old
girl, have already died due to the deadly virus.
</P>
<P>
Despite the local authorities' assurances that all steps are
being taken to keep the aedes mosquitoes, which transmit the
dengue virus, at bay, people in various localities still complain
about inadequate measures.
</P>
<P>
Doctors here have warned people against taking fever cases
lightly because early detection of dengue makes its treatment
easier.
</P>
<P>
They explained that if there is any delay in taking the patient
to the doctor, dangerous internal bleeding may set in.
</P>
<P>
An epidemic of dengue fever here last year claimed hundreds of
lives with nearly 10,000 people hospitalized.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Fully Confident of China  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft will continue to lay
great importance on the Chinese market because of "the tremendous
potential of the country's market and economic development." Duh
Jia-bin, president of the Microsoft (China) Co, Ltd, said during a
recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
China's three million annual sales of computer and huge
intranet network that call for facilitating software, together
with adequate talents for soft and hardware development, are
favorable for the business of this largest software producer of
the world.
</P>
<P>
On September 1, four companies registered in China became
Microsoft's first authorized technological support centers. This
marked the beginning of the introduction of its global
technological support system into China.
</P>
<P>
The simultaneous launching of the Chinese and English versions
of the latest Microsoft Internet browser, Internet Explorer 4.0,
in Beijing and San Francisco ended the trend of the former
appearing later than the latter.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Micorsoft has in the country more than
300 authorized sales agents, and a direct technological support
relationship with 30-plus software developers and 30-plus central
government organs and banks.
</P>
<P>
And to this day, 98 percent of Microsoft's employment are
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Duh attributed the achievements of Microsoft since it
established the Beijing representative office, the predecessor of
the China company, to the country's improvement of investment
climate.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he noted, the Chinese Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications will soon increase the band width of
telecommunications optical fibre to 45k.
</P>
<P>
This means the information transfer capacity of China's
telecommunications industry will be elevated to the international
advance level, Duh said.

<P>
Duh went on to say that Microsoft takes a positive attitude
toward software piracy, an unfavorable factor in the investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
He expressed admiration for "the resolution of the Chinese
Government in promoting original software, and taking the leading
in using it."
</P>
<P>
China's efforts in cracking down on piracy have been
successful, Duh said, with pirate products reducing and the pirate
ratio dropping.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed coercive measures like sanctions "are no
good to Microsoft and the Chinese partners and against the
interests of the two countries."
</P>
<P>
"I hold that economic and political issues should be
disintegrated." said Duh, who went lobbying in the US Congress this
April as member of the US Chamber of Commerce in China.
</P>
<P>
To grant China permanent most-favored-nation (MFN) trading
status and back its accession in the World Trade Organization
(WTO) are "the basis for China's competition on an equal footing
with other countries on the international arena, and an
encouragement to its further opening of the market." he added.

<P>
SANTIAGO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A seminar named "Education
Statistics of Mercosur", opened here today, which aims to promote
exchange of experiences in education reforms among member
countries of South American Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
"Since we have three million students, while Brazil have 30
million students, ... the exchange of experiences is going to be
very rich, for it will help us innovate and improve our education
techniques", Chilean Education Minister, Jose Pablo Arellano, said
in his opening speech.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Mercosur goes beyond an economic
integration, which is to include education and cultural topics.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Arellano added, it is necessary that all member
countries have a common statistical and background base.
</P>
<P>
The seminar also intends to present the systems of statistical
taxonomic indicators on education, and to facilitate the adoption
of agreements to implement a common education statistical basis
for the five member countries of Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the production and distribution of education
statistics in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Chile attended the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> WWF, Greenpeace Say Mediterranean Fish Endangered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Excessive fishing has made
swordfish and tuna endangered species in the Mediterranean,
Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) warned today.
</P>
<P>
The steady increase of fishing fleets in the Mediterranean is
drastically reducing the number of sought-after fish there, the
environmental groups said at the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization's general council on fishing in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The growth of fishing activity by 5 to 7 percent every
year has above all reduced the population of adult tuna by 83
percent in the last 20 years, young tuna by 40 percent and
swordfish.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 fishermen work in the region, bringing in 1.3
million tons of fish for annual revenues of 3.8 billion U.S.
dollars, the groups said.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace and the WWF called on Mediterranean countries and
the European Commissioner in charge of fishing to stop the decline
and prevent the species' extinction.
</P>
<P>
The groups also criticized the council's work, saying it had not
done enough in the region.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela, U.S. to Reduce Oil Dependence on Other Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela and the United
States, together with other oil producing countries in the western
hemisphere, will join efforts to help reduce the continents' oil
dependence from other regions.
</P>
<P>
This commitment was included in the energy cooperation
agreement signed by Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera and
visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton here today.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela was the first leg of Clinton's first official visit
to South America, which will also cover Brazil and Argentina. The
visit was aimed to strengthen U.S. trade cooperation with the
three countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Energy Secretary Federico Pena, who accompanying Clinton
during the visit, also discussed with his Venezuelan counterpart,
Erwin Arrieta, and Luis Giusti, president of the state-owned
Venezuelan Oil Company, details of the two countries' cooperation
on oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Pena said an increase in Venezuela's crude oil production would
help "reduce U.S. dependency on other oil suppliers in less stable
regions of the world."
</P>
<P>
Pena also noted that this circumstance is key and beneficial to
Venezuela, which is trying to expand its oil industry so as to
promote economic development.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela is the U.S. biggest oil supplier. Some 70 percent of
Venezuelan oil enter into the U.S. market. From January to
September this year, the country exported 1.7 million barrels of
oil to the U.S. every day.
</P>
<P>
Despite the high level of production from Mexico, Colombia,
Ecuador, Canada, Venezuela and the U.S. in the western hemisphere
still has to import a considerable oil quota from other regions in
the world.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports Rise Sharply in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The weak baht gave Thailand's
exports a 54.14-percent year-on-year boost in September, up 15.53
percent over August this year, according to the Thai Finance
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Exports have risen each month since the Thai government cut the
baht loose on July 2, increasing in baht terms by 26.6 percent,
27.12 percent and 54.14 percent in July, August and September
respectively against the corresponding months of last year.
</P>
<P>
The baht has lost about 40 percent of its value since July.
</P>
<P>
Exports in September totaled 177 billion baht (5.05 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Exporters here were quoted today by the local press as saying
the result had been expected as the weaker baht has substantially
boosted offshore sales, especially of footwear and food products.

PYONGYANG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Rodong Sinmun, the official
newspaper of the Worker's Party in Korea, today carried a
commentary refuting the U.S. charge of a so-called "North Korean
threat."
</P>
<P>
The commentary pointed out that "the most dangerous threat to
existence is not us but the United States," adding that "we never
threatened the U.S., but the U.S. is threating us."
</P>
<P>
The commentary came in response to the recent U.S. report on
national security strategy, which accused the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) as being a dangerous threat to existence
and has a wild ambition to challenge the U.S. military presence.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said the accusation confounds black and white,
attempting to sabotage and strangle the socialism of the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"So long as the U.S. continues to adopt an invading and hostile
policy towards the DPRK, so long as the U.S. continues to increase
its military presence in South Korea and other neighboring
regions, the DPRK has no alternative but to strengthen its
self-defense forces," said the commentary.

<HEADLINE> Giant-Killing Paddler Emerges from Nowhere in Table Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- To steal the limelight in the
table tennis competitions, teenager paddler Zhang Yining boasted
of a clean slate of six straight wins at the table tennis team
competitions of the Chinese Eighth National Games.
</P>
<P>
Winning the tag as a "Killer of Stars", Zhang of Beijing came
from nowhere to topple the top paddlers in the world, including
second-ranked Li Ju, former doubles world champion Qiao Hong and
seventh-ranked Yang Ying.
</P>
<P>
Ten days after her 15th birthday, the baby-faced Zhang betrayed
her elder sisters on the court with feeble looks, shyness and dumb
expressions.
</P>
<P>
Once upon the court, the Beijing native in hand-shaking grip
became surprisingly steady with her forehand and backhand loops.
</P>
<P>
"Winning over the veterans enhanced my confidence, but I myself
knew clearly that I still have a long way to go, and I will exert
every efforts to improve my rough skills in the first three
attacks," said the teenager upon a gust of praises.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a challenger without any pressure, that was the key point
for my victories over the world famous veterans," explained Zhang
who still refrained from smiling.
</P>
<P>
In the women's team finals which Jiangsu eventually won over
Beijing, Zhang strided upon the court for the opener against
doubles world champion Yang Ying of Jiangsu, the best pen-holding
woman fast attacker in the world.
</P>
<P>
Yang was seemingly to seal her game with ease after winning the
first set 21-8 through varified serves and fierce attacks.
</P>
<P>
All on a sudden, Zhang rallied back to break her rhythm by
firing a flurry of bullets towards Yang's backhand before taking
the last two games 21-18, 21-12.
</P>
<P>
En route to the finals, Zhang achieved the same feat in the
semifinals by toppling 10th-ranked Qiao Hong from one-set down
15-21, 21-8 and 23-21.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yuansheng, vice head coach of the Chinese national squad,
was generous in his praises, depicting her as a budding hopeful
with great potential.
</P>
<P>
"She has displayed strong skills in backhand attacks and
forehand loops, she is an athlete of strength and stamina,"
commented coach Lu.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing teenager started to play table tennis at an early
age of five, and was recruited into the national youth team only
in March last year.
</P>
<P>
She finished third in the singles tournament of the National
Youth Championships last year, and bagged home with the silver
medal from the Asian Junior Championships last month in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Nowsdays, Zhang Yining was on her stride along the singles
competitions wherein she has set her sights into the top eight.
</P>
<P>
To materialise her dream, Zhang faces a tough challenge to
conquer Li Ju anew. No matter whoever eventually wins, the
teenager is surely marching along her promising voyage towards the
pinnacle of her career.

<HEADLINE> Bus Accident Kills 43 in Quebec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Forty-three senior citizens were
killed and another five seriously injured when a bus plunged into
a ravine in the Canadian province of Quebec today.
</P>
<P>
The five injured were rushed to a local hospital and are
reportedly in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 2:15 p.m. on Highway 138, about 100
kilometers northeast of Quebec city. The accident occurred at the
bottom of a steep hill leading into a sharp curve, police said.
</P>
<P>
Road conditions were reported to be dry and the weather
sunny. Faulty brakes are believed to be the cause of the tragedy,
police said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien expressed shock and
sadness at the accident.
</P>
<P>
"Like all Canadians, I was horrified to learn that a pleasant
afternoon devoted to taking in the fall beauty of the Charlevoix
had ended so tragically," Chretien said in a brief statement.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in more than 20 years that a bus
accident has occurred on the same section of highway. A 1974
accident took the lives of 13 senior citizens and injured 24.
</P>
<P>
Most of the casualties are from St-Bernard-de-Beauce, about 35
kilometers south of Quebec city. They were traveling this
Thanksgiving holiday to a ferry that would have take them to
Ile-aux-Coudres, a popular tourist spot.
</P>
<P>
This is reported to be the worst road accident in the history
of Canada.

WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton

<HEADLINE> Coach Chen Expects More Splashes from Swimming Pool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A batch of Chinese women
swimmers displayed their prowess at the National Games, sending a
promising signal of attacks upon the world records, said Chen
Yunpeng, former head coach of the Chinese swimming national team.
</P>
<P>
"After Chen Yan broke the oldest swimming world record and Le
Jingyi swam the all-time second best on Monday, more surprises are
expected from the swimming pool at the National Games," Chen said
at the pool side.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Chen Yan clocked 4:34.79 on Monday to break the
400-meter individual medley world record, signalling the mature of
a new generation of the Chinese women swimmers, the former head
coach said.
</P>
<P>
After Petra Schneider of former East Germany set up the
previous record of 4:36.10 in 1982, a batch of Chinese swimmers
have launched serious attacks in the past 15 years, including
former Olympic champion Lin Li and former world champion Dai
Guohong.
</P>
<P>
Lin Li swam her personal best of 4:36.73 in Barcelona while Dai
Guohong clocked her best of 4:36.90 in their record-breaking bids,
all within the brink of celebration, said the world-known Chinese
swimming figure.
</P>
<P>
"The presence of Chen Yan materialised our dream to break the
oldest world record," exclaimed the former Chinese head coach.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Le Jingyi, world record holder in 50 and 100m
freestyles, was within an arm's reach to break her own 100m record
by clocking the all-time second best of 54.10 seconds on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Should she splashed the first 50 meters with more ease, which
Le covered in a span of 26.05 seconds, it's highly possible for
another world record," recalled Chen.
</P>
<P>
To put together the timings of the top four swimmers in 100m
freestyle at the National Games, their combined timing of 3:39.26
surpassed that of the American women's 100m freestyle reley of
3:42.27 this year, explained Chen.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Chinese men swimmers also had a morale-enhancing
performance at the Games where Zeng Qiliang broke the Asian mark
in the 100-meter breaststroke by clocking the world's third best
of one minute and 1.66 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Althogh China lagged behind in the men's 200m freestyle, but
their combined results of the top four finishers at the Games
already bettered the Asian mark, the former head coach said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Strives to Produce 20 Million Tons of Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is endeavoring to
produce 20 million tons of rice as its target in the 1997-98
fiscal year beginning April, the second year of the country's
present Five-Year Plan (1996-97 to 2000-01).
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister for Agriculture and Irrigation Myint Aung was
quoted by today's The New Light of Myanmar as saying five working
groups such as water supply, agricultural education and finance
have been formed to help farmers ensure success in the tasks.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis is placed on four major crops -- rice, beans and
pulses, cotton and sugarcane -- and efforts are being made to
boost the per hectare yield, the minister said at a work
coordination meeting here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He added that 16 million tons will be enough for domestic
consumption.
</P>
<P>
He also called for efforts to attract domestic and foreign
entrepreneurs to invest in cash crops such as rubber, oil palm,
jute, coffee, corn, mulberry and tea in addition to the four major
crops.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's rice output in the 1996-97 fiscal year failed to
reach the planned target of 20 million tons and its rice export
sharply decreased in the year.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the country's rice production
in the 1995-96 fiscal year was recorded at 17.95 million tons with
an export of 354,000 tons, while the output in the 1996-97 was
17.08 million tons with 93,100 tons exported.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics also show that Myanmar's rice export in
the first six months of 1997 reached merely 1,200 tons, down from
241,700 tons in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's gross domestic product grew by 5.8 percent in the
1996-97 fiscal year, in which agricultural production increased by
3.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> EU Restores Trade Privileges for Laotian Textiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
resumed its trade privileges for Laotian textile products,
according to a report from Vientiane.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in the Laotian capital on Monday, Michel
Caillouet, head of the European Commission mission in Laos,
officially told Laotian Minister of Commerce Sompradith Vorasan of
the EU decision to restore the Generalized System of Preferences
(GSP) for Laotian textiles and Laos can now again enjoy reduced
tariff advantages for its textile exports to EU markets.
</P>
<P>
Laos's GSP privileges were withdrawn in 1995 after the EU
accused the country of violating the GSP rules of origin by using
excessive amounts of raw materials from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Last month the EU eased restriction by allowing Laotian
producers to use more raw materials from ASEAN member states.
</P>
<P>
Caillouet said the decision would encourage trade flows between
the EU and Laos and will promote investment in the country's
textile industry.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Expects 6-Percent GDP Growth This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Ceylon predicted in
a recent economic report that Sri Lanka would achieve a 6-percent
gross domestic product (GDP) growth this year.
</P>
<P>
Economic indicators pointed to the potential to realize the 6-
percent growth rate projected for this year, as compared with last
year's 3.8 percent, Chandra Munasinghe, director of the bank's
Economic Research Division, was quoted by the local press today as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The division completed a study on the country's economic
situation last month.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural, forestry and fishing sectors will grow by 3.5
percent this year, according to the report of the division.
</P>
<P>
The report said that during the first seven months of this
year, the total rice output increased by 9.5 percent over a year
earlier while the output of tea, rubber and coconut also went up
by 5.4 percent, 4.7 percent and 1.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Textiles and garments, the leading export items of the country,
have recorded a 26.6-percent growth in the first half of this year
over the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the GDP growth to Sri Lanka's enhanced
budget policy, power supply and surging market demand for
textiles.
</P>
<P>
It added that an increase in tourist arrivals and a declining
inflation rate also made positive contributions to the GDP growth.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals during the first eight months of this year
jumped by 21.7 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inflation dropped from 14.7 percent in March to 12.9
percent in August. The average inflation rate for 1997 is expected
to be around 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> China Had Census Data 4,000 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China had vital statistics as
early as the Xia Dynasty and the country's first recorded
nationwide census was conducted in 789 B.C. under the reign of
Zhou Xuan, according to materials prepared for an exhibit on
population.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, to open in Beijing on November 12, shows that
China's census reports can be traced back to Great Yu, founder of
the Xia Dynasty (circa 21st-16th century B.C.) who conducted a
successful mass campaign to control flooding in southern China
4,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Great Yu divided the country into nine regions and began to
count the number of people and the area of cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
The country's population in the Xia Dynasty was 13.5
million according to the "Records of the Later Han Dynasty
(947-950)."
</P>
<P>
After Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of the Qin Dynasty
(221-207 B.C.), unified China, an annual nationwide census was
conducted. Materials show that in the dynasty, local authorities
reported population and tax statistics to the central imperial
government at the end of each year.
</P>
<P>
After that, feudal dynasties all paid great attention to the
census and the household registry system for the purposes of
conscription, tax-collection and requisition.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the middle of the imperial Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),
a nationwide census has been conducted in China on an annual
basis. The Chinese population of 400 million, a number often
quoted around 1949, was based on an 1835 census under Emperor
Daoguang.
</P>
<P>
The Exhibition on China's Population, at the joint sponsorship
of the Chinese State Family Planning Commission and the China
Population Association, will open to the participants of the 23rd
International Union for the Scientific Study of Population's
General Population Conference November 12-17.

<HEADLINE> Air China Going Public for Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Air China, China's largest
civil aviation enterprise, is restructuring into a joint-stock
company and is going public on stock exchanges both at home and
abroad, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Yin Wenlong, president of Air China said capitalizing on the
stock market is a must for the carrier's further development.
</P>
<P>
Yin said the joint-stock restructuring will inject big capital
into the company and help it establish scientific and efficient
management systems.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the carrier, with a fleet of 65 freighters and
144 domestic and foreign air routes, is the only one allowed to
carry the Chinese national flag on its planes. Now, it is striving
to develop into a big company group.
</P>
<P>
In fact, fostering big conglomerates is an important part of
China's massive reform of its aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, selecting good performing enterprises to go public
is another part of the major effort to reform the aviation
industry, according to Xia Xinghua, a senior official with the
Civil Aviation Administration of China.
</P>
<P>
Xia said the decision to list civil aviation firms in overseas
markets is aimed at raising funds and to place them in
international competition.
</P>
<P>
The country's two other major airlines, China Eastern Airlines
and China Southern Airlines have already been listed in both Hong
Kong and New York.

<HEADLINE> China, US Protecting Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States may
soon be stepping up their wars against global warming -- with a
collective front, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials in charge of environmental protection issues
from both countries met in Beijing yesterday to discuss the
possibility of establishing a cooperative fight against
environmental destruction.
</P>
<P>
Timothy E. Wirth, US undersecretary of state, talked about
climate change problems while meeting four Chinese ministers and
vice-ministers -- of the National Environmental Protection Agency
(NEPA), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the State Science and
Technology Commission and the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
All agreed friendly cooperation, based on equality between the
two nations, is a significant component in solving the serious
global environmental problem.
</P>
<P>
Global warming is the potential increase in temperature of the
earth's atmosphere caused by the greenhouse effect.
</P>
<P>
The US is currently the top offender, discharging 22 percent of
the world's total greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
China, with 14 percent, is second. However, China's per capita
consumption is only about ten percent of that of the US, NEPA
statistics indicate.
</P>
<P>
Wirth, who arrived in Beijing on Sunday, arranged the two-day
visit to try and explore ways of co-operating with Chinese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Wirth expressed a desire to establish an agreement with Chinese
government officials regarding technology transfer and financing
China's effort in developing efficient energy sources.

<HEADLINE> Tariff Cut Mobilizes WTO Entry, Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The newest round of autonomous
cuts in China's customs duties will not only speed up its pace to
join in the process of global economic integrity, but also help
deepen its on-going State enterprise reform, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
As of October 1 this year, 73 percent of the 6,633 tariff items
have been cut significantly. The average tariff rate fell from 23
percent to 17 percent. This is a drop of 26 percent, which means
that tariffs have come down by 60.6 percent since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, when China began its bid to resume signatory status
in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), the country
has made unremitting efforts to overhaul its economic system and
become more integrated into the world economy.
</P>
<P>
By December 1993, the average tariff level had been brought
down to 36.4 percent from 43.2 percent in 1992. It was further cut
to 23 percent in April 1996. And in 1995, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin declare China would reduce its average tarifflevel to 15
percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale tariff cut will increase the market
competitiveness of imported products and provides the opportunity
for breaking the impasse of restructuring State enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Domestic enterprises have only two options: Either to go
bankrupt due to loss of market share, or the face up to the
challenge and survive, Zhang Hanya, an associate professor at the
University of International Business and Economics, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
State-owned properties and other social capital will be
reorganized through association, merger, leasing, contract
operation, shareholding, the joint stock co-operative system or
sell-off.
</P>
<P>
That will cause a whole succession of changes in the
property-rights system, the management mechanism and social
security arrangements.

night.
</P>
<P>
Goeltom said the first stage of the talks, which began Monday,
has yet to enter into details, such as the possible liquidation of
troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know concrete results of the talks yet," she said.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the IMF team met with Bank Indonesia (central
bank) Governor Soedradjad Djiwandono Monday, but the substance of
their discussions was not revealed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sources said, the Monetary Council held a
meeting Monday which was related to the government's decision to
seek assistance from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government decided last Wednesday to seek help
from international bodies such as the IMF, the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank to improve the country's economy after the
rupiah's value dropped by as much as 46 percent against the U.S.
dollar since last January.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and the World Bank responded to Indonesia's move
positively and sent a team to Jakarta last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah recovered last Friday from 3,650 against the dollar
to 3,355/65 following the government's decision.
</P>
<P>
However, the currency dropped to 3,625 against the dollar at
midday on Monday before recovering in the afternoon to close at
3,470/80.
</P>
<P>
A currency dealer said the rupiah recovered because Bank
Indonesia intervened in the market by selling some dollars.
</P>
<P>
Economists and analysts here said talks between Indonesian
officials and IMF teams had checked the rupiah's fall as the
market was waiting for the IMF financial package.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Finance Minister Mar'ie Mumammad said earlier that
the result of the talks between Indonesia and the IMF would be
possible within two and three weeks.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Close to Ending Government Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Italy's caretaker Prime Minister
Romano Prodi said here today that the four-day government crisis
is expected to end since he is very close to reaching an agreement
with the Communist Refoundation Party in his center-left coalition.
</P>
<P>
"We are close to an agreement," Prodi said, who met Communist
Refoundation leader Fausto Bertinotti earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Refoundation Party last Thursday withdrew from
the parliamentary majority supporting the government by refusing
to back the 1998 deficit-cutting budget proposed by Prodi, forcing
the prime minister to resign.
</P>
<P>
Intensive negotiations aimed at patching up the alliance began
soon after Prodi's resignation.
</P>
<P>
"The talks are going satisfactorily," Prodi said as he emerged
from the Quirinal Palace, after reporting to the President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro on the talks with the communists.
</P>
<P>
Bertinotti also said late on Monday that a deal was imminent
and his party would vote for Prodi's controversial 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the budget bill would be changed in order to
accommodate Communist Refoundation's demands, Prodi said, "No, the
budget will remain as it is."
</P>
<P>
The budget is part of Italy's efforts on meeting the Maastricht
Treaty criteria for joining the European single currency among the
first group in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Although unwilling to reveal details of a likely accord, Prodi
said it would be "for all of 1998", and hinted that it could
possibly be extended further until the present legislature expires
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Once an agreement is reached, Scalfaro, who is to conclude
political consultations on the crisis on Tuesday, is expected to
send Prodi back to the Chamber of Deputies to ask for a vote of
confidence in his government.
</P>
<P>
The budget has to be ratified by the end of this year, after
passing through a series of parliamentary committees.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Inflation Estimated at 7.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's inflation rate this
year is estimated at 7.4 percent and it will not rise to 10
percent or higher, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics
(BPS).
</P>
<P>
BPS chief Soegito said here Monday that even though there were
a prolonged drought and a currency crisis, the inflation rate
would not go up to or exceed 10 percent, Antara News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"If we are serious in handling the food problem resulting from
the long drought, I am convinced that the inflation rate will
reach only about 7 percent," he said after reporting to President
Soeharto at the Bina Graha Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Soegito said that inflation in September was 1.29 percent and
that the cumulative inflation rate between January and September
this year had thus reached 5.37 percent.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate during the same period of last year was 4.94
percent.
</P>
<P>
On the country's economic growth, Soegito said the figure this
year could be around 7 percent as compared with 7.98 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, some government officials said earlier that
Indonesia's economic growth this year will be 5 to 6 percent due
to its currency turmoil and prolonged drought.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah, the country's currency, has dropped by 46 percent
against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of this year.

<HEADLINE> US Official Explaining Energy Development Plan at 15th WPC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- While much has changed in the
world petroleum marketplace, the United States will continue to
have a foot in two camps, that is, one in the camp of producing
nations, and the other in the consuming nations, said a senior US
energy official.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ministerial panel of the 15th World Petroleum
Congress (WPC) here today, Robert S. Kripowicz, principal deputy
assistant secretary for fossil energy of the US Department of
Energy, said that the oil and gas industry continues to be a
significant and crucial component of the American economy.
</P>
<P>
The oil and gas industry accounts for almost 5 percent of the
country's gross output, or about 360 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The US official added that the US is continuing to discover
significant amounts of oil and gas, particularly in the Gulf of
Mexico, and current projections show natural gas production
increasing by more than 40 percent by 2015.
</P>
<P>
He told the ministerial panel that the US is the world's
largest user of petroleum and also the world's largest importer,
dependent on imports for 50 percent of consumption.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three decades, the US has established the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to safeguard economy in case of
future oil supply disruptions, he said. Currently, the SPR
contains 563 million barrels of crude oil, he added.
</P>
<P>
The globalization of the oil and gas industry is becoming a
trend, the US energy official noted. The US oil and gas companies
have markedly increased their overseas presence, often partnership
with foreign companies or governments, and the US has developed
oil and gas cooperation with energy companies from Norway, Japan,
United Kingdom, China and other nations.
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, global leaders and business executives are
incorporating environmental protection into their development
plans, and the world's people expect a clean and healthy
environment as well as economic well-being, Kripowicz said.

<HEADLINE> India Trying to Narrow Gap Between Oil Demand, Supply: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- India is taking vigorous steps
to increase oil and gas exploration and production, so as to meet
the challenge of growing gap between demand and domestic supply,
said Janeshwar Mishra, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ministerial panel of the ongoing 15th World
Petroleum Congress (WPC) here today, the senior Indian official
noted that India has taken several steps and announced new policy
initiatives, including the New Exploration Licensing Policy aimed
at providing a major thrust to accelerate exploration and
production activity through the involvement of private sector and
providing open access to exploration acreages.
</P>
<P>
Under the initiatives, the official said, a large number of
oil exploration blocks are being offered on terms and conditions
which rank among the most attractive in the world.
</P>
<P>
In addition, India has been actively pursuing exploration and
production opportunities abroad. In this regard, the Middle East,
former Soviet Union, Africa and South East Asia have been areas of
key interest and focus, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He told the ministerial panel that to meet the enormous demand
of petroleum products, India has emerged as one of the largest
centers for establishing new refineries which are being set up either
by the national oil companies, joint ventures or private companies.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the refining capacity in the country is
going to increase from the present level of 62 million tons per
annum to over 170 million tons per annum by the year 2006.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has invested Two
billion US dollars this year in the petroleum sector and it is
still witnessing substantial investment in both upstream and
downstream sectors of the petroleum industry, said a senior
Pakistan oil official.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ministerial panel of the ongoing 15th World
Petroleum Congress (WPC), Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, minister of
petroleum and natural resources, said that Pakistan was the fastest
growing energy market in the world, rising by 13.6 percent last year.

<P>
Apart from the increase in exploration activities through which
some 30 new exploration concession agreements are being signed this
year, Pakistan is also seeing major investment in the downstream
sector with the start of work on a 900 million US dollars refinery
and substantial investment in the oil and gas pipeline network in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that Pakistan's biggest upcoming project is
the 2 billion US dollar transnational gas pipeline project from
Turkmenistan which has been recently signed between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
With imported gas, Pakistan will be able to meet gas demand
shortfall and also to achieve economically beneficial and
environmentally preferred replacement of oil by gas in power and
industrial sectors, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Farmer Invests Personal Assets in Hometown Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A farmer of east China's Fujian
Province has made newspaper headlines by financing a wholesale
market in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jianchun, 39, of Fengting township, Xianyou county, has
injected an impressive six million yuan from his personal assets
in the first phase of the market, which involves an investment of
28 million yuan (3.337 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Completed recently, the project also involves World Bank loans
worth 16 million yuan, in addition to 6 million yuan from other
local farmers.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who made his fortune by dealing in dried fruits, decided
on the investment after becoming convinced that the project would
be lucrative.
</P>
<P>
Fengting, a coastal area in central Fujian, is a seaport and
near two other ports and a national highway leading to Fuzhou and
Xiamen. "Fengting township can deal in 10 containers of dried
fruit every year," Chen said. "I'm sure it will become a major
distribution center linking the coast with inland areas."
</P>
<P>
Spurred by a state policy to encourage private enterprises, the
Fujian Provincial Planning Committee endorsed Chen's investment in
the market, which is expected to become one of the 10 largest in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Chen's Xianyou Agricultural, Industrial and Trade Wholesale
Market, designed to house four markets for fruit, aquatic
products, farm produce and handicrafts, will need a total
investment of 55 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The first phase with five trading buildings of stalls and
offices began operations early this month.
</P>
<P>
"To attract traders, I'll not charge stall fees in the first
year, " Wang said.

BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Munich Reinsurance Company, the
world's professional reinsurance giant, has just opened two
offices in China to anticipate the further dynamic growth of
China's insurance industry, "China Daily" reported today.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Algerian official said
here today that his country is striving for a greater role in the
world energy industry.
</P>
<P>
Algeria wants to develop partnership with other countries in
the hydrocarbon sector, which is "a strategic option and not only
management style", Youcef Yousfi, minister of energy and mines,
said at the ministerial panel of the ongoing 15th World Petroleum
Congress Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to emphasize on the dynamic role of my country, in

in the region but definitely on a global vision," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our opinion is that tomorrow-world is calling for an increased
cooperation based on complementarity and mutual support," he added.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum resources are the key element of the Algerian economy,
contributing more than 90 percent of the nation's total exports.
</P>
<P>
The country, among the world's top 20 in oil and gas reserves, is
one of the biggest exporters of condensate and liquified petroleum
gas, and ranks the fourth in natural gas export worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Youcef Yousfi went on to say that partnership in the
hydrocarbon sector has led to a tremendous boost to the industry
for the past ten years, with a number of international oil service
companies established in the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister expected that a total investment of 20 billion U.S.
dollars will be injected to the Algerian oil industry in the next
five years.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A British car powered by
jet engines broke the sound barrier twice on land in Nevada on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
But the speed would not be recognized as a world record as it
took the driver Andy Green of Britain 61 minutes, not within 60
minutes as required by international racing rules, to drive the
British Thrust SuperSonic Car twice in a Nevada desert.
</P>
<P>
The speed for the first run was 1,222 kilometers per hour (kph)
while the second 1,216 kph. The speed of sound in the desert at
that time is 1,216 kph.
</P>
<P>
Team leader Richard Noble said his team was considering trying
again on Tuesday, the 50th anniversary of the first supersonic
airplane flight, by Chuck Yeager of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Thrust SuperSonic Car set a world land speed record of
1,142 kph on September 25.
</P>
<P>
The car is powered by two Rolls-Royce jet engines from a
Phantom fighter aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Enhance Cooperation With Central Asian Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine hopes to start energy and
transport cooperation with Kazakhstan and Kirghizstan, a senior
Ukrainian official announced today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Nikolay Doroshenko, head of the
CIS Affairs Department attached to the presidential office, said
Ukraine expects to initiate cooperation on oil extraction and
processing with Kazakhstan and to import oil and natural gas from
that Central Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Besides helping Kazakhstan with construction of oil pipeline,
Kiev proposed technologies to help modernize Kazakh enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Doroshenko added that Ukraine is considering to participate in
the transport project that will link Europe, Ukraine, Kazakhstan
and China together.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine also hopes to set up cooperation on energy,
particularly on hydraulic power, with Kirghizstan, Doroshenko
noted. Kiev plans to offer construction materials and technologies
in exchange for natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma will visit Kazakhstan and
Kighizstan on the coming two days.
</P>
<P>
As an energy-starved nation, Ukraine imports 70 percent of its
energy from Russia since its independence in 1991. This has badly
hurt Ukraine's economy. To lesson its reliance on Moscow, Ukraine
has to turn to Central Asian nations for alternative power
supply.

<HEADLINE> Pak to Achieve Food Self-Reliance: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Finance Minister
Sartaj Aziz said today that his country would achieve
self-reliance in food within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
It is an irony that, despite being an agro-based economy,
Pakistan has to import wheat and other edibles to meet its
domestic demand, Aziz said while inaugurating a "one-window"
agricultural credit scheme in Chakwal, about 80 kilometers south
of here, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the most important sector of the country's
economy involving around 70 percent of its population, but the
sector has been ignored during the past few years, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, prices of fertilizer, tractors and other farm
materials have increased but farmers remain deprived of any
incentives, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has been trying to raise prices for
agricultural products and reduce rates of farm materials and
agricultural inputs like good seeds and fertilizer will also be
made available.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has allocated an amount of 30 billion
rupees (750 million U.S. dollars) for credits to small farmers
throughout the country, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Under the "one window" scheme, the relevant departments have
been brought under one roof to ensure that a loan will be granted
in one day, he said, adding that it used to take about three
months to materialize a single case.
</P>
<P>
Aziz called upon farmers to fully cooperate with the government
to achieve food self-reliance in two years.

<HEADLINE> China's Population Statistics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A former Deputy-director of
China's State Statistics Bureau says that carefully-designed
methods and a strict control mechanism have kept China's
population statistics "accurate and credible".
</P>
<P>
Sun Jingxin, who is now a vice president of the China
Population Association (CPA) and a member of the State Family
Planning Commission advisory board, told a conference on
population science in Beijing that census statistics were obtained
in three stages: correction of household registration; household
visits and correction; and post-correction checks; with a certain
number of errors corrected in each stage.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth census conducted in 1990, during the two weeks of
census calculation and post-calculation checks, the five million
census takers were responsible for about 300 people each.
</P>
<P>
In addition to checks by other census takers, residents often
took part in checking to make the figures more accurate, and as a
result, a post-census sample check gave an error of 0.6 per
thousand, far below the one percent allowed in statistics, Sun
says.
</P>
<P>
He said that there were strict quality control at each stage of
the census, and sample checks were made at each stage.
</P>
<P>
"Quality checking teams were established from the provincial
level down to the neighborhood, whose responsibility was to
collect and review the data to prevent systematic errors on a
large scale," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He did say that new challenges have arisen, with the biggest
problem coming from the surge in the number of migrant workers
moving from the countryside to cities.
</P>
<P>
To counter this, Sun suggests the use of population maps made
from computer-processed photos taken from the air, which show all
houses, roads and fields, for future censuses.

<HEADLINE> T Cell Kills HIV-Infected Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A team of U.S. scientists has
demonstrated killing of human immune-deficiency virus (HIV)
infected cells in laboratory studies using immune system T Cells,
the California-based Cell Genesys Inc. reported today.
</P>
<P>
The T cells are genetically engineered to seek out and destroy
HIV-infected cells.
</P>
<P>
They have been proved to be able to target and kill infected
cells as efficiently and early as naturally occurring HIV-specific
T cells which are lost during the early stages of HIV infection,
the company said through wire service.
</P>
<P>
The scientists believe that they have identified an important
new treatment strategy for AIDS based on their findings in the
study.
</P>
<P>
Cell Genesys is currently conducting Phase II human clinical
trials in AIDS gene therapy. The study will help determine
whether the company's gene therapy can reduce the requirement for
long-term treatment with combinations of three or more antiviral
drugs.
</P>
<P>
In the Phase I trial, no treatment-related safety problems were
observed, and the data showed that the modified cells persisted in
the circulatory system for up to nine months.

<HEADLINE> 9 Jordanians Released by Israel Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Nine more Jordanians released
from Israeli jails were flown here today on board a Royal
Jordanian helicopter, according to Radio Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The nine were set free by Israel as part of a deal with Jordan
in which Israel would have to release up to 70 Palestinians and
Jordanians from its prisons in exchange for its secret agents held
by Jordan in a bungled assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
Radio Jordan said other Jordanians remaining in Israeli jails
are expected to be set free soon.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israel freed spiritual leader and founder of the
Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and 20 other
Palestinian and Jordanian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Jordan released the two agents of Israel's intelligence service
Mossad arrested after they failed to kill Hamas political chief
Khaled Mashaal in Jordan's capital Amman September 25.
</P>
<P>
The swap of prisoners put an end to an offbeat episode between
Israel and its closest Arab friend Jordan, which was outraged by
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's blunt action on its soil.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed peace with Israel in 1994.

<HEADLINE> No Reform Should Proceed Without Social Obligations: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The social obligations of postal
administrations should not be ignored in the race for greater
commercial freedom, said decision-makers attending a Universal
Postal Union (UPU) high level meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
The biggest challenge for the postal service is one facing
government, UPU International Bureau Director General Thomas
Leavey told delegates.
</P>
<P>
Present at the two-day summit on October 13-14 are more than
500 ministers and chief executives of postal administrations of
the UPU's 189 members as well as representatives of diplomatic
missions and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Governments need to find a balance between giving postal
services greater freedom to operate competitively but at the same
time to serve broader social interests, Leavey said.
</P>
<P>
Postal services are part of global business and if they behave
in a business-like manner, they can be assured of continued growth
and a prosperous future, Leavey said. "The letter will not
disappear," Leavey said with confidence.
</P>
<P>
A recent UPU study has predicted a growth of 2.5 percent per
year in letter volumes worldwide between now and 2005. However,
despite real growth in physical mail volumes, providers of mail
services are actually losing overall market share because of
modern technological advances, a diversion to electronic media and
growing competition from other service providers. The market share
for physical mail is projected to drop from 20 percent now to 15
percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote address today, Chief Executive of New Zealand Post
Elmar Toime said that if postal services are to survive, they
should get rid of their fear of deregulation and competition. He
stressed the need for business decisions, made on the basis of
both commercial and national interests.
</P>
<P>
Modern electronic communications hold new business
opportunities for postal services as good purchases across the
Internet still need to be delivered, Toime explained. He expressed
the hope that the reform process in the postal world will be
completed by the year 2005 and that the postal world will enjoy
commercial freedom and customer confidence.
</P>
<P>
China's Deputy Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Liu
Liqing is the conference chairman. In his opening address, Liu
said, "Over the recent years, the postal market has undergone
profound changes and competition is intensifying with each passing
day, bringing severe trials and challenges to postal sectors of
all countries." He hoped that experience and ideas will be shared
and superb opportunities be explored so as to find answers to
questions like how to better adapt to the market demand and deepen
the reform and how members should cooperate to achieve common
development.
</P>
<P>
The debate will continue as the postal world prepares for the
next Universal Postal Congress to be held in Beijing in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Troops Start Pullback from Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has started to withdraw
from northern Iraq its troops participating in the last operation
against Kurdish militants, the Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted senior Turkish military sources as saying thousands
of troops returned to southeastern Turkey early this morning,
after the main goal of the operation has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
About 15,000 Turkish troops, backed by jets and artillery fire,
stormed into northern Iraq late last month to strike the militants
of outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the General Staff of the Turkish Armed
Forces showed that 816 rebels have been killed during this round
of military operation. Meanwhile, Turkish troops suffered
casualties of 15 killed and 58 wounded.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has in recent years frequently launched cross-border
military operations into northern Iraq in an attempt to wipe out
the PKK rebels taking shelter there.
</P>
<P>
The military sources said that an unspecified number of Turkish
troops will remain in the area to prevent a comeback of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's military operations have triggered strong protests
from Iran and some Arab countries, which urged Turkey to respect
Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Ankara, however, contended that its operations have been aimed
at rooting up the PKK rebels, whom it accused of posing a serious
threat to the security of its border areas.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a war against the Turkish government
since 1984 in a bid to establish an independent Kurdish state in
southeastern Turkey.
