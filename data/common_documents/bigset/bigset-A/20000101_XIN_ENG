<HEADLINE> Russia Spared by Y2K Bug at New Year's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia spent the New Year's with
no strike of the much feared millennium bug, the country's Y2K
command center announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"There have been no data on failures and disconnection of
computer systems from the prompt-action headquarters of ministries,
departments, and territories of the Russian Federation," the
Moscow-base center said.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear Power Engineering Minister Yevgeny Adamov also said
that all major facilities of the industry have overcome transition
to 2000 well.
</P>
<P>
All nine nuclear power stations as well as other sectors of the
country's power grid worked in line with their operational
procedures, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Supreme Commander of Russia's Strategic Missile
Troops Vladimir Yakovlev reported a bug-free entrance to the New
Year of the country's formidable nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
"As we promised, our troops prepared for solving the problem
2000 reliably, and we now report that our work was not in vain:
there have been no faults," Yakovlev said.
</P>
<P>
Russia, the world's largest country that spans 11 time zones,
also saw its fleet of some 300 satellites operating smoothly
without the bug, which could fool a computer to interpret the year
2000 as 1000 or 1900.

<HEADLINE> Britain Presses Russia Again For Chechnya Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Saturday that it
had again urged Moscow to find a negotiated end to the Chechen war
under Russia's new acting president, Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told BBC radio that he had spoken
to his Russian counterpart, Igor Ivanov, by telephone on Friday
after Yeltsin handed over power to Putin, and had urged a peaceful
solution to the Chechen crisis.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he thought Russian President Boris Yeltsin
had taken everyone by surprise when he announced on New Year's Eve
that he was resigning in favor of his prime minister Putin.
</P>
<P>
"I put it to him (Ivanov) that given this change in the
political face at the top, that this would be a good time to set
in motion the political process we have been urging upon Russia,"
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"Without this political process leading to a settlement there
is going to be no permanent, stable outcome of the conflict in
Chechnya," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov was "keen to stress that there will be a continuity in
Russian foreign policy and that there will be no shift from the
strategic direction Boris Yeltsin set of strategic engagement with
the outside world," Cook told the BBC.

<HEADLINE> Russia Continues Assault on Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops continued
their assault on rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya
Saturday, with fierce battles reported in Grozny, the regional
capital.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who took over as Russia's acting
president following Boris Yeltsin's resignation Friday, arrived in
Gudermes, Chechnya, early Saturday and presented awards to
soldiers for their valor in fighting the militants.
</P>
<P>
In the ceremony broadcast live to the nation, Putin said their
actions "was not merely the restoration of the country's prestige
and dignity" but "putting an end to the breakup of Russia."
</P>
<P>
A senior Russian military official said Saturday that federal
forces had killed scores of rebels in Chechnya since Friday,
including several rebel commanders.
</P>
<P>
"The enemy sustained losses. Eight control points were
destroyed at which there had been so-called field commanders,
among them Abu Barayev, a fairly well-known terrorist," Major-
General Vadim Timchenko, deputy chief of the North Caucasus staff,
told the independent NTV television.
</P>
<P>
"Altogether the enemy lost up to 89 men. And that is in Grozny
alone. We also had losses. Altogether, we lost eight men as killed
and 16 as wounded in that period."
</P>
<P>
The military campaign was launched last September following
armed Chechen incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a series
of apartment bombings that killed some 300 people in Moscow and
two other Russian cities. Authorities have accused Chechen
militants of masterminding the blasts.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Chechnya, Putin said that the completion of
the anti-terrorist operation there would not be timed for any
concrete date, the presidential election day included. The
balloting is reportedly scheduled for March 26.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the federal government's readiness to hold talks
with Chechen leaders, if they denounce terrorism, free hostages
and hand over those suspected of staging the terrorist bombings.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chicago Ushers in New Millennium with International Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chicago, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Chicago, the third largest U.S.
city located on the shores of Lake Michigan in the heart of
Midwest, ushered in the new millennium with an international
millennium dinner attended by nearly 4000 people from all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the new millennium and the new year, Mayor of
Chicago Richard M. Daley and the municipal government invited 418
guests from 205 countries and regions on earth, one person with a
companion of his or her choice from every nation and region, to
join Chicagoans for the dinner.
</P>
<P>
The guests are not celebrities or dignitaries, but average
working people, such as a mechanic from Guatemala, a bird trainer
from Vietnam, a teacher from Bangladesh, an acrobatics performer
from China and a washing machine repairer from Suriname.
</P>
<P>
"This unique gathering is designed to further an important goal
for the coming millennium: fostering greater knowledge of our
world, and bettering communication between its many and varied
peoples," said a municipal government press release.
</P>
<P>
The evening began with a unique performance in the Arie Crown
Theater -- a showcase of Chicago's best musical, dance and
literary talent. After the performance, the 4,000 international
guests and Chicagoans were treated to the international millennium
dinner at a big hall in the MiCormick Lakeside Center decorated
with more than 400 multicolored resin chandeliers. The special
menu of the American-style feast, developed and prepared by
Chicago-based Levy Restaurants, included roasted lemon chicken and
apple pie cheesecake.
</P>
<P>
"As we look toward a new millennium, we come together as a
global family to break bread and exchange our wishes for the
future of Chicago and the world. Let's work hard to make better
cities, better countries, a better people and a better world."
said Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley at the dinner. "It is my hope,
that by welcoming two citizens from nearly every country to
Chicago's dinner table, we will create connections between people
that will last well into the next century."
</P>
<P>
The idea of the international millennium dinner, a key
component of the city's three-year celebration, was given by an
Italian man named Dino de Vincenzi through an e-mail when the city
was looking for an idea to celebrate the new millennium in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"I know Chicago is a city made up of immigrants from different
countries, so I think it's a good idea to invite two people from
every country in the world for the millennium gala, said Dino, who
works for the finance division of the municipal government in
Vigevano, a town near Milan. "For the first time in mankind's
history all the countries of the earth sit at the same table,
enjoying the company of one another and giving our hopes of peace
and brotherhood in a middle-of-the night toast."
</P>
<P>
"It's like a dream came true to celebrate the new millennium
here," said Knox Mshumayeli Nxumalo, a guest from Swaziland. "we
have seen too many wars in this century, my best hope for next
century is peace."
</P>
<P>
Dancing and singing went late into night before they started
the countdown for the new millennium. At midnight, the whole sky
was lit up like daytime by the largest extraordinary fireworks
display in the city's history.
</P>
<P>
Besides the millennium dinner and the fireworks display,
Chicago also greeted the year 2000 with a "Dance 'till the Dawn of
the New Millennium" -- a 2000-Minute Party from 9 a.m. on December
31, 1999 to 6:20 p.m. on January 1, 2000. More than 200 Chicago
dance groups danced together with Chicagoans and visitors in
nearly 100 locations, at museums, hotels, dance clubs, community
centers and attractions.
</P>
<P>
"We are excited to share our great city with our honored
guests," said Dorothy Coyle, Director of the Chicago Office of
Tourism.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 1 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were
killed and two more wounded during an attack by gunmen in
Hawlwadag district in South Mogadishu, Somali on New Year's eve.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the deceased included a man and his
son, while his wife was seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen attacked the household using hand grenades and
rocket propelled grenades, the eyewitnesses said, adding that a
donkey used for transporting water for the family was also killed.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the attack is not known officially. However, a
relative of the attacked family said the gunmen were annoyed by
the fact that the owner of the house was among a group of elders
called for testifying in a dispute over a piece of land in the
vicinity.
</P>
<P>
The owner of the house has testified against the claim of the
gunmen over the ownership of the land, the relative said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of astonished people gathered around the destroyed
family Saturday, helping them with the little they could afford.
</P>
<P>
The land ownership disputes in Mogadishu have claimed many
lives these days.

<HEADLINE> No Y2K Problem Reported in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government announced that no Y2K-related problems have been
reported in the country during the 12 hours ending at noon on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"All major mission critical systems such as transport,
communications, electricity, water, health services and emergency
services are reported to be operating normally," said Provincial
and Local Government Minister Sydney Mufamadi.
</P>
<P>
"We have only received a few reports of disruption of some of
these services -- such as electricity -- but those were because of
weather conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Louis Buys, head of the Provincial and Local Department's Y2K
disaster management center, said some local councils, mostly in
rural areas, had not reported on their Y2K status, but officials
had managed to confirm via other channels that all systems in
these areas were up and running.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Airports Company of South Africa, the country's
airports authority, said it had successfully navigated the
transition to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to government Y2K spokesman Fred Barron, Y2K problem
is not a single event limited to the changeover from 1999 to 2000,
many computer systems can only be checked for compliance when
businesses re-open after the holiday period.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the Y2K center would continue monitoring the
situation 24 hours a day until at least January 5, he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Reserves Total 154.6 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign exchange
reserves reached 154.675 billion U.S. dollars by December 31, up 9.
716 billion U.S. dollars over the same date in 1998, according to
official sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the exchange rate of the Chinese currency,
Renminbi, remained stable in the past year.
</P>
<P>
By December 30, the exchange rate of the Chinese currency was
8.2795 yuan against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The increase of China's foreign exchange reserves is because
China's international payment is stable and healthy.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the growth in the reserves to the measures
taken by the Chinese Government to encourage exports and crack
down on smuggling, and the recovery of Asian economies which was
hit hard by the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage export, China increased export rebates
and shortened the time needed to pay rebates to exporters.
</P>
<P>
China's exports stopped dropping in the second half of 1999,
and its surplus in foreign trade totaled 26.4 billion U.S. dollars
in the first 11 months of 1999, with direct foreign investment
reaching 37.09 billion U.S. dollars.

who released their hostages Friday in Kandahar had already left
the country, Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) reported.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Resolved to Cut Debt, Combat Corruption in New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo said Saturday that external debt reduction and anti-
corruption campaign are high on his country's agenda in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
He said in his new millennium message that Nigeria could not
score significant economic growth with a huge debt of about 30
million U.S. dollars. Nigeria is now Africa's biggest debt nation.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the people of Nigeria to support the
government's anti-corruption campaign.
</P>
<P>
Anti-corruption is a centerpiece of Obasanjo's domestic
policies. The first bill he sent to the National Assembly, the
country's top legislature, is an anti-corruption act.
</P>
<P>
If Nigeria wants to make a difference in the new millennium,
its people must refrain form violence and learn to be tolerant,
the president added.
</P>
<P>
The rising trend of ethnic clashes, especially in the oil
producing Niger delta region has long been a trouble for the new
civilian government, which took over the 15-year uninterrupted
military rule last May.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo's speech came hours after the conclusion of many over-
night Millennium Celebrations throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people gathered at Eagle Square in downtown Abuja
from last night until early this morning, to attend a massive
concert and dancing party, which culminated at mid-night in
countdown and fireworks shows, to mark the arrival of the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo and his wife, along with some ministers of his
government, attended the event.
</P>
<P>
In Lagos, Nigeria's largest city and commercial capital, many
people waited in a square for the coming of the new century,
accompanied by pop bands and singers.

NEW DELHI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Airlines A-300
Airbus, which endured an eight-day hijacking drama, reached here
Saturday from Kandahar, Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The plane could not arrive on Friday along with two other
aircraft which took all the released passengers and the Indian
delegation headed by External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh back
to the country following an agreement reached between the
hijackers and New Delhi on the release of 155 hostages in exchange
for three militants.
</P>
<P>
Official sources here said the repair work was completed last
night but the plane could not depart on time due to heavy fog in
New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The plane suffered several minor snags due to the absence of
regular maintenance during the grueling journey it undertook from
Kathmandu on December 24, which ended the next day at Kandahar via
India's border town of Amritsar and Abu Dhabi of the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The co-pilot of the ill-fated plane, Rajender Kumar, defended
the government's decision to secure the release of the hostages in
exchange for three militants, saying it was the only possible
option available with the government in the given circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Kumar said the plane was hijacked when he was flying it but
soon after the incident, captain Sharan took over.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Throws Tea Party to Greet New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today reiterated that the "one China" principle is the foundation
of peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark at a New Year's tea party hosted by the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) in Beijing this morning.
</P>
<P>
"China will not sit idle and tolerate any act calculated to
split China, pursue the so-called 'independence of Taiwan,' or
harm the fundamental interests of the Chinese people on both sides
of the Taiwan Straits," said Jiang, who is also general secretary
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and
chairman of the Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
While extending New Year's greetings on behalf of the Chinese
central government to people from all walks of life, compatriots
in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, as well as foreign friends, Jiang
reviewed major achievements China made in 1999 and said the year
2000 was the last year of the Ninth Five-Year Plan.
</P>
<P>
He urged all people of the country, under the leadership of the
CPC, to correctly understand the situation, recognize the tasks
ahead, seize the opportunities, and be progressive, determined and
united in the country's socialist construction cause.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the return of Hong Kong and Macao to China,
solving the Taiwan issue and the final reunification of the
Chinese sovereign territory have become more and more prominent in
the eyes of all Chinese, Jiang continued.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the China adheres to the principles of peaceful
reunification and "one country, two systems," and the eight-point
proposals he put forward five years ago regarding expanding
relations across the Taiwan Straits and promoting the process of a
peaceful reunification remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
"We will take into consideration the different characteristics
of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and Taiwan will be given plenty of
flexibility to realize peaceful reunification of China under the '
one country' premise," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The tea party was presided over by CPPCC National Committee
Chairman Li Ruihuan. Jiang Zhenghua, chairman of the Central
Committee of Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party (CPWDP),
also delivered a speech at the gathering, which was attended by

<P>
Health Secretary Alberto Romualdez told reporters here Saturday

<P>
By 09:00 (01:00 GMT) Saturday, 795 people had been injured by
firecrackers and 47 by stray bullets, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our overall assessment is that the increase in injuries due to
fireworks is not as high as we feared. We would like to think that

He said that last year there were 547 firecracker-related
injuries and 24 cases of stray bullets in new year celebrations.

<HEADLINE> No Y2K Disruption Happens in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced Saturday that it
did not face any problem caused by the millenium bug (Y2K) as it
entered the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium Information Dissemination Committee (MIDC) at the
Interior Ministry said that the condition at all parts and
organizations of the country were reported normal.
</P>
<P>
The country's electricity, water, energy and communication
networks were working normally without any problems during the
year-changing hours, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem stems from the fact that old computers
recognizes a year only by the last two digits. When the clock of
the computer ticks to the year 2000, the computer will take it as
the year 1900, thus causing confusion in all calculations and
operations which take a date into account.
</P>
<P>
The flag carrier Iran Air resumed its domestic and international
flights at 06:00 a.m. local time (0230 GMT) after a suspension of
over 10 hours due to the concerns on the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
The MIDC also said the refineries and all institutions
affiliated to the Iranian Oil Ministry are working normally after
arrival of the year 2000, and loading of oil tankers is going on
according to predetermined schedule without any halt.
</P>
<P>
Precautionary measures have been taken to prevent unexpected
incidents at the institutions and the Oil Ministry had embarked on
storing fuel in case of any problems cropping up.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials have warned of possible disruption in energy,
communications, transportation and other services due to the Y2K
problem and the cabinet announced January 1 as a public holiday to
prevent possible crisis caused by Y2K bug.

Hiroshima launched fierce counter-attacks but, failing to
penetrate Nagoya's defense, could shoot just once after the

</P>
<P>
Nagoya scored again in a goalmouth melee in the 82nd minute
when Torres passed the ball to Stojkovic, who dribbled past
advancing goalie Shimoda and two defenders before slamming it into
the net.

<P>
ANKARA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish rescue team are still
searching the missing Equatorial Guinea cargo plane around Mt.
Goynuk, north Turkey, reported Turkish Daily News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-made Antonov-28, with six crew members on a flight
from Ukraine to Iran, went missing shortly after it requested
permission to land in Ankara to refuel on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Following the plane's disappearance, Turkish Naval Forces (DKK)
began to search at sea and land, but no wreckage has been found.
</P>
<P>
The rescue efforts, initiated at the spot where the aircraft
gave its SOS call, were carried out by DKK helicopters, planes and
frigates.
</P>
<P>
An announcement from the General Directorate of State Airports
said that the plane was first detected by civilian radars at an
altitude of 3,200 feet and cruising at a speed of 85 nautical
miles.
</P>
<P>
It maintained that the altitude reading indicated that the plane
was losing control owing to technical failure.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the private channel NTV, Turkish
Transport Minister Enis Oksuz said that the matter was very
important. "We regard it as a suspicious plane," he added. However,
there was no report on what cargo the plane was carrying.
</P>

the plane's mission, but expressed thanks to the Turkish rescue
efforts.

residents, the past year was one full of expectation and happiness,
as the motherland celebrated the 50th anniversary of her founding,
and Macao returned to the embrace of the motherland at the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The 20th century has seen China grow from being weak to strong
and seen China step out of a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society
into an independent country, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Guided by the "one country, two systems" principle initiated by
Deng Xiaoping, China has successfully resolved the Hong Kong
question and Macao question. Taiwan's peaceful reunification with
the motherland will add more glory to the Chinese nation, the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The Jornal Va Kio said that the first day of 2000 has brought
about more promises to mankind. Like people around the world, the
Macao residents had flocked to public areas on the eve of the new
year for celebrations to wish for social well-being and economic
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The Dai Chung Pou also noted in a commentary that the grand
celebrations around the world demonstrate that people of all
countries long for peace, stability and prosperity in the new
millennium. People are full of expectations for the future.
</P>
<P>
The Correio Sino-Macaense said in a bylined article that the
year of 1999 not only symbolizes the end of foreign rule in Macao,
but also offers new opportunity. Macao residents should, in the
beginning of a new era, accept challenges and play a more
significant role.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Shahabuddin
Ahmed on Saturday morning called upon political leaders and people
from all walks of life to forget individual and party interests
for the sake of greater national interests.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Jatiya Sangsad (parliament) on the inaugural day
session of the new year, the president said: "We must commit
ourselves wholeheartedly to ensure a prosperous and peaceful
Bangladesh for our future generations to realize the dream of '
Sonar Bangla' (Golden Bangladesh) of the father of the nation."
</P>
<P>
"We have created a unique history as a sacrificing nation for
the establishment and preservation of democracy. We must put our
national interest above all other interests to consolidate the
foundation of democracy to bring about economic well-being of the
nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The presidential address at the start of the first session of
the parliament each year is a constitutional arrangement in the
South Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
The session was then adjourned after the presidential address
to resume on January 12 to continue for the rest of the month.
</P>
<P>
Members of parliament from the opposition parties were absent
from the session.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Humayun Rasheed Chowdhury earlier planned to make the
inaugural session a "millennium session" to welcome the new
millennium, but had to abandon the idea as the opposition, which
had been carrying out a campaign to oust the government, said they
would not join parliament sessions until their demands such as the
implementation of a previous agreement with the ruling party were
met.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Survives Y2K Scare: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has survived
initially the millennium bug scare with basic services going on
unhampered after the rollover date, the Y2K Contingency Task Force
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre, chairman of the
Y2K Contingency Task Force, said, however, that monitoring will
continue up to January 3, the first weekday of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic that our initial success will continue. We
are still going to monitor the other sectors, but (we will know)
whether it's really completely OK or not when we have our regular
office hours on Monday," Aguirre said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
The Aguirre task force is in charge of drawing up plans to make
sure that the millennium bug, a built-in flaw in old computer
systems that prevents them from correctly interpreting dates from
January 1, 2000 onward, does not disrupt basic services.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998, the government has prepared for the bug, with
President Joseph Estrada creating the Presidential Commission on
Year 2000 Compliance to make sure that mission-critical sectors
are not affected by it. These sectors are telecommunication,
transportation, finance, manufacturing, government services,
health care and utilities.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the commission and the task force, the government
also established a Y2K Action Center for the purpose of responding
to emergencies related to the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K Action Center started operating on a 24-hour basis last
December 28. It has links with other agencies such as the National
Disaster Coordinating Council to ensure prompt response and has
made available its hotlines to the public.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Rebels Kills 9 On Eve of New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of Lord's Resistance Army
(LRA), a major rebel group operating in northern Uganda, killed
nine people in their surprise attack on Gulu town on the eve of
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The LRA rebels made a daring attack on the official residence
of the Resident District Commissioner Peter Odok w'Ochieng and
ambushed a pick-up truck, the New Vision daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They reportedly attacked the vehicle at Loyoboo, 13 kms on the
Gulu-Kitgum road in the afternoon. This is the first attack on
Gulu town after they sneaked into Uganda from bases in southern
Sudan on December 22, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The LRA rebels, spearheaded by Joseph Kony have been fighting
against the government since 1986 when the ruling National
Resistance Movement led by President Yoweri Museveni came to power
after a five-year guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
They kill, maim, loot and abduct just to tarnish the image of
the government. They have allegedly abducted more than 10,000
children during their attacks in the northern region.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said that the peace accord signed by President
Museveni and his Sudanese counterpart Omar al-Bashir in Nairobi on
December 8 squeezes the rebels' space for survival and brings new
hope for the resolution of the issue.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Sudan have been accusing each other of backing
rebels operating on their respective territories. Their relations
were severed in April 1995.
</P>
<P>
The recently signed peace pact is a good sign toward the ending
of this hostility. Both countries promised to resume full
diplomatic relations by the end of February.

</P>
<P>
Business at a long-distance bus station near the customs
checking building is very brisk due to the increased inflow of
tourists from Macao, said local sources.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: ASEAN Set to Perform Better in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The initial recovery in members
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1999
marked a reversal of fortune for the group, which is set to
perform much better in 2000 with robust growth and deeper
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
This is the view expressed by many economists and analysts when
asked about the prospects of ASEAN, which now groups Brunei,
Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
From a steep decline of 7 percent in 1998 to a modest increase
of 3.4 percent in 1999, the 10-member ASEAN has indeed performed a
near miracle during the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
However, the rebound was still at the initial stage, compared
with an annual growth rate of 8-9 percent in the region before a
financial crisis hit ASEAN members in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
To achieve a faster growth in 2000 is not an easy job for most
ASEAN nations, where rising public debts are preventing
governments from spending heavily to stimulate growth; huge un-
performing loans are affecting bank lending; and lower
competitiveness is slowing down exports growth.
</P>
<P>
But ASEAN countries are trying their best to prevent the
recovery from derailing by seeking more foreign investments,
developing high technology and deepening economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Economists estimate that if the ASEAN countries could adhere to
economic structural adjustments, they are likely to see a 5-6
percent growth in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Although a full recovery remains a tough job for ASEAN
countries, closer cooperation within the ASEAN region in 2000
could help them attain the goal.
</P>
<P>
With a decision made at the informal ASEAN summit in Manila
last November, about 90 percent of products traded within ASEAN
will be subject to tariffs of 5 percent or less in the new year.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the ASEAN's ambitious plan for the ASEAN Free
Trade Area. If the scheme is implemented well in the new year, the
ASEAN's plan to advance the target date for zero tariffs in the
region to 2010 from 2015 would become more realistic.
</P>
<P>
"The decision in Manila reaffirms ASEAN's commitment to a
progressive integrated market, which is important not only for
expanding trade within ASEAN but also for attracting investments
into the region," said ASEAN Secretary General Rodolfo Severino.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, ASEAN will strengthen cooperation with other East
Asian countries such as China, Japan and South Korea in the
economic and social fields in the new year.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation would accelerate trade, investments and
technology transfer and encourage technical cooperation in
information technology in the ASEAN region and the rest of East
Asia, economists said.
</P>
<P>
While a higher growth rate is likely to be achieved by most
ASEAN countries in 2000, the ASEAN's unity and role in dealing
with regional and international affairs are expected to be
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1967, the ASEAN has been an important force in
maintaining regional peace and stability in the past 32 years.
Nevertheless, the financial crisis, which has not only weakened
the ASEAN's economic position, but also undermined social
stability in the region, has distracted the ASEAN leaders'
attention from some regional issues.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, with the rapid expansion and the inclusion of
countries with different political systems and at different stages
of development, coordination within the group also has to be
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Now, recovery from the crisis has provided a good opportunity
for the group to meet all these challenges and regain its strength
and influence in the region, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The new year, therefore, may prove a new start for the 32-year-
old group.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Calls for Economic Emancipation of Africa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Friday urged Africans to shift their struggle to fight for
their economic emancipation in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
In a national address on television and radio on the eve of the
new millennium Chiluba said that now that the entire Africa is
politically independent, "our struggle must shift, we must shift
to economic emancipation. Our theme for this momentous occasion is
'enhancing democracy and national economic development in the new
millennium.'"
</P>
<P>
He urged all Africans to work for Africa's peace and unity.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative that in the new millennium, the gap between
the rich and the poor is narrowed through equitable distribution
of wealth, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is morally indefensible, It is morally unacceptable, that
the poorest of the poor should continue to wallow in the depth of
poverty, in the middle of ostentatious living. We must
deliberately create opportunities for all our citizens, to aspire
for and attain a better standard of life," Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
He said that when Africans enter the new century the basic
foundations for political stability and democratic practice have
been firmly established throughout much of Africa. What Africa now
needs is the economic means to sustain the momentum.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba complained that Western industrialized countries have
failed to underwrite Africa's democracy.
</P>
<P>
He identified growing external debt burden and the
disadvantageous terms of trade as the obstacles to continue to
hinder growth and development of the African continent.
</P>
<P>
The president, Therefore, called for debt relief, debt write-
off and development assistance from the international community to
improve the economic circumstances of African countries in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
The last millennium has been a nightmare for Africa, sometimes
from self inflicted causes, yes, Africa has gone to slumber as the
rest of the global community has moved on to the outer reaches of
universe, Africa has lost valuable time pre-occupied by mundane
issues of daily sustenance, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although Africa lies licking and nursing its wounds from self
inflicted conflicts, the promise of political stability is certain
and although Africa is burdened by the millstone of massive debt,
economic emancipation is more than assured, said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
"The new millennium must mean a new Africa, free from vices
that hold us down," said the Zambian president.
</P>
<P>
He called on his countrymen to deliberately enhance their
capacities to exploit the technological advances.
</P>
<P>
On the recent coup d'etat in Cote D'ivoire, Chiluba condemned
the military junta for taking power from an elected and legitimate
government of president Henri Konan Bedie.

President Abdurrahman Wahid witnessed the first sun rise in the
easternmost province of Irian Jaya Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In his address welcoming the year 2000, Wahid called on the
nation to enter the new millennium with a resolve to utilize
technology for the benefit of man.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian nation must be able to enter the year 2000 with
a determination to develop technology, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The celebration of the New Year in Jayapura, capital of Irian
Jaya,ran smoothly with sounds of fireworks and trumpets heard
across the city.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, at least a million people took to the streets and
their thousands of vehicles clogged the downtown, causing the
traffic to come to a standstill a few hours before midnight.
</P>
<P>
As the clock turned to 00:00 hours, January 1, 2000 and the
bright lights were still on, marking that the electrical grid was
functioning normally and free from the attack of the millennium
bug, the sounds of plastic trumpets and firecrackers filled the
air.
</P>
<P>
Apart from minor injuries sustained by some people from light
traffic accidents or firecrackers, there were no serious accidents
or civil disobedience recorded by the Jakarta Police Headquarters
until Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
In Mataram, capital of West Nusa Tenggara, thousands of Muslims
performed mass prayers in a number of mosques to welcome the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
As the New Year 2000 coincided with the fasting month of
Ramadan,the local authorities did not hold any activity to
celebrate the New Year's eve.
</P>
<P>
In riot-torn Ambon, capital of Maluku province, the new
millennium celebration was colored by tension and a barrage of
attacks on a number of residences in the city.
</P>
<P>
Tension was reported to have spread to a number of places in
the center of the city where masses began to be seen to carry self-
made bombs and weapons. Strong explosion of self-made bombs was
frequently heard on some locations.
</P>
<P>
Security personnel deployed to some conflict-stricken locations
and demarcation zones of conflicting groups have taken severe
measures by releasing warning shots with an aim to disperse the
masses, thus avoid possible physical contact.

<HEADLINE> Kumaratunga for Peace, Unity in New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has called for peace and unity in the war-torn island
country in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
In her New Year message Friday evening, Kumaratunga said all
Sri Lankans must unite as the new millennium dawns and use the
lessons of the past to ensure a bright future for the nation.
</P>
<P>
"We must learn the lessons from a bitter past and join hands in
unity to ensure a better future for all of us. History has
bestowed this enormous task upon us," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by the seemingly unending ethnic
conflict since 1983 between majority Sinhalese dominated
government troops and Tamil rebels who demand a separate homeland
for minority Tamils in the country's north and east.
</P>
<P>
"We have before us a golden opportunity to strengthen peace,
progress, brotherhood, mutual understanding and faith for the
benefit of mankind," Kumaratunga said,
</P>
<P>
"It is essential for all Sri Lankans to agree on a common
agenda to ensure a better future for all of us learning the
lessons from the past. There will be no other suitable moment for
this noble task than the dawn of the new millennium," she said.
</P>
<P>
Thus the responsibility and expectation in the new year should
be to act with determination, compassion and swiftness to fulfill
the wishes of the people and the nation, the president stressed.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Exports Down in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the value of oil and gas exports increased by 19.80
percent to 8.63 billion dollars, that of non-oil and non-gas
exports dropped by 6.09 percent to 35.44 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil and non-gas exports in the first 11 months of 1999
contributed 80.41 percent to the overall exports, or 3.56 percent
less than in the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas exports accounted for 19.59 percent of the overall
exports,with 9.15 percent contributed by crude petroleum, 1.87 by
refined oil and 8.57 percent by natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the country's exports was an indication that part
of its export-oriented industries still relied on the countries of
destination despite the fact that domestic political and economic
conditions were improving, head of the BPS Sugito Suwito said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau also noted that the country's imports during the
period were only 21.83 billion dollars, down by 12.45 percent from
the corresponding period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia enjoyed a surplus of 22.24 billion dollars in its
trade with foreign countries in the January-November period of
1999, Sugito was quoted by the Antara News Agency Saturday as

<HEADLINE> Kenya Takes Measures to Revive Economy in New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is taking new measures to
reverse the downturn of the country's economy in the new year,
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said in his new millennium
speech.
</P>
<P>
"We have gone through lean times economically, but I'm
confident that with the measures taken by the government, Kenya's
economy will soon recover," Moi said in his 20-minute new year
message broadcast on television at midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
The measures include the plugging of loopholes for corruption,
retrenchment measures, the rebuilding of road torn apart by the El
Nino rains and the signing of the treaty for East African Common
Market, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the next decade, the president said, Kenya should pay
particular attention to four major sectors of the economy --
agriculture, transport, commerce and tourism.
</P>
<P>
He promised that his government would enhance security and
develop requisite infrastructure of road, water and air transport
network to facilitate foreign investment in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Moi also appealed to financers, donors, banks and
non-governmental organizations to make available loans and grants
for investment in Kenya's economic sectors.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Agricultural Productivity Drops, Says Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Latin American
Economic Commission said Friday that the share of the agriculture
and livestock sector in the Latin American economy had a trend to
diminish by almost 50 percent in the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
The study, prepared by Margarita Flores de la Vega, a member of
the commission, said that the sector accounted for 18 percent of
the gross domestic product of the region in mid-1970s, but it
dropped to 8.8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However agriculture remains a sector where labor is
concentrated but with low productivity. It cannot reduce the
poverty in the rural area.
</P>
<P>
It said in none of the countries in the region the sector
offers employment for less than 10 percent of the total
economically active population. In most cases the occupation
surpasses 20 percent, and in Mexico it is 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Latin American agricultural sector faces the challenge of
introducing better forms of production to peasants of small groups
since there exist noticeable differences between the agricultural
workers in Latin America and those of the United States, Japan and
Israel among others.
</P>
<P>
The study underscores that poverty affects one third of the
population in Latin America, and more than half in the rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Post-Yeltsin Russia Welcomes New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russia, with thousands of nuclear-tipped missiles and many
nuclear power plants, was listed in the West as among the
countries most susceptible to the millennium problem. But several
hours into the New Year, there were no reports of any attacks of
the Y2K bug, which fools a computer to interpret the year 2000 as
1000 or 1900.
</P>
<P>
Officially, the world's largest country, which spans 11 time
zones, has not entered the new millennium yet: the State
Commission of Standards has ruled that the third millennium starts
a year later.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, in a televised address to the nation Friday, announced
his decision to step down six months before his term ends in June
and handed his powers to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, the acting
president.
</P>
<P>
The move was seen as the best New Year present to Putin, who is
already the most popular politician in the post-Soviet Russia.
</P>
<P>
The approval rate of Putin, who took office as premier in
August, skyrocketed from a mere 2 percent to well over 50 percent
amid a popular military campaign against rebels in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The offensive, launched in September following armed Chechen
incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a spate of terrorist
bombings that killed over 300 people in Moscow and two other
cities, is till in progress, but federal commanders said the final
stage is nearing its end.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, revelers flocked to the Red Square, the Pushkin
Square and several other venues to mark the New Year. A light snow
under relatively warm temperature brought more crowds to the
celebrations, although some 80 percent of Russians said in a pre-
New Year's poll that they would celebrate at home.
</P>
<P>
With the economic crisis apparently bottoming out in 1999, many
Muscovites harbor a guarded optimism for the new year.
</P>
<P>
Less than 18 months after the devastating August 1998 ruble
devaluation, a poll conducted a week earlier found that some 42
percent of the Muscovites expect their family's economic condition
will improve next year.
</P>
<P>
It is not a majority, but it is a jump from last year's 27
percent, and beats the previous high of 30 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Russians outside the rich national capital are less sanguine. A
December 17 to December 20 survey of 1,600 people conducted by the
VTsIOM public opinion agency found that only 6 percent thought the
year 2000 would be better than 1999.
</P>
<P>
Five percent said conditions would worsen, while 17 percent
said 2000 would be no worse than 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's inflation rate in
1999 averaged 2.01 percent or way below the previous year's figure
of 77.63 percent, according to the Antara News Agency Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Improvements in the economic and political situations this
year influenced the inflation rate in a favorable way so that it
dropped to far below the previous year's figure," chief of the
Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) Sugito Suwito said.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate stood at 1.73 in December 1999, while it was
0.25 in November.
</P>
<P>
Sugito attributed the higher inflation in December to increased
demand for goods and services during the fasting month of Ramadan
and ahead of Christmas Day and New Year celebrations. Consequently,
the prices of goods and services rose significantly.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Power Plants Malfunctions Reported as Japan Enters 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Japanese officials said Saturday
that some minor malfunctions were reported at nuclear power plants
as the new year started, but the country's key sectors have not
experienced any major problems related to the millennium computer
bug.
</P>
<P>
"The malfunctions are not of the nature that would immediately
affect people's lives," Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Fukushiro
Nukaga told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Malfunctions were reported at the Shiga nuclear power plant in
Ishikawa Prefecture, west of Tokyo, but the system used for
sending data to government ministries and company headquarters
during emergencies failed to display the information.
</P>
<P>
Another alarm went off shortly after midnight at the Onagawa
nuclear power plant in Miyagi Prefecture, northeast of Tokyo, but
operations returned to normal 10 minutes later, according to
government officials.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government is investigating whether the problems
arose from the Y2K computer glitch, Nukaga said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the country's some 2,300 major medical facilities,
including emergency hospitals, reported having no Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Naoyuki Akikusa, chairman of the Japan Electronic
Industry Development Association, told a separate news conference
that none of his 148 companies had reported any problems involving

<HEADLINE> No Major Y2K Problem Reported in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 1 (Xinhua) -- No major problems related to the
feared Y2K computer glitch have been reported in Japan as the
country crossed into 2000, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
said here early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, there have been no major incidents that would
have a major impact on people's living," Obuchi told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Railways, airport services and traffic lights functioned
normally, power stations operated in a stable manner and no
telephone line malfunctions were reported as the clock ticked into
2000, said Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
Although there were some connection problems regarding cellular
phones in some areas and international calls to China and the
Philippines, they were related not to the computer glitch but to
the usual flood of calls on New Year's Day, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister, however, said his government will
continue to look out for problems.
</P>
<P>
More than 2 million people in Japan's public and private

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cheer New Year At Mount Taishan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAI'AN, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from China's 56
nationalities, together with some 10,000 mountaineering
enthusiasts, gathered at the snow-covered peak of Mount Taishan
in the wee hours today to cheer the new year.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time so many nationalities have met at Mount
Taishan, which rises 1,545 meters above sea level and is the
highest peak in eastern China.
</P>
<P>
Mount Taishan formed about 30 million years ago and serves as
a witness of the long history of China and a symbol of the
grandeur and soul of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Ancient Chinese paid their highest respects to the majestic
mountain and regarded it as the world's closest altar to heaven,
and the first spot to meet each dawn.
</P>
<P>
They used to go to the mountainside temples to worship and pray
for good fortune.
</P>
<P>
Gao Jianshe,a member of the Gaoshan nationality who comes from
southeastern Fujian Province, was one of today's climbers to wish
greater prosperity for China and the earlier reunification of the
motherland in the new century. Gao also extended his good wishes
to relatives living in Taiwan, which is home to the majority of
the Gaoshan ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 is significant for all Chinese people, because in
the Chinese zodiac it is the year of dragon, an auspicious symbol
of good luck.
</P>
<P>
To herald the dawn of the year 2000, some 5,000 college and
university students clad in golden robes scaled the mountain and
scattered to form the shape of a dragon stretching from the foot
of the mountain to the peak.
</P>
<P>
A torch lit at the site of the Neolithic Dawenkou Culture,
which is at the foot of the mountain and dates back some 5,000
years, was carried to the peak of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese nation has undergone many hardships and
frustrations in the past 5,000 years, so I wish our country a
promising future in the coming century," said one mountaineer.
</P>
<P>
Mount Taishan is situated near the country's eastern seaboard,
in Tai'an city of Shandong province. The mountain was added to the
World Heritage List of culture and nature sites by UNESCO in 1987.

She recalled that many of her relatives discouraged her from
marrying Han five years ago because he lived on a precipitous
cliff and there were no neighbors near by.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there were few relatives and friends to visit them, and
even the neighbors living closest were reluctant to take the long
mountainous road to the Hans.
</P>
<P>
But she said she is lucky that their home was the first one on
the Chinese mainland to see the dawn of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Many of the town's people came to extend congratulations to the
Hans, but also expressed their envy of the family, because it is
said locally that the family first to enter the new year will have
good luck and become well-off.
</P>
<P>
Shitang is more than 1,000 years old, and now has a population
of 36,500, most of whom live by fishing, as they have there for
generations, and so they see this exceptional moment as a good
opportunity to diversify their local economy.
</P>
<P>
The town covers an area of 16.26 square kilometers, is rich in
historic sites, and has many beautiful seaside vistas and scenic
spots.
</P>
<P>
One village head, Wang Hetan, said, "I hope the sunlight of the
year 2000 will shine on every local household and bring fortune to
them all."

<P>
SHITANG, Zhejiang, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-two-year-old
Fisherman Han Ping could not contain his excitement when he first
saw the brilliant new year dawn at 6:46 a.m. in Shitang, a remote
seaside town in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
"It is thrilling. I hope the auspicious sunlight will bring our
family good future in the new century," Han said.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua he was amazed to find out that his home, built
on a high and steep cliff with three sides facing the East China
Sea, was the first on the Chinese mainland to see the dawn of the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of visitors began flocking into Shitang after
Chinese astronomers announced last November that this little-known
town would be the exact spot where the new year sun would first
shine.
</P>
<P>
At the easternmost part of town, Han's home is more than 120
meters above sea level and thus became the first one in Shitang to
see the sunrise.
</P>
<P>
After the announcement was made, Han's family became a magnet
attracting great attention from seldom-seen relatives, friends
living miles away, farmers from neighboring villages, the leaders
of Shitang, and even major media from across the nation.
</P>
<P>
"I'm overwhelmed that so many people came to visit our family,
and it was especially beyond our expectations that reporters from
CCTV, the Hong Kong Phoenix TV Station, and other news media also
came," Hang's wife, Jiang Sujuan said with a smile.

<HEADLINE> China's Easternmost Point Celebrates New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
USU, HEILONGJIANG, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Braving freezing cold,
eight soldiers and one girl at a border post opposite Russia
solemnly watched the Chinese national flag rise slowly at 7:04 a.m.
, the exact dawn of the new year here, accompanied by the national
anthem.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers released eight pigeons, symbols of peace, when the
flag reached the top of the pole.
</P>
<P>
This was the first flag-raising ceremony of the year 2000 in
Usu, the country's easternmost point, in Heilongjiang Province in
northeast China. The post is on the west bank of the Wusuli River,
the boundary between China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
It's an unforgettable moment for the soldiers stationed at Usu,
and for the seven-year-old girl, Zhang Longyu, seeing the new year
in this way, because they are at the far eastern end of China's
territory.
</P>
<P>
The sun shines over the vast snow-covered land in Fuyuan
County, as the mercury reads minus 30 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
"I see the sun of the new year," the girl shouts excitedly,
rubbing her freezing hands, "I wish that the sun will bring good
luck to the motherland, and I wish all children study harder and
do better."
</P>
<P>
Although there were no fireworks and no dinner party, the
soldiers were too excited to fall asleep last night and they
invited the girl, their good friend, to attend the flag-raising
ceremony with them.
</P>
<P>
Usu is located at 135 degrees, 5 minutes east longitude and 48
degrees, 30 minutes north latitude, and most days is the first
place in China to see the sunrise.
</P>
<P>
But today, because of the season, the small town is 18 minutes
behind Shitang in Zhejiang Province in east China in seeing the
dawn of the new year.
</P>
<P>
 The eight soldiers and the girl and her four family members
are the only people living in Usu.
</P>
<P>
The small town is 60 kilometers from Fuyuan County, which
became an open port in 1992 with the approval of the State Council,
China's highest governing body. Since then, border trade between
China and Russia boomed.
</P>
<P>
 Post Commander Hu Tiezhu said that border issues between
China and Russia left over from the past have basically been
solved.
</P>
<P>
He added, "We hope that the Chinese and Russian peoples can
live harmoniously forever, and that the people of the world also
can live in peace and happiness in the coming century."

<HEADLINE> 21st Century Brings New Hope: Chinese Students (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The 21st century teems with hope
and opportunities for both China and individual Chinese, many
college students believe.
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited about the news that China may join the World
Trade Organization, because this will bring huge development
opportunities to the nation," said Ding Sai, who studies
international economics at Tianjin-based Nankai University.
</P>
<P>
 Ding said, however, that China can only find a foothold in
the world by increasing its industrial strength, as the country
still lags far behind developed countries in a number of fields.
</P>
<P>
 "In the new century, every one of us should have a strong
sense of competition," she noted.
</P>
<P>
 One graduate student at Shanghai-based Fudan University, Wu
Yanyuan, said the new century will bring even more rapid changes
and exert greater pressures on people, but will at the same time
offer more opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"We must work hard to improve our abilities because
opportunities always await those who are well prepared," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jiabin, a second-year graduate student at the Shanghai
University of Communications, said he has set a clear goal for the
new century, "to become an excellent entrepreneur."
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Chen, whose major is kinetic and energy
engineering, launched a nine-member campus company to develop new
technology. The firm, registered with a capital of 800,000 yuan (
about 100,000 U.S. dollars), also provides consultation services.
</P>
<P>
 As both a student and a manager, Chen has a much busier
schedule than most of his classmates.
</P>
<P>
 Li Hui, a first-prize winner in the Competition of National
College Students in Extracurricular Scientific and Technological
Products, said he intends to devote himself to life science, a
field that is gaining in popularity.
</P>
<P>
 Li, a genetics student at Fudan University, said he plans to
gather first-hand human genetic information from northeastern
China, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Tibet.  (

<P>
Together with several other student representatives, Li rang a
750-kilogram bell on the campus yesterday evening.
</P>
<P>
 Although Chinese college students are full of expectations
for the new century, they are not overly impressed.
</P>
<P>
 One Beijing student said the new century is merely an
artificial time definition, which cannot reduce the gap between
China and developed countries overnight. In addition, the world is
far from peaceful.
</P>
<P>
 Yu Hua, a student at the Chinese Language Department of
Beijing University, said China suffered from foreign aggression,
wars, and poverty at the beginning of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
 The start of 21st century is much different, as China is no
longer a weak nation, and as its influence grows, more and more
foreigners may come to China to study, he said.
</P>
<P>
 Zhang Yuan, a student at Nankai University, said that
information technology will continue to develop robustly.
</P>
<P>
 He said China has a strong contingent of information
technicians, and the government has adopted a sound policy for the
development of the industry. In the new century, the Chinese
people will be able to fully display their wisdom and talents as
their country forges ahead on the information tide.
</P>
<P>
Fang Jiangang, a junior in the Mathematics Department of
Beijing University, said the 21st century brings new hope to
people, and hope is what pushes people to create a better life.
</P>
<P>
He fancies that in the next century China may have
universities as famous as Harvard, Cambridge, and Yale, producing
a number of Nobel Prize winners.
</P>
<P>
In the new century, he said, what can be envisaged for China
is nearly limitless.

SHITANG, Zhejiang, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The first rays of
sunlight of the year 2000 began shinning on the Chinese mainland
at 6:46 a.m. in Shitang, a remote seaside town in Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 jubilant tourists and local fishermen are
dancing and blowing trumpet shells to celebrate the new year dawn
in the little-known town.
</P>
<P>
A torch is lit on the high and steep cliff overlooking the East
China Sea, and the firelight blends sunlight amid the resounding
echoes of the sounds of hundreds of shells, creating a grand and
ardent ambiance for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
As the sun rises gradually above the sea, more than 30 fishing
boats set sail with flags in the shape of dragons, phoenixes, and
tortoise hanging above their bows, flapping in the wind.
</P>
<P>
This little town came into the limelight soon after Chinese
astronomers announced last November that it would be the first
spot on the Chinese mainland to see the dawn of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Before this announcement, the town of Usu in Heilongjiang
Province, the easternmost point on the mainland, was thought to be
the first place that would cheer the new year dawn.
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-year-old town of Shitang is located at 28 degrees, 15
minutes north latitude, and 121 degrees, 36 minutes east longitude.
</P>
<P>
It has a population of 36,500 and covers an area of 16.26
square kilometers. Most of the local people live by fishing, as
they have there for generations.
</P>
<P>
The local government has decided to take this opportunity to
develop the town's tourism as one way to diversify the local
economy.

<HEADLINE> No Resignation Accepted by Sudan's President: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar al-
Bashir has asked his ministers and state governors to stay in
office after they expressed desire to resign to facilitate "
necessary changes in the executive power."
</P>
<P>
This was reported by the official Sudan News Agency (SNA)
Saturday. It quoted Minister of Culture and government spokesman
Ghazi Salah-Iddin as saying the Sudanese president did not accept
the resignation of any minister.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a celebration Friday marking the 44th anniversary of
the country's independence, al-Bashir said the ministers and state
governors had offered to resign, but he asked them to stay until he
could reform the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The resignations were called by the government spokesman as "a
self-motivated act that came after broad consultations."
</P>
<P>
Nearly three weeks ago, al-Bashir declared a three-month state
of emergency and dissolve the parliament, as a result of power
struggle with Hassan al-Turabi, the powerful parliament speaker and
secretary general of the ruling National Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
This was seen as a pre-emptive move to foil a planned parliament
vote on amending the constitution to drastically reduce the
president's powers, including the power to appoint cabinet
ministers and state governors.
</P>
<P>
The National Congress Party consultation group held an
extraordinary meeting last week to approve a recommendation to
bridge the rift between the two leaders, who had been on very good
terms with each other since al-Bashir took power in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The committee called for restructuring the executive body in
order to restore trust and tranquility. The resignations were
believed to aim at leave the president a free hand to form a new
executive body.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has already been beset by a civil war in the south, which,
coupled with famine, has killed more than 2 million people in the
biggest African country.

<P>
KHARTOUM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar al-
Bashir has asked his ministers and state governors to stay in
office after they expressed desire to resign to facilitate "
necessary changes in the executive power."
</P>
<P>
This was reported by the official Sudan News Agency (SNA)
Saturday. It quoted Minister of Culture and government spokesman
Ghazi Salah-Iddin as saying the Sudanese president did not accept
the resignation of any minister.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a celebration Friday marking the 44th anniversary of
the country's independence, al-Bashir said the ministers and state
governors had offered to resign, but he asked them to stay until he
could reform the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The resignations were called by the government spokesman as "a
self-motivated act that came after broad consultations."
</P>
<P>
Nearly three weeks ago, al-Bashir declared a three-month state
of emergency and dissolve the parliament, as a result of power
struggle with Hassan al-Turabi, the powerful parliament speaker and
secretary general of the ruling National Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
This was seen as a pre-emptive move to foil a planned parliament
vote on amending the constitution to drastically reduce the
president's powers, including the power to appoint cabinet
ministers and state governors.
</P>
<P>
The National Congress Party consultation group held an
extraordinary meeting last week to approve a recommendation to
bridge the rift between the two leaders, who had been on very good
terms with each other since al-Bashir took power in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The committee called for restructuring the executive body in
order to restore trust and tranquility. The resignations were
believed to aim at leave the president a free hand to form a new
executive body.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has already been beset by a civil war in the south, which,
coupled with famine, has killed more than 2 million people in the
biggest African country.

Official statistics show that the Cuban economy registered last
year a 6.2 percent growth, one of the highest in Latin American
countries.

the wreckage of a raft on which a group of illegal Cuban emigrant
tried to the United States

LONDON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- A giant millennium parade, billed
as the world's biggest millennium carnival, was held in central
London on New Year's Day with some 12,000 twirlers, marchers and
pipers paraded through Whitehall and along Millbank beside the

bands and 75 floats and special acts paraded past.
</P>
<P>
With no reports of Y2K bug glitches in Britain so far, a banner
on a float which consisted of a caged computer in a reconditioned
supermarket trolley said: "Don't worry, we've caught the
millennium bug." The onlookers burst into laughter when seeing the
banner.
</P>
<P>
Blair congratulated police on their security operations which

<HEADLINE> Swiss President Hopes for More self-confident, Optimistic Switzerland in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- President Adolf Ogi has called on
the Swiss people to show more self-confidence, courage and
optimism about the country's future in his New Year's message to
the nation.
</P>
<P>
Taking office as Switzerland's federal president on January 1
for a one-year term, Ogi said that Switzerland is a nation that
can be proud of its achievements and should take an active role in
helping shape the future both at home and on an international
level.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to be seen by the international community as
tardy, over-cautious or complacent," he said, urging Switzerland
to recover its political confidence and courage of the turn of the
century, when landmark decisions, such as the then revolutionary
decision to build a major trans-Alpine rail tunnel, had helped
propel the country forward.
</P>
<P>
Now, almost 100 years later, Switzerland is again in the
process of expanding those major rail connections across the Alps,
Ogi said in referring to two major tunnels that played a key role
in recent transport negotiations between Switzerland and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Ogi said that Switzerland, despite its traditional political
neutrality, must continue to open up to the world and take an
active role in international decision-making.
</P>
<P>
"If you are optimistic and believe in your ability to solve a
problem then you are in a much better position to actually achieve
something. Pessimists are only able to see a problem, and then
another problem and yet another problem," Ogi said.

drama ended Friday with all the 155 hostages aboard the Indian
Airlines aircraft having returned here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
It was a touching home-coming for the passengers who returned
here to a warm welcome by relatives, friends and well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
In a highly surcharged atmosphere, some cried and others tried
to smile as they came out of the special aircraft sent to bring
them back from Kandahar where they were held hostage since Friday.
</P>
<P>
The passengers were put in cars and buses at the Indira Gandhi
International Airport where ambulances were on standby to meet any
exigencies.
</P>
<P>
It was a heart-rending scene of mixed emotions when some
passengers touched the tarmac and embraced their kith and kin for
whom it was an agonizing wait over the past week.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to be back in the country after eight days," a
visibly tired but passenger said.
</P>
<P>
The longest-ever hijacking involving an Indian airliner took a
sudden twist with External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh along
with three militants, flying to Kandahar after the government
announced that a deal had been reached for the release of the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
The hostages, including the crew of the IA flight 814 hijacked
while on its way from Kathmandu to New Delhi on December 24, flew
back to the capital in two planes along with Jaswant Singh to join
their families just before the dawn of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who met some opposition
leaders, defended the decision to free the militants, saying that
was the only option available. Opposition leaders expressed
reservations over the deal.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for home, Singh told reporters in Kandahar that
the Taliban had assured that the hijackers would not be given
political asylum and had been given 10 hours to leave Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
India thanked the Taliban and the authorities in Afghanistan
for their "constructive" cooperation in bringing an end to the
week-long hijacking crisis and asserted that the fight against
terrorism would continue unrelentingly.
</P>
<P>
Singh said at the Delhi airport soon after his arrival along
with hostages from Kandahar: "We have conveyed our gratitude to
the Taliban and authorities in Afghanistan for the cooperation
which was constructive all along the trying period."

<P>
HONG KONG, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has a smooth
rollover to the new Millennium without any Y2K-induced incidents
reported, a senior Hong Kong government official announced
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As at 1:00 a.m. Saturday, Hong Kong's Central Coordinating
Center (CCC), a region-wide Y2K monitoring and coordinating
structure, has not received any reports on Y2K-induced incidents,
Jessie Ting, deputy secretary for Information Technology and
Broadcasting, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The CCC has been in operation since 12:00 noon Friday to
monitor the rollover situation in Hong Kong and overseas. The
center works with coordinating centers of 13 essential services
sectors to respond to Y2K-induced incidents among different
departments and organizations.
</P>
<P>
Ting, who is also the controller of the CCC, said she was very
pleased to see that efforts made by all sectors concerned "are
bearing fruit as no Y2K-induced incidents have so far been
reported."
</P>
<P>
She said that in the next several days, the CCC "will continue
to monitor the status for each essential service sector and
coordinate emergency response to any incidents which have cross-
sector implications."
</P>
<P>
All government bureaus and departments with mission-critical
systems will conduct "wellness checks" for their systems over the
holiday, and report the result to the CCC, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of these checks is to confirm as early as
possible whether there is any Y2K-induced failures in government's
mission-critical systems," she said, adding that if necessary,
they "will be able to carry out the required remedial work before
the first normal working day in the new year."
</P>
<P>
"Government bureaus and departments will also be required to
report to the CCC on the first working day in the new millennium
on whether their operation is affected by any Y2K-induced failures
encountered by their business partners, local or overseas," Ting
added.

<P>
WELLINGTON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand opened up the
worldwide millennium celebrations Saturday.
</P>
<P>
When most of the countries in the world were still in 1999, the
people of New Zealand welcomed in the dawn of the new millennium
with all-night carnivals, continuous entertainment, colorful
fireworks displays and devout religious services.
</P>
<P>
As the first country on the globe to enter the new millennium,
New Zealand's greeting of the first rays of the dawn attracted
huge attention from around the world. Its three official dawn
celebrations were live broadcast to about 2.5 billion TV viewers
in 130 countries and regions around the globe.
</P>
<P>
The three official dawn celebrations were held on Pitt Island
in the Chatham Islands, which is 800 km from New Zealand's east
coast; at Mt Hikurangi, a site of strong cultural significance for
Maori; and Gisborne, a city on the east coast.
</P>
<P>
Children took center stage in the first official dawn
millennium celebrations on the Chatham Islands, which consists of
two inhabited islands of Chatham and Pitt, and over 40 small
islands and rock outcrops.
</P>
<P>
The 50 people on Pitt Island and 700 people on Chatham Island
were the first communities in the world to greet the dawn of the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
"Hi Millennium!" "Good Morning!"......a dozen of teenagers of
Pitt Island shouted greetings to the world from the top of Mount
Hakepa as the sun touched the first inhabited land at 4:59 am (New
Zealand Daylight Saving Time). They wished their greetings and
giggling, which echoed in the valley, could be carried far away to
every corner of the world, serving as an announcement that the
dawn of the year 2000 had arrived, thus raising the curtain for
the grand celebrations of the new millennium all over the world.
</P>
<P>
In the Moriori language, Hakepa meant the place which receives
the first rays of sunlight. Mount Hakepa is the highest point on
Pitt Island reaching 231 meters.
</P>
<P>
One and a half minutes later the children of Chatham Island
greeted the sunrise with a "Dawn Chorus" performance in dance and
song in which they "gifted" birds symbolizing peace, kindness,
hope and strength.
</P>
<P>
At the junction of the old and new millennium, a couple of
young people held a wedding ceremony. The first newlyweds of the
new millennium in the world promised to remain a devoted couple to
the end of their lives.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony involving Moriori, the first people to settle in
the Chatham Islands, a "Beacon of Hope" for the new millennium was
lit, beginning a series of similar beacons throughout the world.
The official midnight ceremony was followed by a dawn vigil which
culminated in a traditional Maori welcome to the dawn performed by
a local cultural group. This group also performed a traditional
Sunset Ceremony earlier to herald the millennium sunrise.
</P>
<P>
The Sunset Ceremony featured the four Touchstones of New
Zealand, which have been gifted by people in eastern, southern,
western and northern parts of the country to symbolize the ancient
soul of New Zealand. The four treasure stones were transported
onto the Chatham islands after travelling round the mainland of
New Zealand. Touching the stones, Islanders spoke out their dreams
for the country and its people in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Following the first dawn observances, the Chathams community
gathered for a communal breakfast during which the first horse
race of the new millennium was run.

<P>
The second site for New Zealand's millennium Dawn celebrations
was 1,752-meter Mt Hikurangi, 120 km north of Gisborne City. The
first light of the new millennium touched New Zealand's mainland
at Mt Hikurangi on the East Coast at 5:40 am.
</P>
<P>
Because of very limited safe space to assemble on the slopes of
the mountain, a limited number of people were allowed to attend
the celebrations there.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, after attending
celebrations in Auckland, made a special trip to Mt Hikurangi to
join 2,500 members of the local tribe and their invited guests
including representatives of the other indigenous peoples of the
world in greeting the dawn of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Bidding their farewell to the 20th century, people held a
religious service to salute it by commemorating the deeds of their
heroes and heroines of the past. When the dawn of the new century
appeared, they made a traditional call of welcome to it, while
battery-powered helium balloon beacons atop more than 10 mountains
from Hikurangi to Titirangi in Gisborne City were lit. Under the
first faint rays of the dawn, the balloon beacons shined
brilliantly.
</P>
<P>
The devout people also chanted prayers of tribute. This was
followed by a performance of traditional Maori songs and militant
dances by a 500-strong cultural group.
</P>
<P>
Gisborne's official dawn celebrations attracted a large number
of domestic and foreign tourists, greatly outnumbering its 46,000
permanent residents. It was a combination of Maori spirituality,
contemporary dance, the concert with Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and the
New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and recognition of New Zealand's
place in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The spectacular official dawn celebration, which began at 3:15
am on the waters and foreshore of Poverty Bay at Midway Beach
South, brought tens of thousands of people together. The
celebration started with a special Maori blessing. This was
followed by an interactive performance of New Zealand's journey
depicted in song and dance.
</P>
<P>
The most welcomed program was given by Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, the
most popular New Zealand-born opera singer who had immigrated to
England. About an hour before the sun touched the city at 5:43 am,
she began her performance for her hometown people, accompanied by
the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. Her excellent performance was
warmly received and her sweet singing brought in the dawn of the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The sun was greeted by a traditional Maori call of welcome.
This prompted a host of canoes and the tall ship The Spirit of New
Zealand into shore. The celebration finished with a special
breakfast at a nearby place.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Clark hurried to Gisborne from Mt Hikurangi on
New Year's morning. She extended from the city new millennium
greetings to the New Zealand people and the people in the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand organized hundreds of large-scale activities to
greet the new millennium. But the largest ones were held in
Auckland, the largest city in the country. As the first major city
to see the dawn, Auckland truly led the world into the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
A 12-hour-long, carnival style party was arranged in Aotea
Square and Aotea Center in Downtown Auckland. The party, featuring
Pacific Island's unique drumbeats and dances, traditional Chinese
Lantern-making and lion dance as well as a millennium ritual,
reflected the city's multicultural make-up and celebrated the
diversity of arts, entertainment and music.
</P>
<P>
There was a stunning theatrical extravaganza in the Auckland
Domain, the centerpiece of the city's millennium celebrations. It
was produced on a massive scale, with a 1,000-strong cast, state
of the art technology and special effects. The dramatic three-hour
journey through the past 2,000 years featured the birth of Jesus,
the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, the epic Maori canoe
journeys, Shakespeare, Newton, the world wars and much, much more..

<P>
At the moment when the globe began entering the new millennium,
a stunning fireworks display set the Auckland skyline afire at
midnight. Shot from inner-city high-rise buildings including the
Sky Tower, the multicolorful fireworks display ran for 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
A large-scale concert was staged at Auckland's Okahu Domain.
People at the Okahu Domain adopted a unique form to bid farewell
to the old millennium by standing in silence during last moments
of darkness. A few minutes later, a giant flotilla of more than 2,
000 craft including Maori canoes, dragon boats, naval ships and
Pacific Island outriggers sailed by. A royal New Zealand Air Force
fly-by extended the spectacle to the air.
</P>
<P>
At 6:06 am, the millennium flotilla arrived at the shores of
Okahu Bay as the first rays of sunlight stroke the water. Conches
call from the shore as a formal Maori welcome was sung across the
bay and a 2,000-strong welcome party performed the biggest ever
haka (a traditional Maori dance).
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Governor-General Sir Michael Hardie Boys attended
Wellington celebrations to welcome in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
In order to add more international significance to its
celebrations, the capital of New Zealand invited more than 150
teenagers from 80 countries and regions to take part in its
celebrations. They gathered with nearly 2,000 local children in a
pre-dawn ceremony of music and dance on the top of Mt Victoria,
the highest point of the city. Seeing the dawn coming, the happy
children broke into deafening cheers. A dozen of teenagers in
Japanese kimonos jubilantly beat taiko drums to greet the arrival
of new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Wellington is also a coastal city. A water-front carnival went
from the new year's eve through to the dawn. A great number of
Wellingtoners, braving the rain and bringing along the old and the
young, attended the exciting event. On the seaside, which was
decorated with tens of thousands of colorful lights, they enjoyed
performances by local artists, fireworks displays and a dance
party. The celebrations in Wellington left people with an
unforgetable impression.
</P>
<P>
On the new year's eve and dawn, the whole of New Zealand was
permeated with a festive atmosphere. Various forms of activities
were organized to bid farewell to the outgoing millennium and
welcome in the incoming one, including mountain-climbing to greet
the dawn, bay-crossing swimming, food stalls, lantern parades,
collective wedding ceremonies, and sports games.
</P>
<P>
During the occasion, a song, composed especially for the
millennium celebrations in New Zealand was sung. The song entitled
"I'll Meet You There" urged people to be optimistic about the
future and greet the new millennium in high spirit. It told the
people that their dreams could be realized as long as they never
thought of "turning back."
</P>
<P>
An official of the New Zealand Millennium Office told Xinhua
that the four millennium Touchstones had travelled the whole
country to listen to people's wishes and dreams. Although each had
his or her own wishes and dreams, a common wish was shared. They
all wished the new millennium would bring peace, harmony,
prosperity and happiness to the troubled world.

<HEADLINE> Macao People Greet New Millennium with Great  Expectations  By Zhang Yongqing </HEADLINE>

<P>
MACAO, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Like people around the world,
throngs of residents in Macao began flocking to public areas on
the eve of the new millennium, and celebrations heated up to high
tides toward midnight.
</P>
<P>
During the last several hours of 1999, Macao was illuminated
and lively songs and cheers could be heard all around the region
which had been reunited with the motherland just a dozen days ago.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR)
government and social bodies, countdown soirees were held at
several public places.
</P>
<P>
A torch was lit up in front of the famous Ruins of St. Paul
Church. Holding candles, hundreds of local middle-school students
were arrayed on the steps, singing for the upcoming new year. The
lights of the torch and candles blended with the colorfully
decorated lights nearby.
</P>
<P>
In the form of a zigzagging human chain, residents passed on
water, fire, soil and air -- which are regarded as four
fundamental elements to nurture life -- to a downtown square
several hundred meters away.
</P>
<P>
The square was overcrowded. Art performances brought people
nearer and nearer to the exhilarating moment. The performances
started from about half past nine on the eve of the new year.
</P>
<P>
The midnight was coming and people counted down loudly, "ten,
nine, eight,...... two, one!" Thunderous cheering erupted from the
square while thousands of balloons which bore people's written
best wishes were released into the air.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, celebrating soirees were in full swing in
many places.
</P>
<P>
In front of the Macao Jockey Club, singers from China's
Guangdong Province, Hong Kong as well as Macao sang for the new
year. Crowds of people were also fascinated by passionate dancing
and conjuring. Children were wild with joy holding the new year
gifts they had received from game stands.
</P>
<P>
Inside the Macao Forum, which had accommodated a grand party on
December 20 to mark the founding of the Macao SAR, about 5,000
people watched performances and waited for the coming of the new
year.
</P>
<P>
Along the southern coastal area of Macao, hundreds of
bicyclists from around the world held a competition around
midnight. It was part of a series of bicycling contests
surrounding the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Macao people have marched into a new year, a new era indeed,
just as Chinese President Jiang Zemin pointed out at Macao's
handover ceremony right after China's national flag was raised in
the territory which had long been ruled by the Portuguese.

<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- China celebrated the new
millennium with colorful festivities throughout the land.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, the largest industrial center of China, greeted the
new millennium with a colorful fireworks display, lively lion
dancing and grand gala along the Huangpu River.
</P>
<P>
Local residents counted down the last ten seconds of the
millennium in unison. When the clock clicked to the zero hour,
people in the crowd hugged and cheered wildly.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, the youngest municipality in southwest China,
welcomed the arrival of the year 2000 with a motorcycle rally at
dawn today.
</P>
<P>
People holding torches bearing the numbers "1999" ran in front
of the procession, followed by 2,000 motorcycles and 2,000 long
distance runners.
</P>
<P>
The procession passed through a 1,000-meter tunnel decorated
with 1,362 lights and a board brightly lit with the number 2000,
symbolizing the Chinese people's march from one millennium to
another.
</P>
<P>
High school student Cao Junjie said, "I am proud to be a
representative of 1.2 million students in our city of Chongqing to
greet the new millennium."
</P>
<P>
Nankai University in north China port city of Tianjin hosted a
grand evening party tonight. Thousands of students performed
dances with red silk banners in their hands before large-screen
TVs or the countdown clock.
</P>
<P>
A 115-year-old woman in a village on Tianjin's western
outskirts observed the festive night at her own home with five
generations of her family, more than 60 people in total. The city
boasts 92 centenarians who have entered the new century.
</P>
<P>
In northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
approximately 60 people from the United States, Hong Kong, Beijing
and Shanghai gathered at the Taklimakan Desert, the largest desert
of its kind in China, to see the first sunrise of this century.
They cheered, rang bells and released pigeons and balloons.
</P>
<P>
Among them were 10 newly-recovered patients who are all around
age 60 and eight couples who will hold their wedding ceremony on
the desert when the first rays of sunlight appear.
</P>
<P>
In freezing Harbin, capital of China's northernmost
Heilongjiang Province, 34 couples from the U.S., Turkey and China
held their wedding ceremony in a lavish artistic project named the
"Great World of Ice and Snow."
</P>
<P>
However, many residents in south China's Guangzhou city who
usually travel during holidays chose to stay at home on the first
day of 2000 for fear of possible Y2K problems with airlines. Some
said they will visit nearby scenic spots by bus instead of flying.
</P>
<P>
A luxury pleasure cruiser named the "Millennium Boat" carried
people from all social strata down the Beijing-Hangzhou Great
Canal, which winds through four provinces and two major cities
with a total length of 1,789 meters. Passengers sang and danced
joyously to celebrate the arrival of the year 2000. They are
scheduled to see the first ray of the new millennium on Guangji
Bridge.

are holding torches and scattering into the shape of a dragon, the
auspicious symbol of Chinese civilization, to greet the new
millennium.

At the same time, Pen Jiang, a computer programmer with the
China Computer Software and Technology Service Corporation, is
hosting a private party in the two-bedroom apartment he moved into
yesterday at the Huilongguan Living Quarters in the northern
suburbs of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Attended by a few friends, the party is a combination New Year'
s-housewarming affair. "The house is a result of rent down payment,
said Peng.
</P>
<P>
Though traffic in urban areas is now constantly clogged, a
number of bus lines will be open for late night New Year's
revelers. A subway line with underground tunnels and on-ground
tracks is under construction.
</P>
<P>
"It's a coincidence that the subway connects the quarter and my
company at Xizhimen in the western urban area," Peng said with
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
At the subway's construction site near Peng's house, thousands
of workers are still busy building the 40 km long subway, the
country's first of its kind. At a cost of six billion yuan (723
million US dollars), the subway will go into operation in 2001.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, living in suburbs has become more and more
popular among Beijing citizens, especially young people, Peng said.
For those living in urban areas of the city, the New Year's
holiday offered them a 24-hour shopping day by most major
department stores.
</P>
<P>
While they are deciding what will be their first purchase in
the new year, groups of foreigners are visiting ancient
architectural sites in the city on tricycle.

As new babies cry and new parents laugh, millions of Chinese
watched the millennium turnover on the Internet. With a few taps
on the keyboard, they entered the new year and watched the new
millennium's entrance at the zero hour. Statistics from Sohu, one
of the largest Chinese websites, show that about two million
people visited the site to see the first rays of sunshine or share
New Year's greetings.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xin, a web designer with Sohu, said that there are eight
million internet users in China, most of whom spent New Year's Eve
on the net.
</P>
<P>
This is an unusual new tradition for the Chinese at such a
festive occasion, Wang said, adding that with the development of
technology, more such changes will take place for the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
For Zhao Ze, an Shanghai-based engineer, the change took place
right at the beginning of the new millennium. Zhao and his wife
arrived in Beijing yesterday afternoon to attend a centenary group
wedding organized by the All-China Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
When the New Year's bell strikes, a total of 2,000 newly-
married couples nationwide will embrace their new spouses.

<TEXT>
<P>

BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- A children's choir sang a song
softly as a candle lit up the face of 55-year-old astronomer Wang
Jingxiu.
</P>
<P>
Wang, one of China's leading astronomers with the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, together with thousands of ordinary residents,
prayed for world peace as they converged on the Shanghaiguan Pass,
the east end of the world famous Great Wall on the shores of the
Bohai Bay, one minute till midnight before the first day of the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the world will enter an era of peace, democracy and
science in the new millennium, and China will become a most
prosperous, democratic and culturally advanced nation in the new
era," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In ancient times, China presented to the world four great
inventions, including paper-making, gun-powder, printing and the
compass.
</P>
<P>
"I hope China will contribute still more to the world in the
new millennium," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the call of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), prayers for the end
of war and ever-lasting peace for mankind were uttered by Chinese
citizens along the 2,000-year-old Great Wall, a great wonder of
human civilization, like the pyramids of Egypt, the Taj Mahal in
India, and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.
</P>
<P>
The temperature in Shanhaiguan at midnight dropped drastically
to more than ten degrees below zero. Seven-year-old primary school
pupil Ma He stood red-faced in the cold, freezing wind for more
than four hours.
</P>
<P>
"I'm too excited to feel the cold," the boy told his mother. (

Approximately 2,000 college students sang and danced around
campfires by the sea. Colorful fireworks that arced into the sky
and campfire lit up the camp site. Crowds gathered on the ancient
magnificent Great Wall, hills and seashores, waiting for the
arrival of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
When the clock struck the zero hour on January 1, 2000,
revelers on the Badaling section of the Great Wall in Beijing's
northern outskirtan area chanted joyously the final ten-second
countdown in unison, and at midnight more fireworks ripped through
the sky.
</P>
<P>
The sound of gongs and drums resounded from the Great Wall's
starting point at Jiayuguan Pass on the Silk Road in northwest
China to Shanhaiguan Pass.
</P>
<P>
People in China prayed for a peaceful new world on the Great
Wall, the only man-made structure visible from the Moon, which was
a means of defense against raids from northern nomadic tribes in
ancient times, and now is regarded as a symbol of national spirit.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 people from in China's mainland, Taiwan, Hong
Kong and Macao and from overseas climbed the Badaling section of
the wall. According to the traditional Chinese calendar, the year
2000 is the year of dragon, an auspicious one.
</P>
<P>
Fan Yunlong, a villager from Lingfen city of north China's
Shanxi Province, has spent three full years to complete a drawing
of 12 dragons on a 21-meter-long scroll as an expression to show
his best wishes to China in the year of dragon.

<HEADLINE> Eternal Flame, Big Bell Add Excitement to Beijing Celebrations ( Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Lighting a new eternal flame and
striking the world's largest bronze bell, revelers in the Chinese
capital of Beijing ushered in a new era.
</P>
<P>
 Gongs and drums, lion and dragon dances, flowers and laughter
filled the 4.5-hectare China Centenary Altar. Braving wintry wind,
the jubilant multitude awaited the historic moment.
</P>
<P>
 As a huge countdown board indicated only 20 seconds until the
year 2000, more than 20,000 people on the altar cheerfully chanted:
"Twenty, Nineteen, Eighteen ... Three, Two, One!"
</P>
<P>
 As the digital countdown reached zero, Chinese President
Jiang Zemin pressed a button, and a flame instantly leaped up from
the center of a square at the south side of the altar. The fire
will be preserved eternally.
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, people began to strike a 50-ton bell placed
at the east side of the altar, a memorial structure built for
greeting the new century and new millennium. Twenty one thundering
tolls of the bell echoed through Beijing.
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese nation will be rejuvenated due to the motherland
's complete reunification and the establishment of a prosperous,
strong, democratic, culturally advanced and modern socialist
country," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
 Merrymakers set off an array of fireworks which spelled out "
2000" in the dark sky. Two hundred youngsters representing the
country's 56 ethnic groups, all wearing their traditional clothing,
danced delightedly. Nine dragon figures flying over the frolicking
crowd and a sea of flowers marked the gala's climax.
</P>
<P>
 History Professor Zhang Xiqing of Beijing University said he
takes pride in China's past millennium, during which the nation
invented the compass, printing, and gun powder, greatly promoting
the development of world civilization.

<TEXT>

<P>
Zhang is also one of the authors of the bell's inscription. He
said the bell is inscribed with 20 major events in China in the
20th century, including the Revolution of 1911, in which the
Chinese bourgeois toppled the Qing Dynasty, the founding of the
Communist Party of China, and the founding of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
 Among these events are China's opening-up and reforms drive
and the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland. The bell
also depicts the national shame of the aggression of foreign
allied forces at the beginning of the 20th century and the
Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976.
</P>
<P>
 "The past century saw China's rise from weakness to
prosperity," Zhang said. "History tells us that as long as a
nation works hard in unity, there exist no unconquerable
difficulties in the course of development."
</P>
<P>
 Flames lit the smiling faces of the people. The fire for the
eternal flame was brought from Zhoukoudian, 48 kilometers from
downtown Beijing. There, in 1923, archeologists discovered the
fossil remains of Peking Man, an evolutionary ancestor of man some
600,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
 The fire was brought to the altar by 1.87-meter-tall Dabenna,
a young man from Inner Mongolia who studies law at Beijing
University.
</P>
<P>
 "I'm carrying the sacred flame on behalf of all Chinese youth,
" the 22-year-old Dabenna said. "Like carrying the flame, we
should carry on the long history of China's civilization,
generation to generation."
</P>
<P>
 Looking up at the altar shaped like a giant sundial, Tang
Shaoguo, who took part in the building of the altar that combines
both traditional and modern styles, said China is certain to build
an even more prosperous civilization as long as it walks on the
right path, as it is doing right now.

<HEADLINE> China Fetes Dawning of New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Frenetic people around China,
one of first countries embracing the year 2000, overwhelmed the
historic sites in the country last night, celebrating the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
"To the future, the 5,000-year-old civilization is such a
marvelous gift," said Zeng Tao, a TV anchorperson.
</P>
<P>
Beijing built a new landmark, the Chinese Centenary Altar, to
link the past with the future, and a flame brought from the Peking
Man Site, where human ancestors learned to use fire some 500,000
years ago, was ignited at the altar.
</P>
<P>
At the stroke of midnight, President Jiang Zemin arrived at the
millennium monument which blends the symbols of the Book of
Changes, one of China's oldest classical philosophical works, with
modern technology, and expressed his wish that China will strive
to create a bright future along with the other countries on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, crowds of people ascended the Great Wall despite the
severe cold, where fireworks, candle light and drumbeats replaced
the ancient smoke signals that once dominated this great fortress
built to stop invaders.
</P>
<P>
Other sites representing the ancient Chinese civilization,
including the Forbidden City and the Terra-cotta Warriors Museum,
were also jammed with Chinese, many of them returning from
overseas to celebrate the historic moment. At the stroke of
midnight, bells sounded in cities throughout the nation. "This is
the most auspicious sound," said Jue Xing, a Buddhist master in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Many believe that a new millennium signals the start of a
transition from chaos to order, and from separation to
reunification.
</P>
<P>
It was shortly after the beginning of the first millennium that
Emperor Guangwu expelled a usurper and revitalized the great Han
Dynasty. On the eve of the second millennium, the Song Dynasty
reunited China by ending the chaotic period of the Five Dynasties
and Ten Countries (907-979), and turned the Chinese capital of
that time, Kaifeng in central China's Henan Province, into the
largest and most prosperous city in the world. The first
millennium also saw the completion of China's four great
inventions: gun powder, paper, movable-type printing, and the
compass.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong and Macao, to the Chinese, is another
big gift. The 20th century began with cannon shots fired by
foreign forces attempting to split the country, but ended amid the
chorus of Beijing Opera and Western symphony orchestras under the
most brilliant spotlights. This joyful picture has undoubtedly
stirred up the nation's anticipation of a better century, and for
the reunification of China by solving the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
The last days of 1999 passed as sales of private cars continued
to rise and people predicted a growing stock market in the Year of
Dragon.
</P>
<P>
After midnight, a general manager of a Chinese airline company
piloted a jetliner into the sky, showing his full defiance of the
"millennium bug." In Shanghai, citizens ascended one of the
highest skyscrapers for a first glimpse of the New Year sun.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the first ray of light fell on the Chinese mainland in
Zhejiang Province, and then went across the vast land to Tibet and
Xinjiang, two ethnic autonomous regions in the far west.
</P>
<P>
Many people believe that it is the time to commemorate the
giants. The names of Confucius, Laozi, Emperor Qin Shihuang,
Genghis Khan, Sun Yat-sen,Mao Zedong, and Deng Xiaoping appear in
morning newspapers in Chinese characters. The Chinese used these
characters to record history long before the birth of Jesus Christ,
and still use them today.
</P>
<P>
However, other traditions have died. In China, the years were
named after the names of emperors until 1911. The Western way of
calculating the years was not officially introduced until the
founding of the People's Republic in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Chinese civilization had in fact maintained a dominant position
in the world for thousands of years, and China has only lagged
behind the West for the past several centuries. Some observers
believe that China's rejuvenation began 50 years ago, and that the
new millennium will see the country take off once more.
</P>
<P>
At 23:59 of the last day of 1999, holding candles aloft, the
people gathered at the Great Wall began to pray for peace together
with people around the world.
</P>
<P>
The dawn of a new year had arrived in China.

<P>
In the famous Beima temple in Luoyang, central China's Henan
Province, the two-ton, 445-year-old bell rang out loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no Chinese temples boasted more visitors today than the
famous Hanshan Temple in the east China city of Suzhou, Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
There, a 33-year-old Qiushuang monk timed his 108th strike of a
cast-iron bell to the clock ticking to zero hours on Jan. 1, 2000,
and thousands of people at the temple cheered as the last chime
sounded, rejoicing over the arrival of the new year and the new
century.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 30,000 clergy and laymen gathered at the famous
cultural spot today, including over 1,200 tourists from Japan,
Italy and other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
In China's largest commercial city of Shanghai, bells also rang
from the 70-year-old customs building, the Yufo Temple and Jingan
Temple.
</P>
<P>
"This year is really the high point of a century in which our
country celebrated its 50th anniversary, Macao returned to the
motherland and the new millennium arrived," said Monk Juexing, the
11th Buddhist abbot of the Yufo Temple.
</P>
<P>
"Bell chimes are the most auspicious and beautiful sounds of
Buddhism. I sincerely hope that the chimes will bring to all the
wisdom and good luck," he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- When clock struck zero hours
here today, the giant bronze China Centenary Bell, the largest in
the nation, chimed 21 times at the China Centenary Altar in
western Beijing.
</P>
<P>
From the altar, Chinese President Jiang Zemin pressed a button
to light the sacred flame, taken from Zhoukoudian on the outskirts
of Beijing, where the "Peking Man" fossil was found by
archaeologists in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after that, 20 people struck the bell in unison, to
the thunder of fireworks and explosive cheers from thousands upon
thousands of revelers gathered to celebrate the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The centenary bell, which was cast specially for the millennium
celebration, weighs 50 tons and is 6.8 meters high and 3.38 meters
in diameter. It is inscribed with the words to the national anthem
and accounts of the major historical events of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Bells have been symbols of the Chinese nation for over 5,000
years. China traditionally rings bells during major festivals and
grand ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
With the advent of the new millennium, thousands of bells rang
across the ancient land. The Chinese people sincerely hoped that
this ancient and traditional instrument would spread their best
wishes far and near.
</P>
<P>
In the Chinese capital, the famous 579-year-old Yongle Bell in
the Big Bell Temple in northwestern Beijing boomed, along with the
"Zhonghua Hezhong", the Chinese Bells of Harmony, a huge set of
bells placed near the Forbidden City in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Before the past millennium, the world acknowledged glorious
Chinese civilization developed several thousand years ago, and
China maintained its prominent position in the world until the
15th century. Due to the slow growth of productive forces and
social and political decadence, China gradually fell behind other
nations, and as a result it fell into a semi-colonial and semi-
feudal society up to the modern times, suffering the bullying and
humiliation of world powers. However, the Chinese people did not
yield but waged an arduous struggle for generations. The Communist
Party of China (CPC), represented by Comrade Mao Zedong and
combining the basic Marxist principles with the real conditions in
China, led the Chinese people in a great revolution and
established new China in the middle of this century. China has
since entered a new epoch of socialism. Now, the Chinese people
are making giant leaps toward modernization along the road of
reform and opening-up pioneered by Comrade Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, progress will override backwardness, science will
win over ignorance and justice over evil, and this is a truth that
history has made clear time after time. The noble cause of world
peace and development will never be deterred.
</P>
<P>
Facing the new century and the new millennium, far-sighted
statesmen in all countries should think from a historical
perspective when they ask themselves: What should the future world
be like and what contribution should be made to realizing such a
world?
</P>
<P>
We hope that in the future, all states and ethnic groups will
co-exist in peace and harmony and cooperate in a friendly manner
with each other for common development, shaping a reasonable and
just international new political and economic order, and realizing
lasting peace and universal prosperity so that the people of all
countries can build and enjoy a happy life according to their own
desires. The world is marching toward multi-polarization, which is
the inevitable trend in historical development and also the common
will of all the people in the world. The Chinese people are ready
to work with the people of all other countries to fight against
hegemony and power politics, push forward the process of multi-
polarization and create a glorious future for the world.
</P>
<P>
We firmly believe that in the new century, the Chinese people
will unshakably proceed along the road of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, China's socialist system will be
consolidated and perfected through continuous reforms, its
development will lead to national prosperity through the common
advancement in all regions, and the Chinese nation will be
rejuvenated due to the motherland's complete reunification and the
establishment of a prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally
advanced and modern socialist country.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin's Speech Greeting Year 2000 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text
of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's speech to greet the new century
and millennium:

Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades and Friends:
</P>
<P>
The bell to usher in the year 2000 will soon resound throughout
the boundless sky of our planet. Human civilization will enter a
new century and the beginning of a new millennium. Tonight, the
people of all countries of the world, whether in the east, west,
south or north, regardless of their nationalities and faiths, are
elated over the arrival of this historic moment.
</P>
<P>
First, I would like to wish the people of all nationalities
throughout the country, overseas Chinese and friends all over the
world a happy new year, and extend to them my best wishes for the
new century and the new millennium!
</P>
<P>
This moment is most likely to inspire people to review the past
and look into the future. Only by correctly summing up history can
people move bravely ahead.
</P>
<P>
Over the past millennium, great changes have taken place in
human history. Ancient civilization developed into modern
civilization. Feudal society became capitalist, and in some
countries a completely new socialist system has emerged. The human
economic activities have entered an industrial era and are now
shifting to a time marked by swift development of high and new
technologies. Man has accumulated vast material and ideological
wealth which is beyond comparison with that of the previous
millennia. In understanding and changing the world, man broke
through one realm of necessity after another and has continued
advancing toward the realm of freedom.
</P>
<P>
Over the past millennium, all the achievements in human
civilization in terms of social changes and scientific and
technological progress have been made by weeding out the old ways
to allow the new ways to come through. The Renaissance did away
with the dark domination of theology in the Middle Ages in Europe.
The mighty power of peace and justice defeated "overlords" who
rode roughshod over the world and their unjust wars were lost. The
centuries-long colonial system was finally declared terminated
during the movement for national liberation that had surged
through this century. Outstanding inventions and extensive
exchanges between people of various countries have converged to
form a mighty force to advance the progress made in history. The
desire for peace and development has become the trend of the times
in the world today.

BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- As the clock ticked off zero
hours on the year 2000's first day, tens of thousands of Chinese
staged a traditional dragon dance and prayed for peace along a
lengthy stretch of the Great Wall, the beloved symbol of China, to
welcome the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Just before the advent of January 1, people from Jiayuguan, the
west end of the 6,000-kilometer-long Great Wall, in the desert of
the Gansu Province, across to Shanhaiguan, the east end at the
coast of Hebei Province, held candles and uttered a one-minute
prayer for world peace.
</P>
<P>
Revelers on the Badaling section of the Great Wall in suburban
Beijing chanted the final ten-second countdown in unison, and at
midnight fireworks ripped through the sky.
</P>
<P>
On the last night of 1999, people at the city gate of Jiayuguan
played traditional Chinese musical instruments to say good-bye to
the final sunset of 1999.
</P>
<P>
At 20:00 Beijing Time on December 31, 1999, Chinese on the
Great Wall let out deafening cheers and beat gongs and drums. The
jubilation passed from one tower to the next, until a total of 20
watch towers and ancient passes, symbolizing the 20 centuries
people have been through, were contributing to the roar.
</P>

<HEADLINE> World Peace, Development Cause Never Deterred: Jiang Zemin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that history has made clear time after time that
the noble cause of world peace and development will never be
deterred.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, progress will override backwardness, science will
win over ignorance and justice over evil, Jiang said at a midnight
celebration marking the coming new century and millennium.
</P>
<P>
"Facing the new century and the new millennium, far-sighted
statesmen in all countries should think from a historical
perspective when they ask themselves: What should the future world
be like and what contribution should be made to realizing such a
world?" he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that in the future, all states and ethnic
groups will co-exist in peace and harmony and cooperate in a
friendly manner with each other for common development, shaping a
reasonable and just international new political and economic order,
and realizing lasting peace and universal prosperity so that the
people of all countries can build and enjoy a happy life according
to their own desires.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the world is marching toward multi-
polarization, which is the inevitable trend in historical
development and also the common will of all the people in the
world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese people are ready to work with the
people of all other countries to fight against hegemony and power
politics, push forward the process of multi-polarization and
create a glorious future for the world.
</P>
<P>
Over the past millennium, great changes have taken place in
human history. Ancient civilization developed into modern
civilization. Feudal society became capitalist, and in some
countries a completely new socialist system has emerged, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the human economic activities have entered an
industrial era and are now shifting to a time marked by swift
development of high and new technologies. Man has accumulated vast
material and ideological wealth which is beyond comparison with
that of the previous millennia.
</P>
<P>
Over the past millennium, all the achievements in human
civilization in terms of social changes and scientific and
technological progress have been made by weeding out the old ways
to allow the new ways to come through, he said.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding inventions and extensive exchanges between people
of various countries have converged to form a mighty force to
advance the progress made in history. The desire for peace and
development has become the trend of the times in the world today,
he stressed.
