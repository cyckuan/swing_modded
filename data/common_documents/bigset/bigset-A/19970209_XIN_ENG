MOSCOW, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Tajik government, Islamic
rebels and a top military leader from neighboring Afghanistan held
talks today to try to solve the hostage crisis in Tajikistan,
Itar-Tass news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, headed by Bakhrom Sadirov, took Tajikistan's
Security Minister Saidamir Zukhurov hostage on Friday as he
arrived in Obi-Garm for talks to try and secure the release of
four United Nations workers, four U.N. military observers and
four Russian journalists who were captured by the rebels on

The rebels were also holding Muhamad Soleh, brother of Afghan
military leader Ahmad Shan Masoud who is taking part in the
talks. But Soleh was released and has now joined the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Bakhrom Sadirov's brother, Rizvon Sadirov, a former commander
of the Tajik armed opposition was also present at the
negotiations. He is believed to have carried out the kidnappings
and is demanding free passage for rebels based in neighoring
Afghanistan to return to Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-General Pavel Tarasenko, the commander of Russian
border troops, told Itar-Tass that all border check-points in and
out of Afghanistan have been sealed in the wake of the

<P>
Tajikistan has been engaged in a four-year civil war, but there
is currently a ceasefire between the government and the armed
Islamic opposition.

<HEADLINE> PA Complains About Israeli Foot-dragging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority (PA)
said today it has sent 92 messages to the world community warning
against the gravity of Israel's non-compliance with the signed
agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Voice of Arab radio, Local Government
Minister Saeb Erekat warned against Israel's continued digging
operation beneath the al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest shrine of
Islam and other "oppressive measures" aimed to preempt final
status talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel's opening of a tourist tunnel near the al-Aqsa mosque
compound sparked gun battles between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian police in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as well as
widespread demonstrations. A total of 61 Palestinians and 15
Israelis were killed in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Erekat also denounced the confiscation of identity cards from
the Palestinians in Jerusalem, the decision to expand Jewish
settlements in southeast and north of Jerusalem up to the outskirts
of Bethlehem and Ramallah, both self-rule enclaves in the West
Bank set up under the interim peace deals with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He warned that these measures could bear grave consequences on
the future of the peace process and the final status negotiations
on Jerusalem, slated for March 15, he told the Cairo-based radio.
</P>
<P>
Israel pulled back troops from 80 percent of Hebron in January
but PA leader Yasser Arafat has accused it of foot-dragging on
implementing addenda to the Hebron deal signed last month.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said the meeting between Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu will discuss implementation of 33
pending items in the Hebron protocol, such as starting work on a
Gaza seaport, opening Gaza airport and creating a "safe passage"
corridor between Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Besides the final phase negotiations, scores of other civil and
economic topics will also be discussed at the meeting, including
the release of Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails, he said.
</P>
<P>
Only 25 of the nearly 5,000 Palestinian prisoners held by
Israel are women, some of them were involved in deadly attacks
against Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The release of female, sick and young prisoners was a
commitment made in a deal signed by the previous government in
September 1995 with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Arafat will meet Sunday evening at Erez on the
border between Israel and Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Aid Body Helps Zimbabwe Fight Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A U.S.-based development aid
agency said here today it is willing to help research on projects
aiming at poverty alleviation in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
William Ford, the head of the African Development Foundation
(ADF), said the ADF has financial resources to take on more
projects in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Ford, accompanied by other ADF board members, arrived at the
country six days ago to assess the development of the projects
the foundation has been involved in.
</P>
<P>
The foundation has invested about 2.5 million U.S. Dollars in
20 projects in Zimbabwe since an agreement between the two sides
was signed in 1985.
</P>
<P>
"The projects continue to meet their goals and new projects
are coming, we are certainly going to fund them," said Ford.
</P>
<P>
The ADF-financed projects, some of them aimed at raising
women's income, are mainly rural agricultural ventures.
</P>
<P>
Ford said most of the projects aim to alleviate poverty and
have recorded more fruits than initially expected.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Warns Officers Against Getting Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Public Service,
Labor and Social Welfare Deputy Minister Alois Mangwende today
said the government would deal harshly with officers who demand
bribes and people who induce civil servants with bribes.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the women's branch of the War Veterans
Association in Harare, Mangwende said the public should report
officials who demand bribes.
</P>
<P>
''I appreciate that sometimes the temptation is strong when
one is desperate to be served and an officer is demanding a
bribe, but people should persevere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Bribery in Zimbabwe has become prevalent as people are pressed
to ''tip'' the civil servants to expedite applications for
drivers license, marriage certificates and many more services
which are only provided by the government.
</P>
<P>
Mangwende stressed, ''if you give a bribe you are equally
guilty and to stem this practice we will arrest both parties.''

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Publish Code of Conduct on AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government is in
the process of gazetting the national code of practice on AIDS
under which it will become an offense to discriminate those with
the HIV virus or AIDS disease.
</P>
<P>
Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare Minister Florence
Chitauro today said under the code no employee should be sacked
from work because they were suffering from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
''We know some people have lost their jobs because they were
HIV positive and we want to put a stop to this... if a person has
the disease they should only be shifted to a department which
allows for them to work in that condition and not to sack them,''
said Chitauro at the National Employment Council for the
transport operators industry.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 people are estimated to be dying from the disease
each week in Zimbabwe while over one million are said to carry
the HIV virus which causes AIDS.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Telecom-Japan, one of
Japan's largest telecommunications companies and a leading
provider of Internet access services, has chosen U.S. Robotics'
Total Control network as the standard for its nationwide internet
project, bi-weekly Israel Business reported today.
</P>
<P>
Tsion Ezra, head of U.S. Robotics' Israeli marketing company
TEAM Computers' communications division, explained that
U.S. Robotics equipment will be initially installed in Tokyo --
the largest installation in the world outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ezra added that Telecom-Japan also placed an order for
U.S. Robotics new X2 technology which offers the Internet and
on-line services at a speed of 56 Kbsp -- almost twice the
commonly-available speed on today's market -- via standard
telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
Telecom-Japan will also be able to upgrade the Total Control
equipment which it operates to support the new technology by
means of the addition of a simple software application.
</P>
<P>
Ezra said that U.S. Robotics management expects Telecom-Japan
to be the first company to provide Internet and on-line service
operation via standard telephone lines -- at a transmission
speed of 56 Kbps -- to customers throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
He added that over 40 telecommunications service suppliers,
representing more than 15 million users, have already pledged
their support for the new technology.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Golden Internet Company, which employs the
U.S. Robotics network package, has also announced its willingness
to join the list of X2 technology users in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Domestic users of U.S. Robotics modems will also be able to
upgrade their modems to make use of the new technology.

<HEADLINE> Auto Accidents Cost Greek Insurance Companies Heavily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A recent study has revealed that
Greek insurance companies spend approximately 100 billion drachmas
(about 400 million U.S. dollars) annually on clients' automobile
repairs.
</P>
<P>
The Prevention and Control Committee of Automobile Accidents,
part of the Insurance Companies Union of Greece, claims that 80
percent of insurance payments are used to cover auto damages as
the number of accidents is rapidly increasing and repair costs are
extremely high.
</P>
<P>
According to the Statistical Services of Insurance Companies, in
1995 75.5 billion drachmas (302 million U.S. dollars) were spent
on repairs with an average of about 296,812 drachmas (1,187
dollars) per automobile. Client's insurance payments for the same
year reached about 127 billion drachmas (508 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies note that if repair cost and auto accidents
were reduced, insurance fees could also decrease. But repair costs
in Greece are not standardized, which results in extremely high
fees charged to insurance companies. The Prevention and Control
Committee of Automobile Accidents claimed that the cost divergence
could be avoided if the auto repair market was audited for prices
concerning labour costs and parts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, insurance company representatives indirectly blame
the traffic police for their inability to implement the Driving
Code, known as KOK, and thus reduce the number of car accidents.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Child Murder and Suicide Rate High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States has the
highest rates of child murder and suicide in the industrialized
world, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has expressed great concern about
the figure, describing the situation as "unacceptable," said the
report.
</P>
<P>
A study by the state-sponsored Center for Disease Control
(CDC) found that the number of Americans under age 15 who are
likely to be killed are five times more than other 25 developed
countries the CDC has surveyed.
</P>
<P>
From 1950 to early 1990, the death rate for U.S. children
dropped substantially due to enhanced health and safety
standards, said the study.
</P>
<P>
However, the child murder rate tripled and child suicide cases
quadrupled in the same period, the BBC quoted the study as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The number of American children are 12 times more likely to
die in gunfire and twice more likely to commit suicide compared
with other developed nations, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons of the phenomenon is that children in
the United States have easy access to guns, said the report.

HARARE, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwe minister today said
the government is committed to the indigenization of the
Zimbabwean economy so as to spread the economic benefits of
market reforms to be poor majority.
</P>
<P>
Addressing participants to a business conference organized by

number of ad-hoc measures have been put in place in support of
indigenization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Msipa said the government had also approved the operational
framework of the National Investment Trust (NIT), which would
hold shares of privatized companies in trust for the indigenous
sector.
</P>
<P>
He also said a comprehensive timetable of privatizing and
commercializing all state enterprises is being worked out.

<HEADLINE> 280,000 People Need Food Aid in N. Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Church leaders in
Northern Tanzania today said over 280,000 people are in need of
food assistance following the current drought persisting in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Bishops of ELCT dioceses in Arusha, Meru, Mount Kilimanjaro
and Pare met in Arusha on Friday to discuss the current drought
situation in the Northern Zone.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued in the town of Arusha today,
the joint assessment mission indicated that Arusha, Kilimanjaro
and Tanga regions are facing food crisis.
</P>
<P>
Apart from crop failure, the drought has greatly contributed
to serious water shortage for pastoralists as dams, wells,
springs and rivers have dried up.
</P>
<P>
"The condition of livestock in these areas is worsening," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said the church leaders appealed to government to carry out
a quick assessment of affected areas and victims and provide
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The statement further said the church leaders have pledged to
educate the public on how to handle the drought situation by
preserving available resources of food and water.
</P>
<P>
The churches will cooperate with the government and other
institutions to ensure that food assistance reached only the
needy, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> 83 Servicemen Killed in Egypt in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A total of 83 servicemen were
killed in combating terrorism in Egypt in 1996, the Egyptian MENA
news agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The state security authorities managed to uncover 125 terrorist
cases during 1996. About 98 percent of the accused were arrested
while the rest are at large outside the country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The People's Assembly of Egypt advocated stronger support to
the armed forces to keep them the "protective impregnable shield"
against internal and external threats.
</P>
<P>
A committee of the assembly, formed to prepare explanations to
the government's policy statement, said in its report that peace
requires a strong armed force capable of protecting the country.
</P>
<P>
The committee lauded the achievements of the armed forces in
training as shown in its major war games "Badr 96," held last
September, and the joint exercises with friendly countries with
advanced capabilities and high combat experience.
</P>
<P>
It hailed the armed forces' plan to extend services to back up
the civil sector as well as their contribution to the
rehabilitation of 22,000 demobilized soliders and the eradication
of 30,000 illiterates every year.
</P>
<P>
The government should upgrade military industry as it is closely
tied to the state security and strategies, the committee said in
the report which the assembly will continue to discuss after the
three-day break on the occasion of the Lesser Bairam.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the committee applauded the role played by security
agencies in maintaining security and stability throughout the
country.

<HEADLINE>   UN: No Greek Cypriots Involved in Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. investigation showed
that no Greek Cypriots were involved in the alleged shooting
incident near the Turkish Cypriot village Louroujina last
Thursday, Cyprus Defense Minister Costas Eliades said here today.
</P>
<P>
There has never been such an incident, Eliades said in a
statement to reporters, adding that the investigation was
conducted by the U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said that the whole story was a "well
planned fabrication, aimed at creating problems in the military
dialogue," currently underway between the National Guard (Cyprus'
armed forces) and the Turkish troops under the U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
It was further aimed at affecting efforts for a Cyprus
settlement, Eliades added.
</P>
<P>
Also today, UNFICYP released an announcement on its actions
and observations regarding the alleged shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
"A burst of about 10 rounds of automatic fire was heard by
an UNFICYP observation post and by an UNFICYP patrol base near
Louroujina in the early hours," the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
It added "strong winds at the time made it impossible to
determine the direction of the shots."
</P>
<P>
UNFICYP said that at first light, one of their officers "was
shown an intermittent, five meter-long trail of blood stains in
the immediate vicinity of an observation post" located southeast
of Louroujina at the Turkish forces' cease-fire line.
</P>
<P>
The trail consisted of five spots of varying amounts of blood
leading from the flagpoles in front of the observation post
toward the U.N.-buffer zone but not into it, it said.
</P>
<P>
"UNFICYP thoroughly searched the buffer zone in the area
concerned, both on the ground and from the air, and did not find
anything which could shed further light on the matter," the
announcement noted.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the U.N. peacekeeping force in the area was
immediately increased, it added, noting that UNFICYP "is in
close contact with the military authorities on both sides in
order to defuse possible tension."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has already turned down Turkish
allegations that shots were fired against a number of Greek
Cypriots who tried to lower the Turkish flag in the area,
wounding one of them.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup supported by Athens.
</P>
<P>
Around 35,000 Turkish troops have been stationed in northern
Cyprus to protect the Turkish Cypriots, who unilaterally
declared in 1983 a breakaway state "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus", which is only recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Treasury Secretary Praises Strong Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Berlin, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin said here today that a strong dollar is in the interest of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Rubin told reporters after a one-day meeting of the Group of
Seven (G-7) finance ministers and central bankers in Berlin that
Washington welcomes the strong dollar because it meant lower
inflation at home, lower interest rates and because it created
confidence in global financial markets.
</P>
<P>
But he stopped short of speculating whether the dollar would
strengthen further against the German mark.
</P>
<P>
No clear signals were given by the G-7 ministers either when
they issued a short statement after the meeting declaring that the
major currency misalignments of 1995 had been corrected.
</P>
<P>
They promised to monitor currency developments and "cooperate
as appropriate".
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Rubin, Germany's central bank president Hans
Tietmeyer and Finance Minister Theo Waigel said before the meeting
that they believed the steady gains of the dollar against the
German mark should now be over.
</P>
<P>
The dollar has risen 11 percent against the mark over the past
year.
</P>
<P>
Waigel said that the dollar's strength did not mean the mark
was weak, instead, it was profiting from the strong U.S. economy
and differing interest rates in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Germany has been plagued by a series of bad economic
news, including a drop in industrial orders in December last year
and record high post-war unemployment of 12.2 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said they did not believe the G-7 meeting on
Saturday would halt further rise of the dollars against the mark,
according to local media reports.

CAIRO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Egypt released 536 repentant
Islamic militants today on the eve of the Islamic holiday of Eid

</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Interior Hassan el-Alfy issued a decision,

terrorist elements and dialogue with the jailed members, he was
quoted as saying by the Egyptian MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
The militants were rounded up in a clamp-down on the extremists
who have been fighting for a strict Islamic rule in Egypt since
1992. More than 1,000 people have died in the violence, most of

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Computer Grants to Public Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Clinton
announced Saturday the first "technology literacy" grants to
provide needy public schools with computers and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
"That's how we must prepare our children for the 21st century
-- with the full promise of the Information Age at their
fingertips," Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
The new grants are expected to fund programs in each of the 50
states by the end of 1997, help disadvantaged schools to buy
classroom computers, provide Internet access and train teachers to
use it. Illinois, Mississippi and New Mexico will share the first
installment of a total of $14.3 million federal funds.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the Education Department, only one in
five teachers in American public schools used advanced
telecommunications, and only 13 percent of public schools required
teacher training in the technology.
</P>
<P>
Schools with the highest concentration of poverty and those in
the most rural areas are also lagging far behind in computer
access, the survey found.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Bids to Attract More Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Tourism
Mamdouh el-Beltagui said today that the ministry is launching
promotion campaigns to attract more tourists to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He told the Egyptian MENA news agency that integrated plans
have been laid down to face up to the expected tourist leap in
cooperation with the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Some 4 million tourists visited Egypt in 1996, a 24.3 percent
rise over the previous year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Beltagui said that 4.2 million tourists are expected to visit
Egypt this year while the hotel occupancy will increase by 12
percent to reach 29 million tourist nights.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, a total of 236 tourist projects were approved for
establishment with investments topping 14 billion Egyptian pounds
(4.1 billion U.S. dollars), which will add 116,000 new rooms over
the coming five years, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted there was a notable drop in the number of
African tourists from Nigeria by 16 percent, from Somalia by 25
percent and from Sudan by 41 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism became Egypt's second largest foreign currency earner
in 1996 when the tourism revenues reached 3009.1 million
U.S. dollars, up by 710 million against 1995.

<HEADLINE> Personal Computer Sales Up in Europe Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Sales of personal computer
were up 7.1 percent in Western Europe in 1996 to a total of 15.9
million units, the twice-weekly European Report reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the consultancy firm International Data Corp(IDC),
quoted by European Report, the growth was a result of heavier
buying by large and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The IDC said these higher sales to the business sector helped
offset the poor PC sales among the general public.
</P>
<P>
Germany, Europe's leading market, suffered at the end of the
year, owing to the weakness of its economy.
</P>
<P>
Sales of personal computers were down four percent in the final
quarter, but for 1996 as a whole, the German market expanded by
2.6 percent, with 3.9 million computers sold.
</P>
<P>
Britain and France remained at the second and the third place,
with 3.17 million and 2.38 million PCs sold respectively, a 9.1
percent and 10.9 percent growth compared with 1995.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Penalties for Offenders of Labor Laws in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- There were some 4,400
convicted cases in 1996 relating to employers breaching labor
laws, according to figures released today by the Hong Kong Labor
Department.
</P>
<P>
And the convictions resulted in a total fine of 10 million HK
dollars (1.3 million US dollars), up 21 percent over the previous
year, Acting Senior Labor Officer, Ms Tonia Leung, said.
</P>
<P>
She assured that her department would continue to protect
employees' rights and benefits by prosecuting employers who did
not abide by the labor laws.
</P>
<P>
"Employers should take the statutory provisions
seriously. Otherwise, they will face prosecutions and have to pay
heavy penalties for their malpractice," she said.
</P>
<P>
Among the convicted cases, nearly 80 percent were relating to
the violation of the Employment Ordinance (EO) and its subsidiary
regulations.
</P>
<P>
And the largest share of offenses involved the failure to
comply with provisions on statutory holidays and restrictions
imposed on working hours of women and young employees in
industrial employment.
</P>
<P>
A record high penalty of approximately 500,000 HK dollars
(64,100 US dollars) was imposed on a company in 1996 for not
paying wages to imported workers within the prescribed statutory
time limits and not granting a statutory holiday as provided
under the EO.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, 874 cases, or close to 20 percent, were
convicted under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance (ECO). The
total fines amounted to 2.8 million HK dollars (359,000 US
dollars), representing an increase of 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ms Leung reminded employers that the maximum fines for offenses
under both the EO and ECO were substantially revised in 1995 and
1996 respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Employers should refrain from contravening provisions of these
 ordinances, or they are liable to very heavy penalties," she
warned.

ZHUHAI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 450,000 trips were
made by compatriots from Taiwan to the Zhuhai Special Economic

</P>
<P>
This made Zhuhai City the second-largest port of entry on the

Manuel Bulhosa, a Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Mozambican Minister of Natural

The Matola refinary was nationalized in l976, one year after
the Mozambique's independence.

Last November, Bulhosa arrived in Maputo to ask the
Mozambican government to return the factory to him. However,
the government refused to meet him.
</P>

Negotications are now being held between the Mozambican
government and Asian investors on the restoration of production
in the refinary. enditem

HONG KONG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Police has began an inquiry
into how a float in a Lunar New Year parade careered into a crowd
at Tsim Sha Tsui, killing one person and injuring 31 others,
according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Police believed that the driver of the float may have been
overcome by carbon monoxide fumes.
</P>
<P>
"We investigated by checking his blood and found his carbon
monoxide levels were high, causing him to fall asleep at the wheel
and lose control," said a Queen Elizabeth Hospital spokesman.
</P>
<P>
While details of a preliminary police report are being kept
secret, officers confirmed that it was possible that the float's
exhaust pipe may have been blocked by decorations.
</P>
<P>
However, "at this stage, we are only at the very beginning of
investigations and are not in a good position to draw any
conclusions about what or why the accident happened," said a
senior inspector of Kowloon West Traffic Accident Investigation
Division.
</P>
<P>
The float, sponsored by the Better Hong Kong Foundation, veered
off the road and crashed into the crowds watching the annual
parade, at 2:45 pm local time on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A British tourist, 45-year-old Brenda Stevens, was pronounced
dead on arrival at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Seven people were
admitted to the hospital while the remaining 24 injured were
discharged after treatment.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa had on Friday night sent
condolences to the family of the dead and hoped the injured would
recover soon.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Endeavors to Improve Use of Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- China will readjust its plans
for the utilization of foreign investment in due time, in a bid to
improve the use of foreign investment as situations change,
according to a high-ranking foreign trade official here today.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiuhong, director of the Foreign Investment Department of
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC),
said necessary readjustments will be made to a document
promulgated by the central government in June 1995 on guiding the
direction of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
According to that document, China encourages foreign funds to
be invested in infrastructure, basic and pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
Measures will be taken to encourage the involvement of more
foreign investment in projects in the country's central and
western regions.
</P>
<P>
Another effort to be made in this regard is the acceleration of
the enacting of relevant laws so as to provide a better
environment for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Such laws now in the making include the "Enterprise Merger
Law", "Anti-Monopoly Law" and "Acquisition Law", Ma said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the acceleration of the use of foreign
investment since 1992 China has ranked first among developed
countries and second in the world only after the United States in
the use of direct foreign investment for four consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996 the country had utilized a total of 177.2
billion US dollars of foreign investment. The number of
enterprises involving overseas funding amounted to 140,000 in that
year, with 17 million employees.
</P>
<P>
Of the world's 500 leading multinational corporations, 200 have
a presence in China.
</P>
<P>
Last year the combined export value of foreign-funded
enterprises reached 61.51 billion US dollars, accounting for 40.72
percent of the country's export total.
</P>
<P>
The number of large foreign-financed projects is also on the
rise.
</P>
<P>
Between January and November 1996 MOFTEC approved 79 projects
each exceeding 30 million US dollars in foreign investment. The
contract value of these projects topped six billion US dollars,
accounting for 9.3 percent of the country's total.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Begin Voters' Registration on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will on Monday start
registering voters as the west African country prepares for the
forthcoming local government election on a party basis.
</P>
<P>
According to the guideline released by National Electoral
Commission of Nigeria (NECON) on Saturday, all citizens above the
age of 18 shall be registered by February 19.
</P>
<P>
The local government election, intitially set for the last
quarter of 1996 by the three-year Program of Transition to Civil
Rule announced by the military government in October 1995, was
postponed to the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for the postponement, according to General
Sani Abacha who came to power in a coup in November 1993, some
people were plotting to blast the polling stations and kill
voters in a bid to block the poll.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's official newspaper, the New Nigerians, carried a
notice signed by NECON's Chairman Chief Sumner Dagogo-Jack,
urging all eligible citizens to register and vote sincerely.
</P>
<P>
"The public officials whom you elect consider issues that
directly impact the quality of your life," it said.
</P>
<P>
Other major events set for 1997 in the original transition
program include the inauguration of newly-elected local
government councils and the election of state governors and
assemblies.
</P>
<P>
Abacha's military government promised to hand over power to an
elected civilian government on October 1, 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Province, China's most
populous province with over 100 million people, collected more
than 14.1 billion yuan (about 1.7 billion US dollars) in local
taxes in 1996, an over-30-percent increase compared to the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth rate was more than 10 percentage points
higher than the national average, according to an official of the
local tax bureau.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the significant growth mainly to
greater efforts to collect taxes and curb tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
He added that a provincial taxation check last year covered
139,000 taxpayers, netting 216 million yuan in what would
otherwise have been tax losses.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has
discounted military intervention in the crisis in Lesotho, local
daily Sunday Tribune reported today.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Affairs spokesman Peter Swanepoel said
on Saturday "no military option is being considered" while South
Africa offered its "full support" to the Lesotho government.
</P>
<P>
Eight Lesotho policemen, who are resisting arrest over the
killing of three fellow officers in 1995, were reported to have
seized the Maseru police headquarters, rounded up several senior
officers and claimed to have dismissed them on Friday.
</P>
<P>
They said they would sack the Commissioner of the Lesotho
Police, Major General Bolutu Makoaba, when he returns from
Namibia, where he is attending a conference of Southern African
Development Community in Windhoek.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo issued a statement
from Windhoek, Namibia last night, saying the South African
government was giving the crisis urgent attention.
</P>
<P>
He said he would be in touch over the crisis with his Lesotho
counterpart, who is also attending the Windhoek conference.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Presidential Power Vacuum Finally Filled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A competition for Ecuador's
presidency triggered by a decision of the Congress Thursday to
deprive Abdala Bucaram of presidential power finally ended as the
Congress appointed Rosalia Arteaga as the nation's first woman
interim president today.
</P>
<P>
The Congress, previously named Fabian Alarcon, its leader, as
interim president, but Arteaga, 41, claimed that she was Bucaram's
legal successor.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram, who was dismissed for being mentally unfit for
governing, refused to leave his post at first but earlier today
acknowledged his lost of power in a televised address since the
military has withdrawn support for him. Bucaram came to power in
August 1996.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram's four cabinet officials including Defense Minister
General Victor Bayas and Energy Minister Alfredo Adum left him
after he was ousted.
</P>
<P>
The military still remains a potent force in the political life
of the country though it handed over power to a civilian
government in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The political crisis erupted on the second day of a 48-hour
nationwide strike called by unions to oppose harsh economic
austerity measures including a 200-percent electricity and gas
rate hike and a 60-percent rise in bus fares imposed by Bucaram
early last month.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 200,000 local Moslems
gathered at the mosque on Niujie Street here today to celebrate
the traditional festival of Lesser Bairam, or Fast-Breaking
Festival.
</P>
<P>
The celebration began in the morning with prayers for world
peace, China's reunification and national prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Deputy-Mayor Lin Wenyi and other municipal officials went to
the street, center of the largest Moslem residential area in
Beijing, to attend the celebration.
</P>
<P>
"The Nuijie Mosque has become much more vigorous in recent
years," said Yang Yuzeng, a 78-year-old resident of the
street. "For one thing, it's a lot warmer in the winter," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The government spent three million yuan (about 36,000 US
dollars) on renovating the mosque last year. The stoves which had
been used for centuries were replaced by a central heating system.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the municipal department of religious affairs said
that about 220,000 Moslems from ten ethnic groups, including the
Hui, Uygur and Kazak nationalities, and 450 foreigners from
Islamic countries attended the festival ceremonies at 65 mosques
in Beijing.

LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister John Major faces a severe
pre-election setback this week when the government's plans to
bring in mandatory jail sentences for serious crimes are expected
to be defeated in the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Defects in financial control in the British Defense Ministry
led to losses and mistakes amounting to more than 40 million
pounds (66 million U.S. dollars), according to a report by the
government's financial watchdog.
</P>
<P>
Independent on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- The British Labor Party is planning a vote of no confidence
in the government if the Conservatives lose the Wirral South
by-election, a threat that could force John Major to opt for an
early election.
</P>
<P>
The Observer:
</P>
<P>
-- Ian Lang, President of the British Board of Trade,

<HEADLINE> Israeli Project Fulfills Poor Kids' Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel is launching a
nationwide project to provide computers to disadvantaged children
to help them compete in the future job market.
</P>
<P>
The project, called "A Computer for Every Child," was
initiated by the Operation for Social Development with the
support of leading businessmen from famous companies such as
Motorola Israel, IBM Israel and Microsoft Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a period of five years, the project is to spend 50 million
U.S. dollars on providing computers to 100,000 elementary-school
children, whose families are too poor to buy a computer for them,
in the two lowest deciles of the socio-economic scale.
</P>
<P>
Having the computer skills increasingly determines whether a
young person will be employable. In the two lower socio-economic
deciles, only seven percent of homes have a computer while the
majority of rich families have it.
</P>
<P>
The recipients, which will be selected with help from local
social workers, include Russian and Ethiopian immigrants and
Arabs as well as Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Every child was required to undergo a 60-hour computer course
in his community along with a parent or an older sibling, to
ensure that the computers do not just sit around collecting
dust.
</P>
<P>
Through the project, the children would become computer
literate in order to upgrade their learning skills, improve their
self-esteem and give them a chance to compete in the job market in
the decades ahead, project organizers have said.
</P>
<P>
A month before the Israeli elections last May, then-premier
Shimon Peres warmly endorsed the idea and afterward Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu personally gave it his support. He
has attended several fund-raising events that have collected
over 1.3 million dollars in donations.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided recently to establish a public
council, headed by Prime Minister Office's director-general
Avigdor Lieberman, to run it with a group of business people.
</P>
<P>
Other companies have also shown great interest in supporting
the project. The Safra Brothers have donated 150 computers. Hod
Ami Computer Publishing Company will provide 33,000 dollars worth
of materials. And the chain stores Supersol will organize
fund-raising campaigns among customers in all its branches.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Investors Advised Not to Be Greedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today advised Malaysian investors to be wary of
their plans to invest in other countries to prevent them from
being branded as greedy.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian investors could invest their limited capital in other
countries where investment opportunities abounded if they could
not invest in the Philippines, he said while commenting on the
Philippine Supreme Court decision to stop the Philippine
government from selling Manila Hotel, a national heritage, to
Malaysia's Renong Limited, which won a bid to acquire the hotel in
1995.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want others to say we are very greedy to the extent
of wanting to grab all the investments for ourselves," he told
reporters at the Festival of Fast-breaking "open house" in his
official residence here.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the decision would strain bilateral ties and
Malaysia's investments in the Philippines, Mahathir said: "I feel
Malaysian investors will be more careful and will not invest too
much in the Philippines."
</P>
<P>
Malaysian investors were actually asked to invest in the
Philippines to help in revitalizing the country's economy and "now
the country's economy has recovered, whether it is because of
Malaysia or not, we don't know," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
"But I feel due to the recovery, certainly there will be a
slight shift in Philippine view towards foreign investment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Malaysian investors were accused of being greedy
due to their overzealousness in wooing and scouting for investment
opportunities, Mahathir said Malaysia's investments involved a
two-way traffic.
</P>
<P>
"We are not investing merely to reap profits. We invest in
infrastructure projects required by other countries and before, we
open up opportunities to foreigners to invest in Malaysia to seek
profits jointly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said both investors and countries receiving
investments would benefit in any investment.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's investments in the Philippines are not only to make
profits but also in the interests of that country, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the court decision, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon who was reported to have regarded it as embarrassing to the
Philippine government, said Saturday that it was difficult for the
Philippine government to explain the court's decision to the
Malaysian government.
</P>
<P>
However, Siazon said he would meet Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi during the ASEAN-European Union Foreign
Ministers meeting in Singapore next week in a bid to defuse
tension following the court ruling.

<HEADLINE> British Company Explores Gold in Northeastern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Branch Energy Uganda Limited,
a British company, is exploring gold at Kabong in Uganda's
northeastern district of Kotido, though fruit has not been borne
so far.
</P>
<P>
"We excavate five tons of soil each time we drill. But after
analyzing the samples, we only get gold samples equal to less
than 10 grams," said Sanmaria Noithe, a South African geophysicist.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said the company started the exploration project
on March 12, 1995, and has invested over four million U.S.
Dollars on the project. But it has not started benefiting.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said full exploration will take at least 10
years.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government had claimed that gold deposits in the
country's northeastern area of Karamoja were second to
Australia's, adding that the deposits in the area
would be mined for 50 years with an annual yield of three tons.
</P>
<P>
Gold deposits were also found in Kyakiddu, about 160 km west
of capital Kampala where a U.S. mining company has decided to
invest 8 million U.S. Dollars in exploration.
</P>
<P>
Study showed that each ton of soil in Kyakiddu mines can
produce 500 grams of gold and the production can last at least
eight years.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Neighbors to Ill-willed Outsiders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today called on neighboring countries to prevent certain
outsiders from creating chaos in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"The enemies of the Islamic revolution had endeavored to rouse
a fear of Islamic Iran in the Persian Gulf so that they could sell
them (countries in the region) arms and have an excuse for their
military presence in the Persian Gulf," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader made the statement to thousands of
worshipers for the fast breaking ceremony at Imam Khomeini
Mausolea.
</P>
<P>
"If this region should become insecure, the very same
countries that have prepared the conditions for that insecurity
will bear the brunt of their action, for having offered their soil
to them (foreign troops)," he was quoted by the official news
agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not point his finger to specific foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani warned of
a great danger from "illegitimate presence of the United States
in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that it is a matter of great significance
to the Iranian nation that the continued conspiracies of the
enemies, particularly that of the United States of America,
has failed to stop the growth, development, and progress of
the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the statements Khamenei and
Rafsanjani are clearly referring to some western reports that
the United States is making special program to wage military
strike against 19 Iranian targets, including terrorist training
camps and nuclear reactors.

<HEADLINE> Film on Opium Wars Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The "Opium Wars", a new film,
costing 80 million yuan (9.3 million US dollars), has been
completed.
</P>
<P>
The two Opium Wars were launched by Britain against China from
1840 to 1842 and resulted in the signing of three unequal
treaties, under which China was forced to cede its territory of
Hong Kong to Britain. China will resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The film was directed by famous director Xie Jin. Well-known
actors and actresses on the mainland and from Taiwan and Britain
have played roles in the film, which employed more than 3,000 foreign
actors and actresses.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 outdoor scenes were built and 200,000 sets of costumes
were made for the film.
</P>
<P>
The sample and copy of the film, which has used the most
advanced recording, illumination and shooting equipment, will be
produced with advanced techniques in Japan.
</P>
<P>
It was an experiment for the film circle to collect money from
non-governmental organizations, said Zhang Wei, vice-chairman of
the board of directors of the Huitong City Co-operative Bank,
which funded the high-budget film.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the film, which was still in production
then, had received many orders from Hong Kong, Taiwan, the
Republic of Korea, Japan and countries in southeast Asia, Europe
and America.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Lawmakers Discuss Unilateral Lebanon Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A group of Israeli coalition
and opposition lawmakers have discussed a plan for unilateral
withdrawal from south Lebanon, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting held Saturday night at the home of Likud
lawmaker Gideon Ezra included Likud faction leader Michael Eitan,
Third Way's Yehuda Harel, Shas' Yitzhak Cohen and the opposition
Labor's Yossi Beilin, the radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Several former Israeli senior security heads also took part in
the discussion, including ex-General Security Service (GSS) head
Yaacov Perry, ex-GSS deputy head Yossi Ginossar, former
Coordinator of the Territories and Lebanon Liaison Unit commander
Danny Rothschild.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in the wake of the worst air disaster last
week in which two military helicopters transporting soldiers in
south Lebanon collided and killed all 73 on board.
</P>
<P>
This tragedy led to a week of nationwide mourning, and has
sparked a debate over whether Israel should withdraw from its
self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It remained unclear what conclusion the meeting had reached or
if the participants were even in agreement, but they planned to
take up the issue with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu, in a Friday interview, rejected such a move,
saying it would bring Hezbollah fighters closer to Israel's
northern border. He said that Israel must first stabilize its
northern border before considering withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"This border was at first grabbed by Palestinian terrorists
and now it has been seized by Hezbollah terrorists who rely on
Syria and Iran," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not easy to change this equation without at least
changing the equation with Syria," he added, alluding to the
frozen Israel-Syrian peace talks and Damascus' role as a power
broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Army Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin Shahak said Israel
would not leave south Lebanon, saying "there is a price to
pay for security." His statements were welcomed by Mayors of
towns and villages in the north who demanded the government
not to consider unilateral withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, meanwhile, also made it clear that Israel would
not withdraw from south Lebanon unless arrangements are reached
that would guarantee the safety and security of northern
communities.

WELLINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Queen of Britain
extended today her sympathy with the victims of the killing in New
Zealand's central North Island Saturday, which claimed six lives.
</P>
<P>
In a message to NZ Governor General Sir Michael Hardie Boys,
the Queen said she is appalled to hear the tragic loss of life.
</P>

She said she knows all New Zealanders will share the same sense
 of shock and disbelief, and her thoughts and prayers are with the
families involved.

<P>
The massacre took place in the town of Raurimu, and the gunman
was a 22-year-old Wellington man named Stephen Anderson. He gave
himself up to the police after killing six people and injuring
another five.
</P>
<P>
Stephen, flanked by three police officers, yesterday appeared
briefly in a court in Taumaruni, 50 km north of the site of the
shooting incident. He will be remanded in custody for psychiatric
assessment until Wednesday when he is to appear in the Hamilton
District Court in the city of Hamilton, about 150 km south of

WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Chicago's Steve Kerr
survived a first-round scare to win the three-point title in
Cleveland on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kerr, a failure for three years at the NBA Three-Point
Shootout, won the event by scoring the most of 22 points in the
final round against reigning champion Washington's Tim Legler who
netted 17 points.
</P>

The event was part of festivities before Sunday's NBA All-Star
Game, along with the NBA Slam Dunk competition, which was won by
rookie Kobe Braynt of the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
Eight players entered the competition featuring five rows of
five balls. As most balls were worth one point, the ball full of
colors in each rack was worth two points.
</P>
<P>
Kerr sank all five two-point balls in the final.
</P>
<P>
Toronto's Walt Williams led four first-round survivors with 18
points, but he and Charlotte's Glen Rice bowed out in round two.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Industry Stuck in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's local wheat industry
is stuck with more than 100,000 tonnes worth over 25 million US
Dollars from last season which it is failing to market as millers
now prefer cheaper Argentinian wheat, the Sunday Mail reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Grain Marketing Board (GMB) is the worst affected as it
presently holds the bulk of the crop.
</P>
<P>
GMB Chairman Kumbirai Katsande told the paper that the
parastatal had 60,000 tonnes in its stocks.
</P>
<P>
Although Katsande said the local wheat was of good quality for
millers to buy, millers were now turning to cheaper Argentinian
wheat which was landing at a price of about 250 US Dollars per
tonne while locally produced wheat was being sold for about 255
Dollars. enditem

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Fights Against Public Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's public service is
buckling under a heavy backlog of unresolved disciplinary cases
with some of them going back several years ago.
</P>
<P>
A report from the local newspaper the Sunday Mail said today
that this has prompted fears among labor experts that discipline
in the civil service could crumble to unacceptable levels.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for the Public Service Commission Ngoni Masoka
confirmed that there was a huge backlog and said the highest
number of cases were in the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
The commission therefore demanded all ministries submit
monthly returns on disciplinary cases as a way of monitoring the
processing of all misconduct cases.
</P>
<P>
Labor experts said ineffective disciplinary system in the
civil service failed to serve as a deterrent, hence a high number
of cases ranging from fraud and abuse of government property to
the involvement of teachers in affairs with school children.
</P>
<P>
Many of the offenders remained at large because it took years
to resolve their cases.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Aids Drug Pearl Omega Banned in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
ordered the immediate withdrawal of the controversial anti-Aids
drug Pearl Omega from the Kenyan market, the Sunday Nation
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Following the government order, Arthur Obel, the inventor of the
drug, announced his resignation as the government's chief
scientist, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Inspector of Drug, C.K. Juma, and Police "Flying
Squad" Chief Superintendent, Mate Muranga, yesterday morning
served the inventor of the drug with a notice to that effect.
</P>
<P>
Obel expressed shock at the government order, but said that he
would not contest the ban decision.
</P>
<P>
Pearl Omega has been at the center of controversy for some
time in the east African country with medical authorities
accusing Obel of failing to disclose important information on the
drug.
</P>
<P>
Obel claimed that some 40,000 Kenyans and about 27,000
foreigners have taken the drug since he started administering it
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The pharmacologist announced his invention early last year and
said recently that the drug was set to be launched this
month as a plant-based anti-Aids drug.

<HEADLINE> Indian Cloth Poses Great threat to Bangladeshi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi textiles,
particularly the traditional saree industry, have been facing a
great threat as most of the local markets are flooded with
smuggled Indian sarees, according to industrial operators.
</P>
<P>
Most of the textile mills now find it difficult to operate on a
viable basis due to massive influx of the Indian cloth. "Unless
the trend is checked, the country would soon be turned into a
dumping ground of Indian cloth," said Mohammad Bhuiyan, a leading
garment businessmen.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that sarees worth about 15 billion taka (about
375 million US dollars) are being smuggled into Bangladesh every
year from India.
</P>
<P>
Easy availability of Indian sarees has become a hindrance to
the sales of local products now facing tough competition from the
smuggled cloth being sold at a lower prices.
</P>
<P>
Trading in smuggled Indian sarees, according to sources, is now
common in markets of almost of all the border districts of
Bangladesh. Even in the capital Dhaka, the banned items are being
sold openly almost in every market.
</P>
<P>
Local producers has urged the government to lower duty
structure on raw materials and take stern measures to stop
marketing of smuggled cloth. Otherwise they said that the
industry, once famous worldwide, would soon meet a doomsday
scenario.

<HEADLINE> Low Tobacco Yield Predicted in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 9 (Xinhua) -- With only two months to go before
the opening of the tobacco auction floors, the Zimbabwe Tobacco
Association (ZTA) has predicted a low yield due to the rains that
have affected the crop, the Sunday Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
ZTA Vice-President Kobus Joubert, however, told the paper this
would not affect the quality of the crop.
</P>
<P>
He described the current tobacco season as a ''sorry season''
as it was expected to produce an estimated crop of about 235
million kilograms and would earn the country more than 700
million US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The floors open on April 22 and indications were that demand was
high for the country's high quality tobacco.
</P>
<P>
Although there were no certain figures for this year's crop, the
ZTA was hoping it would fetch the same prices as last year and also
sell as much as the 201 million kilograms sold on the floors.

<HEADLINE> India Eases Curbs on Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Commerce Ministry
on Saturday allowed free imports of 69 more items figuring in the
special import licence (SIL) list, the Economic Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 92 items have been taken off the restricted
list and shifted to the SIL list. A notification to this effect
will be issued on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Disclosing this, Commerce Minister B.B. Ramaiah said that the
changes were in tune with the current liberalization process.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was committed to phase out quantitative
restrictions on imports in accordance with the commitment made
with the world trade organization.
</P>
<P>
Terming the relaxation as a normal and gradual process, the
minister said that India still had more than 3,000 items under the
restricted list of imports while another 900 items were in the
transferable SIL list.
</P>
<P>
The present exercise is aimed at moving a number of items which
are currently in the SIL list to open general licence (OGL) list,
and making certain restricted items permissible for import under
SIL, he added.
</P>
<P>
Among the items that have been shifted from the restricted to
the SIL list include aluminium beverage cans, car air conditioners
and other types of air conditioners, toilet deodorants, commercial
dish washers, some kinds of toys, coin-operated game machine, etc.
</P>
<P>
The items that have been transferred from SIL to the freely
importable list include escalators, instant print cameras, auto
bank note dispenser, air purifiers and cleaners, and so on.

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Moves Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- After a brief spell of
cessation in price rise, India's annual rate of inflation moved up
again to touch 7.66 percent for the week ended January 25, the
Press Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation (provisional-over-final) went up by 0.18
percentage points compared to 7.48 percent during the previous
week even as the wholesale prices index (WPI) for "all
commodities" declined marginally to 320.3 as against 320.4 for
the week before.
</P>
<P>
Compared to this, the annual inflation during the corresponding
week in 1996 was 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is the 96th week in succession that inflation has
maintained single digit levels. Inflation had touched single
digits in March 1996.

<HEADLINE> East China city Improves Living Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Nanchang, capital
of east China's Jiangxi Province, find that they are living in a
greener, cleaner, and more charming environment, while celebrating
the traditional Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
This is attributed by local people to the city government's
efforts at improving urban residential environment in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The city invested more than 20 million yuan in beautifying the
four lakes last year, today's "People's Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The lakes, located at the city proper of Nanchang, in four
different directions, had attracted many tourists with its elegant
environment. Water of the lakes, however, became muddy and dark
due to poor drainage systems and a thick layer of silt.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Nanchang has built a batch of modern
garbage transfer stations, involving a total investment of more
than ten million yuan, to collect garbages bagged by local
residents.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,200 dustbins were added to the city last year, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts were also made to build power stations, water plants,
and housing for teachers and other residents. What's more, 91 new
buses were put into service in urban areas last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, Nanchang planted a total of 110,000
trees and grew 120,000 square meters of lawns in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project in Full Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Work on the gigantic Three
Gorges Project, on the middle reaches of the Yangtze river, is
going smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that an accumulative 19.2 billion yuan has been
invested in the project since construction began in 1993, or more
than ten million yuan per day.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, the construction site has witnessed
the removal of 178 million cubic meters of earth and stone,
averaging 120,000 cubic meters per day.
</P>
<P>
If a road with a width of one meter is paved with the earth and
stone, it will be 170,000 kilometers long, more than four times
around the earth at the equator.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project is expected to build a 175-m-high dam
across the Yangtze, with the aim to use the river's abundant water
resources to generate electricity and reduce the possible dangers
from floods.
</P>
<P>
The project is scheduled to be completed in the year 2009 and
cost at least 90 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Ruling, Opposition Party Chiefs in Nepal Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Top leaders of Nepal's main
ruling and opposition parties have held their first formal meeting
in six years to discuss ways to ensure political stability in the
country, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting on Saturday, President of the main ruling
Nepali Congress (NC) party Girija Prasad Koirala and his
counterpart of the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) Man Mohan Adhikari stressed the
need for cooperation between their parties for political
stability, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the two former prime ministers, initiated
by the NC party, would preceded a series of meetings the NC
planned to hold with leaders of other parties.
</P>
<P>
The NC and the CPN-UML, currently hold 88 and 90 seats in the
205-seat lower house respectively, are the two biggest parties in
the country. The two parties had jointly launched the 1990 popular
democratic movement which led to the reinstatement of the
multi-party parliamentary system in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the NC party, which leads a three-party coalition
government formed in 1995, will also meet with leaders of other
political parties in the country, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of these meetings is to minimize the conflicts
existing between the political parties and work together to bring
political stability in the country, a NC party leader said.

COLOMBO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Tamil rebels
Saturday for the first time launched an artillery attack on the
Vavuniya Town in Northern Province, killing two police constables
and injuring 4 others, according to reports from the north today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the attack which was launched around 1:30
on Saturday was directed towards the police Barracks close to the
Air Force units near the Vavuniya-Kandy Road.
</P>
<P>
The government troops immediately responded with an attack by
helicopters and air force bombers.
</P>
<P>
The reports pointed out that the attack was seen as an attempt
to put pressure on the government troops who have concluded the
first phase of their fresh offensive operation after advancing
22kms into the rebel territory and are poised for the next phase
of the operation.
</P>
<P>
The operation launched last Tuesday is aimed at clearing the
Vavuniya-Paranthan-Jaffna highway and gaining control over it so
as to prevent supplies reaching the rebels, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting for a separate homeland for
the minority Tamils in the north and east of the country since
1983.

<HEADLINE> Italian Judge Calls for Uniform Code for Drug Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 8 (Xinhua) -- An Italian prosecutor said today
that Europe needs a uniform criminal code for an effective fight
against international drug trafficking and Mafia activities.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a round-table on drugs, Gian Carlo Caselli, chief
prosecutor of the Sicilian capital of Palermo, also called for
more public awareness of the disastrous results caused by drugs.
</P>
<P>
Caselli, one of Italy's leading anti-Mafia prosecutors, warned
that Italian judges pursuing Cosa Nostra (Sicilian Mafia) will be
unable to press extradition orders or requests for investigations
abroad without a continentally uniform code.
</P>
<P>
Italian laws allow the prosecution to extradite suspects fled
abroad under the "Mafia association" charge, which is not legally
warranted in other European countries.
</P>
<P>
Law and order is not the only way to combat drugs, Caselli
said, indicating that the justice should encourage the public
awareness of the drugs' damage to society, including a constant
drain of resources and the destruction of thousands of young
people.
</P>
<P>
The judge warned of an increasingly difficult combat against
drugs as international drug dealers are taking new moves to expand
their market.
</P>
<P>
One example is the Columbian cocaine producers' introduction of
a "socially acceptable heroin", which can be sniffed or ingested
rather than injected and therefore is finding a growing market.
</P>
<P>
Caselli noted that closer police cooperation among European
countries and more exchange of information are needed to curb the
surging drug trafficking, as large quantities of drugs are being
found in Russia, Romania, Bulgaria and other ex-Soviet republics
on the Asian border.

<HEADLINE> Group of Rio Expresses Concern Over Ecuadorean Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Rio
expressed today its concern over the Ecuadorean crisis, calling
for a prompt solution to the confusing political situation in the
wake of the dismissal of President Abdala Bucaram.
</P>
<P>
The group's secretariat said in a communique that it is
maintaining constant contacts with the representatives of its
member countries "to exchange ideas about the crisis."
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadorean situation remained uncertain today as three
politicians -- President Bucaram, Vice President Rosalia Arteaga,
and congressional leader Fabian Alarcon -- continue claiming the
presidency and Defense Minister Victor Bayas resigned.
</P>
<P>
The political crisis was triggered by the ouster of Bucaram by
Congress on Thursday on grounds of mental incompetence.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the secretariat said that other members of
the 13-nation group hope a solution to the problem will be found
soon "in the context of respect to the state of law."
</P>
<P>
The group convened an emergency meeting on Friday at the
request of Paraguayan Foreign Minister Ruben Melgarejo Lanzoni.
</P>
<P>
The urgent meeting was also requested by the removed government
of Abdala Bucaram, who demanded the presence in Quito of a
delegation to mediate. Ecuador is a member of the Rio Group.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the group said nothing has been decided yet about
the matter, but that the development of the events are being
followed closely.

<HEADLINE> Rome 2004 Chief Defends Games Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 8 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of criticism from
opponents of Rome's bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games, the head
of the committee spearheading the Italian capital's effort
defended the proposal on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In response to criticism from the "No Committee", committee
director Raffaele Ranucci said at a press conference that "the
information we have provided in our report is true, and we want to
assure our supporters that they needn't worry."
</P>
<P>
"Our work was not rushed, it took a year and a half and
involved professionals from the sports world and the city," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Opponents said Rome's proposal was based on "lies and
approximations" and called for a meeting with International
Olympic Committee chairman Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
Responding to criticism that only public funds would be used to
prepare for the Games, Ranucci explained that private money had
been used in recent Olympics and state funds would be divided
among sports structure and metro construction.
</P>
<P>
In the field of transportation, Ranucci said an enlargement of
the highway encircling Rome would help the Games from impacting
the city's historic center and its monuments.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the issue of environment and urban planning, Ivan
Novelli, deputy director of Rome 2004, said "I would like those
who oppose this proposal to ask the residents of Tor Vergata if in
2005 they won't be happy to have a metro stop."
</P>
<P>
Rome would be able to handle the refuse created by the Games,
Novelli said.
</P>
<P>
The IOC panel evaluating the 11 candidate cities is expected to
annouce five finalists in March and select a winner in September.

<HEADLINE> Labor Pledges Switch of Welfare Cash to Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- British Opposition Party leader
Tony Blair today pledged a significant boost to the education
budget if he wins the forthcoming general election.
</P>
<P>
Blair told Labor's local government conference in Nottingham
his pledge would be "number one" in a list of 10 election
manifesto promises which would be his "covenant with the people".
</P>
<P>
The Labor leader said the 48 billion Pounds spent on education
would rise by more than inflation during the lifetime of the next
parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, he refused to put a figure on the rise and insisted
the money would be found by cutting the 144 billion pounds welfare
budget.
</P>
<P>
The Labor leader's promise was aimed partly at reassuring the
party's councillors that Labor would not merely continue Tory
policies following its decision to stick to the present
government's overall spending ceiling for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
"New Labor will make a difference," Blair stressed. His pledge
follows criticism from some Labor councillors over plans to stop
them abolishing Britain's remaining 161 grammar schools, which
were announced last week by shadow education secretary David
Blunkett.
</P>
<P>
Roy Hattersley, the party's former deputy leader, attacked
Blunkett, saying "the argument in favor of retaining grammar
schools is so intellectually inadequate that it damages the
reputation of those who advance it."
</P>
<P>
Labor's internal dispute on the grammar schools also surfaced
when 50 demonstrators greeted delegates arriving at the
conference.
