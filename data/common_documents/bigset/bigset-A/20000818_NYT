<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Al Gore sat down at his laptop to write _ no
pressure, but everyone said it had better be the speech of his life
_ he began by raiding some of his favorite speeches past, culling
some material that had been written for him and some of his own
stuff, like the eulogy he wrote for his father's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   He threw in everything he might even conceivably want to mention
_ 12,000 words in all, then let his speechwriters edit and polish,
tinker and tweak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in the speech reflects what he wanted in the
speech, if you know what I mean,'' said his top consultant, Carter
Eskew, one of three aides who helped edit Gore's acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   The top-down approach is not only the perfect reflection of the
way Gore operates, but the mirror image of the way his Republican
opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, worked on his recent acceptance
speech. Bush, as is far more typical of presidential nominees, left
the writing to the professionals and then fiddled with the text,
asking for certain changes and adding some personal touches.
</P>
<P>
   That Gore would make the highly unusual decision to write his
own words surprised no one who knows him well. After all, he wrote
his own book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' and before running for
office was a reporter for The Tennessean in Nashville, where his
former editors fondly recall having to tear copy out of his hands
as he kept right on reporting past deadline, never satisfied that
he had all the information.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday afternoon, he was still asking his staff for
documents he might want to draw from.
</P>
<P>
   For such an important speech, Bush put his writers through 17
drafts.
</P>
<P>
   But a few hours before Gore was to deliver his address, an aide,
Laura Quinn, joked, ``It's in draft 625'' _ and not necessarily in
final form even then.
</P>
<P>
   Of this much, though, Quinn was positive: ``It won't be short,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore's first draft ran 12,000 words, he never intended to
deliver a speech of that length, Eskew said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process was to gather a lot more material than he knew he
could use,'' Eskew said. ``He enjoys the editing process, and
that's how he likes to work. That helps him decide what's
essential.''
</P>
<P>
   What was essential? He wanted to explain why he is running and
what he has learned from listening to voters, and told several
stories of people he had met in the last year, like a parent who
lost a child at the school massacre in Columbine, Colo., and
whispered in his ear, ``Promise me that these children will not
have died in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to introduce himself with some good biographical
stories, telling about how his father, Sen. Albert Gore, grew up
poor in Possum Hollow, Tenn., and after living through the
Depression ``entered public service to fight for the people, not
the powerful.'' And how his mother, Pauline LaFon Gore, put herself
through law school waiting tables in an all-night coffee shop. Yet
he also wanted to get into policy details that he thought Americans
ought to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does love to talk about policy and specifics,'' said Gore's
oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, ``and he has the attitude
that if people don't like that they should still know that's what
they're getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also felt strongly that he wanted to use the speech to look
to the future. ``He didn't just want to talk about the successes of
the administration,'' Schiff said. ``He thinks people are not as
interested in hearing what he did as vice president as they are in
hearing what he would do'' if elected.
</P>
<P>
   After taking his initial, 12,000-word crack at the speech, he
handed a computer disk with that first draft on it to a consultant,
Robert Shrum, and a speechwriter, Eli Attie, who whittled it to
7,500 words.
</P>
<P>
   Gore took that version with him on his recent vacation in North
Carolina. He kept putting various chunks that his aides had taken
out back in _ again in contrast to Bush's impulse to pare down his
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to include a foreign policy section,'' for example,
Eskew said. ``Some of us felt that might be a place to cut, but he
said it's an important part of the job and I want to talk about it
and explain how the threats facing our country have changed over
the last 20 years. That's very much him.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked, recently, whether he regretted anything he had
written in ``Earth in the Balance,'' a book that proposed phasing
out the internal combustion engine, and has been widely parodied,
he said he still regretted some sections that were edited out.
</P>
<P>
   As a senator, he not only wrote his own op-ed pieces, but in the
early 1980s once turned up at the office of The New York Times and
announced, ``I pulled an all-nighter on this one,'' and hung over
an editor's shoulder as his piece on arms control was being edited.
</P>
<P>
   Where he did make cuts in his acceptance speech, though, was in
streamlining wording that speechwriters had inserted that did not
feel comfortable for him. His aides, for example, had come up with
the line, ``We're for the people; they're for the powerful.'' His
team wanted him to repeat the line about a half-dozen times
throughout the address.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not feel right to him, he told his team. Eskew
said, ``He said, `Well, that's true, but I only need to say it
once.' Ms. Schiff said he also took out a number of anecdotes that
he has been using on the campaign trail. ``He scrapped that,'' she
said. ``He wanted it to be fresh.''

<P>
   In the final version, he quoted his high school headmaster:
``Sometimes, you have to be willing to spend your popularity in
order to pick the hard right over the easy wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He was self-deprecating, as he often is in private, saying, ``If
you entrust me with the presidency, I know I won't always be the
most exciting politician.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked in one of the fun facts he loves, mentioning that
``there is more computer power in a Palm Pilot than in the
spaceship that took Neil Armstrong to the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   And, voicing his personal reaction to the discussion of honor
that he heard at the Republican convention, he talked about his own
definition of honor: ``Getting cigarettes out of the hands of kids
before they get hooked is a family value . . . A new prescription
drug benefit under Medicare for all our seniors, that's a family
value.'' His second daughter, Kristin, who works as a comedy
writer, contributed a joke at the last minute, not a side-splitter
but a play on words on why he opposes a Republican-size tax cut:
``You would get 62 cents in change, but that's not the change I'm
seeking in America.''
</P>
<P>
   It was his youngest daughter, Sarah, who will be a senior at
Harvard in the fall, who of all his family worked most closely with
him on the speech, and spent much of the family vacation helping
him edit and rewrite.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did practice his speech the last couple of days before he
was to deliver it, trying parts of it out on his family, members of
his staff and that of his wife, Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday afternoon, Eskew said the speech _ now down to
5,700 words, about 1,800 more than Bush's _ was finally more or
less finished, except for ``a few little word things.''
</P>
<P>
   Eskew insisted that Gore did not feel pressured by expectations
and the perception among some pundits that he had to hit a homerun
to stay in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a speech he's been waiting to give for a long time.''

 &HT;    GORE VOWS TO FIGHT FOR 'EVERYDAY HEROES'
 &HT;    950&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore promised to support the
``quiet, everyday heroism of hard-working Americans'' as he
accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that focused on the possibilities of the future
rather than the accomplishments of the Clinton administration, Gore
declared himself ``my own man'' as he re-introduced himself to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than try to match the charm of his Republican rival,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the notoriously formal Gore used his
acceptance speech to draw distinctions on issues he believes will
help him overcome Bush's steady lead in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my own imperfections,'' he said. ``I know that
sometimes people say I'm too serious, that I talk too much
substance and policy. Maybe I've done that tonight. But the
presidency is more than a popularity contest. It's a day-to-day
fight for people.''
</P>
<P>
   And with news of a new investigation of President Clinton
casting yet another shadow on his candidacy, Gore added, ``If you
entrust me with the presidency, I know that I won't always be the
most exciting politician. But I pledge to you tonight: I will work
for you every day and I will never let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's new presidential standard-bearer promised to use the
federal government's record budget surplus to expand health care
coverage, improve education, shore up safety net programs and
extend tax cuts to help ``every hard-working family'' to ``open the
door to their dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged his support for affirmative action, new gun
controls, federal hate crime legislation, an increase in the
federal minimum wage, a patients bill of rights, funding for more
police and teachers and cracking down on the marketing of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Although frequently interrupted by the pennant waving delegates
and chants of ``Go, Al, Go,'' Gore drew the most sustained applause
when he reiterated his support for abortion rights, a direct
counterpoint to Bush's opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let there be no doubt: I will protect and defend a woman's
right to choose,'' he said. ``The last thing this country needs is
a Supreme Court that overturns Roe v. Wade.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also recalled how he had fought ``against the powerful
interests'' over the course of his career, pushing for welfare
reform and an improved environment.
</P>
<P>
   And despite his own abuses of the campaign finance system, Gore
vowed that a reform bill will be the first one he sends to Congress
as president. ``Let others try to restore the old guard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also took direct aim at a sweeping tax cut proposal at the
heart of Bush's campaign. ``Let me say it plainly: I will not go
along with a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of
everyone else and wreck our good economy in the process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's emphasis on issues in a speech he largely crafted
himself, the convention's final day was mostly devoted to showing
the American public parts of the 52-year-old Gore's life that have
been obscured by his eight years as President Clinton's vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime friends of Gore played roles in an evening talk-show
style segment that featured anecdotes about Gore's relationship
with his father, a fiddle-playing populist senator from the hill
country of Tennessee; his decision to join the Army during the
Vietnam War; and his career in journalism before entering politics.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, an accomplished photographer, used photographs from
their three decades of marriage and his 24 years in politics to
present her husband as a family man. ``Al has always been there for
our family and he will always be there for yours,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore family photo album was shared not only with the more
than 4,368 delegates in the Staples Center, the site of the
convention, but also with the prime-time national television
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's biography has a central part of nearly every night of the
convention since Clinton's curtain call and departure Monday night,
a reflection of the concern among Gore advisers that voters
continue to view the vice president through the lens of Clinton's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns were not diminished by the disclosure earlier
Thursday that a new grand jury has been empaneled to continue the
investigation of Clinton in connection with his extramarital affair
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Not only Democrats, but also Republicans expressed dismay over
the disclosure just hours before Gore was to accept his party's
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not appropriate for this type of announcement to be made
on the day that the vice president is going to accept the
Democratic nomination,'' said senior Bush strategist Karen Hughes.
``This election is not about the past; it's about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in his acceptance speech, paid a glowing but brief tribute
to Clinton. ``Millions of Americans will live better lives for a
long time to come because of the job that's been done to President
Clinton,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now we turn the page and write a new chapter,'' he said.
``We're entering a new time. We're electing a new president. And I
stand here tonight as my own man, and I want you to know who I
truly am.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I have strong values, the love of my family, my
faith, my love for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention delegates erupted with cheers as Gore entered the
convention hall after Tipper's introduction. Wearing the more
traditional blue suit rather than the earth tones that were
ridiculed during the presidential primaries, Gore took the unusual
route to the speaker's podium, charging down an aisle on the
convention floor past the Tennessee delegation.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Promising to champion ordinary folks and their children, Gore
said, ``Tonight, I ask for your support on the basis of the better,
fairer, more prosperous America we can build together.''
</P>
<P>
   He reminded the audience of the administration's economic
accomplishments: 22 million new jobs, the lowest inflation in a
generation, the highest home ownership ever, the lowest
unemployment in a quarter century and the biggest budget surpluses
ever.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``for all of our good times, I am not satisfied,'' he
added. ``Together, let's make sure that our prosperity enriches not
just the few, but all working families.''
</P>
<P>
   As president, Gore said he would continue the open meetings that
were a part of his presidential campaign and his 16 years in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go out to you, the people, because I want to stay
in touch with your hopes, with the quiet, every-day heroism of
hard-working Americans,'' he said. ``So this is not just an
election between my opponent and me. It's about our people, our
families, and our future _ and whether forces standing in your way
will keep you from having a better life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not dwell exclusively on economic issues, however. He
also vowed to use the presidency to ``challenge a culture'' that
has ``too much meanness, and not enough meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's 43rd convention, much more traditional than the
TV-driven GOP gathering two weeks ago, ended with a picturesque sea
of red, white and blue balloons and confetti dropped from the
Staples Center as family, friends and political joined Gore on the
podium.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut,
planned to leave Los Angeles shortly after the climactic event of
the convention to begin a four-day trip down the Mississippi River,
through Midwestern battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   Their trip follows word from the Bush campaign that the
Republican nominee and his running mate, former congressman Dick
Cheney, would like five debates this fall: three involving the
presidential candidates, two with the vice presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush initiative calls into question the three debates
scheduled by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which usually
organizes and runs the debates. The Bush campaign is seeking other
organizations to sponsor the debates.
</P>
<P>
   William Daley, the Gore campaign chairman, suggested that the
five debates sought by Bush should be in addition to the three
already scheduled by the debate commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of our campaign will be simple: to set up the
greatest number of debates in forums accessible to the greatest
number of voters, starting at the soonest possible time,'' Daley
said.

CRITICS NOTEBOOK: GORE'S LIGHTER SIDE STILL LARGELY HIDDEN FROM THE
CAMERA 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If you entrust me with the presidency, I know I won't always
be the most exciting politician,'' Al Gore said as he ended his
acceptance speech with what seemed, after months of wrestling with
the issue, a defiant acknowledgment of fact. Even in a speech
declaring himself a man of the future, he was conspicuously
uncomfortable as a media candidate. Watching his acceptance was
like watching the televised version of a stage play, the kind in
which the cameras stand back and put the television audience in the
position of distant voyeurs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore nodded as he looked out over the crowd, as if he could
connect with individuals in that vast room; that was an effective
performance in itself. Yet when he looked toward the camera, he
actually seemed to be looking into the teleprompter. And a
convincing performance once removed is not what a television
campaign needs.
</P>
<P>
   His one hour in prime time had been preceded by two days of
character witnesses, as family and friends appeared in an endless
loop of interviews on the morning shows, late shows, and everywhere
in between. More than once, Tipper Gore and Tommy Lee Jones blamed
the office of the vice presidency for Gore's much-talked-about
stiffness. He had been standing so loyally in the background, they
argued, that of course he couldn't seem as lively as he was in
private. In his speech Thursday night, when he said his mother was
from a town named Cold Corner, you could almost imagine them
protesting, ``Don't say cold! He's not cold!''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the most effective view of the human side of Gore came
from a short biographical film made for the campaign by Spike
Jonze, the director who got his start in music videos before making
the sly film ``Being John Malcovich.'' Jonze is a master of
meticulous films that create the illusion of looseness, and he used
the intimacy of hand-held cameras, and smooth editing that looked
tossed together, to re-create the Gore image.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, the vice president is seen with his family, walking
through the woods of Tennessee, making funny faces (well, not that
funny) at his grandson, and singing (off key) a jingle from one of
his father's old campaigns. ``Vote for Gore, vote for Gore, He's
wise and able, And he's just forty four.'' Tipper Gore talks about
their first date. ``Was I a little stiff?'' he asks. ``Not at
all,'' she says and they kiss for the camera. That of course was
the message, which Gore made explicit. ``I'm a lot more comfortable
with the idea of rolling up my sleeves and making the system work
than I am with campaigning,'' he said in the film.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jonze film was almost sneaked on the air at an
especially off time, 7:30 Tuesday night, as if it were being
tested. It was carried only by MSNBC and CSPAN then, but popped up
over the next 24 hours on ABC's ``Nightline'' and ``Good Morning
America,'' and on CNN. Something similar in prime time might have
gone a long way toward delivering on the promise of showing a new,
warmer Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Tipper Gore introduced her husband Thursday night with
a typically homogenized campaign film, loaded with sentiment and
family photographs. The cable news channels, along with PBS and
NBC, carried that film, while CBS, ABC and CBS replaced it with
their own fuller reports, complete with references to the Buddhist
temple fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign is not about the gestures I make in an
interview,'' Gore said in a clip in the ABC report, but of course
campaigning is largely about imagery. If not, his family wouldn't
have worked overtime to create the warm gestures for him. He needed
that long smooch with Tipper on the podium Thursday night to
suggest a warmth he will never display on his own.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, watching both conventions was like watching a less
lively, political version of ``Jurassic Park,'' with two dinosaurs
colliding. The networks _ the dinosaurs of the television world
compared to cable news _ are cowering and cutting back coverage
while wondering how to deal with the conventions, those dinosaurs
of the political world. Even Clinton advisers like Harold Ickes,
interviewed on CNN, and Leon Panetta, on MSNBC, said the convention
should be cut back to two days. And we know what happened to all
those dinosaurs.

GORE ASKS VOTERS TO PLACE NATION'S FUTURE IN HIS HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLES POPE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Seizing the moment that could make or break his
presidential ambitions, Al Gore asked skeptical voters Thursday to
place the nation's future in his hands, assuring them that ``I
stand here tonight as my own man'' and promising a path to a
``better, fairer, more prosperous America.''
</P>
<P>
   The 50-minute speech, in which Gore accepted his party's
nomination and brought the Democratic National Convention to a
rousing climax, was universally viewed as the most important of
Gore's life. It offered the vice president a unique opportunity to
imprint himself _ and his policies _ on voters who remain
unimpressed by his candidacy, to declare his independence from
President Clinton and to gain ground on front-running Republican
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who high-fived cheering delegates as he walked through the
packed convention floor to the podium to begin his speech, wasted
no time. He painted himself as an experienced leader who is the
best choice for protecting the nation's galloping economy,
improving education, expanding health care and protecting Social
Security, while restoring values and ensuring that the less
advantaged are not left behind.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to spend more money to find a cure for cancer,
finance the hiring of 50,000 police officers and pass campaign
finance reform and hate crimes legislation. And underscoring one of
the biggest differences between himself and Bush, Gore said: ``Let
there be no doubt: I will protect and defend a woman's right to
choose,'' drawing some of the loudest and most prolonged cheers of
the speech.
</P>
<P>
   With his 87-year-old mother, Pauline, wife, Tipper, and children
looking on, the 52-year-old Gore cloaked himself as a populist.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so here tonight, in the name of all the working families
who are the strength and soul of America _ I accept your nomination
for president of the United States,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to talk seriously about the issues. I believe people
deserve to know specifically what a candidate proposes to do. I
intend to tell you tonight. You ought to be able to know, and then
judge for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech laden with policy details, partisan jabs, personal
asides but few rhetorical flourishes, Gore promised to advance
limited tax cuts, to protect the environment and to improve the
quality of life for time-stressed workers.
</P>
<P>
   If elected president, Gore promised, he would stay connected to
the nation by ``holding open meetings in the places (people) live
and work. ... I'm going to go out to you, the people, because I
want to stay in touch with your hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   And he mocked the centerpiece of Bush's campaign _ a major tax
cut _ as fiscally ill-advised and unfair to all but the wealthiest.
``Let me say it plainly,'' Gore pledged, ``I will not go along with
a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else and
wreck our good economy in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together, let's make sure that our prosperity enriches not
just the few, but all working families. Let's invest in health
care, education, a secure retirement and middle-class tax cuts,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore's attempts to present a more personal side may have
succeeded, his effort to escape Clinton was more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that ran 13 pages, Gore mentioned Clinton by name
only once.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's presence was tangible. Only hours before Gore
stepped onto the stage at the Staples Center came news that
independent counsel Robert Ray has impaneled a new grand jury to
hear evidence against Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The White House reacted quickly and bluntly to the report,
dismissing the probe and questioning the timing. ``The timing of
this leak reeks to high heaven,'' White House spokesman Jake
Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Clinton committed perjury or obstructed
justice when he denied an affair in sworn testimony in the Paula
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Gore cast himself as a devoted father and an
unfailing friend of working families who will stand as a barrier
between them and the monied interests favored by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's the difference in this election. They're for the
powerful, and we're for the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big tobacco, big oil, the big polluters, the pharmaceutical
companies, the HMO's. Sometimes you have to be willing to stand up
and say no _ so families can have a better life,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So often, powerful forces and powerful interests stand in your
way, and the odds seemed stacked against you _ even as you do
what's right for you and your family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How and what we do for all of you _ the people who pay the
taxes, bear the burdens and live the American dream _ that is the
standard by which we should be judged. And for all of our good
times, I am not satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has served as vice president for the past eight
years, Gore portrayed himself as an underdog who will safeguard the
interests and future of Middle America, proclaiming that his
``focus is on working families'' who often feel powerless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know this,'' Gore said to an adoring and
overflow crowd in the Staples Center and the millions more watching
on TV. ``I've taken on the powerful forces. And as president, I'll
stand up to them, and I'll stand up for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was preceded on stage by his wife, Tipper, who introduced
him as ``a decisive leader with strong values, deeply held
convictions, and an unwavering commitment to making the American
dream a reality for all our people.''
</P>
<P>
   There also were testimonials from friends and family members and
a 13-minute film of his life, tracing his path as a child born in
Tennessee to his Army tour in Vietnam through his early career as a
newspaper reporter and a politician.
</P>
<P>
   The segment was designed to add depth and color to Gore's image,
to present him as an everyday guy who is little different from the
average American and not a stiff, distant, waffling politician.
</P>
<P>
   One of the testimonials came from Jim Frush, a Seattle attorney
and mountain climber who guided Gore and his son Albert to the
summit of Mount Rainier last summer in extraordinarily harsh
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough climb,'' Frush told the Democrats. Temperatures
dipped into the 20s, and much of the mountain was shrouded in near
white-out conditions. But, Frush said, Gore ``was grace under
pressure and perseverance. ... Al was our spark plug on that climb.
... I'd follow him anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the glowing praise, Gore admitted, ``I know my own
imperfections. I know that sometimes people say I'm too serious,
that I talk too much substance and policy. Maybe I've done that
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the presidency is more than a popularity contest,'' he
said. ``It's a day-by-day fight for people. Sometimes, you have to
choose to do what's difficult or unpopular. Sometimes, you have to
be willing to spend your popularity in order to pick the hard right
over the easy wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore delivered the speech trailing Bush by about 10 points in
most polls and with his campaign struggling to find a chord that
will energize the undecided voters that will determine the
election.
</P>
<P>
   He structured his speech to address issues important to them and
to amplify the centrist positions that those voters are most likely
to embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it will work remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   But he reminded voters, ``The power should be in your hands. The
future should belong to everyone in this land. We could squander
this moment _ but our country would be the poorer for it. Instead,
let's lift our eyes, and see how wide the American horizon has
become.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward Gore left with vice presidential nominee Joe Lieberman
for Wisconsin, where they are to begin a campaign boat trip down
the Mississippi River.

GORE, CENTER STAGE AT LAST, REVELS IN EMBRACE OF CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs grafs 4, 5, 7 and 10 for wording changes; adds 9 grafs at
end)  
 (Eds.: This is now an added starter on N.Y. Times Page 1)  
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Bill Clinton's backstage walk to valediction on
Monday was a heavyweight champion's last indulgent moment in the
sun, Al Gore's arrival in the Staples Center on Thursday night was
a dogged contender's first chance to enter the arena alone. He
strode through a sea of pennants down a side aisle with a posse of
seconds trailing humbly in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Gore had climbed the gray-carpeted steps of the
podium and wrapped his wife, Tipper, in a sweeping embrace and a
long kiss, the giant arena was shaking as if in a California
earthquake, strobe lights flickered, tears streaked delegates'
faces, and the crowd was utterly his.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking unusually quickly (faster, one of his writers said,
than he ever did in rehearsals), confidently, even ebulliently at
times, Gore seemed determined to shake the plodding pace and tone
of condescension that often mark his formal speeches. He virtually
raced through a litany of causes and issues dear to the core
Democratic constituencies, from health care to civil rights,
affirmative action, public education, and abortion rights, with
perhaps the biggest applause line of all that ``the last thing this
country needs is a Supreme Court that overturns Roe vs. Wade.''
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of loyal service to a consummate, intuitive
political performer, Mr. Gore left no doubt from the start tonight
that he was determined to present himself without Mr. Clinton's
shadow darkening his center stage. When he said, ``I stand here
tonight as my own man, and I want you to know me for who I truly
am,'' his young speechwriter, Eli Attie, and his image-meister,
Carter Eskew, watching from just below the podium, slapped a
high-five in satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 minutes later, at the end of his speech, Gore even
found his own formulation of Clinton's 1992 pledge to stay with the
voters of New Hampshire until the ``last dog dies,'' by vowing:
``If you entrust me with the presidency, I know I won't always be
the most exciting politician. But I pledge to you tonight: I will
work for you every day and I will never let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrast with the disappointment that Clinton's personal
conduct has caused Democrats was unspoken, but perfectly clear.
</P>
<P>
   But as they climbed the aisles to the press section afterwards,
Gore's aides took particular satisfaction at the way he had defined
his identity and delineated his argument for election, by saying:
``This election is not an award for past performance. I'm not
asking you to vote for me on the basis of the economy we have.
Tonight, I ask for your support on the basis of the better, fairer,
more prosperous America we can build together.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's aides also expressed surprise that Gore had
finished his speech far faster than in any of his repeated
rehearsals with a teleprompter.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, for a candidate with proven skill at cut-and-thrust,
Gore made not a single direct mention of his Republican opponent,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and very few indirect ones.
</P>
<P>
   About the closest he came to a direct attack was his vow to
fight against tax cuts for the wealthy, and fight for prescription
drug benefits for the elderly. ``And that's the difference in this
election,'' he said. ``They're for the powerful, and we're for the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a convention week in which conventional wisdom held
that Gore needed to knock one out of the park Thursday night. Only
time will tell how he touched the television audience, which
matters the most, but many delegates here, perhaps in reflection of
the glittery, giddy high of the moment, said he had done just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my gosh, I was moved to tears _ I'm so proud of him,''
said Dianna Johnson, a delegate from Virginia who grew up in
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Whalen, a Massachusetts delegate, said: ``He kept right on
the issues, and the issues are what will help him win in November.
His style was great. He absolutely was not wooden. As Tiger Woods
would say, he brought his A game.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Hale, a longtime Clinton aide who came back this season
to help manage the convention for Gore, flashed a thumbs-up sign as
she passed journalists on deadline. ``I think he showed his own
persona,'' she said, ``and he told his own story and he said it
clearly and with emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, as star-shaped mylar balloons, and red, white and
blue rubber ones, and gold and silver confetti fired from air
cannons filled the air, the newly minted nominee was joined on
stage by a pantheon of the Democratic family, winners and losers,
past and present alike, from his primary rival, former Sen. Bill
Bradley, to John J. Sweeney, the president of the AFL-CIO. When
Gore finally made his way through the tunnel off the speaker's
platform, delegates were straining to shake his hand or snap his
picture, and a new aura surrounded him.
</P>
<P>
   From late afternoon on, the energy in the hall had built
steadily. Souvenir stands that were all but deserted on Wednesday
suddenly had long lines. Aisles that had been passable were filled
to overflowing. Air-conditioning that had been icy seemed just a
bit less cold. By 5:30 p.m., the stage was groaning with a gaggle
of party leaders and dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Gore's daughter Kristin introduced his wife an hour
later, there was pandemonium. Mickey Hart, the old Grateful Dead
drummer, beat a tom-tom on stage, and Mrs. Gore, radiant in powder
blue, shook and boogied, clapped and high-fived. What seemed like
an ocean of round red, white and blue signs reading ``Tipper
Rocks'' bobbed in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore, an accomplished amateur photographer, narrated
pictures from a family album interspersed in a video that paid
tribute to Gore's service in Vietnam, his journalistic career and
his virtues as a family man. She concluded over stirring music,
``To me, for all the past accomplishments and future promises, he's
still the man I fell in love with in high school.''

SCIOSCIA DENIES REPORT DODGERS FIRED HIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anaheim Angels manager Mike Scioscia strongly denied
a story in Thursday's Los Angeles Times which cited unnamed sources
in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization who claimed he was fired
after managing at Triple-A Albuquerque last season.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone fired
Scioscia ``because his staff didn't think he could manage.'' The
report also quoted Malone saying Scioscia wanted to be at the
major-league level but they didn't have room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not true,'' Scioscia said. ``I was not fired and I did
not ask for a spot on the major-league staff. I had meetings with
(assistant GM) Bill Geivett and Kevin Malone, really long-range as
to what my role in the organization would be and what my input
would be. But there couldn't be any clear-cut plan because they
were still in transition. The organization was still being
reshaped.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers announced that Scioscia resigned during the first
week of September, right after he guided the Dukes to a 65-74
record in the Pacific Coast League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I know what happened,'' he said. ``I resigned to pursue
opportunities I knew would be out there. . . . I don't know where
the perception (he was fired) came from. The first week of
September my feeling was this gives me a jump on other positions
and allowed me to lay the groundwork for getting this job.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Pitching update: Troy Percival (inflamed elbow), Seth
Etherton (shoulder tendinitis) and Jarrod Washburn (stress fracture
in shoulder) all played catch Thursday and were encouraged by their
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today he gave it an enthusiastic thumbs up,'' Scioscia said of
Percival. ``It's not like he stepped it up to any appreciable level
to say, hey, he's ready to get on the mound. But the sensations he
had before are not there and that's encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Etherton is eligible to come off the DL on Sunday. The club
didn't expect him back by then, but Etherton hopes to show them
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt great,'' he said. ``I can come off in four days.
Hopefully I can make sure they know I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn's recovery is monitored by the pain he feels, and
Thursday he said he felt no pain.
</P>
<P>
   __ Back in the lineup: Tim Salmon was in the lineup Thursday,
one day after being hit on the left thumb by a line drive hit by
Troy Glaus.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A deputy no more, Vice President Al Gore made his
debut as the Democratic presidential nominee Thursday night with a
vow to work for all Americans, ``especially those who need a voice,
those who need a champion, those who need to be lifted up so they
are never left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Democratic National Convention that nominated
him on Wednesday night and to the nation beyond, Gore said bluntly,
``I stand here tonight as my own man'' _ a clear rejoinder to the
Republicans who have sought to picture him as a cut-rate version of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president told a whooping crowd at the Staples Center
on the fringe of downtown Los Angeles that he would give working
families ``a full range of targeted tax cuts,'' including an early
end to the so-called marriage penalty, and a reform of the federal
estate tax. But his proposals stopped well short of those made by
his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In a pointed reference to Bush's promise to cut federal income
taxes by more than $1.3 trillion over 10 years, Gore said, ``I will
not go along with a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of
everyone else and wreck our good economy in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   In what sounded like a subtle attempt to distance himself from
Clinton, he promised, ``I will never let you down.'' And he was
careful to confine his criticism of the opposition to policies
rather than personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing Bush in the polls, faced with an uphill fight in the
Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic swing states that will decide the
outcome, Gore seemed to be laying the groundwork for a fall
campaign in which he would identify himself as the friend of the
little guy and Bush as the candidate of the rich, powerful and
influential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together let's make sure that our prosperity enriches not just
the few, but all working families,'' the vice president declared.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, he spoke of unspecified ``powerful forces'' and
``powerful interests,'' which he implicitly identified with the
Republicans, standing in the way of working men and women. It was
reminiscent of Theodore Roosevelt's denunciation of ``the
malefactors of great wealth'' in 1907 and Franklin D. Roosevelt's
castigation of ``economic royalists'' during the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that the stock market has boomed and so many
businesses and new enterprises have done well,'' the vice president
said. ``This country is richer and stronger. But my focus is on
working families _ people trying to make house payments and car
payments, working overtime to save for college and do right by
their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy is in many ways Gore's greatest asset on the stump.
Given its strength, he should be doing much better, by normal
standards. Candidates of parties that hold the White House usually
fare well when the economy is strong and the country is involved in
no foreign war.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president has been unable to generate the kind of
electricity that follows Clinton everywhere. And Clinton's speech
on Monday night did nothing to light a fire for his protege. ``All
he did was, he made a good case for Clinton,'' said Gerald
Rafshoon, Jimmy Carter's imagemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this most important hour of his political career, the
shadow of Clinton fell across Gore's path. It was disclosed in
Washington that a new grand jury has been convened to consider
whether the president should be indicted after leaving office for
having lied under oath about his affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Some weeks ago, Sam Popkin, a professor at the University of
California at San Diego who is working in the Gore campaign,
defined the goals of the two candidates at their respective
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, Popkin said, needed to show some gravitas, while Gore
needed to show some levitas. In other words, one needed to show he
was not a lightweight, the other to lighten up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   By common consent, the Republican made at least a start at the
Philadelphia convention towards establishing himself as a serious
political figure, capable of handling large issues. It was less
clear how much the Democrat had improved on his image as a
plodding, overearnest orator and campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech contained few rhetorical flourishes or unexpected
policy departures and fewer flashes of humor. Speaking more quickly
than usual, Gore poured out a flood of words; sometimes he sounded
like a man with his car parked with the meter running. But he
gestured more than Bush had, and was altogether more animated.
</P>
<P>
   The speech, which lasted for 52 minutes, was a shopping list,
and Gore acknowledged that he may have sounded like a policy wonk.
He even admitted, ``I won't always be the most exciting
politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he hit hard on key points, sometimes almost shouting to
drive home his message. And the crowd cheered wildly when he
promised to preserve abortion rights, to oppose school vouchers and
to support affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest cheers came when he promised that a
comprehensive campaign spending reform bill would be the first he
sent to Congress if he was elected. But he did not commit himself
to the most stringent such measure _ the one sponsored by Sens.
John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go, Al, go!'' the crowd chanted, waving blue-and-white
``Gore'' signs.
</P>
<P>
   Some in his camp still hope for a modest post-convention
``bounce'' in opinion polls about Gore's candidacy, but their
ultimate goal is to turn the race around in the debates with Bush.
The Texas governor agreed Thursday to three debates with the vice
president, starting in early October, as well as two between the
vice presidential nominees. But the Bush campaign made no agreement
as to the debates' length, format or location. Gore, an experienced
and accomplished debater, said earlier in the campaign that he
would like to debate twice weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was preceded to the podium by a parade of speakers,
including Kweisi Mfume, a former congressman who is now president
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
and Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamente of California, the first statewide
Hispanic officeholder in this state this century.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the modern, made-for-television style, a parade of
friends of the nominee extolled his virtues. Among the speakers
were David Halberstam, the journalist and author, a family friend,
and Robert Delabar of Seattle, who met Gore while both were
stationed at Fort Rucker, Ala., in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Gore served in Vietnam while Bush did not, and the Democrats
have made a point of that difference throughout their convention.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Tipper Gore, the vice president's wife, came on to
introduce him. An amateur photographer, she called her husband ``a
decisive leader with strong values, deeply held convictions and an
unwavering commitment to making the American dream a reality for
all our people,'' and showed a series of shots from what she
described as ``the family photo album.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for the night's main event, the delegates were in a
jolly mood for all their worries about winning. They boogied,
talked on their cell phones, waved placards, put on silly hats for
the television cameras, did the wave and chanted, ``Viva, Gore!''
</P>
<P>
   Gore entered through the crowd, high-fiving several delegates,
then ascended the stage to give his wife, dressed in a sky-blue
silk dress and coat, a robust bearhug. There was an echo of Tipper
Gore's past attacks on popular music that features explicit sexual
content in Gore's speech, much of which he wrote himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we must challenge a culture with too much meanness
and not enough meaning,'' he said. ``And as president I will stand
with you for a goal that I know we share: To give more power back
to the parents, so that you can choose what your own children are
exposed to, and pass on the basic lessons of responsibility and
decency.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Gore's other themes was an openness to voters' views.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm elected president,'' he declared, ``I'm going to keep
on having open meetings all over this country. I'm going to go out
to you, the people, because I want to stay in touch with your
hopes, with the quiet, everyday heroism of American families.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president underlined that point by introducing people
in the audience who, he said, had taught him about key issues when
he met them during the campaign _ an Iowa woman who needed a tax
cut to help pay for her daughter's college education, for example,
and a Hispanic family from Texas who long for a less crowded,
better built school for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing John F. Kennedy, who announced the start of a national
journey to a New Frontier when nominated here 40 years ago, Gore
urged his listeners Thursday night to ``set out on a new journey to
the best America.''
</P>
<P>
   He called it, in some of the most poetic language he used
Thursday night, a journey ``on which we advance not by the turning
of wheels, but by the turning of our minds, the reach of our vision
and the daring grace of the human spirit.''

A VOTE FOR SOCIETY OR FOR SELF? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ My boss, Chris Lester, spent his Tuesday
column agonizing over whether his vote in this November's
presidential election should be dictated by economic self-interest
or civic virtue.
</P>
<P>
   His growing family makes candidate Bush's promises of a
substantial tax cut appealing, but his conscience's concern is
whether tax relief of this magnitude will detonate an inflationary
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The process of deciding, he allowed, is becoming painful, and he
may not be alone in this particular pickle. Strange as it may seem,
there are otherwise reasonably intelligent citizens who sincerely
believe allowing government to keep more of their money ensures a
sounder economy.
</P>
<P>
   This perception of things economic is highly arguable, of
course, but in the case of Lester and all others similarly
situated, it's also irrelevant in the here and now.
</P>
<P>
   One of Lester's primary concerns was the second quarter's rate
of gross domestic product expansion, which was much stronger than
anticipated. Although sizzling growth often signals an overheating
economy that threatens hyperinflation, the economy's April-June
strength was generated by activity that actually should counter
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Had consumer spending fueled the growth surge, inflationary
fears would have been justified. Most of the unexpected growth,
however, resulted from capital investment by business in high-tech
wares that will enhance worker productivity.
</P>
<P>
   This expectation was validated last week by news that
productivity soared at a 5.3 percent annual rate in the second
quarter. The year-over-year productivity comparison showed the
biggest increase in 17 years. Unit labor costs, meanwhile, dipped
slightly after a relatively large first-quarter gain. Compared with
last year's second quarter, however, labor costs fell 0.4 percent,
which was the first year-over-year decline since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   These productivity gains will make it easier for businesses to
boost wages without having to raise prices to maintain profit
margins. Productivity has been registering significant gains since
the mid-1990s after a couple of decades of lackluster performance.
</P>
<P>
   The especially good news is that business outlays on
productivity-enhancing investment are continuing at a strong pace.
A recent Merrill Lynch analysis revealed that although
second-quarter capital spending surged at a 21 percent annual rate,
tech spending was up at a 31 percent pace. New orders for
technology equipment, meanwhile, were up 42 percent in June from a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch research shows that increases in technology
spending translate into productivity gains after about 10 quarters,
which means the current trend probably will keep bearing fruit
until at least early 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line here, which Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan has also noted, is that increasing productivity can be
expected to allow higher growth rates and lower jobless rates
without spurring inflation. This will hold no matter who cuts taxes
by how much in post-election Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed in this context, Lester isn't locked into a choice
between self-interest and society's best interest. He can vote his
pocketbook serene in the knowledge that he won't wreck the economy
by putting home and hearth first.

 &HT;    GORE VOWS TO FIGHT FOR 'EVERYDAY HEROES'
 &HT;    950&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore promised to support the
``quiet, everyday heroism of hard-working Americans'' as he
accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that focused on the possibilities of the future
rather than the accomplishments of the Clinton administration, Gore
declared himself ``my own man'' as he re-introduced himself to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than try to match the charm of his Republican rival,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the notoriously formal Gore used his
acceptance speech to draw distinctions on issues he believes will
help him overcome Bush's steady lead in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my own imperfections,'' he said. ``I know that
sometimes people say I'm too serious, that I talk too much
substance and policy. Maybe I've done that tonight. But the
presidency is more than a popularity contest. It's a day-to-day
fight for people.''
</P>
<P>
   And with news of a new investigation of President Clinton
casting yet another shadow on his candidacy, Gore added, ``If you
entrust me with the presidency, I know that I won't always be the
most exciting politician. But I pledge to you tonight: I will work
for you every day and I will never let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's new presidential standard-bearer promised to use the
federal government's record budget surplus to expand health care
coverage, improve education, shore up safety net programs and
extend tax cuts to help ``every hard-working family'' to ``open the
door to their dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged his support for affirmative action, new gun
controls, federal hate crime legislation, an increase in the
federal minimum wage, a patients bill of rights, funding for more
police and teachers and cracking down on the marketing of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Although frequently interrupted by the pennant waving delegates
and chants of ``Go, Al, Go,'' Gore drew the most sustained applause
when he reiterated his support for abortion rights, a direct
counterpoint to Bush's opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let there be no doubt: I will protect and defend a woman's
right to choose,'' he said. ``The last thing this country needs is
a Supreme Court that overturns Roe v. Wade.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also recalled how he had fought ``against the powerful
interests'' over the course of his career, pushing for welfare
reform and an improved environment.
</P>
<P>
   And despite his own abuses of the campaign finance system, Gore
vowed that a reform bill will be the first one he sends to Congress
as president. ``Let others try to restore the old guard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also took direct aim at a sweeping tax cut proposal at the
heart of Bush's campaign. ``Let me say it plainly: I will not go
along with a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of
everyone else and wreck our good economy in the process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's emphasis on issues in a speech he largely crafted
himself, the convention's final day was mostly devoted to showing
the American public parts of the 52-year-old Gore's life that have
been obscured by his eight years as President Clinton's vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime friends of Gore played roles in an evening talk-show
style segment that featured anecdotes about Gore's relationship
with his father, a fiddle-playing populist senator from the hill
country of Tennessee; his decision to join the Army during the
Vietnam War; and his career in journalism before entering politics.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, an accomplished photographer, used photographs from
their three decades of marriage and his 24 years in politics to
present her husband as a family man. ``Al has always been there for
our family and he will always be there for yours,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore family photo album was shared not only with the more
than 4,368 delegates in the Staples Center, the site of the
convention, but also with the prime-time national television
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's biography has a central part of nearly every night of the
convention since Clinton's curtain call and departure Monday night,
a reflection of the concern among Gore advisers that voters
continue to view the vice president through the lens of Clinton's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns were not diminished by the disclosure earlier
Thursday that a new grand jury has been empaneled to continue the
investigation of Clinton in connection with his extramarital affair
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Not only Democrats, but also Republicans expressed dismay over
the disclosure just hours before Gore was to accept his party's
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not appropriate for this type of announcement to be made
on the day that the vice president is going to accept the
Democratic nomination,'' said senior Bush strategist Karen Hughes.
``This election is not about the past; it's about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in his acceptance speech, paid a glowing but brief tribute
to Clinton. ``Millions of Americans will live better lives for a
long time to come because of the job that's been done to President
Clinton,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now we turn the page and write a new chapter,'' he said.
``We're entering a new time. We're electing a new president. And I
stand here tonight as my own man, and I want you to know who I
truly am.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I have strong values, the love of my family, my
faith, my love for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention delegates erupted with cheers as Gore entered the
convention hall after Tipper's introduction. Wearing the more
traditional blue suit rather than the earth tones that were
ridiculed during the presidential primaries, Gore took the unusual
route to the speaker's podium, charging down an aisle on the
convention floor past the Tennessee delegation.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Promising to champion ordinary folks and their children, Gore
said, ``Tonight, I ask for your support on the basis of the better,
fairer, more prosperous America we can build together.''
</P>
<P>
   He reminded the audience of the administration's economic
accomplishments: 22 million new jobs, the lowest inflation in a
generation, the highest home ownership ever, the lowest
unemployment in a quarter century and the biggest budget surpluses
ever.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``for all of our good times, I am not satisfied,'' he
added. ``Together, let's make sure that our prosperity enriches not
just the few, but all working families.''
</P>
<P>
   As president, Gore said he would continue the open meetings that
were a part of his presidential campaign and his 16 years in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go out to you, the people, because I want to stay
in touch with your hopes, with the quiet, every-day heroism of
hard-working Americans,'' he said. ``So this is not just an
election between my opponent and me. It's about our people, our
families, and our future _ and whether forces standing in your way
will keep you from having a better life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not dwell exclusively on economic issues, however. He
also vowed to use the presidency to ``challenge a culture'' that
has ``too much meanness, and not enough meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's 43rd convention, much more traditional than the
TV-driven GOP gathering two weeks ago, ended with a picturesque sea
of red, white and blue balloons and confetti dropped from the
Staples Center as family, friends and political joined Gore on the
podium.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut,
planned to leave Los Angeles shortly after the climactic event of
the convention to begin a four-day trip down the Mississippi River,
through Midwestern battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   Their trip follows word from the Bush campaign that the
Republican nominee and his running mate, former congressman Dick
Cheney, would like five debates this fall: three involving the
presidential candidates, two with the vice presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush initiative calls into question the three debates
scheduled by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which usually
organizes and runs the debates. The Bush campaign is seeking other
organizations to sponsor the debates.
</P>
<P>
   William Daley, the Gore campaign chairman, suggested that the
five debates sought by Bush should be in addition to the three
already scheduled by the debate commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of our campaign will be simple: to set up the
greatest number of debates in forums accessible to the greatest
number of voters, starting at the soonest possible time,'' Daley
said.

WOMAN FINDS SUCCESS SELLING POLITICAL PRODUCTS ON INTERNET

<P>
   SMITHVILLE, Mo. _ The speeches have been delivered, the confetti
swept away, the lights dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   Now the stumping begins in earnest for presidential candidates
Al Gore and George W. Bush, their running mates and their
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   And John and Jane Q. Public _ itching to trumpet their loyalty
for their candidate on a T-shirt, button or bumper sticker _ can
click onto www.politicalshop.com, which sells a wide array of
political products.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site is an outgrowth of one started by Sharon Clemons of
Smithville in 1996. The year before, she got her first taste of the
Internet and was in awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is one of the most earth-shattering things
developed in the last century, and I think it will continue to be
well into this century,'' Clemons said. ``It is just so
fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   PoliticalShop.com is an outgrowth of an entrepreneurial class
that Clemons took in 1992 while pursuing a master's degree in
business administration at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to come up with something where you start your own
business, so I started selling novelty items, souvenirs and
political items, and I've never stopped,'' Clemons said.
</P>
<P>
   So caught up was Clemons in her venture that she never returned
to finish her MBA, which she regrets.
</P>
<P>
   But selling political buttons, T-shirts, bumper stickers, coffee
mugs and more has kept her busy.
</P>
<P>
   After her first foray into the world of Web sites connected
through technology, Clemons set up shop on the Internet. Along the
way, she registered Web site domain names, including AlGore.com,
Gore2000.com and variations thereof.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Clemons got a call from Gore's staff. Could Gore, they
asked, get the AlGore.com and Gore2000.com domain names?
</P>
<P>
   After haggling over a price for the names, Clemons gave the vice
president AlGore.com but kept the others for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Clemons said Gore's camp offered less than five figures, while
she thought the names were worth nothing less than six figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we just ended up giving it to him,'' Clemons said.
``After all, Al Gore is his name, but we felt we had a right to
keep {www.gore2000.com} because we were speculating a long time ago
he was going to run. We'd been selling Gore items since 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Gore, who once said he invented the Internet, wasn't
too on top of snagging domain names. In the end, she cut him some
slack. After all, she said, she is a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But she said her site is strictly nonpartisan. There are as many
Bush-Cheney items as there are Gore-Lieberman ones.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she was a bit worried about the expected drop-off
in business after the election but that she immediately will begin
a Campaign 2004 push and branch out into other areas. That includes
an eBay auction-type site for which Clemons has registered the name
PoliticalAuction.com. Her current site sells political
paraphernalia going back to 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Clemons' personal favorites on PoliticalShop.com are Ella the
elephant and Demi the donkey, plush collectibles she spent more
than a year designing. They can be bought separately or in a set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like them the most because they're collectible, like Beanie
Babies, and they're, well, just cute,'' Clemons said.
</P>
<P>
   Each come with hangtags with sayings such as ``I promise to work
my tail off,'' ``I promise to keep my nose clean'' and ``I won't
take you for a ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemons said many of the Web sites offering political
paraphernalia are partisan, although there are direct competitors
such as PoliticalGifts.com.
</P>
<P>
   She said her site was getting about 1 million different visitors
each month. Many of those visitors click on from overseas, Europe
and Asia in particular.
</P>
<P>
   She said the site generates revenue of more than six figures
each year and is profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wouldn't want to say how far into the six figures for
competitive reasons,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And the best seller on the site?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Clemons said, ``that would have to be the T-shirts
that say, `Read My Lips _ No New Texans.' ''

GORE VOWS TO SPREAD PROSPERITY IN ACCEPTING DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL
NOMINATION &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  Editors: Tightens, updates 
 
By JULIE MASON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vowing to extend prosperity to the working
families he's made central to his campaign, Democrat Al Gore on
Thursday accepted his party's presidential nomination, declaring,
``Our whole future is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The future should belong to everyone in this land,'' Gore said
in remarks prepared for delivery at the Democratic National
Convention. ``We could squander this moment, but our country would
be poorer for it. Instead, let's lift our eyes and see how wide the
American horizon has become.''
</P>
<P>
   Delivering the most important speech of his life on the
convention's closing night, the 52-year-old vice president marked a
pivotal moment between more than a year of nonstop campaigning and
the final sprint to Election Day Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sought to project a passion that would overcome low
expectations, lagging poll numbers and the reputation for a stiff
personality that has been the subject of Republican derision,
late-night television one-liners and even his own self-deprecation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know this,'' Gore said in accepting the
Democratic nomination and calling on voters to support him and his
running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut. ``I've taken on
the powerful forces. And as president, I'll stand up to them, and
I'll stand up for you.''
</P>
<P>
   He specifically mentioned the pharmaceutical industry, invoking
a key campaign theme _ health care reforms including Medicare
coverage for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll fight for it and the other side will not,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd responded often with applause and cheers of ``Go, Al,
Go!''
</P>
<P>
   With his campaign for president trailing Republican Gov. George
W. Bush for months heading into the Democratic National Convention,
Gore strove in a speech he wrote himself to knit his name and
message to the nation's bounding economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that the stock market has boomed and so many
businesses and new enterprises have done well,'' he said. ``This
country is richer and stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But my focus is on working families _ people trying to make
house payments and car payments, working overtime to save for
college and do right by their kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made a single mention of President Clinton in his 51-minute
address, saying many Americans will live better lives for the job
the president has done.
</P>
<P>
   And in a nod to those who did not support Gore and his more
centrist campaign for president, Gore acknowledged Bill Bradley,
the former U.S. senator from New Jersey who the vice president
vanquished in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Lighting on a question raised frequently about his difficulty in
emerging from the shadow of President Clinton, Gore said, ``We're
electing a new president. And I stand here tonight as my own man,
and I want you to know me for who I truly am.''
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the speech from Bush's headquarters in Texas, Bush
spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Gore offered ``more cliches than
conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The working families of America will not be well-served by
more fighting in Washington, yet Vice President Gore tonight
offered more of the same old language of class warfare,
partisanship and division,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the week leading up to Gore's climactic speech,
Democratic supporters and family members have urgently worked to
convey an enhanced, multifaceted image of Gore, whom many voters
say they find stolid and inscrutable.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, his wife of 30 years and an avid amateur
photographer, introduced her husband at the convention through a
montage of her own pictures and others showing the family man
behind the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of you know that faith and family are at the center of
Al's life,'' she said. ``Many of you know Al to be a decisive
leader with strong values, deeply held convictions and an
unwavering commitment to making the American dream a reality for
all our people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also want you to know that as a husband, father and
grandfather, Al has always been there for our family and he will
always be there for yours,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Texan Robert Strauss, former ambassador to the Soviet Union and
adviser to presidents of both parties, said earlier this week that
in order to connect with voters, Gore would have to deliver an
issue-laden convention address that also was ``appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   The biographical journey that preceded Gore's speech traced his
life from Carthage, Tenn., to Harvard, Vietnam, years spent working
as a journalist, 16 years in Congress and eight as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In adding family flourishes _ such as remarks by his wife and
daughters Karenna and Kristin _ to Gore's delivery on the
convention's national stage, his handlers hope to benefit from a
post-convention ``bounce'' in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gore laid out a list of accomplishments and an
agenda for the country's future aimed at closing the gap between
the Democratic and Republican campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   He said the federal budget surplus makes possible ``a full range
of targeted tax cuts to working families. Not just to help them
save for college, but to pay for health insurance or child care, to
reform the estate tax ... and to end the marriage penalty _ the
right way, the fair way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he wants to build upon the nation's prosperity, as
symbolized by expanding federal budget surpluses, the lowest
inflation rate in a generation and 22 million new jobs since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In a swipe at Bush and what Gore has deemed the ``do-nothing
Republican Congress,'' Gore said: ``Let me say plainly: I will not
go along with a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of
everyone else and wreck our good economy in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, try as he might to define his own persona separate from
Clinton, the president's ongoing legal troubles inserted themselves
during what was to be Gore's unspoiled moment in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   It was disclosed Thursday that a new federal grand jury was
impaneled July 11 to hear evidence about Clinton's affair with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a decision by special prosecutor Robert Ray on
whether to indict Clinton on charges of obstruction of justice and
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert condemned the inopportune
revelation, saying: ``The timing of this leak reeks to high
heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign was similarly critical of the news, as was
Karen Hughes, spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, who said, ``We
think the timing is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Also before Gore's address, the Bush campaign announced from
Austin that Bush and running mate Dick Cheney would negotiate a
total of five debates this fall with Gore and his running mate,
Sen. Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   With the conclusion of the convention, Gore and Lieberman plan a
four-day, 400-mile boat trip down the Mississippi River starting
Friday.

   WASHINGTON _ Independent counsel Robert Ray has impaneled a
federal grand jury to review President Clinton's efforts to conceal
his affair with Monica Lewinsky, raising howls from Democrats about
a political sneak attack on the day Al Gore accepted the Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury was sworn in more than a month ago, sources
outside the independent counsel's office said. The panel is
positioned to help Ray fulfill a promise to announce, once Clinton
leaves office, whether he can be indicted on charges of perjury or
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who replaced Clinton nemesis Kenneth Starr last October,
has quietly continued the investigation into the president's affair
with Lewinsky, at the center of his impeachment by the House and
subsequent acquittal by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing of the leak of this information reeks to high
heaven,'' said White House spokesman Jake Siewert. ``But given
their (the independent counsel's office) track record on this, it
is hardly surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   As Vice President Gore was preparing to give perhaps the most
important speech of his political career Thursday evening, his
staff reacted angrily to the reports of the resurrection of
scandals plaguing the administration in which he is top deputy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is highly suspect,'' said Doug Hattaway, a Gore
spokesman. ``People are sick and tired of the judicial system being
manipulated for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Hattaway added, Gore was not concerned that the reports
might mar his acceptance speech. ``We believe the voters are
focused on the future.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore's November opponent, George W. Bush's campaign
spokesman Ray Sullivan said, ``Americans are sick and tired of
investigations and scandals. The best way to change the tone in
Washington is to change the administration in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's office refused to confirm that a grand jury had
been impaneled, but at the same time denied any link to reports
that a grand jury was meeting. ``The source of these reports is not
within the office of the independent counsel,'' said Lynda Flippin,
spokeswoman for Ray.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as this spring, Ray said he had not ruled out
indicting Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Legal bombshells dropping near important political events are
not new in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Iran-Contra independent counsel Lawrence Walsh
issued an amended indictment of Caspar Weinberger, President Bush's
defense secretary, on the weekend before the 1992 election. It was
the first indictment in the scandal to make specific references to
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's political advisers pounced on that and within hours of
the indictment issued a statement headlined: ``New Iran-Contra
Evidence Released By Prosecutor Shows Bush Flatly Lied.'' Bush
loyalists claimed the court filing halted his momentum before the
1992 vote.
</P>
<P>
   But some Clinton advisers and friends think that Thursday's leak
could actually end up helping Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is no doubt this leak is designed to deprive Al
Gore of his moment tonight, but you know what, I think it will
boomerang,'' said Lanny Davis, a former Clinton administration
official.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six months, Ray's office has issued statements
noting the hiring of several new attorneys and assistants in his
office, indicating that at least some aspects of the Clinton case
had not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Ray has been in Nova Scotia on vacation for several days and was
out of touch with his staff during the critical hours before
initial reports of the new grand jury, associates said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a panel of federal judges overseeing independent
counsel investigations reauthorized Ray's inquiry for another year.
In a brief statement, the judges said it is ``not currently
appropriate'' to end the investigation begun in 1994 into Clinton
involvement in Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   Starr told Congress in September 1998, when he filed his
impeachment referral with the House, that he believed there was
``substantial and credible'' evidence that the president had
committed perjury, first during a sworn deposition during the Paula
Jones sexual harassment case, and then when he testified via
closed-circuit television to Starr's original grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was Clinton's claim to Jones' lawyers that he had not
had sexual relations with Lewinsky when he was asked that as part
of Jones' lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also alleged that Clinton had obstructed justice in his
efforts to cover up the Lewinsky affair, action he eventually
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright, who oversaw
the Jones case, ordered Clinton to pay about $90,000 to the Jones
legal team, finding the president in contempt of court for giving
false testimony about his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Ray has said that he would bring no charges in
two other cases _ the misuse of classified FBI files to the White
House and the firing of White House travel office workers.

VERIZON AND UNION NEGOTIATORS KEEP TALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT
DEADLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Negotiators for more than 86,000 striking workers and
Verizon Communications continued to talk early Friday, past a
midnight deadline that some union representatives had set to end
formal talks.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared likely that talks between high-level representatives
of the unions and Verizon would continue through the night and
perhaps longer, regardless of what midlevel union negotiators did
at midnight, people close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   That was made possible after the unions' three main bargaining
units, which were divided on Wednesday, agreed to draw up a unified
proposal Thursday night, a person close to the talks said. The main
sticking points are now job security and mandatory overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperation would probably mean that the unions' concern
about the movement of work after Bell Atlantic's recent acquisition
of GTE Corp., a transaction that formed Verizon, would eclipse the
concern about mandatory overtime, people close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the highest-level negotiators on each side,
Lawrence T. Babbio Jr., Verizon's vice president and co-chairman,
and Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of
America, were exchanging details of the proposal by fax Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm prepared to stay all night,'' Bahr said near the midnight
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The CWA represents about 72,000 striking employees, while the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers represents about
14,000. The walkout affects a region stretching from Virginia to
Maine that has more than 25 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, representatives for the CWA in New York and New
England and representatives for the IBEW said they would break off
talks if an agreement was not reached by midnight Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   That would have left a CWA bargaining unit representing striking
employees in several mid-Atlantic states alone in bargaining with
Verizon. That bargaining unit's main priority was gaining
concessions on mandatory overtime.
</P>
<P>
   That has been an important issue throughout the strike region
but perhaps more so in the states where the reluctant bargaining
unit is strongest, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Customer service representatives in those states _ unhappy with the
amount of overtime they work _ have a greater voice in union
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In New York and New England, it is less important because
technicians, who are generally paid more than customer service
representatives, are likely to favor more overtime. In that region,
they are gathered into union locals without much mixture with the
customer service representatives.
</P>
<P>
   At least officially, the communications workers' union for
employees in New York and New England said it supported its
counterpart in the mid-Atlantic region. It and the electrical
workers' union together represent nearly two-thirds of the striking
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bargaining team is prepared to work whatever hours it
takes to get a contract, but we are not willing to be ignored or
disrespected,'' negotiators from the communications workers' union
said in an e-mail message circulated before midnight among union
leaders in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon, for its part, appeared ready to make some concessions
Thursday to speed a resolution to the strike, which has disrupted
the company's efforts to make repairs and start new service.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on the issue of movement of work, the company
reduced the percentage of employees who could have their jobs
formally redefined by the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger to between 1
percent and 2 percent, down from 4 percent. Still, the unions and
the company were in disagreement over how the movement of work
would be measured, a person close to the talks said. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles evokes a lot of impressions: The great
growing metropolis that doesn't have mass transportation. The
art-starved community that's home to some of the world's most
creative people.
</P>
<P>
   Tinseltown. Smogville. The City of Angels. The city of broken
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The thousands of visitors to L.A. through the Democratic
National Convention had time to form their own impressions. Some
opinions will flatter Angelenos. Some will infuriate us. Some even
sound like they come from locals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mayra Uribe, 26, a Florida delegate, fell in love with Los
Angeles during her four-day stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles has been phenomenal. It has lived up to everything
I've ever heard in movies and fantasies,'' she said. ``It's a shame
that Los Angeles has gotten such a bad rap in the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, Uribe said, were the celebrity sightings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Ben Affleck,'' she said. ``And I just took a picture
with Billy Baldwin!''
</P>
<P>
   _ Armstrong Williams, host of the Washington, D.C.-based
``Armstrong Williams Show'' on the Talk America Network, found Los
Angeles warm, and not just because of the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised that a liberal city like Los Angeles gave me a
lot of love. They are very nice,'' he said. ``I expected to be
treated like a pariah while hosting my talk show from the
convention, but we have been getting everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Expensive. That is the greatest impression that Los Angeles
left on Puerto Rico delegate Eudaldo Baez-Galib, a senator from San
Juan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cabs alone cost almost $40 from here to there,'' said the
delegate who was staying in Bel-Air during the four-day convention.
``And the food. I liked it, but it was expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed, however, the friendly reception from Angelenos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one thing that I like very much,'' he said. ``That is
the hospitality. The people here are very hospitable.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Rookie delegate Beth Mills of Gainsville, Fla., said that Los
Angeles lived up to its billing as one of the world's great fun
capitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a great time,'' she said at the party California
threw for out-of-state delegates Monday night on Paramount Studios'
back lot.
</P>
<P>
   She was also a gracious visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for the people of this city because we're
disturbing their traffic,'' Mills said while enjoying a glass of
California chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   She credited Los Angeles with a fun-time grand slam, giving the
city high marks for its Hollywood atmosphere, wine, great food and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   _ National Jewish Democratic Leadership Council's summer interns
from the nation's capital were working inside Staples Center and
had no idea of the disturbances outside until one of them called
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to my mom on a cell phone from Washington, D.C. We
didn't know if we were going to walk out and find rioting. Nobody
inside had any idea anything was going on (outside),'' said Stephen
Krupin, 18, of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Risa Berkower, 20, said: ``We were a little surprised that
something so organized inside could be so chaotic outside.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A family from Mendocino, north of San Francisco, was among the
marchers in one rally against corporate greed.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Watson and her husband, Bruce Erickson, brought their
7-year-old son, Julian Erickson-Watson, who was dressed in a
sea-turtle costume in a show of support for the environment and
wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who said she was in Seattle for the World Trade
Organization demonstrations, said the couple decided to come to Los
Angeles with Julian to change ``the world that he grows up in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my son to know that he can be in the streets to voice
his concerns about the issues that affect him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was wide-eyed at a Los Angeles police officer who was
laden with teargas canisters hanging on his chest straps. The cans
jingled and clanged noisily as the officer moved in formation with
a squad of officers assigned to crowd control. ``What is that?''
the boy asked.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I never realized how diverse the population in Los Angeles
really was,'' said Wisconsin delegate Dave Stetter. ``The people
we've run into have been very friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Stetter's wife, Kathleen, was one of dozens of people who
complained about transportation for the convention and in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transportation is terrible. The bus schedule is a
well-kept secret, and I kept trying to find out what it was,'' she
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   !boxes!
</P>
<P>
   Ed Hasevawa, a delegate from Hawaii, described the city as
``very large.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so spread out, it's so huge,'' he said. ``But I love the
cosmopolitanness.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been to the city once before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the smog has cleared up quite a bit since I was here a
couple of years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   _ Guam's Lt. Gov. Madeleine Bordallo has been to 10 conventions
in 10 cities since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a scale from one to 10, I'd say Los Angeles gets a good
eight or nine from me,'' she said. ``The people have been very
nice, and we've met everyone from the top organizers to the
volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Pennsylvania delegate Joseph Elias couldn't say enough good
stuff about Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fabulous, absolutely fabulous. The governor has done a
great job of presenting the state. This is my first time in Los
Angeles, and I love it,'' he said. ``And I'd like to compliment the
LAPD and Highway Patrol. They're doing an outstanding job.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Some delegates actually gave the convention high marks. That's
the case of Colorado delegates Bettina Bassanou and her daughter,
Nora Nye.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the free-flowing libations, mother and daughter were on a
Clinton High on Monday night after the president and first lady
addressed the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary and Bill, well that was fantastic,'' Bassanou said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we came for. It really got your adrenaline
shooting,'' Nye said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alan Lubin, a delegate from Albany, N.Y., also had glowing
reviews of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' he said. ``It's a great city. The cabs are pretty
expensive, but the restaurants are wonderful, the people have been
superb, and you should be proud of your police force,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He had one criticism about the city's layout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit spread out. I remember one of your mayors once
saying it's 50 suburbs in search of a city,'' he said. ``I agree
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he enjoyed his stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's just the mountains, the fresh air, the ocean. You
can't do better than that.''

   ``This game mirrored our season a whole lot,'' Oates said. ``It
stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Rangers' play last night, Oates said, ``We stunk. We
scored a few runs, but we stunk in a lot of areas.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little disagreement from within the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to make up ground or consider yourself one of the
better teams, you've got to find a way to win that game,'' starter
Rick Helling said. ``We're finding ways to lose. That's the story
of our season; we're finding ways to lose games we should win.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling left the game with a 6-2 lead in the seventh, but the
Red Sox scored six runs in the final two innings off the Rangers'
bullpen to win it. They got three off Jeff Zimmerman and Mike
Venafro in the eighth and three more off John Wetteland in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Mike Lansing, with the Rangers leading 7-6 with two out
in the ninth, delivered the killer blow, a two-run double off the
top of the wall to bring home the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel bad for Rick,'' Venafro said. ``It's his job to keep
it close, and he did just that. It's our job to shut it down from
there, and we failed to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the Rangers lost for the 12th time this season
despite leading after six innings, and for the sixth time when
leading after eight innings. Wetteland suffered his eighth blown
save, one more than last season, although one brief, momentary
bobble by shortstop Royce Clayton cost him as much as Lansing's
two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't make the plays tonight,'' Oates said. ``We did
a lot of things wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling had one of the most unusual games he has pitched. He
allowed a career-high 12 hits and walked two in 62/3 innings, but
he gave up only two runs because the Red Sox were only 2-for-16 off
him with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   But his bullpen didn't have the same astounding success rate.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman got out of the seventh with a 6-2 lead by getting
Nomar Garciaparra to pop out with the bases loaded. But he walked
Jose Offerman to start the eighth. After Venafro took over, Bernard
Gilkey's single and Lansing's two-run double made it 6-4, and
another run scored on first baseman Rafael Palmeiro's throwing
error.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers came back with another run in the ninth when Frank
Catalanotto doubled and scored on Rusty Greer's double, his third
of the game. But the Rangers couldn't make it stand up.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland got in trouble by walking Scott Hatteberg with one out
and giving up a two-out single to Offerman. Gilkey then reached
with a high chopper that Clayton bobbled in his glove while trying
to deal with a tricky hop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got caught in between,'' Clayton said. ``I knew I didn't
have much time and I bobbled it just a little. But he busted his
tail and just beat it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland forced in a run when he hit Carl Everett on the wrist,
and Lansing then smashed his double to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get much better than this,'' Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Oates can only wonder if it will get any worse.

EDITORIAL: MR. GORE STEPS FORWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Aug. 18:
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore accepted the Democratic presidential
nomination on Thursday night with a forceful address designed to
humanize him to the voters and to accelerate his drive to free
himself from the understudy's role. Imploring Americans to take a
fresh look at his life experiences and values, Gore issued a
calculated declaration of independence from President Clinton.
``We're electing a new president, and I stand here tonight as my
own man,'' he asserted, promising to fight against ``powerful
forces'' on behalf of working Americans. And in a striking,
unmistakable reference to the scandals of recent years, he drew a
thunderous ovation by promising, ``I will work for you every day
and I will never let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the center of Gore's sales pitch invoked the Clinton
administration's economic record and laid out a budgetary approach
that will clearly be a main theme of his campaign against Gov.
George W. Bush. The vice president repeatedly hammered Bush as
someone who would squander the surplus on ``a huge tax cut for the
wealthy.'' Just as ardently he portrayed himself, over and over, as
someone who would ``fight for working families.'' He argued that
the current economic abundance had brought an extraordinary
opportunity to address the ills of American society.
</P>
<P>
   Racing through his speech and sometimes even stepping on his own
applause lines, he offered an unusually detailed outline of the
case for using the budget surplus to save Social Security and
Medicare, provide prescription drugs to the elderly and offer
limited tax cuts to help the middle class pay for college and
health care. In a sense it was like a State of the Union address,
but with an almost bellicose declaration that ``for all our good
times, I am not satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not enter the Staples Center in Los Angeles with
Clinton's gladiatorial dash through the corridors. Instead he came
down an aisle as a determined underdog with a clear tactical
mission. His campaign hopes the traditional convention ``bounce''
will put him within a few points of Bush just as voters start to
focus on the issues. The paradox is that voters do side with Gore
on many issues he emphasized on Thursday night, particularly the
economy and social concerns like gun control, abortion rights and
protecting the environment. But to the dismay of Democrats, their
agreement has not translated into political dominance or public
acclaim for him.
</P>
<P>
   The twin goals of Gore's acceptance speech were clear. He was
inviting listeners to look beyond the candidates' personalities to
the issues that would make them very different presidents. He also
hopes that the voters will rethink the stereotype of him as an
automaton more comfortable with abstractions than with the everyday
worries that Clinton empathized with, almost to the point of
self-parody. Trying to turn his political defects into virtues, the
vice president acknowledged that ``sometimes people say I'm too
serious.'' But one of his biggest ovations came when he declared:
``The presidency is more than a popularity contest. It's a
day-by-day fight for people.'' In a kind of homage to his father's
New Deal economic populism, Gore introduced members of the audience
who he said deserved fairer, more caring treatment from a
government that should not bestow undeserved tax-cut windfalls on
the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of the Democrats' hanging out at movie studios, it
was striking how Gore tried to appeal to Americans alienated from
the content of popular entertainment. Echoing the longstanding
campaign of both his wife, Tipper, and his running mate, Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, he declared that ``we must challenge a culture
with too much meanness, and not enough meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   It was said by Gore's staff that the vice president, a former
newspaper reporter, had written his speech himself, and the address
seemed to galvanize him. It drew waves of ovations from an audience
that sometimes appeared impressed that he was trying _ often
successfully _ to rise above his usual plodding delivery. Gore
clearly did what he needed to do and impressed and perhaps
surprised his audience in the process. He moved his party to
full-throated support, and he sharply defined the battle lines for
what could now turn into a close race over real policy differences.

BEFORE THE COWBOYS BREAK CAMP, OWNER JERRY JONES WEIGHS IN ON
SEVERAL TOPICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Cowboys owner Jerry Jones didn't exactly
turn off the lights and shut the door on Camp Campo, which is
scheduled to break this morning, very likely for the last time ever
at Midwestern State University.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones did stop to discuss the state of the team before
pulling out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Jones discussed the dynamics of NFL training camps, the perils
of the NFL salary cap and the accomplishments of Camp Campo.
</P>
<P>
   He raised the issue of the Cowboys' front seven serving as a
safety net for an unproven secondary, and said he hopes to have
Houston's expansion team on the Cowboys' schedule as a
nondivisional, geographic rival every season, beginning in 2002,
when the NFL is expected to realign into eight four-team divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ST: Why have training camp and why does it have to be so long?
</P>
<P>
   JJ: ``For young players, it's really a way to evaluate how bad
they want it. It's a way to evaluate how they will perform under
extreme conditions, and these are extreme conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   ST: Is it a good idea to reduce the preseason, or at least
shorten training camp for veteran players?
</P>
<P>
   JJ: ``Yes, it is. I think it's just common sense. We don't want
to wear the players out so bad in preseason that when we get into
November and December, that they've left \Rtheir game\S on the
practice field in August and late July. But I don't quite know how
you solve the problem of getting in hard work for the young guys
and letting up on the veteran players.''
</P>
<P>
   ST: Did you accomplish everything you had hoped to accomplish in
this camp?
</P>
<P>
   JJ: ``I really couldn't have asked for anything more. We were
able to evaluate our young players. We were able to do the
fundamental things ...\R such as\S getting down the timing between
Troy Aikman and the receivers. I think we also were able to see how
we might tailor this offense to Randall Cunningham when he's in
there. I really like the way Jackie Harris has established himself;
I see us moving him around. I couldn't have asked for Chris Warren
to have had a better camp than he had. Erik Williams is in \Rafter
a four-week holdout\S, and with enough time to get in enough work
to be what we want him to be. \RGuard\S Kelvin Garmon has shown us
that he's going to be the future. Yes, we've gotten a lot
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   ST: Arkansas rookie Clint Stoerner looks as though he will be
the No. 3 quarterback. How do you like what you see?
</P>
<P>
   JJ: ``I'm particularly pleased with his presence on the field,
and the respect that players have for him. He fits just right. He's
Texas-born and went to Arkansas. That fits my plan real well.
Seriously, he's shown good poise, arm strength and quickness of
delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   ST: Top draft pick Dwayne Goodrich struggled early, now he's
injured. How concerned are you about his progress?
</P>
<P>
   JJ: ``Concerned that he has been limited, but that's the nature
of this game. We're going to see him when he's well. He'll be here,
and we'll get a good look at him. I like the idea of these young
players who are the future for the Dallas Cowboys. Our front seven
has a chance to be one of the best. That's going to help these
young guys in the secondary. So, I'm OK there.''
</P>
<P>
   ST: Are you where you thought you would be with the salary cap,
say, five years ago?
</P>
<P>
   JJ: ``We are. This is a constant challenge, but there are no
surprises here. A couple of things could've happened differently,
and we might have had a little more \Rcap\S room. A couple of
things could've happened negatively, and we'd be in a lot worse
shape than we are right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ST: Your longtime NFC nemesis San Francisco mortgaged the
future. Some say the Redskins are going to be next. What's your
philosophy on going for broke _ literally _ to try to win another
Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   JJ: ``Over-extending yourself now so that you can't compete
later, that's madness. I've never done that in any business. I'm a
gambler ... but, at the same time, I've always been able to live
with the down side. I may pout. I may cry. But I live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ST: Houston returns to the NFL as the Texans in 2002. Should a
geographical rivalry be established with the Cowboys?
</P>
<P>
   JJ: ``Yes, I think that would be good for the league. I think it
would make great television. If, in any way, I can extend the
positiveness and tradition of the Dallas Cowboys in such a way to
give credibility to the new Houston franchise, I want to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ST: Bush or Gore? Who do you endorse?
</P>
<P>
   JJ: ``That's not appropriate. With as many Democrat and
Republican Cowboys fans as we have, we don't get involved in
politics.'' nn

POOR MAN'S POLITICAL POLL: FINAL NUMBERS: CLINTON 25, LIEBERMAN 15,
GORE 5 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to insert new second item, Doing the Hokey Hokey.)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB AND ELISABETH BUMILLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Can political star power be measured by parking
lot rates? If so, Al Gore may have reason to worry.
</P>
<P>
   One of the outdoor parking lots closest to the convention has
altered its rates on a daily basis. On the day President Clinton
spoke, the lot charged $25. The Joseph Lieberman night resulted in
a discounted parking rate of $15. Thursday, the biggest and final
day of the convention, when the presidential candidate, Al Gore,
spoke to the delegates, parking lot rates tumbled. All-day parking
cost only $5.
</P>
<P>
   Doing the Hokey Hokey
</P>
<P>
   It was an hour before the biggest speech of Al Gore's life. The
packed Democratic National Convention was pulsing with energy. The
crowd waited. But then the convention's planners began an
Oprah-style tribute to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And no one listened.
</P>
<P>
   The stage presentation featured among others David Halberstam,
the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who talked about Gore's
family and The Tennessean, the Nashville newspaper where he and
Gore once worked. There were also tributes to Gore as a
mountaineer, a man of religion, a soldier, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The tribute was designed to depict Gore as warm, gutsy and
accessible. But it went on and on.
</P>
<P>
   And on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear it,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear it,'' said Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the
New York state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really listen to it,'' said Christine Quinn, a New
York City councilwoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it's hokey,'' said Jaynne Keyes, a former New York City
film commissioner. ``But three-fourths of America is hokey, and
proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Guy in Gore's Shadow
</P>
<P>
   Now that Al Gore is the Democratic Party's new leading man, what
happens to the big guy still on stage in the White House? At a
raucous reunion party late Wednesday in West Hollywood for past and
present Clinton staffers, Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman,
said that the president would be out fund-raising for Gore ``a
couple of times a week'' between now and the election.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Clinton's role in the Gore campaign is undecided _
and a big source of debate here. Will Clinton's presence on the
campaign trail strengthen Gore, or dwarf him? ``The president can
raise money and raise issues, but otherwise he ought not to be out
there campaigning,'' said Paul Begala, the former Clinton adviser,
who turned up at the party at Manhattan Wonton Co., a restaurant on
Melrose Place. `He would tend to distract and overshadow.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton would do whatever the Gore campaign
wanted, which, a Gore adviser said, will be trips to the South, to
black communities and to California _ places where he is popular.
Clinton is also speaking nearly every day to his old friend,
William Daley, the Gore-Lieberman campaign manager. Offering
political advice, yes? Lockhart wouldn't say, but Begala, a veteran
of the 1992 Clinton campaign offered this: `In 1992 there was
always a creative tension between the people who were hired to run
the campaign and the person who wanted to run the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghost of Elvis?
</P>
<P>
   He was Elvis in feathers one night, the serious guy on the
podium the next. Although Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana's biggest
role here was nominating Lieberman in a speech at the convention
Wednesday night, it was hard to forget his far more mesmerizing
appearance here: As an Elvis look-alike in white tights, big white
collar and purple, green and gold feathers at an over-the-top faux
Fat Tuesday party at Paramount Studios. The party, estimated to
cost $500,000, was paid for by the Democratic Leadership Council
and many of the companies Breaux helps to regulate on the finance
and commerce committees.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said Thursday that his costume was not, in fact, Elvis,
but a traditional Mardi Gras outfit that was `just Breaux being
Breaux.'' He also said that `there are some people in New York who
might think that's a little bit of an unusual costume for a U.S.
senator, but it's perfectly acceptable back home.''
</P>
<P>
   New Kosher Kid on the Block
</P>
<P>
   Kosher food for the Liebermans? No issue, said Wolfgang Puck,
the premier chef of Los Angeles, who has catered dozens of
convention parties in the last few days. Puck said he had not yet
specifically made dinner for Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, who
keep kosher. ``But,'' he said, ``there's no difficulty at all _ I
cook for a lot of customers who have kosher homes and they eat some
white fish, some vegetables, some fruit. They don't eat butter and
cream with meat. You avoid these.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Orthodox Jews, like the Liebermans, either avoid
restaurants at any cost, or even bring their own plates out of
concern that restaurant dishes, however clean, had been used in the
past for nonkosher food. But the Connecticut Democrat has eaten at
numerous receptions here and dines at at trendy places in
Washington, like I Ricci. One of his friends said, ``He eats salad
and fish _ no big deal. He has bread. And he's a stickler for
kosher wine _ that's what he drinks when he has wine. Of course, he
wouldn't be caught dead at a steak place like The Palm or Smith &AMP;
Wollensky.''
</P>
<P>
   Puck, owner of Spago and other restaurants, said jokingly that
while providing food for the Liebermans would pose no difficulties,
the hungry delegates were another matter. ``They like to eat, they
really like to eat, much more than people do in L.A.,'' he said.
``In L.A., with the movie people, they take a little food, a little
mineral water, sometimes a glass of champagne. But these delegates
are something else. They enjoy their food! I like that. We had a
dinner the other night at Spago. Eight hundred were supposed to
show. Well, 1,800 showed. I was shocked. They kept coming and they
kept eating. That's the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP Spin Squad
</P>
<P>
   Republicans? At the Democratic convention?
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like the people who were entering `Checkpoint
Charlie,' it's kind of like going into East Germany,'' said Rick
Wilson, a consultant to the Republican National Committee who has
been in town for the last week with a half-dozen members of the GOP
shmoozing the press at the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   Were the Republicans spinning the news? ``I prefer to call it
`rapid response,' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican spinners included Gov. Christie Whitman of New
Jersey, Rep. Henry Bonilla of Texas, Jim Nicholson, chairman of the
Republican National Committee, and Pat Harrison, co-chairman. The
group operated from a small suite opposite the Staples Center, and
fanned out each day, sometimes wearing press passes, walking the
corridors and talking to journalists and radio correspondents about
the inadequacies of the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican convention in Philadelphia, the Democrats had
a similar squad, but their members were sometimes harder to spot.
The Republican group here wore pins reading: ``Bush/Cheney.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said the week passed perfectly pleasantly for the
interlopers. ``Actually we were treated kind of well by the
Democrats,'' Harrison said, sounding a bit puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   Pity the Poor Millionaire
</P>
<P>
   One-two-three. Everyone. Let's all feel sorry for the
millionaires at the Democratic Party. While billionaires like Eli
Broad, one of the Democrats' most generous patrons, seem to have no
complaints about how the party is falling all over itself with VIP
treatment, the lesser contributors are another matter. Lesser means
those who have given only, say, $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   As rich as these donors are, the red carpet is looking a bit
frayed to them. The computers were down when they checked into the
five-star Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, their parking passes and
convention center credentials were not ready, their skyboxes at the
convention had been commandeered by Democratic officials and their
parties, which they initially assumed would be exclusive affairs,
turned out to be grossly oversubscribed and seemed, at times, like
the subway at rush hour in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   One party fund-raiser heard a torrent of complaints from one big
donor and suggested that the unhappy millionaire speak to the party
leadership. ``He said to me, `who am I going to complain to? This
whole thing is being run by a bunch of 23-year-old kids.'''
</P>
<P>
   One-two-three. Everyone. Let's all feel sorry ...

MAVERICKS HOPE NEW UNIFORMS WILL SHOW ENERGY, ENTHUSIASM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN WOOD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Mavericks are developing a new team logo that
features a horse instead of a cowboy hat and swaps the team's
green, blue and white color combination with a black, blue and
silver scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, team officials will meet with representatives from
the NBA and Nike, which makes the team's uniforms, to review the
first round of creative work on the new look.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want the look to have a lot of energy, a lot of
attitude,'' said Matt Fitzgerald, senior vice president of
marketing and communications for the Mavericks. ``You want an
exciting color scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said the Mavericks will change their 20-year-old
image for the 2001-02 season, which will be their first in the new
American Airlines Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That logo is not a maverick,'' he said of the team's current
symbol. ``Our colors will be blue, black and silver.''
</P>
<P>
   The team has submitted proposed changes to the league and will
continue to work with league designers to refine them throughout
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes at least a year and a half to two years,'' said Chris
Heyn, senior vice president of the NBA's global merchandising
group. ``It's a long, thought-out process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have had basically the same look since the team
entered the league in 1980. They switched from green road uniforms
to blue road uniforms in the early 1990s. Otherwise, there have
been few changes beyond the look of the lettering.
</P>
<P>
   But the team has been making numerous changes since the
franchise was purchased earlier this year by Internet entrepreneur
Mark Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really kind of symbolized who the owner was at the time,''
Fitzgerald said. ``Mr. \RDonald\S Carter wears a white hat. Reunion
Arena was kind of a green, blue combination. It hasn't changed in
20 years. It's just become a tired mark in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   The league has been working with teams in the past decade to
update their looks. Teams such as the Denver Nuggets, Detroit
Pistons, Golden State Warriors, Houston Rockets and Seattle
SuperSonics have all gone through logo changes that reflect a
certain amount of brand consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely what we're looking for right now is consistency
with a classic edge,'' Heyn said. ``We're not changing but evolving
that brand for that team. It's important for us to keep up to
date.''
</P>
<P>
   League rules dictate that if a team changes its logo, it can't
change again for eight years. It can change uniforms every four
years. ``The last thing we want to do is send so many mixed
messages from a team that the fans are turned off or confused,''
Heyn said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Mavericks merchandise have been disappointing, given
the team's dismal play in the 1990s. Fitzgerald said he did not
have the figures on where the team ranked in the league for
merchandise sales. But based on what they sell during games,
Fitzgerald said the team has to be ``near the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The logo makes it look like this is a laid-back cowboy town,''
he said. ``This town is not like that. It's a bold town. You try to
incorporate the attitude of the team, and that's what we're trying
to do in our new mark. You need a winning team and you need some
cool stuff.''

ONUS ON RANGERS' OWNER TO MAKE CRUCIAL WINTER DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rangers are a bad baseball team right now, and it has little
to do with catcher Ivan Rodriguez's being lost for the season. The
Rangers miss him terribly, but it's doubtful that the best catcher
in baseball could do anything to stop this free fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler is on a rampage, and Rick Helling has turned into
one of the best pitchers in the American League. But hitting coach
Rudy Jaramillo still has a lot of work ahead of him with Mike Lamb
and Ricky Ledee; the great experiment with young pitching has not
been an instant success; and many of the veteran players are in a
funk while wondering where this franchise is headed.
</P>
<P>
   The usual ``good nucleus'' will still be there next year, but
the Rangers' dismal showing since the All-Star break strongly
suggests this team is not as close to a pennant contender as people
think. The Rangers have a difficult decision facing them in the
off-season, and it's one that can't be made by general manager Doug
Melvin or manager Johnny Oates.
</P>
<P>
   The man on the spot will be the owner himself, Tom Hicks. Only
Hicks can decide if he's willing to spend huge amounts of dollars
to try to compete with the New York Yankees, or if he would rather
sit through another trying season waiting for his young players to
develop.
</P>
<P>
   When the accountants finish their work this year, the Rangers
likely will spend $40 million to $44 million less on salaries this
year than the Yankees. That's a staggering amount considering Hicks
isn't one to be frugal. But $40 million also could be exactly what
Hicks will have to fork over this winter for the starting pitcher,
power hitter and front-line closer the Rangers need to close the
gap.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if the Rangers were able to sway Mike Hampton,
Manny Ramirez and Robb Nen to come to Texas, it still would be no
guarantee a pennant will be flying in Arlington at the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that. The Rangers could spend $100 million next year
on player salaries and still not be good enough to win the AL West,
much less the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Seattle and Chicago have proved, as the Rangers have
in the past, that you can win in the regular season without
spending in the Yankees' class. But the playoffs have proved to be
a totally different story.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks also could decide to take pretty much the same team into
next year with only a few cosmetic changes. They still would have
the same three young pitchers in Matt Perisho, Doug Davis and Ryan
Glynn, but they would have them for a full year, along with a
healthy Justin Thompson and a healthy Darren Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy also would give Kapler a chance to develop into a
true star, give Lamb an opportunity to make less errors and drive
in more runs, and provide Ruben Mateo a chance to finally stay
healthy for a season. That might be the best way to go as far as
the long-term success of the organization, but the Rangers would
have to do so knowing it will be difficult competing against the
best in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Melvin's philosophy of trying to be as competitive
as possible each year without sacrificing the future too much.
Melvin has proved adept at doing that, as shown by three division
titles in four years. One shrewd trade with the Arizona
Diamondbacks could get Curt Schilling here at the bargain price of
$6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin is a firm believer that if you keep winning division
titles and keep making the playoffs, eventually you're going to win
a pennant and maybe even the World Series. He refers to it as his
Denver Broncos theory, in honor of the long-suffering John Elway,
who finally was rewarded for his perseverance with back-to-back
Super Bowl victories.
</P>
<P>
   But NFL teams don't have to deal with a $40 million gap in
payrolls. Hicks does, and this winter only he can decide what he's
going to do about it.

   LOS ANGELES _ in culture war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 1992 in reverse,'' said Leonard Williams, a political
scientist at Manchester College in North Manchester, Ind. ``The
Republicans are willing to submerge their differences to get behind
a candidate that can win. The Democrats were more willing to do
that when they were desperate to get back in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Appealing to independents will be difficult and could take
longer than just the Democrats' four-day convention, Bruce
Buchanan, the Texas political scientist, said. Gore must deal with
what Buchanan called his ``LL'' problem _ Gore's perceived lack of
leadership and likability. Undecided voters won't listen to Gore's
message, he said, if they don't like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has made this about leadership and likability. He's got
that advantage,'' Buchanan said. ``Unless Gore can neutralize that
advantage, Gore will be unable to change the subject to policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among the hard-core Democrats at the convention, there is a
realization of campaign work to be done, and that the lease on the
White House does not get renewed automatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``With party people, there is the understanding that the
presidency tends to turn over from one party to the other every
eight years,'' said Mary Ellen Miller, a Democratic political
strategist from Blue Springs, Mo. ``That's something we've got to
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Collins, president of the Missouri Education Association
and a middle school teacher from Grandview, senses her allies came
into the convention ``well, lackadaisical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she said, ``the enthusiasm and urgency grew during the
week.''

CRITICS NOTEBOOK: GORE'S LIGHTER SIDE STILL LARGELY HIDDEN FROM THE
CAMERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to correct spelling to Malkovich in 4th graf.) 
By CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If you entrust me with the presidency, I know I won't always
be the most exciting politician,'' Al Gore said as he ended his
acceptance speech with what seemed, after months of wrestling with
the issue, a defiant acknowledgment of fact. Even in a speech
declaring himself a man of the future, he was conspicuously
uncomfortable as a media candidate. Watching his acceptance was
like watching the televised version of a stage play, the kind in
which the cameras stand back and put the television audience in the
position of distant voyeurs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore nodded as he looked out over the crowd, as if he could
connect with individuals in that vast room; that was an effective
performance in itself. Yet when he looked toward the camera, he
actually seemed to be looking into the teleprompter. And a
convincing performance once removed is not what a television
campaign needs.
</P>
<P>
   His one hour in prime time had been preceded by two days of
character witnesses, as family and friends appeared in an endless
loop of interviews on the morning shows, late shows, and everywhere
in between. More than once, Tipper Gore and Tommy Lee Jones blamed
the office of the vice presidency for Gore's much-talked-about
stiffness. He had been standing so loyally in the background, they
argued, that of course he couldn't seem as lively as he was in
private. In his speech Thursday night, when he said his mother was
from a town named Cold Corner, you could almost imagine them
protesting, ``Don't say cold! He's not cold!''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the most effective view of the human side of Gore came
from a short biographical film made for the campaign by Spike
Jonze, the director who got his start in music videos before making
the sly film ``Being John Malkovich.'' Jonze is a master of
meticulous films that create the illusion of looseness, and he used
the intimacy of hand-held cameras, and smooth editing that looked
tossed together, to re-create the Gore image.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, the vice president is seen with his family, walking
through the woods of Tennessee, making funny faces (well, not that
funny) at his grandson, and singing (off key) a jingle from one of
his father's old campaigns. ``Vote for Gore, vote for Gore, He's
wise and able, And he's just forty four.'' Tipper Gore talks about
their first date. ``Was I a little stiff?'' he asks. ``Not at
all,'' she says and they kiss for the camera. That of course was
the message, which Gore made explicit. ``I'm a lot more comfortable
with the idea of rolling up my sleeves and making the system work
than I am with campaigning,'' he said in the film.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jonze film was almost sneaked on the air at an
especially off time, 7:30 Tuesday night, as if it were being
tested. It was carried only by MSNBC and CSPAN then, but popped up
over the next 24 hours on ABC's ``Nightline'' and ``Good Morning
America,'' and on CNN. Something similar in prime time might have
gone a long way toward delivering on the promise of showing a new,
warmer Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Tipper Gore introduced her husband Thursday night with
a typically homogenized campaign film, loaded with sentiment and
family photographs. The cable news channels, along with PBS and
NBC, carried that film, while CBS, ABC and CBS replaced it with
their own fuller reports, complete with references to the Buddhist
temple fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign is not about the gestures I make in an
interview,'' Gore said in a clip in the ABC report, but of course
campaigning is largely about imagery. If not, his family wouldn't
have worked overtime to create the warm gestures for him. He needed
that long smooch with Tipper on the podium Thursday night to
suggest a warmth he will never display on his own.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, watching both conventions was like watching a less
lively, political version of ``Jurassic Park,'' with two dinosaurs
colliding. The networks _ the dinosaurs of the television world
compared to cable news _ are cowering and cutting back coverage
while wondering how to deal with the conventions, those dinosaurs
of the political world. Even Clinton advisers like Harold Ickes,
interviewed on CNN, and Leon Panetta, on MSNBC, said the convention
should be cut back to two days. And we know what happened to all
those dinosaurs.

GORE STRIKES A CHORD WITH DEMOCRATIC DELEGATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE AND SCOTT CANON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Republicans left their national convention in
Philadelphia convinced their nominee would be the next president of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Democrats fly from Los Angeles confident of having a
winner but conscious that it will take some work.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for their optimism was Gore's acceptance
speech on Thursday, in which he focused on working families.
</P>
<P>
   ``So often, powerful forces and powerful interests stand in your
way, and the odds seem stacked against you, even as you do what's
right for you and your family. How and what we do for all of
you...that is the standard by which we should be judged.''
</P>
<P>
   One piece of bad news for Vice President Al Gore as the
convention drew to a close were reports out of Washington that the
independent counsel had empaneled a new grand jury to investigate
President Clinton. The news could make it even more difficult for
Gore to escape Clinton's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Still the race between Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush
remains a work in progress. The polls are all over the lot. Voters
remain largely uninterested and may not tune in for weeks. And any
issue that's going to decide the race still isn't apparent.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the Democrats have largely matched their Republican
rivals in staging a highly scripted, finely calculated convention.
Both major parties have been able to reshape their gatherings into
large-scale promotional efforts that cloak intramural strains.
</P>
<P>
   ``You expect (the Democratic convention) to be a little more
casual, a little less manageable,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a
University of Texas political scientist. ``Nobody regards that as
any special problem.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the Democrats faced more obstacles in presenting an
unfettered message to the American people. There were questions
about how much President Clinton's presence would diminish Gore's
promotion to party leader.
</P>
<P>
   African-American delegates wondered aloud about
vice-presidential nominee Joseph Lieberman's commitment to concerns
such as affirmative action. The Teamsters union, an important
segment of the labor constituency, still hasn't endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And the vice president faced new questions about his viability.
A USA Today//CNN poll released on the convention's opening day
showed that 47 percent of likely voters across the country had
decided that they definitely would not support him.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the controversy was expected. This was, after all, a
Democratic convention, and Democrats have a reputation for laying
out their disagreements for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan Voter.com poll released Thursday morning showed
Gore making some progress, but there was still a considerable
distance between him and Bush. If the election were held today,
voters told the survey, 48 percent would back Bush, 37 percent
Gore, 3 percent Green Party nominee Ralph Nader and 2 percent
Reform Party nominee Patrick Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The poll Thursday of 1,000 likely voters found Bush leading in
one key swing group: married, white, working women by a 2-to-1
ratio. However, it also showed Gore gaining in the Midwest, where
several crucial states are perceived to be in play. And in general,
independents have been moving toward the Democrat during his
convention, and he may be winning some Nader supporters back to his
camp.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Democrats said their goal was to leave with the
race tied up. In the wake of the Republican convention, pollsters
had Bush leading by double-digit margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this race to be back inside the margin of error,''
said Joe Andrew, national chairman of the Democratic National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, meantime, were confident that Bush was still the
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Duwe, a spokesman for the Missouri GOP, said Thursday that
he was more confident of a November win than he had been before the
Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hear a mainstream-type of message coming out of that
convention,'' Duwe said. ``They just can't resist going back to
their liberal base.''
</P>
<P>
   A better read will come about 10 days from now, when the
electorate has had time to digest the events of the two
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, the Republicans had the luxury of appealing to
independent and undecided voters, because the GOP base stood firmly
behind Bush. In Los Angeles, Democrats faced the twin tasks of
pursuing those same centrist voters and shoring up wayward party
members.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats sought to appease their liberal base by devoting
much of Tuesday night to party stalwarts such as the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, former Sen. Bill Bradley and Sen. Ted Kennedy. In
contrast, the Republicans made no such appeal, and conservative
party leaders were largely confined to the sidelines at the GOP
convention.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Lieberman had what appeared to be a successful
meeting with black delegates that apparently quelled any lingering
resentments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have your questions, and you want them answered,'' said
the Rev. Nelson Thompson, a delegate from Kansas City. ``But he
answered them, and we have all rallied around Joe Lieberman.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lieberman repeated the Clinton administration's pledge
to ``mend, don't end'' affirmative action, and black leaders
appeared to drop their reservations about the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Intraparty complications like that conjure memories of the
Republicans' 1992 convention, when President George Bush talked of
a ``kinder and gentler nation'' while Pat Buchanan shouted that the
country was locked in culture war. MORE

ANALYSIS: A MAN OF MANY TASKS TRIES TO RALLY HIS DECIDEDLY JITTERY
PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (Subs for rewriting thruout, new headline)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Al Gore tried to accomplish a political feat so
daunting Thursday night that even the maestro himself, President
Clinton, might have had trouble pulling it off.
</P>
<P>
   Gore presented himself as his own man and virtually skated over
his service as vice president as he sought to convince the nation
that he is more than the dutiful lieutenant. But he also tried to
take credit for helping to bring about ``the biggest surpluses
ever'' _ the grandest achievement of the Clinton era.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to shake the impressions of Americans who, in the words
of his campaign chairman, think he is ``boring, stiff'' and
``unable to speak.'' But he also asserted that he would build a
campaign based on the dry timber of issues rather than on the flash
and dazzle of personality.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to embolden and excite liberals whose turnout are
essential to his victory. But he also tried, though less
aggressively, to embolden and excite moderate voters who are
crucial to a victory in November _ and have shown an interest in
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas that has alarmed Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's elaborate _ and often conflicting _ objectives Thursday
night, and throughout this convention week, reflect the trying
challenges he and the Democrats confront as they emerge from this
convention. Forget the confetti and mirthful talk of harmony from
the rostrum. For the Democrats, happy days are certainly not here
again. They may not be panicked, but they are jittery about their
standard-bearer. And they are jittery about November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a difficult campaign,'' said James Patrick Leahy, a
delegate from Ohio, even after four days of enforced partisan
cheerleading. ``Gore has one of those personalities you have to
develop a relationship with.''
</P>
<P>
   The polls showing Gore behind, Leahy said, have dampened his
enthusiasm. ``The polling has a psychological effect,'' he said.
``It's like when you go to the racetrack and look at the racing
form and see your horse isn't supposed to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no such worries when the Republicans concluded their
political production in Philadelphia two weeks ago. At that
convention, Dick Cheney, the vice presidential nominee, did not
have to scurry from constituent group to constituent group with
words of appeasement _ as Sen. Joseph Lieberman did Thursday, and
the two days before.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years on the outside, even Republican delegates who
were not pleased with the inclusive tone of their program were so
desperate to return to power that it took little, if any, prodding
to corral them behind Bush. Eight years ago, Democrats were also
willing to put aside their differences in the name of the greater
goal of helping Bill Clinton bring them back to power. Now, they
are less accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   So the party tried to fire up the rank and file by jamming the
stage this week with liberal icons like Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and leaders of labor, abortion rights and
gay rights groups. Even Lieberman, in his speech, retreated from
his usual condemnation of the collapsed culture of Hollywood and
instead played the partisan. And Thursday night, Gore aimed his
message squarely at the party base _ and away from the broader
messages of Clinton's two acceptance speeches _ by sounding
traditional Democratic themes of abortion, affirmative action and
government spending.
</P>
<P>
   More than one Democratic official complained that the campaign
this week seemed more focused on winning over the liberals who
might back Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, than the bigger
threat, Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans played to the country _ the Democrats played
to the hall,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ``Voters
saw through the big tent Republican convention. They know it was
staged. But they were thankful that somebody cared.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's address was carefully calibrated to offer a nod to the
man with whom he has such a complicated relationship _ and to move
on swiftly. In the 5,100-word text, the vice president mentioned
Clinton only once, declaring, ``Millions of Americans will live
better lives for a long time to come because of the job that's been
done by President Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   He also, subtly, sought to put some distance between himself and
a leader who had disappointed, if not embarrassed, the nation. ``I
will never let you down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The unknowing listener would not have a clue of what arguably
makes Gore best prepared to be president: That he has served the
past eight years as vice president. The thinking of Gore's campaign
is that no matter how active a political partner he was, voters
will never give a vice president credit.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is Gore. Whether it is his link to the
scandals of Clinton, the unfavorable comparisons to the more
politically adroit president _ or simply his personality _
Democrats here are just not as enamored of their new nominee. On
this day four years ago, even the bombshell that Clinton's top
strategist was having an affair with a call girl did nothing to
disrupt _ and maybe added a little spice _ to the week of lock-step
partisan harmony behind the president.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before his boss was to deliver the most consequential
speech of his political career, one of Gore's top aides confessed
that he was worried because the campaign was still roiled by
squabbling factions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Daley has not gotten the warlords under control yet,''
this campaign official said, referring to William M. Daley, Gore's
campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident, certainly, that Gore spewed out lots of
policy Thursday night. He was trying to make the case that ``people
deserve to know specifically what a candidate proposes to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of polls showing that the public gives Democrats higher
marks than Republicans on a range of issues, Gore's aides said they
hope the campaign can be fought on that terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Before he can do that, Gore wants to neutralize Bush's biggest
advantage _ his appealing personality. That explains that footage
in a film Friday night lauding Gore for his Frankenstein disguise
during a Halloween party. That is why all week Democrats, and the
candidate himself, offered testaments to the fuzzy and decidedly
un-vice presidential side of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made only glancing blows at the Republicans and he did not
directly cite his opponent by name even once. But clearly
acknowledging that Bush had the edge on charm, Gore said, ``The
presidency is not a popularity contest. It's a day-by-day fight for
people. Sometimes, you have to chose to do what's difficult or
unpopular. Sometimes you have to be willing to spend your
popularity in order to pick the hard right over the easy wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then-Vice President George Bush, in his acceptance speech
in New Orleans in 1988, did not face the difficulties of Gore. He,
too, had the unfortunate fate of having to stand on his own after
eight years in the shadow of a far more dexterous political
performer. But Bush never had such trouble untangling himself from
Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The symbolic transfer of political power was far smoother in
1988 when Reagan put forth a dignified and full-throated pitch for
his No. 2. This week, Clinton was criticized for not making more of
an energetic case for Gore in his speech here on Monday _ or in
their joint appearance in Michigan the next day. The rub is that
had he been more generous in his praise, Clinton might have been
accused of injecting himself too much into the role of star
performer giving an assist to his understudy.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Thursday night, Gore seemed to borrow a bit from
the playbook of the man whose son is standing in his way to the
White House. He addressed the personality issue head on, saying,
``If you entrust me with the presidency, I know I won't always be
the most exciting politician.'' But in what could be interpreted as
a dig at Bush _ who is known as less engaged on the issues than
Gore _ he pledged, ``I will work for you every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Bush said in 1988: ``I may not be the most eloquent,
but I learned that eloquence won't draw oil from the ground. I may
sometimes be a little awkward, but there's nothing self-conscious
in my love of country.''And, as Bush did 12 years ago, Gore sought
to fasten himself to the economic successes of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that the appeal will work and, as happened with
Bush, that people will entrust Gore to continue bringing the nation
down the path of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But in a telling acknowledgment that the campaign ahead will not
be easy, Gore's aides were already playing down the import of
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important moment, a crescendo,'' said Tad Devine,
one of Gore's top strategists. `` But there will be other big
moments in this campaign, including the presidential debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, though, Gore will run out of big moments. And
Thursday night may have been his best opportunity to accomplish
what he has tried again and again in this race for president: to
reintroduce himself to the people.

MAN BECOMES FIRST TO BE RELEASED FROM KANSAS' SEXUAL PREDATOR
PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. _ Former Olathe resident Jerry P. Inman on Thursday
became the first person to be released from Kansas' sexual predator
program since it began in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He will remain under the scrutiny of court officials for at
least five years and will be subject to annual polygraph tests and
continued psychological counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Inman, 51, who plans to leave Kansas, also signed an agreement
not to fight extradition to the state if he violates any of the
conditions of his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to get on with my life,'' he said Thursday after a
hearing in Johnson County District Court. ``I'm happy to be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   His release was nearly held up Thursday when the director of the
predator program said Inman had failed to achieve a ``clean
polygraph result.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin DesLauriers said that although Inman's answers appeared
to be deceitful on two points, there was no suspicion that he had
been involved in any ``sexual misbehavior.''
</P>
<P>
   District Judge Peter Ruddick said he was satisfied that Inman's
problems with the polygraph test should not block his release
because they were not related to issues of sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   Inman said he would be living and working on a farm outside
Kansas. He said he had arranged for therapy with a psychologist who
will provide annual reports to the court.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three convicted sex offenders are being held in Kansas'
predator unit, based in the Larned Correctional Mental Health
Facility.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas lawmakers approved the predator legislation in 1994,
after a convicted rapist who had been released from prison killed
college student Stephanie Schmidt of Leawood, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows the state to hold some sex offenders indefinitely
for treatment after they have completed their prison terms. The
Kansas Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional, but the
U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the predator law, legislators approved the state's
Sex Offender Registration Act. It requires virtually all people
convicted of committing sex crimes after the law took effect in
1994 to register with the sheriff in the county where they reside.
</P>
<P>
   The information is available to the public in each sheriff's
office and is also maintained on the Kansas Bureau of
Investigation's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Inman would not have had to register as a sex offender because
he committed his crimes before the law took effect.
</P>
<P>
   He was committed to the predator unit in 1996 after a jury found
that he had a mental condition that made him likely to commit more
sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen women and girls testified at his predator trial
about his deviant sexual activities dating to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the girls testified that Inman molested them during
photographic modeling sessions in motel rooms. Others were
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County prosecutors filed the predator case in 1996 when
Inman was about to be paroled. He went to prison in 1994 after
pleading no contest to charges involving three victims.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, he became the first man in the predator unit to be
moved into the program's transitional release phase.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in a duplex on the state hospital grounds and worked on
the grounds. Inman and his attorney, Darrell Smith, argued for his
release from the program then, noting that he had received no
counseling during that time.
</P>
<P>
   In May, he was transferred to the Johnson County Community
Corrections residential center near Gardner, Kan., to complete the
transitional release phase.
</P>
<P>
   Inman on Thursday praised the staff at the residential center
but said no one from the predator program met with him while he was
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been dragging on longer than it had to be,'' Inman said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said part of the frustration was because Inman was the
first to get out and officials had to make release plans.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing Thursday, Smith said that Inman's release
shouldn't hinge on something as unreliable as a polygraph test.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason polygraphs are not admissible in court,''
Smith said. ``He'll take the test as many times as they want to
strap him into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Inman's release agreement will require an annual polygraph test
that he must pay for.
</P>
<P>
   He also agreed to keep a journal of his daily activities and a
record of people who can verify his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   He is not to have any involvement with pornography and have no
unsupervised contact with females under age 18. The judge said that
order should include online contacts such as chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Inman also will not be allowed to use photographic equipment
without court approval.

ANGELS GET LOST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's a good thing the Anaheim Angels had a bus driver
who knew the way back to the team hotel Thursday night. Left on
their own, they might have ended up somewhere in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the Angels were lost on the basepaths in a 6-1
setback to the Yankees before 35,180 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees starter Denny Neagle (3-3) gave up nine hits in 6
innings, but no Angel crossed the plate against him because of
baserunning errors worthy of a blooper reel. The Angels avoided a
shutout when Scott Spiezio hit a two-out, pinch homer in the ninth
off Jason Grimsley.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Kent Mercker, making his second start since
recovering from a brain hemorrhage, pitched well in five innings,
yielding two runs and three hits. Still on a limited pitch count,
Mercker (0-2) was removed after making 88 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' weary bullpen, now laden with minor-leaguers, gave
up four runs in three innings and allowed the Yankees to win
easily.
</P>
<P>
   The baserunning gaffes, though, hurt the Angels when they still
had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   They loaded the bases with one out in the second inning when
Darin Erstad hit a fly ball to medium-deep right field. Slow-footed
Bengie Molina tagged at third and began lumbering toward the plate
as right fielder David Justice made the catch and threw home.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway home, though, Molina put on the brakes and returned to
third, as instructed by third-base coach Ron Roenicke. Meanwhile,
Adam Kennedy retreated to second, but Benji Gil tagged at first and
raced toward second.
</P>
<P>
   After joining Kennedy at second, Gil was tagged out in a rundown
between first and second for the final out of the inning while
Molina stood motionless just a few feet from third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my head down to run hard once the throw went over
(cutoff man) Tino Martinez's head,'' Gil explained. ``I should have
looked to see where Adam was. That's why I was out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, the Angels put runners on first and third with
one out. Troy Glaus hit a sharp grounder down the line and inside
third. Yankees third baseman Scott Brosius made a diving,
back-handed grab of the ball, preventing it from going into left
field.
</P>
<P>
   But Gil froze at third, and Erstad, running from first, rounded
second too far and was thrown out for the second out of the inning.
Tim Salmon then struck out to end the inning, as the Angels went 2
for 10 with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I froze,'' Gil said. ``Once you freeze, it's hard to get going
again, even if you probably have time. Obviously I should have
scored on that play. I should have gone on contact. That's stuff
that shouldn't have happened. Unfortunately it happened more than
once today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We shot ourselves in the foot,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia
said. ``We had a lot of opportunities. You look at the number of
hits in the game (Angels had 11, Yankees had six) and you'd think
we'd be the club up 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if we get out ahead, it's a different ballgame. You
allow Neagle to settle down, he's tough, as he proved to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The only positive in the game was Mercker's performance. He gave
up single runs in the second and third innings but nothing else
through five. It was a significant improvement from his 3-inning
outing five days ago against the same Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, yeah (it was encouraging), but we lost. I'd rather
pitch bad and win,'' Mercker said. ``I felt a lot better out there
tonight than five days ago. Tonight was a night that if I had the
endurance to throw 120 pitches, it was a good night to do it. I
could have pitched through the seventh and kept it right where it
was at.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Angels had to go to Juan Alvarez, Eric Weaver and
Derrick Turnbow. Alvarez gave up a two-run homer to Justice and
Weaver yielded a solo homer to slap-hitter Luis Sojo in the sixth
inning. Justice added a sacrifice fly in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how the Yankees beat you,'' Scioscia said. ``They get
on base, put pressure on you and keep innings alive.''

MANNING HIT WITH TWINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While many of his teammates stayed in Westwood the
past few months to lift weights, run and work on various skills,
Ricky Manning went to Florida for his summer job.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, a sophomore cornerback from Fresno, spent his second
consecutive summer playing center field for the Fort Myers Twins of
the Gulf Coast League, the Minnesota Twins' rookie affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Manning has showed he can hit and run in both sports.
</P>
<P>
   With UCLA, he started the final nine games and had two
interceptions and 53 tackles, fourth on the team. He had seven solo
tackles in the upset of Washington, including a jarring hit on
quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo that forced a fumble the Bruins
turned into a touchdown in a 23-20 overtime win.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, he batted .276 in 26 games _ mostly in the leadoff
spot _ with a .427 on-base percentage and 13 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there's no telling how good he could be if we had
him full-time,'' Twins farm director Jim Rantz said. ``In two
years, he's made considerable improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played him against left-handers and he hung in there. With
the speed he has and the way he slaps the ball around, yes, we
think he's a prospect. But where he fits depends upon how long we
can work with him. The fact is, he can only play so many years in a
rookie league. This is kind of up to Ricky to see which way he's
going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning wants to continue to play both sports and let the
market, if not his heart, decide which will be his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a lot of progress this summer, but I know I'm going
against the odds,'' Manning said. ``Instead of playing six months
like everyone else, I'm playing six weeks. I made a lot of
sacrifices to come to UCLA and I made a lot of sacrifices to play
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Those sacrifices aren't financial.
</P>
<P>
   When Manning signed a letter of intent with UCLA in February of
1999, he was content to play college baseball, too. The Twins
drafted him in the 22nd round that June but offered him
fourth-round money: $275,000 plus $80,000 toward finishing his
education.
</P>
<P>
   Manning signed what is known as a two-sport contract, meaning
the bonus is paid out in equal installments over five years. This
prevents players from taking the bonus money and quitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money was right,'' Manning said with a smile. ``Actually,
it was better than right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they wanted me to not play football, I told them it was
going to take seven figures. It wasn't that I thought I was that
good, but I'm not dumb. If you're going to give me a million
dollars, I'll play baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Home Malone: Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone took in the
afternoon practice.
</P>
<P>
   __ Basketball recruits: Lakewood Mayfair guard Josh Childress
and Compton Dominguez 7-footer Tyson Chandler joined the afternoon
pick-up games with current Bruins and NBA players Thursday at the
North Gym. They also visited UCLA's coaches, but Childress said he
is not close to making a commitment and has scheduled recruiting
visits to Stanford on Sept. 30 and Kansas on Oct. 13. Chandler is
all but assured of entering the NBA draft.

BREAKAWAY CABLE SPOOL SERIOUSLY HURTS 2 AT SUBWAY WORK SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to correct name to Metropolitan Transportation Authority in
2nd graf.)  
 By SHAILA K. DEWAN and RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 7,500-pound spool of electrical cable being lowered
into a Manhattan subway station Thursday suddenly broke loose and
barreled down the stairs of the station, gravely injuring two
women, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened at about 11:45 a.m. at the 14th Street and
Eighth Avenue station. Workers for Sheldon Electric, a
subcontractor for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, had
left half of the stairway open, allowing passengers to use it as
workers lowered the spool on the other side, which had been taped
off, said Bob Slovak, a transit authority spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The one-inch thick nylon rope that held the spool snapped, he
said, and the spool, which had reached only the third step, went
rolling down the stairs with enough force to destroy the metal
bannisters, bouncing off a wall and then hitting the women, Slovak
said.
</P>
<P>
   The women, identified by the police as Andresa Kippins, 73, of
Brooklyn and Valca Valentine, 41, whose address was not known, were
badly injured, with multiple broken bones, said the police and
hospital officials.
</P>
<P>
   Kippins' son David said she and Valentine, who did not know each
other, had stopped at the foot of the stairs when they saw the
spool, about 5 feet in diameter, being lowered. But they were
assured by workers that they could proceed, David Kippins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy waved to them and said it was OK to pass,'' he said.
``And the next thing they knew, it broke and this thing came at
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kippins suffered several broken bones, including the fibula and
the tibia of one leg, three ribs, her collarbone and her pelvis,
her son said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine broke her left leg and clavicle, according to a
spokeswoman for St. Vincents Hospital, where the women were taken.
</P>
<P>
   David Kippins said he was astonished at the lack of safety
precautions. ``How could they just have men holding a rope? Why
didn't they have a crane lowering something like that? It was 7,500
pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Electric, which is based in Queens, had not notified the
transit authority of its plan to use a ``muscle operation'' to
lower the spool, Slovak said. ``If they had, we would have had them
close off this staircase completely when the cable was being
lowered,'' he said. ``We would have directed people away from the
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Electric was working for CAB Associates, the main
contractor for the $15 million renovation of the subway station,
which is served by the A, C, E and L trains. The renovation began
in 1994, but Sheldon has been working for the transit system for at
least a decade, a city official said. Sheldon is owned by a company
called Railworks.
</P>
<P>
   The company has faced questions about safety issues before, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have had other safety issues in which they at least had
to be talked to about the problems,'' the official said. ``I don't
know if there were any penalties involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cahn, the chief executive of Sheldon, said he did not
know whether the company had notified the MTA that it was going to
lower the spool manually. He did not provide more details about the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of it is such that my attorney would probably tell
me not to say anything about this, and that's easy because I really
do not know what happened,'' Cahn said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kippins was to have surgery Thursday night, her son said.
</P>
<P>
   A retired first-grade teacher, she had been on her way to a
class with other retired teachers in which she was learning to play
the recorder, a flutelike instrument, her son said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very active lady,'' said Dorothy Kippins, the wife of
Mr. Kippins. The family of the other victim could not be reached.
She was reported in stable condition by a hospital spokeswoman
Thursday night.

TEXAS TECH COACH, QUARTERBACK THINK ALIKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The offense conjured in the fertile mind of new Texas Tech head
coach Mike Leach is an ever-evolving work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as is possible,'' Leach said. ``We like to think it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture is easy to imagine of Leach, stick in hand, kneeling
over a spot of bare ground with his players huddled around him,
furiously drawing a new configuration as precious seconds tick off
the 25-second play clock. The offense does not always evolve on
such whim, though it's not out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``A receiver comes to me and says, `Hey, I'm open on the curl
route,' we'll throw the curl route,'' Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   And regardless of the time frame, all suggestions are welcome,
quarterback Kliff Kingsbury confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Leach is real open-minded,'' Kingsbury said. ``\RThe
players\S came up with some new plays over the summer, and he was
open to trying them out. There are a couple of them in the offense
now. That makes it more fun for us because we really get to be a
part of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``And coach Leach is always coming up with new ways to beat the
defense. He's always thinking. It really is a new game every day
because there's no telling what he's going to put in. Meetings are
real interesting. We learn something new every day. As a coach, I
love him to death. I think we complement each other really well.''
</P>
<P>
   His new team, Leach said, has digested everything he can throw
at them as the Red Raiders slowly turn their focus toward game
preparation for the Hispanic College Fund Classic on Aug. 26
against New Mexico. Leach said Kingsbury, a 6-foot-4, 218-pound
sophomore who possesses a tireless arm, is one of the big reasons
why he believes the Raiders are, at this stage of development,
ahead of offenses he inherited as offensive coordinator at either
Kentucky (1997-98) or Oklahoma (1999).
</P>
<P>
   Kingsbury completed 24 of 26 passes for 321 yards and three
touchdowns in Tech's spring game and has hit the ground throwing
with the same precision in August workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as picking up the scheme, I think Kliff is ahead of a
lot of the quarterbacks I've had,'' said Leach, who coached Tim
Couch, the NFL No. 1 draft pick in 1999, at Kentucky and OU's Josh
Heupel. ``He doesn't have as much \Rgame\S experience as some of
them had, but he's made up for it by the way he studies the game.
He's really a self-starter kind of guy who learns something new
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingsbury played in six games last season as a redshirt
freshman, shining in his only start, ironically against the
Sooners. Kingsbury outdueled Heupel by throwing for 259 yards and
three touchdowns as the Raiders upset OU in their season finale,
38-28, to send retiring coach Spike Dykes out on a winning note.
</P>
<P>
   As Heupel, Kingsbury is a coach's son. So, making suggestions to
his head coach is nothing new to the New Braunfels High School
product who, as a senior, passed for 3,009 yards and 34 touchdowns
while leading the Unicorns to the 1997 Class 5A semifinals. He was
also a member of the National Honor Society and twice has qualified
for the Big 12 commissioner's academic honor roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kliff has always had a knack for understanding the game and
has studied it all his life,'' said his father, Tim Kingsbury, who
recently retired from coaching so he and his wife could watch his
son play on Saturdays. ``He would draw up plays and bring them to
me, and whenever he told me something, I always listened.
</P>
<P>
   ``If what he brought me worked, we used it. I took his advice a
lot of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim believes the collaboration between Leach and his son will
prove to be a match made in football heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a good fit, I think, because Kliff and he are a lot
alike as far as their thinking in offensive football,'' the elder
Kingsbury said. ``Having been in the profession and been \Rto
Lubbock\S to watch some of spring training, I have been really
impressed with Mike's whole coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate Leach's attitude because he's willing to try
things that maybe traditionally other people wouldn't try. He's
willing to experiment, and that's great because it makes the game
enjoyable for the players. Kliff is really excited about having him
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The excitement has spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``This offense is going to put Kliff on a showcase,'' sophomore
H-back Shaud Williams predicted. ``It's perfect for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Leach's system relies on a heady quarterback who can make snap
decisions at the line of scrimmage as the play clock dwindles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This offense can be complex,'' Kingsbury conceded. ``You have
to buckle down and study the game a lot more because you control
the offense, you control how your team does. You have a lot more
leverage to make the calls on the field. If I see something good, I
get to check to \Ra new play\S. But I wouldn't say the scheme is
that complicated if you break it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingsbury said he would be confident if the Raiders were opening
the season tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'd be ready to go,'' he said without hesitation.
``We've been going against our defense so long now that they have
learned our plays and checks, so it's getting tougher to do things.
But that's making us better, because we have to be a lot more
precise to get things done against them. I think it's going really
well.''
</P>
<P>
   And in this scenario, the quarterback's opinion is given more
than a passing thought. nn

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Stars assistant general manager Doug Armstrong
won't guarantee that the team is done finagling their roster. But,
with yesterday's signing of free-agent forward Ted Donato and
winger Blake Sloan on board after a ruling in his arbitration case,
Armstrong said they are pretty darn close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're prepared to go with the players we have,''
Armstrong said of training camp, which begins Sept. 9 in Vail,
Colo. ``Getting \RDonato\S gives us another veteran. I think it's
important to have players that have been through the grind before,
to give support to Roman \RLyashenko\S, Brenden \RMorrow\S and
\RJon\S Sim and give them a chance to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato, who played last season for the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim,
signed a one-year deal. Terms were not disclosed. The 31-year-old
winger said the Stars were his No. 1 choice for ``obvious''
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they win,'' Donato said. ``And I want to be on a
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   He had 11 goals and 19 assists in the 1999-2000 season and could
be used on the second line with Joe Nieuwendyk and Jamie
Langenbrunner or in a checking role on the third line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted is a guy not unlike Mike Keane. He'll play a very
versatile role for this team,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``We can also move him into a higher-profile position and he'll be
equally effective. He helps so we're not breaking in inexperienced
people in critical roles.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have lost a lot of veteran leaders in the two
off-seasons since their 1998-99 Stanley Cup championship. They've
been replacing them with a mix of selected veterans, such as Donato
and younger players such as Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have known Sloan would be in Vail since he filed for
arbitration this summer. They just didn't know what kind of
contract he would have. They do now.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrator ruled yesterday in favor of Sloan, awarding him a
one-year, one-way contract worth $550,000. The Stars asked for a
two-way deal that would have paid him considerably less for games
played with their minor-league affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very excited about the ruling,'' said Sloan, who made
$375,000 last season. ``I don't know if fair is the right word, but
I'm happy.'' \Nsubheds:Briefly Retired Stars center Brian Skrudland
has taken a developmental job in Calgary similar to the one Guy
Carbonneau took in Montreal. Calgary is where former Stars director
of player personal Craig Button was hired as general manager this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also signed forward David Ling, who was acquired last
week in a trade with Chicago, to a one-year deal with an option for
another year. nn

ARLINGTON MAKES MILLIONS FOR CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To commemorate the return of the Arlington Million from its
two-year absence, officials at Arlington International Racecourse
bumped the purse for the high-profile turf race from $1 million to
$2 million. And when the race is conducted tomorrow (ESPN, 3-4:30
p.m.), a field that includes Running Stag, Manndar, Bienamado,
Chester House and Slickly is expected to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Those are accomplished horses, but none strikes the imagination
as John Henry did when he competed in the race in the mid-'80s. In
fact, the best turf horse on display at Arlington on Saturday might
be competing earlier in the day when King Cugat goes for his fifth
consecutive victory against other 3-year-olds in the $400,000
Secretariat Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Million has attracted nice horses this year, but it's no
bonanza. The bonanza appears to belong to Dick Duchossois, the
strong-willed chairman at Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, an introduction is in order. Duchossois returned
racing to the Chicagoland track after the fire that torched the
grandstand in the late '80s. He did a good job.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 tracks in this country have either been constructed,
remodeled or rebuilt since Arlington burned. None _ Lone Star Park
at Grand Prairie included _ is as opulent as the rebuilt Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   To Duchossois, the racetrack is his bat, his ball, his game. So
if he ever went to Illinois' horse-racing regulators or to the
other two tracks in the Chicago area (Sportsman's Park or Hawthorne
Racecourse) and if he didn't get what he wanted, Duchossois
wouldn't hesitate to either reduce the number of race dates he
would offer or make threats to shut the place down.
</P>
<P>
   Since the arrival of riverboat casinos in the Chicago area,
Duchossois has wanted a piece of the action. Legislators told him
to take a hike, so that's what Duchossois did. He made good on his
threat to shut down the track in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   So after two years of keeping the track dormant, Duchossois won
legislative approval to get a cut on riverboat casino proceeds. But
that's nothing compared with the bonanza that's about to become
final in a Churchill Downs boardroom.
</P>
<P>
   Duchossois has agreed to allow Arlington to become the latest
racetrack to join the Churchill Downs corporate plan. But rather
than the complete buyout that Churchill used to acquire Calder
Racecourse and Hollywood Park, this is a merger.
</P>
<P>
   So Duchossois and his company gets 3.15 million shares of
Churchill stock. Based on Churchill's stock price, which closed at
22 13/16 Wednesday on the Nasdaq, it's a payday of $71 million. His
stake actually could grow to 4.4 million shares, and he would own
30 percent of Churchill Downs and its corporate-owned tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that with a private investor named Brad Kelley, who is
based in Franklin, Ky., and has been identified as the most active
buyer of Churchill stock during the past 18 months. He owns 1
million shares, or 11 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   It's the season of political conventions, and there has been a
lot of talk about ``squandered opportunity.'' Duchossois certainly
hasn't squandered his.
\Nsubheds:LATE SCRATCHES... All American Derby A group of 48
entrants, including Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie stakes
performers Significant Speed and Gone Kool Man, are scheduled to
race in the time trials of the $300,000 All American Derby today at
Ruidoso Downs. Final for the event is Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Significant Speed, owned by Gus Barakis of Weatherford,
qualified for the Dash For Cash Futurity last year at Lone Star.
She also won the Rainbow Derby this year at Ruidoso. Gone Kool Man
is trained by defending Lone Star champion Steve Van Bebber and was
second in the Texas Classic Futurity last year. A Delightful
Dasher, winner of last year's All American Futurity, also is
entered in the Derby time trials. \Nsubheds:Racing at Arlington In
addition to the Arlington Million tomorrow, two other important
turf stakes races make their return to Arlington International
Racecourse near Chicago after a two-year absence. The Beverly D
Stakes is worth $500,000 for fillies and mares and the Secretariat
Stakes offers $400,000 for 3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Running Stag, fifth in his last start on a wet dirt track in the
Whitney Handicap, is the top money earner in the Million. Manndar
might be the most talented challenger; he has won two consecutive
Grade I stakes races at Churchill Downs and Belmont. Also in the
field are Godolphin Stable-owned Slickly, Bienamado, Chester House
(a jockey switch to Jerry Bailey), Mula Gula and Asidero.
</P>
<P>
   Happyanunoit, winner of the Grade I Beverly Hills Handicap at
Hollywood Park, faces nine others in the Beverly D, the most
talented appearing to be European stakes performers America and
Country Garden.
</P>
<P>
   King Cugat tries for his fifth victory in a row in the
Secretariat, and his toughest rival looks to be European invader
Ciro. He finished third in the Irish Derby. \Nsubheds:Alabama in NY
Saratoga Racecourse is in New York, but it calls its training track
the Oklahoma Training Facility. So it's no wonder that one of
Saratoga's biggest stakes races of the year is known as the Alabama
Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Status, who won the Kentucky Oaks but faltered in her
latest start in the Coaching Club American Oaks, is the expected
favorite for the Alabama. The race is part of the Arlington Million
telecast tomorrow (ESPN, 3-4:30 p.m.).
\Nsubheds:SPOTLIGHT ON ... Pioneering Krone trying hand on new TV
venture Julie Krone's induction into the Horse Racing Hall of Fame
this month is easily the most controversial addition in years. One
prominent national columnist wrote prior to Krone's induction that
Krone, with her more than 3,000 victories as a jockey, was less
deserving for induction to the Hall of Fame than Earlie Fires. He
has ridden about twice as many winners as Krone.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing was written about measuring the idea of
trailblazing. Does a Hall of Fame honor stats or a contribution to
a sport?
</P>
<P>
   Krone has now moved into television work. She is an on-camera
host for the Television Games Network that is part of home
satellite dish systems. Her work there is hardly Hall of Fame
quality.
</P>
<P>
   While working as a studio co-host during a recent race day,
Krone used the medium to remind viewers on numerous occasions that
she was suffering from a sore throat. And when her co-host noted
that neither one of them predicted a winner from a race that just
finished at Calder Racecourse, Krone said, ``I did. I just didn't
tell anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   TVG is a new network that, like most ventures, needs some fine
tuning. Krone needs to be a part of that. She handled postrace
interviews of jockeys for ABC Radio at this year's Preakness Stakes
and did a respectable job. Krone ought to be doing that sort of
on-site work, rather than a studio host, for TVG.
\Nsubheds:By the numbers Time trials for the $2 million All
American Futurity were conducted yesterday at Ruidoso Downs in New
Mexico. The final is scheduled for Sept. 4 and will be televised on

RANGERS MIGHT MOVE DOUG DAVIS TO BULLPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There was a lot of fallout from Brian Sikorski's
terrific pitching performance Tuesday night against the New York
Yankees. At the top of the list isthat left-hander Doug Davis is
being considered by manager Johnny Oates as a reliever next season
rather than a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly interested in Doug Davis as a starter, but I
think he would also be ideal as the second left-hander in the
bullpen,'' Oates said. ``With our depth of starting pitchers, that
might be his future as a reliever.''
</P>
<P>
   Sikorski is filling in while Ryan Glynn is on the disabled list.
But when Glynn returns, Sikorski could stay in the rotation and
Davis could go to the bullpen. It's not so much that Oates is
enamored with Sikorski, who has made only one start in the majors,
but he knows he must make room in next year's rotation for both
Darren Oliver and Justin Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes two left-handers in the bullpen and currently Mike
Venafro is the only one. \Nsubheds:Sikorski saves the day Other
repercussions from Brian Sikorski's outing against the Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   It kept Darren Oliver in the minors. While Sikorski was throwing
seven scoreless innings against the Yankees, Oliver was making his
second start for Triple-A Oklahoma. Oliver allowed one run in five
innings against the Las Vegas Stars, but gave up five hits and four
walks.
</P>
<P>
   If Sikorski had bombed, the Rangers probably would have brought
back Oliver to pitch Monday against the Yankees. Instead, Sikorski
will start against the Yankees, and Oliver will remain in the
minors on medical rehabilitation assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Glynn, on the disabled list because of Friday's fainting
spell, will join Oliver in Triple A on medical rehabilitation
assignment and will probably pitch next Thursday. Sikorski isn't
eligible to come off the disabled list until Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Sikorski will get at least two more starts, but he's also likely
to stay with the Rangers the remainder of the season. He can't be
sent to the minors unless he clears outright waivers, and his
performance against the Yankees makes it more likely he'll be
claimed. \Nsubheds:O'Brien snags Sikorski General manager Doug
Melvin gave assistant GM Dan O'Brien credit for recommending Brian
Sikorski when the Houston Astros put him on waivers in the
off-season. O'Brien knew Sikorski from his time with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``He drafted him in the fourth round in 1995 and recommended we
pick him up if he became available,'' Melvin said. ``I heard Kansas
City had interest in him. In fact, we were at the general managers
meetings \Rin November\S and two teams told me they were
considering claiming him, but they just missed it because those
waiver things can get overlooked when you're at those meetings.''
\Nsubheds:30 for Palmeiro Rafael Palmeiro's home run Wednesday
night was his 30th of the season, marking the sixth consecutive
season he has hit that many. Among active players, Barry Bonds has
done it nine consecutive seasons and Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa
have done it six consecutive seasons. Albert Belle has hit at least
30 home runs the past eight years, but has 22 this season.
\Nsubheds:Briefly Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra got the day
off yesterday, his first since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin said he expects to talk with
outfielder Tyrell Godwin's agent again today. Godwin, the Rangers'
second pick in the June draft, has agreed to a $1.2-million
contract, but it's pending the results of a physical. The Rangers
have concerns about Godwin's right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said one problem with the baseball draft is that teams
aren't allowed to conduct mass tryouts or physicals on prospective
draft picks. He said baseball should conduct an NFL-style combine
before the draft.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A deputy no more, Vice President Al Gore made his
debut as the Democratic presidential nominee Thursday night with a
vow to work for all Americans, ``especially those who need a voice,
those who need a champion, those who need to be lifted up so they
are never left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Democratic National Convention that nominated
him on Wednesday night and to the nation beyond, Gore said bluntly,
``I stand here tonight as my own man'' _ a clear rejoinder to the
Republicans who have sought to picture him as a cut-rate version of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president told a whooping crowd at the Staples Center
on the fringe of downtown Los Angeles that he would give working
families ``a full range of targeted tax cuts,'' including an early
end to the so-called marriage penalty, and a reform of the federal
estate tax. But his proposals stopped well short of those made by
his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In a pointed reference to Bush's promise to cut federal income
taxes by more than $1.3 trillion over 10 years, Gore said, ``I will
not go along with a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of
everyone else and wreck our good economy in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   In what sounded like a subtle attempt to distance himself from
Clinton, he promised, ``I will never let you down.'' And he was
careful to confine his criticism of the opposition to policies
rather than personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing Bush in the polls, faced with an uphill fight in the
Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic swing states that will decide the
outcome, Gore seemed to be laying the groundwork for a fall
campaign in which he would identify himself as the friend of the
little guy and Bush as the candidate of the rich, powerful and
influential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together let's make sure that our prosperity enriches not just
the few, but all working families,'' the vice president declared.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, he spoke of unspecified ``powerful forces'' and
``powerful interests,'' which he implicitly identified with the
Republicans, standing in the way of working men and women. It was
reminiscent of Theodore Roosevelt's denunciation of ``the
malefactors of great wealth'' in 1907 and Franklin D. Roosevelt's
castigation of ``economic royalists'' during the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that the stock market has boomed and so many
businesses and new enterprises have done well,'' the vice president
said. ``This country is richer and stronger. But my focus is on
working families _ people trying to make house payments and car
payments, working overtime to save for college and do right by
their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy is in many ways Gore's greatest asset on the stump.
Given its strength, he should be doing much better, by normal
standards. Candidates of parties that hold the White House usually
fare well when the economy is strong and the country is involved in
no foreign war.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president has been unable to generate the kind of
electricity that follows Clinton everywhere. And Clinton's speech
on Monday night did nothing to light a fire for his protege. ``All
he did was, he made a good case for Clinton,'' said Gerald
Rafshoon, Jimmy Carter's imagemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this most important hour of his political career, the
shadow of Clinton fell across Gore's path. It was disclosed in
Washington that a new grand jury has been convened to consider
whether the president should be indicted after leaving office for
having lied under oath about his affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Some weeks ago, Sam Popkin, a professor at the University of
California at San Diego who is working in the Gore campaign,
defined the goals of the two candidates at their respective
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, Popkin said, needed to show some gravitas, while Gore
needed to show some levitas. In other words, one needed to show he
was not a lightweight, the other to lighten up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   By common consent, the Republican made at least a start at the
Philadelphia convention towards establishing himself as a serious
political figure, capable of handling large issues. It was less
clear how much the Democrat had improved on his image as a
plodding, overearnest orator and campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech contained few rhetorical flourishes or unexpected
policy departures and fewer flashes of humor. Speaking more quickly
than usual, Gore poured out a flood of words; sometimes he sounded
like a man with his car parked with the meter running. But he
gestured more than Bush had, and was altogether more animated.
</P>
<P>
   The speech, which lasted for 52 minutes, was a shopping list,
and Gore acknowledged that he may have sounded like a policy wonk.
He even admitted, ``I won't always be the most exciting
politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he hit hard on key points, sometimes almost shouting to
drive home his message. And the crowd cheered wildly when he
promised to preserve abortion rights, to oppose school vouchers and
to support affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest cheers came when he promised that a
comprehensive campaign spending reform bill would be the first he
sent to Congress if he was elected. But he did not commit himself
to the most stringent such measure _ the one sponsored by Sens.
John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go, Al, go!'' the crowd chanted, waving blue-and-white
``Gore'' signs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, continuing his string of promises, said that as president
he would provide universal child health insurance by 2004,
universal preschool education of a high quality by 2010 and use
federal funds to put 50,000 more police officers on the streets of
U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   Some in his camp still hope for a modest post-convention
``bounce'' in opinion polls about Gore's candidacy, but their
ultimate goal is to turn the race around in the debates with Bush.
The Texas governor agreed Thursday to three debates with the vice
president, starting in early October, as well as two between the
vice presidential nominees. But the Bush campaign made no agreement
as to the debates' length, format or location. Gore, an experienced
and accomplished debater, said earlier in the campaign that he
would like to debate twice weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was preceded to the podium by a parade of speakers,
including Kweisi Mfume, a former congressman who is now president
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
and Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamente of California, the first statewide
Hispanic officeholder in this state this century.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the modern, made-for-television style, a parade of
friends of the nominee extolled his virtues. Among the speakers
were David Halberstam, the journalist and author, a family friend,
and Robert Delabar of Seattle, who met Gore while both were
stationed at Fort Rucker, Ala., in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Gore served in Vietnam while Bush did not, a point Gore
emphasized in his speech as he has done on the stump throughout the
campaign.``I was an Army reporter in Vietnam,'' he said. ``When I
was there, I didn't do the most, or run the gravest danger. But I
was proud to wear my country's uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, the vice president's wife, came on to introduce
him. An amateur photographer, she called her husband ``a decisive
leader with strong values, deeply held convictions and an
unwavering commitment to making the American dream a reality for
all our people,'' and showed a series of shots from what she
described as ``the family photo album.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for the night's main event, the delegates were in a
jolly mood for all their worries about winning. They boogied,
talked on their cell phones, waved placards, put on silly hats for
the television cameras, did the wave and chanted, ``Viva, Gore!''
</P>
<P>
   Gore entered through the crowd, high-fiving several delegates,
then ascended the stage to give his wife, dressed in a sky-blue
silk dress and coat, a robust bearhug. There was an echo of Tipper
Gore's past attacks on popular music that features explicit sexual
content in Gore's speech, much of which he wrote himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we must challenge a culture with too much meanness
and not enough meaning,'' he said. ``And as president I will stand
with you for a goal that I know we share: To give more power back
to the parents, so that you can choose what your own children are
exposed to, and pass on the basic lessons of responsibility and
decency.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Gore's other themes was an openness to voters' views.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm elected president,'' he declared, ``I'm going to keep
on having open meetings all over this country. I'm going to go out
to you, the people, because I want to stay in touch with your
hopes, with the quiet, everyday heroism of American families.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president underlined that point by introducing people
in the audience who, he said, had taught him about key issues when
he met them during the campaign _ an Iowa woman who needed a tax
cut to help pay for her daughter's college education, for example,
and a Hispanic family from Texas who long for a less crowded,
better built school for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing John F. Kennedy, who announced the start of a national
journey to a New Frontier when nominated here 40 years ago, Gore
urged his listeners Thursday night to ``set out on a new journey to
the best America.''
</P>
<P>
   He called it, in some of the most poetic language he used
Thursday night, a journey ``on which we advance not by the turning
of wheels, but by the turning of our minds, the reach of our vision
and the daring grace of the human spirit.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Spirits were high at the Shrine Auditorium late
Thursday, where Democrats gathered to celebrate Al Gore's
acceptance speech at a bash that included performances by Barbra
Streisand, Babyface and Boyz II Men.
</P>
<P>
   The average ticket price for Thursday's fund-raiser was $1,000.
Whoopi Goldberg hosted.
</P>
<P>
   Although entertainment was on the marquee, politics was on the
minds of most who attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's speech was passionate and very good,'' said Santa
Monica resident Jon Graff, a ``mid-30s'' entertainment industry
worker waiting to enter the Shrine. ``He made a statement about
what he wants to accomplish, but I think Tipper did a better job of
explaining who Al is.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Jefferson Boulevard, about 200 members of the Screen
Actors Guild stood for a candlelight vigil to bring attention to
its continuing strike over residuals on commercials airing on cable
TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see Ms. Streisand and Ms. Goldberg come out here
and joins us,'' said actress Mariette Hartley, as she stood holding
a sign reading ``Soar with Gore'' with other union members. ``We
need visible faces so people can see what's going on. We need big
names to fight for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Los Angeles actress, Tisza Major, also called upon
Streisand to back the guild's cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you are done in there, come join us,'' she said.
``We need your voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Streisand so far has not commented on the strike. But it was
announced Thursday that negotiations would continue on Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   News that President Clinton was again under investigation by a
Washington, D.C., grand jury did little to dampen the enthusiasm of
those who attended the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leak was disgraceful,'' said Democratic National Committee
Chairman Ed Rendell, who was attending the Shrine event. ``This was
obviously timed to deflect the attention from Al Gore's big day. I
do hope they bring Clinton to trial because that jury is going to
raise its hand and say, `Let's acquit the president and convict the
prosecutor.' ''

KIDNAPPING LINKED TO DRUG DEBT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The 15-year-old West Hills boy whose
bullet-riddled body was found in a Santa Barbara park had been
kidnapped because his older half-brother owed $36,000 in drug
money, detectives with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's
Department announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, three suspects were cruising Nicholas
``Nick'' Samuel Markowitz's neighborhood looking for 22-year-old
Benjamin Markowitz but found the teen-ager instead. They grabbed
the teen and took him to the house of one of the suspect's parents
in Santa Barbara, where they kept him for two days before finally
taking him to the park and killing him.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Markowitz was fed a steady diet of marijuana and
Valium while at the house, and friends of the suspects took to
calling Markowitz the ``stolen kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Markowitz's family was stunned by the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no preparing for something of this magnitude,'' said
Nick's mother, Susan Markowitz. ``Right now, I have a hard time
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Hikers found Nick's body in a shallow grave in the Los Padres
National Forest near Santa Barbara on Saturday. Nick had been shot
nine times, mostly in the head and torso, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said in Thursday's press conference in Santa Barbara
that four of five suspects have been arrested. But a fifth suspect,
identified as 20-year-old Jesse James Hollywood from the West
Valley area, remained at large.
</P>
<P>
   Authorites believe Hollywood was looking for Benjamin because he
allegedly owed Hollywood $36,000 from a past drug deal.
</P>
<P>
   The other four suspects were arrested Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   William Skidmore, 20, was arrested Wednesday afternoon at his
home in Simi Valley. Jesse Taylor Rugge, 20, was arrested near his
home on Casiano Drive in Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan James Hoyt was taken into custody Wednesday at 11 p.m. just
after leaving a friend's home. Hollywood, Skidmore, Hoyt and Rugge
apparently knew one another from growing up in the West Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A 17-year-old boy, who police said dug Nick's grave, was
arrested after his parents brought him into the Santa Barbara
sheriff's station Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four suspects has been booked on suspicion of
kidnapping, criminal conspiracy and murder.
</P>
<P>
   The last family members to see Nick on the day he was kidnapped
were a cousin and uncle who live a few houses away from the
Markowitz family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were coming home from the gym and pulled over near
Ingomar (Street) and Chaminade High School to ask (Nick) if he
wanted a ride home and he said, 'No , I'm fine,' '' his cousin
said.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, Nick's mother knew something was wrong when she
paged her son and he didn't call home, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 8, Susan Markowitz and her husband, Jeffrey, reported
Nick missing with the LAPD's West Valley Division.
</P>
<P>
   Rugge, Hollywood and Hoyt, driving in a rented van, are
suspected of kidnapping Nick on Aug. 6 and taking him to Rugge's
house in the 700 block of Casiano Drive in Santa Barbara, where he
was held for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that during Nick's stay at the Rugge residence, he
was given marijuana and Valium. During the daytime, he was told not
to make phone calls or leave the house but apparently had some
degree of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Police were uncertain if he had been more confined at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he was given a large amount of drugs there ...
perhaps as a way to keep him quiet and passive,'' said Santa
Barbara Sheriff Jim Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Rugge's parents were apparently home during that time, but
police said it did not appear they knew what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   Four or five juveniles who visited the home in those two days
knew that Nick had been kidnapped and even referred to him as the
``stolen kid,'' officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they went to great lengths to hide it,'' he
said. ``Then plans were hashed to commit the murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said it did not appear that the suspects contacted
Benjamin or his family to seek ransom. After two days in the house,
they moved Nick to a State Street hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Hoyt and the unidentified 17-year-old left the hotel
and went to Lizard's Mouth, a popular hiking site, to dig a grave.
When they returned, Hoyt, Rugge and the 17-year-old took Nick to
the grave.
</P>
<P>
   Nick was bound and Hoyt and Rugge placed duct tape over his
mouth, taped his hands behind his back, placed him in the grave and
shot and then buried him. The weapon, a semiautomatic handgun, was
recovered in the grave.
</P>
<P>
   That Saturday, hikers found the body buried in the shallow grave
and reported the find to authorities. Part of Nick's clothing was
visible in the grave, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are seeking the public's help in the arrest of
Hollywood, who is believed to be staying at various friends' homes.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with information about Hollywood's whereabouts is asked
to contact the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department at (805)
681-4150, or the anonymous tip line at (805) 681-4171.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial for Nick will be held today at 2 p.m. at the Groman
Eden Mortuary at 11500 Sepulveda Blvd. in Mission Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Markowitz said Benjamin would not attend the service
because he didn't want to draw attention to himself on a day when
Nick's memory will be honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope (Benjamin) uses the love his brother had for him to get
him through this,'' Susan Markowitz said. ``I can't imagine how he
is feeling.''

 DEMOCRATS NOT TAKING BLACK VOTES FOR GRANTED  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Listen up, Miss Bertha in the beauty shop. You're
about to become one popular lady.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Bertha is a fictional character that Donna Brazile, Al
Gore's Mississippi-born campaign manager, who is African American,
likes to talk about. Because Gore's election may depend upon it.
</P>
<P>
   Brazile's creation is just about one of the most important
voters in America to the Democratic Party. Miss Bertha is average
folks, good people. Miss Bertha is African American.
</P>
<P>
   And while Miss Bertha has always voted Democratic, this time, &LR; 
she may not be fully convinced that Al Gore's the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to talk to Miss Bertha in the beauty shop, and
Uncle Bob at the barber shop, that's really how the grapevine
begins in the African American community,'' Brazile said Thursday.
``People start talking it up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Brazile _ along with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Rep.
Maxine Waters of Los Angeles, San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, and
a whole host of Congressional black caucus members _ appeared
before African American delegates Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They preached their hearts out on behalf of Gore and his running
mate, Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   And surprisingly, their message is not such an easy sell in the
African American community this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not when a charming, folksy guy named George W. Bush has taken
his Republican message right into African American communities.
He's talking diversity and education. He's campaigning with J.C.
Watts. He had break dancers and rap artists and Chaka Khan _ could
you believe  &UR; that?  &LR; _ at his GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   It worked: Miss Bertha has started looking his way. So the
Democrats have to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Bertha knows Al Gore as Vice President Al Gore. She
doesn't know Al Gore, his story, what he's fought for, what he
intends to do, his presidency,'' Brazile said. ``And she's going to
hear the personal story _ who Al Gore is, and what his values are.
She's going to know that Al Gore is on her side.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miss Bertha and Uncle Bob have some other doubts, too. They
need to know that Lieberman is on their side, on issues like
affirmative action, even though he's been more conservative and
belongs to groups like the Democratic Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Waters was the first, and the most vocal, in raising some
of those issues this week.
</P>
<P>
   And another, unspoken question lingered in the background for
the Miss Berthas of the world: Did Lieberman's selection, as a
Jewish man, mean African Americans have been forgotten or bypassed,
or _ worse _ taken for granted by Democrats?
</P>
<P>
   It was Jesse Jackson Thursday who strode into the African
American delegation to hash the whole thing out, including what he
called the ``black-Jewish question.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson understands the issues, the doubts, the anger, and yes,
the conflicting emotions here; he once referred to New York as
``hymietown,'' and later apologized.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, he challenged African Americans ``to vote our
hopes and our dreams, not our fears.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are people who suggest there's ``an invisible quota''
of Jewish people in politics. But, Jackson said, blacks and Jews
have a common ground of ``shared suffering ... and shared
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are people of all kinds ``who have hang-ups about
Jews,'' he said. ``But that is not our religion. We are not raised
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Blacks didn't keep Jews off the (presidential) ticket until
last Tuesday,'' he said. ``Blacks didn't lock Jews out of the
country clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger picture is this: Blacks and Jews marched together''
in the civil rights movement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he was not concerned with Lieberman's more
conservative bent. ``I'm not hung up by the Democratic Leadership
Council and the certain wing of the party. Because it takes two
wings to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was not concerned with the public doubts and perceptions
of the lead man on the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say Al Gore is not charismatic,'` he said. ``We got a
surplus of charisma.  &UR; We need some resources. &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Bertha, get ready.
</P>
<P>
   Between the Republicans and the Democrats, your dance card is
gonna be full.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Los Angeles Sparks played 34 games this year with
only four losses, but none were as bad as the one they played
Thursday night in the opener of the best-of-three Western
Conference Finals at the Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, there was nothing that they could do to change
their destructive course. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The three-time defending WNBA champion Houston Comets, who lost
three regular-season games to Los Angeles, brought the Sparks down
to earth in a hurry and shackled them, 77-56, in front of a
deafening crowd of 14,597.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets had a playoff record 15 steals translating into 23
turnovers by the Sparks, who had nine miscues in the first nine
minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played 39 minutes of ugly basketball,'' Sparks coach
Michael Cooper said. ``It's just one of those games. Hopefully,
we'll get it out of our system, because we have two days to work us
out a situation, we'll look at game film ... and we'll come back
and play a better game on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   The series moves to the Forum in Inglewood where the Sparks face
a must-win situation when the teams meet at 1 p.m. If they win,
they will play in the decisive game Monday at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets' Sheryl Swoopes, who was honored as the league's most
valuable player, and Cynthia Cooper, a two-time MVP, set the tone
early. They combined for 25 points first-half points to give
Houston a comfortable 40-23 margin at the break. Swoopes finished
with 22 points, six rebounds, a playoff record five steals, and
Cooper had 21 points. Tina Thompson had 12 as the Houston's Big
Three outscored the Sparks starters, 55-52.
</P>
<P>
   Mwadi Mabika tried to keep the Sparks in the game with a playoff
record 7 of 11 3-pointers for a team-high 21 points, but she wasn't
getting a lot of help.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks were unable to get the defensive stops they needed to
slow the Comets' attack. DeLisha Milton, who fouled out with 10
points, scored two early baskets to start the second half and cut
the Sparks losses to 40-27. But Swoopes answered with a quick
3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Houston took its first lead when Cooper came off back-to-back
screens to put the Comets ahead 8-4. The Comets built a 19-4
advantage and things just got worst for the Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out ready to play,'' Milton said. ``They study us
well and did a good job with what we were trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was just anxious to play. The ball just didn't
bounce for us, it bounced against us. I don't think we were really
in sync. We were spastic.`'The Sparks' guards struggled. Tamecka
Dixon could not buy a basket. She was 1 for 9 and Ukari Figgs was 1
for 6. They had six assists between them and eight turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just didn't come out focused,'' Dixon said. ``We played the
worst basketball that we've ever played and we were still in the
game, We just couldn't get over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other team that really took the Sparks out of their
comfort zone was the expansion Seattle Storm, which took the Sparks
to overtime games to earn a split. But Thursday's loss sent the
Sparks to their lowest point in the best season the franchise has
enjoyed in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just were not on the same page this time,'' said Leslie,
who had 14 points and eight rebounds. ``What we practiced to do I
guarantee you we didn't do it. I said all year, we've lost four
games not doing what the coaches have asked us to do.''

GORE ACCEPTS NOMINATION, SEIZES CHANCE TO CHAMPION WORKING 
 FAMILIES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Moving to separate himself from President Clinton
_ but not from the economic success of the past eight years _ Al
Gore accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination
Thursday by pledging to ``make sure that our prosperity enriches
not just the few, but all working families.''
</P>
<P>
   In a spirited address on the final night of the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles, the vice president vowed to
battle his Republican rivals on issues that matter to American
workers. ``My focus is on working families,'' Gore said. ``People
trying to make house payments and car payments, working overtime to
save for college and do right by their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   He also played off his reputation as a dull, policy wonk by
suggesting that a little boredom might not be bad for an America
exhausted by the national roller-coaster ride of the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you entrust me with the presidency, I know I won't always
be the most exciting politician,'' Gore said. ``But I pledge to you
tonight: I will work for you every day and I will never let you
down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what presidents are supposed to do, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-minute speech also served as Gore's attempt to
reintroduce himself to the voters after eight years in Clinton's
long shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're entering a new time; we're electing a new president,''
he said. ``And I stand here tonight as my own man, and I want you
to know me for who I truly am.''
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president didn't distance himself from the economic
prosperity of the past eight years. Gore reminded the audience of
the country's fragile economic condition when he and Clinton took
over from the Republicans and President George Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not forget that a few years ago, you were also working
hard. But your hard work was undone by a government that didn't
work, didn't put people first and wasn't on your side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a rapid-fire delivery, Gore shifted between his vision of a
new and better life for America's working people and specific
references to the policies he believes will get them there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to talk seriously about the issues,'' the vice
president said. ``I believe people deserve to know specifically
what a candidate proposes to do. I intend to tell you tonight. You
ought to be able to know, and then judge for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore brought some people into the convention hall with him,
people with the type of problems he vowed to solve: a couple
fighting an HMO to get full-time nursing care for their disabled
young son, a working mother seeking to send a daughter to college,
an elderly woman struggling to pay prescription drug bills, a
family seeking a better school for their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this election is about Mildred Nystel, Jacqueline
Johnson, Caterina Gutierrez, Ian Malone,'' Gore said. ``It's about
millions of Americans whose names we may never know _ but whose
needs and dreams must always be our calling.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech was interrupted more than 40 times by applause as
delegates waving flags and blue-and-white ``Gore'' pennants roared
their approval.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke with marked confidence, displaying only occasional
evidence of the wooden mannerisms or halting delivery that has
haunted him in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``He softened up ... he took loose lessons,'' said William
Silver, a convention volunteer from Miami. ``A lot of the details
(of policy), we already knew. But he brought it to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Harris of Los Angeles, a security worker and Democratic
volunteer inside the Staples Center, was equally impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a good job,'' she said. ``There's only one Bill
Clinton. But Al Gore's his own man.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president made sure his theme _ and the likely focus of
the fall campaign _ wouldn't be missed. He repeated the phrase
``working families'' nine times and used the words ``fight'' or
``fighting'' 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are likely to hear those words over and over before the
November election, starting Friday on a riverboat trip along the
Mississippi River that will include stops in Wisconsin, Iowa,
Illinois and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing about the job of the president,'' Gore said.
``It is the only job in the Constitution that is charged with the
responsibility of fighting for all the people ... not just the
wealthy or powerful _ all the people. Especially those who need a
voice; those who need a champion; those who need to be lifted up,
so they are never left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Without ever mentioning Texas Gov. George W. Bush, his
Republican opponent, Gore tried to highlight some of the
differences between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my own imperfections,'' he said. ``I know that
sometimes people say I'm too serious, that I talk too much
substance and policy. Maybe I've done that tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the presidency is more than a popularity contest,'' he
continued. ``It's a day-by-day fight for people. Sometimes, you
have to choose to do what's difficult or unpopular. Sometimes, you
have to be willing to spend your popularity in order to pick the
hard right over the easy wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's press secretary, wasted little time in
responding to Gore's speech, saying he ``offered more of the same
old language of class warfare, partisanship and division.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of last night's program was devoted to giving people a look
behind the political persona of Al Gore. A parade of friends,
relatives, colleagues and others talked about Gore as a boy, a
college student, a soldier in Vietnam, a congressman and vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   After holding a job that, almost by definition, made Gore
invisible for eight years, Democratic leaders believe the vice
president is ``well-known, but not known well,'' in the words of
one commentator.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Republicans trying to paint Gore as a man who would
say and do anything to become president, the Democrats believe it
is critical to put a human face on their nominee.
</P>
<P>
   That job went, in part, to Gore's wife, Tipper, who narrated a
campaign video featuring, she said, ``a little bit more about Al
and the life of our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also tried to change his image as a man of privilege, a man
whose father was a senator and who grew up in a Washington hotel
and attended exclusive schools.
</P>
<P>
   His father grew up poor in Possum Hollow, Tenn., and was
teaching in a single-room schoolhouse when he was 18, Gore said
last night. His mother waited tables to earn enough money to go to
law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did give me a good life,'' he said. ``But like so many in
America, they started out with almost nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Democrats have been saying that Gore's acceptance
speech represented a do-or-die chance to make his case to the
American people. But in recent days, some party leaders have been
trying to lower expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware told California delegates earlier
this week not to lose heart if Gore's speech doesn't deliver a
knockout punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ... he doesn't hit it out of the ballpark, don't worry
about it,'' he said. ``He still deserves your overwhelming
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls this week have reinforced Democrats' concerns about the
fall campaign against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had an 11-point lead over Gore, 48 percent to 37 percent _
the same as Wednesday _ in a Voter.com-Battleground tracking poll
released Thursday. The poll has an error margin of 3 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has yet to see any convention ``bounce'' in
his tracking poll numbers. But in the week between the conventions
_ when he announced his selection of Connecticut Sen. Joseph
Lieberman as his running mate _ he cut in half the 18-point lead
held by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the convention, and especially Thursday, the
Democrats tried to project a feeling of unity and confidence behind
their new ticket. That's why Los Angeles Rep. Maxine Waters'
complaints about Lieberman's positions on affirmative action and
school vouchers sent party officials into a frenzy this week.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting privately with Lieberman and then listening to him
speak to the Congressional Black Caucus on Tuesday, Waters' vow of
support sounded lukewarm at best. But the feisty congresswoman
appeared to make up for it Thursday when she spoke to the
California delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My new best friend is Joe Lieberman, and make no mistake about
it,'' she said.
</P>

WITH ACCEPTANCE SPEECH, GORE REDEFINES CAMPAIGN IN TERMS
OF  ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Republicans have portrayed the 2000 election as a
campaign about leadership. Thursday night, Al Gore sought to
redefine it as a contest over issues.
</P>
<P>
   Honor, Gore declared, is earned by fighting to raise the minimum
wage, expand child care, enforce civil rights laws, protect
affirmative action and preserve a woman's right to an abortion.
Leadership, he asserted, is tested by standing up to cigarette
makers, to drug manufacturers and to big oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned President Clinton just once during the 51-minute
address. And he never brought up the matter that led to Clinton's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But the underlying message was unmistakable. Every time
Republicans bring up character _ a persistent theme of the GOP's
convention in Philadelphia two weeks ago _ Gore will respond with
issues. Responsibility, he said, is to be measured by one's
commitment to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, honor is not just a word, but an obligation,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's effort to refocus the campaign on issues is
understandable considering his double-digit deficit in the polls.
Most surveys show that while Americans agree with Gore's positions
on paying down the national debt, spending the surplus on Social
Security and Medicare, and providing new prescription drug
benefits, they see Texas Gov. George W. Bush as more of a leader.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sought to look presidential by entering the Staples Center
from a side entrance and working his way up to the podium through
the crowd a la Rocky Balboa. He then stood alone on the oversized
stage, speaking in a tone that began as reflective and built its
way up to a more combative conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore used the word ``fight'' no fewer than two dozen times,
trying to regain the spirit that propelled him past Democratic
rival Bill Bradley in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when his campaign was sputtering and Bradley was
surging past him in the polls, Gore suddenly seemed to find the
rationale for his candidacy in a series of fiery speeches in which
he presented himself as a fighter for Democratic ideals.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast at the time was with the more subdued Bradley, whom
he portrayed as merely going through an ``academic exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore would never accuse Bush of anything so cerebral. The
contrast with his GOP rival is different. When Gore first entered
the U.S. Congress, Bush was still struggling in the oil business.
When Gore was elected to the Senate, Bush was working for the Texas
Rangers baseball team. Gore was already vice president when his
opponent won his first election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not directly bring up experience, as Bush's father did
against Clinton eight years ago. But he made it clear that he has
been ``fighting'' for ``working families'' for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know this: I've taken on the powerful forces.
And as president, I'll stand up to them, and I'll stand up for
you,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Substance Over Style
</P>
<P>
   With much written about his stylistic shortcomings, Gore even
sought to turn his own reputation as an awkward speaker into an
advantage, saying: ``perhaps I talk too much substance and
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's address came two years to the day after President
Clinton's grand jury testimony in the Monica Lewinsky matter. Hours
before his speech, word spread through the convention center that a
new grand jury would investigate whether Clinton should be
prosecuted for alleged lies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made clear that he would not be hung by the rope that
Republicans have tried to use against Democrats since the scandal
first broke. He talked at length about his family, and was
introduced by his wife, Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's best family moment came 24 hours before, when he made a
surprise trip to the podium following a speech by his daughter,
Karenna. Gore walked onto the stage and gave her a warm hug. Though
he did not say a word to the delegates roaring their approval, the
moment spoke volumes about his devotion to his family.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gore rattled off a list of core Democratic
priorities, hewing less to the center than Bush did in Philadelphia
two weeks ago. Perhaps it was a reflection of Gore's need to shore
up the party's liberal base, which is less solidly behind him than
conservatives are behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But the centrist tone of the Democratic ticket was obvious
throughout the four-day convention.
</P>
<P>
   It was no coincidence that of all the Bay Area Democrats to
speak from the podium, Rep. Ellen Tauscher _ the most conservative
of the Northern California congressional delegation _ got a prime
spot on the final night.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was given a hero's welcome by the Democratic faithful, and
his speech won rave reviews in the earliest analyses.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even the most spectacular speeches sometimes lead to
unpredictable results. Former President Bush's 1988 address was the
launching point for his come from behind victory over Democrat
Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   But it contained a line that came back to haunt him four years
later.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress pushes to raise Taxes, Bush said, ``I'll say to
them: `Read my lips. No new taxes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Bush agreed to tax cuts. And two years after
that, Clinton defeated him for the presidency.

DETERIORATING NUCLEAR FLEET MAJOR CONCERN  &HT;     BY CARL T. HALL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While rescuers struggled Thursday to save the crew trapped
aboard the Kursk, horrified observers around the world warned that
a much wider-ranging disaster may be unfolding with the slow decay
of the Soviet-era war machine.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about a potential threat to the ocean environment and
human health were circulating long before the Russian submarine
sank _ just the latest incident in a continuing saga of budget woes
and official neglect for Russia's nuclear fleet.
</P>
<P>
   A sunken submarine might withstand corrosive forces for many
decades, but the odds are overwhelming that radioactive materials
will eventually find their way into the sea, ultimately posing a
threat of radiation poisoning to marine organisms.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 Soviet-built subs await decommissioning, most of
them said to be tied up in ports where they are ostensibly being
guarded. In fact, they are virtually abandoned, according to
nuclear watchdog groups in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The doomed Kursk rests in the relatively shallow waters of the
Barents Sea, where ocean currents would be most likely to spread
contamination far and wide. Meanwhile, at least five other
nuclear-powered subs, two American and three Soviet, have sunk in
much deeper water, some nearly four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, unless it's all retrieved, this material will leak
into the ocean and get into the food chain,'' said Diane D'Arrigo,
a radioactive-waste specialist at the Nuclear Information and
Resource Service, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit group. ``It's a
significant concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk represents one of the more modern nuclear-powered
vessels in Russia's beleaguered Northern Fleet, now a crumbling
relic of the once-formidable Soviet navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Northern Fleet is in bad shape,'' said Thomas Jandl,
director of the U.S. arm of Bellona, a Norwegian environmental
group that has closely tracked Russia's military for years.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of IMPACT18 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  He cited breakdowns in troop morale and discipline caused by
money shortages so bad that payrolls cannot always be met, leaving
almost nothing for adequate maintenance and training. Accidents are
an ever-present danger even when authorities try to follow
international arms-disposal agreements.
</P>
<P>
   In June, for example, a worn-out crane being used to unload a
disarmed nuclear missile dropped its payload at a dock near
Vladivostok, creating a toxic cloud that killed five people.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Thompson, a nuclear engineer at the Institute for
Resource and Security Studies, a think tank in Cambridge, Mass.,
said the issue of how to deactivate Russian nuclear submarines
safely has been building for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a bunch of these subs now awaiting decommissioning,
most of them stored with pretty minimal supervision,'' he said.
``There's a concern about those subs sinking. There are also barges
containing radioactive material that are often moored alongside,
and those also could sink and wind up contaminating the oceans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The quantity of material we are talking about is considerably
greater than just what's on this one sunken sub,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson noted that the Russians have been reluctant to discuss
some of the key details about military operations needed to get an
accurate picture of the problem, which has made it hard to estimate
the cost of a cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   The costs of doing nothing are even more difficult to calculate.
</P>
<P>
   Radioactive materials are potentially toxic for tens of
thousands of years. ``It might be decades before environmental
contamination would ensue, but you are dealing here with some very
long-lived radioactive materials,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Enough exposure can cause cancer, DNA damage and birth defects
many years later, effects that may be difficult to blame on any
particular pollution source.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the biggest problem might be if the Kursk
breaks up during a rescue operation or in attempts to raise it to
the surface. But the more likely eventuality is that it will remain
on the sea floor.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of IMPACT18 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Jandl said there is virtually no chance of any significant
contamination from the Kursk itself if that happens _ even if the
stricken sub turns out to have been carrying a full arsenal of
nuclear-tipped warheads, which Russian military officials have
denied.
</P>
<P>
   A much more serious problem, he and other experts said, has to
do with the decommissioned nuclear-powered vessels and listing
barges, nearly all of which are loaded with dangerous cargo. Many
of these corroding hulks are clustered around the northern port
region of Murmansk, home to half a million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a broader issue here,'' Jandl said. ``Even at this
point, with the Kursk still sitting there at the bottom of the
ocean, it presents much less risk than hundreds of other old chunks
of war apparatus that nobody is talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismantling one submarine costs about $25 million, said Cristina
Chuen, research associate at the Monterey Institute of
International Studies. She noted that until only recently have
other countries besides Norway and its neighbors begun to take the
problem seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other NATO powers also have their share of
military-related toxic disposal issues, but those problems seem to
pale against the near-anarchic situation in the cash-starved former
Soviet system.
</P>
<P>
   ``America had a plan to dismantle subs even while they were
being built,'' Chuen said. ``Although some things have changed, the
issue was planned out ahead of time, and there's money set aside
for it. In Russia, they didn't plan to decommission these subs
anytime soon. They thought they would just dump all the radioactive
waste into the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the problems caused by such neglect seem to be getting more
intractable _ even with international assistance.
</P>
<P>
   A Japanese-financed program to construct a nuclear-waste
processing facility _ to limit open-sea dumping _ wound up costing
at least double the initial $25 million construction estimate. With
few operating funds in sight, the project has yet to begin
full-scale operations after years of delay.
</P>
<P>
   It might take 100 years for the radioactive material to start
entering the ocean environment. Although it is hard to gauge how
bad such pollution might be, some experts argue that it is a
problem that must be reckoned with soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we have all these reactors sitting in submarines
slowly corroding somewhere,'' Chuen said. ``The longer it sits
there, the harder it is to do something about it.''

 BEFORE CLASS, A LESSON IN SALVATION  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dignity pops up in the strangest places.
</P>
<P>
   Jessie Street just off Sixth Street's sad pawn-shop row is a
urine-soaked alley and pavement hotel. At 8 o'clock Thursday
morning, a man was sipping a Colt 45 and sucking a stogie, a woman
was raging incoherently, a few street people were sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   But in front of the Salvation Army Service Center, the sidewalk
was hosed clean and a few moms and kids were lined up quietly.
</P>
<P>
   They were waiting for their appointment times to enter the
building and shop for back-to-school clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything better than wearing that cool new shirt and
carrying that brand-new notebook on the first day back to school?
Your stuff is tight and you are ready to take on whatever they
might throw at you.
</P>
<P>
   But lots of kids don't get back-to-school clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And a lot of them will delay going to school for a week or
two, so they don't have to be the only ones with no new clothes,''
says Salvation Army Lt. Col. Bettie Love.
</P>
<P>
   So every year at this time, the Army turns its big building into
a brightly decorated store where financially challenged parents who
have signed up and qualified bring their kids and load up. About
3,600 kids will shop here this week. Most of the stuff is donated
by Sears.
</P>
<P>
   There are balloons and displays, racks of nice new clothes,
underwear, backpacks, pencils and crayons. There are volunteer
personal shoppers to help with sizes and styles.
</P>
<P>
   There is no counter where someone slings you a charity bag of
donated stuff. There are no cash registers. There is dignity.
</P>
<P>
   First into the store is a grandma named Leather. She's shopping
for her five grandchildren, ages 5 through 13, who live with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have to buy clothes, but this will help,'' she says.
``I'm on SSI, their mother is in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrell, third grade, holds up his new sweat pants, WWF T-shirt
and hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get new friends,'' he says. ``I'll fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll fit in because of your personality and attitude,'' his
mother says.
</P>
<P>
   But now maybe he'll fit in better with himself.
</P>
<P>
   A SENSE OF humor, whatever happened to that?
</P>
<P>
   The MasterCard people are suing the Ralph Nader campaign because
a Nader-for-prez TV commercial is a spoof of MasterCard's
``Priceless Moments'' TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``(W)e will always do whatever it takes to protect the
campaign,'' said a high-ranking MasterCard drone.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy Awards people are miffed at Gov. Gray Davis for
presenting President Clinton with a spoof Oscar statuette at a
party Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy folk are afraid people think it's a real Oscar and
an official presentation. Do those movie people think we're idiots?
Wait, I've seen a couple of movies lately. They do think we're
idiots.
</P>
<P>
   But you know, it's time the Academy people admitted their
horrible error in not awarding Clinton the real best-actor Oscar
for his performance in the ``That Woman, Miss Lewinsky'' speech. I
get emotional just thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   SAD DAYS at Mama's, the little breakfast-lunch cafe on
Washington Square. Frances Muriel Sanchez _ Mama to everyone _
passed away last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   She also had restaurants at Macy's and on Nob Hill, and they say
Mama gave out as many free meals, through various charitable causes
and simply over the sill, as she sold.
</P>
<P>
   She could sing, and socialize. And cook? Says one regular, ``I
remember seeing Julia Child standing in line for a breakfast
table.''
</P>
<P>
   FOR EVERY item there is an equal and opposite correction.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's easternmost province is  &UR; not  &LR; a tip of Alameda
that spills over the mid-Bay boundary line, maintains Steven
Appleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the Sierra, where the City is the proud owner of the
Hetch Hetchy dam and watershed system.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, Jeff. That can't be part of San Francisco. I've been to
Hetch Hetchy. There's parking.
</P>
<P>
   And re: an item about Palo Alto's golden retrievers who drive
Porsches, Jeff Denno says, ``I would have thought they would have
preferred to drive Rovers.''
</P>
<P>
   DASHIN' NASH Bridges has the cool car, and in a recently filmed
episode he was bustin' the bay in a 38-foot Donzi Daytona
speedboat.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Rinehart, a San Rafael boat broker often used as a maritime
tech adviser for movies and TV, says the boat sells for around
$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could Nash buy one of those on a police captain's salary?''
Joe wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Joe hasn't heard about the city employees' generous overtime
scams.
</P>
<P>
   AT LEAST BART has a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   At the Colma BART station, Holly Rizzo has noticed a brand-new
electronic message sign in the window of one information booth. All
week the sign has said in bright red letters, ``Welcome to Coma.''

   It's a party. BYO life support.

AFTER UPN, FOX FIGURES TO FILL A VOID WITH MORE VOID 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So News Corp., which is to say Fox, will buy the Chris-Craft
television stations, squeeze out UPN and launch another Fox
network.
</P>
<P>
   Those stations include KBHK in San Francisco, and Rupert Murdoch
says a Fox 2 broadcast network is under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Without the stations that formed its core group, Viacom's UPN
network faces extinction even before its name changes to the
Paramount Network.
</P>
<P>
   But let's bring it down to earth. What this means to you is that
in one giant leap, you could go from ``Shasta McNasty'' to
something not quite as good as ``World's Wildest Police Chases.''
</P>
<P>
   What a bargain for the public.
</P>
<P>
   That's why God put Murdoch on the planet, and gave him American
citizenship along with all the newspapers and TV networks he could
possibly eat. And then some more.
</P>
<P>
   When Murdoch burps, he exhales the gaseous fumes of yet another
TV network.
</P>
<P>
   I'd weep no tears for UPN, a network that found its raison
d'etre in inciting hormonal disturbances among 13-year-old boys.
</P>
<P>
   But the slumberous public officials who are supposed to regulate
the broadcasting industry ought to prop themselves up on their
elbows, clear the cobwebs and ask a question.
</P>
<P>
   Why should Fox program another broadcast network when it can't
even program the original Fox?
</P>
<P>
   I direct your attention to the Fox fall schedule. At 8 p.m.
Wednesdays, watch for that audience favorite, ``To Be Announced.''
At 8:30 Wednesdays, ``The Untitled John Goodman Project.'' Just
Thursday, it was named ``Normal, Ohio.'' It'll premiere ...
sometime abnormal.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 p.m. Thursdays, ``To Be Announced.'' At 9 p.m. Thursdays,
``To Be Announced.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox is scampering toward the fall season in wild disarray,
without dirt to fill all the holes. The average job tenure of its
entertainment presidents is roughly six minutes. If that's the
state of Fox's A team, what'll make its way onto a Fox 2 schedule?
Reruns of ``To Be Announced''?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Fox is more than broadcast TV. It's also cable. Lots
of cable, including the extra-glossy FX cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, one of the signature shows on FX is the bonzo bikini
Howard Stern production, ``Son of the Beach,'' which to date has
consumed 15 hours of time _ 15 minutes of which were funny.
</P>
<P>
   The TV industry has never been more industrial. It's big, and
ever bigger, companies trying to seize every programming venue in
sight, but demonstrating zero programming acumen to fill the
acquired space.
</P>
<P>
   The object, at a time of splintered audiences, is to grab shelf
space and hope your Fox-Fox 2-Fox Family Channel-FX-Fox News
Channel-Fox Sports is in aggregate huger than the other guy's
CBS-UPN-Showtime-MTV-VH1-Nickelodeon-et al.
</P>
<P>
   But consolidation hasn't been a vitamin for valuable programming
ideas to benefit the public. The blind energy is devoted to
acquisitions and mergers. Then the dust settles on low-rent
programming.
</P>
<P>
   To fulfill its neglected promise, television needs fewer bean
counters and more artisans. The trend line runs the other
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate reach exceeds creative grasp. It's the story of
television at the moment. Conglomerates want plenty, only to
deliver plenty of nuttin'.

AN OFFICE AWAY FROM HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By KELLY YAMANOUCHI  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Somewhere between road warrior and telecommuter
in traffic-clogged Marin County, Calif., Sue Russell has found the
workplace that makes the best use of her time.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Russell had dreaded fighting traffic for nearly an
hour to get to work, but she didn't like the idea of working from
home.
</P>
<P>
   Now, each morning she drives five minutes to a small office park
near her Petaluma, Calif., home, sets up her laptop and works for a
couple of hours. By 10 a.m., when the rush hour has passed, she
gets into her car for a smooth sail on Highway 101 to her office at
Fair, Isaac &AMP; Co. in San Rafael, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping employees content in their jobs by easing their commute
is a big priority for companies trying to attract and retain
workers.
</P>
<P>
   For many companies, telecommuting has been a popular choice to
offer employees frustrated with traffic tie-ups and rising gas
prices.
</P>
<P>
   However, it isn't the answer for those whose office homes are
simply too noisy or distracting. It also doesn't work for those
whose homes aren't technologically equipped for their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In these circumstances, enterprising companies are setting up
telecommuting centers somewhere between the residential areas of
their workers and the company office.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement is flexible enough to allow telecommuters to
work there a couple of hours or the entire day.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are beginning to take note on how it can be used,''
said David Fleming, telework consultant to the state Department of
Personnel Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The telecenter idea surfaced six years ago when the California
Department of Transportation sponsored the opening of 15 sites.
Short on money for marketing, the idea never caught on, and the
underused centers eventually closed.
</P>
<P>
   The centers have been a tough sell in the private sector.
Consultants in the telecommuting industry say they have been trying
to gain support for the idea, but some managers are reluctant to
make the investment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, transportation consultants hope technological advances
will make these centers more attractive. With high-speed Internet
access connections more accessible for small-business operations,
commute centers can now be run more effectively than five years
ago, said Jeffrey Weil, a commercial real estate broker.
</P>
<P>
   Fair, Isaac, a financial softwaremaker with a number of
employees living in the Petaluma area, is among a handful of
companies in the San Francisco Bay Area that has opened telecommute
centers in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 14 employees use Fair, Isaac's Petaluma telecommuting
center daily.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, which invested $150,000 to set up the office three
years ago, spends $6,500 a month in rent and operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to 22 workstations, the center has such amenities as
conference rooms, a fax machine, a copier, printers, filing
cabinets, a refrigerator and a coffeemaker.
</P>
<P>
   The tab for rent and upkeep can add up. Abe Kleinfeld, who
manages the center, has had to start seeking ways to cut costs.
Other businesses, including Birkenstock, Autodesk and PG&AMP;E, have
asked to share the resource and expenses with Fair, Isaac so they
can offer the benefit to their employees. But Kleinfeld said he
first has to work out the possible security and safety risks.
</P>
<P>
   For those workers who have used it, the center has been a plus.
On a day when he works from the commute center, ``I get more time
at home and more time at the office,'' said Len Mowat, a Fair,
Isaac manager.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said that if she doesn't have meetings to attend, she
works all day from the commute office.
</P>
<P>
   She said it is not feasible to work from home because her
husband runs a home-based business that uses her home's only phone
line. In addition, her 9-year-old son and 6-year-old twin daughters
can be distracting.
</P>
<P>
   As a mother, Russell finds the commute center convenient. If she
has to take her kids to the doctor or ballet lessons in Petaluma
during the day, she will bring her kids to the commute center,
where they play in a conference room when it isn't being used.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're loud, it may interrupt people, but at least not as
many are being interrupted'' compared with the larger San Rafael
office, Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Fair, Isaac employees say the company generally trusts its
employees to regulate their own work, adding that the firm
considers it more important to get the job done than to worry about
how many hours a worker is seen in the office.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, who has worked at Fair, Isaac for 11 years and is now a
senior employee, said there was no problem getting approval from
her manager to use the commute center.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommute center works best for employees with
information-based jobs that can be done anywhere with a network
connection and a telephone. In that regard, industry experts say
such centers suit the needs of the Bay Area's many high-tech and
financial-services workers.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Mountain View, Calif., chip designer Synopsys. It
opened a telecommuting center in Pleasanton, Calif., a year ago to
cater to the needs of about 200 employees living on the east side
of San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of public transportation between the East Bay and
Mountain View forced workers in the Livermore, Calif., area, for
instance, to make a nearly two hour-drive in sluggish traffic to
the company office.
</P>
<P>
   The Pleasanton telecommuting center enables Synopsys employees
to work out of that office until highway gridlock eases.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Donaldson, the facility director, said East Bay
employees are saving eight to nine hours a week under the
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the gain in productivity, supporters of such centers
say the facilities help recruit and retain employees. Synopsys
found it could broaden its search for workers to as far east as
Stockton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Trent West, a software engineer, said having the option to use
the commute center was a tie-breaking factor between Fair, Isaac
and another job offer.
</P>
<P>
   When he doesn't have meetings, he works all day at the commute
center. In Petaluma, there are far fewer interruptions than during
a typical day in San Rafael. There is the option of working at
home, but there, he has only one phone line and a slower network
connection.
</P>
<P>
   A satellite office can also help a company pare operational
costs. For companies with offices in downtown areas where office
rents are high, Weil said, a satellite office paired with other
cost-saving measures can be a better deal than a branch office.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommuting center idea isn't for everyone, especially
those concerned with having enough ``face time'' with their bosses.
And anyone who thrives on the company's social environment would
wither away in the rather silent Petaluma commute center.
</P>
<P>
   But coping with a nomadic work style may be worth it for those
who put a premium on their free time, outside of the driver's seat.
Spending a day working from an office closer to home might mean
that a working parent can make it to a soccer game, rather than
getting home at a child's bedtime, Donaldson said.

SHAREHOLDER RETURN NOT HURT BY BROAD OPTION PLANS, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHLEEN PENDER  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Giving stock options to most employees, not just
top executives, has a negligible impact on shareholder returns,
according to the biggest study yet on broad-based stock option
plans.
</P>
<P>
   That's actually good news for shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Companies tout stock option plans as a good way to attract top
employees, and get them thinking like investors. But many
shareholders fear that broad-based stock option plans will dilute
earnings per share.
</P>
<P>
   When employees cash in their options to buy SUVs and overpriced
bungalows, new shares begin trading _ and unless earnings grow
apace, earnings per share will fall and the stock price will
follow.
</P>
<P>
   The Rutgers University team that conducted the study didn't look
at earnings, but it did look at shareholder return, return on
assets, worker productivity and a statistic so arcane _ called
Tobin's Q _ that I won't even mention it again.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers compared 490 companies that have broad-based
plans to about 7,000 that don't.
</P>
<P>
   To try to determine cause and effect, they compared results from
1985 to 1987, before most companies even dreamed of giving stock
options to people in the mail room _ with results from 1995 to
1997, after most plans had been implemented.
</P>
<P>
   To adjust for industry factors, they also compared each company
that offered options with its two closest competitors that did not.
</P>
<P>
   The full report is available at
www.nceo.org/library/optionreport.html. Although the authors say
the report is ``written for the non-technical reader,'' it's chock
full of numbers and seemingly contradictory evidence. But here are
some things the authors feel certain about:
</P>
<P>
   _ Even before they implemented broad-based stock option plans,
companies that did so had more productive, higher-paid workforces
than other companies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Workers got even more productive after the company showered
them with stock options, but only at first.
</P>
<P>
   For example, productivity at companies with options went from
9.3 percent higher than average in 1985-87 to 29.4 percent higher
in 1995-97. Compared with their competitors, productivity went from
5.4 percent higher to 22.2 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   However, once it reached a higher level, productivity did not
grow faster at stock-option companies than at non-stock-option
companies.
</P>
<P>
   _At first blush, stock option plans seemed to benefit
shareholders. From 1992 to 1997, the median return to shareholders
for companies with plans was 164 percent, compared with only 82
percent for all companies without plans.
</P>
<P>
   But the authors felt academically obligated to compare apples to
apples, so they adjusted for differences in company size, industry,
and other factors. When they did that, the difference between
option and non-option companies became statistically insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't find a negative effect, but we're not confident
there's a clear benefit to shareholders,'' says co-author Douglas
Kruse.
</P>
<P>
   Co-author James Sesil speculates that ``the productivity gains
are making up for the (earnings) dilution,'' leaving shareholders
no better or worse off.
</P>
<P>
   _ Companies did not cut worker pay after they starting doling
out stock options; nor did they increase the premium they were
already paying.
</P>
<P>
   Kruse says companies with options paid employees about 8 percent
better than average before and after the plans were adopted.
</P>
<P>
   While workers with stock options clearly benefitted financially,
the authors aren't sure if their increased productivity comes from
working more hours, or working more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   _ The study has important implications for U.S. economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   The results ``certainly lend some support to the position that
broad-based stock option payments ... may have significantly
contributed to unmeasured hidden wage inflation,'' the authors
state.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: ``There have been competing views over whether
stock option plans are good for companies and good for investors
and good for employees,'' says Kruse. ``What we find is that
investors may be helped and are certainly not hurt, and that
employees seem to be helped. This is added to their regular
compensation, and productivity levels seem to increase.''
</P>
<P>
   LATEST BULL ON TV: How authentic is ``Bull,'' television's first
attempt to hook demographically desirable viewers with a weekly
show glamorizing Wall Street?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was rolling my eyes through the whole thing,'' says Cristina
Morgan, co-head of investment banking at Chase H&AMP;Q in San
Francisco. ``Like all TV shows, they have to overdramatize things
to make it interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she said she'd watch it again, Morgan said the one-hour
program, which debuted Tuesday night on cable channel TNT, is even
less realistic than cop, doctor and lawyer shows. Because IPOs and
currency swaps don't usually involve life or death, Bull's
producers have to go even farther out on a limb to create tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as everyone would like to believe our business is full
of intrigue and skullduggery, there's a lot of stuff that's awful
straightforward and boring,'' Morgan says.
</P>
<P>
   Most people I talked to say the show captured the essense of a
brokerage house and used the jargon accurately. But apparently most
MBAs aren't (begin italics) quite (end italics) as gorgeous as the
actors on ``Bull.'' (The only schlumpy character is a newspaper
reporter.)
</P>
<P>
   Morgan and others say the most implausible plot line involved
the head of the Wall Street firm blatantly violating insider
trading laws.
</P>
<P>
   Another blooper: Two businessmen agree to a merger, then one
turns around and hands his investment banker an envelope _ payment
for merger advisory services.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Morgan says, investment bankers get paid only if and
when a merger goes through, which is many months after the
handshake deal.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Bigelow, a vice president with Robertson Stephens in San
Francisco, caught another mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a scene where some people are talking about a merger
in front of the brokerage people.'' In practice, merger and
brokerage people usually keep their activities separate, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago _ before CNBC and day trading and Motley Fool _
Bigelow says she started to write a screenplay about a brokerage
firm, but gave up when she figured there wouldn't be an audience
for it. Maybe Bigelow was just slightly ahead of her time.
</P>
<P>
   Correction
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's column, I misquoted Stacey Ho saying the dollar
fell by half from 1985 to 1999. That should have been 1985 to 1989.
Sorry for the error, Stacey.

rents are high, Weil said, a satellite office paired with other
cost-saving measures can be a better deal than a branch office.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommuting center idea isn't for everyone, especially
those concerned with having enough ``face time'' with their bosses.
And anyone who thrives on the company's social environment would
wither away in the rather silent Petaluma commute center.
</P>
<P>
   But coping with a nomadic work style may be worth it for those
who put a premium on their free time, outside of the driver's seat.
Spending a day working from an office closer to home might mean
that a working parent can make it to a soccer game, rather than
getting home at a child's bedtime, Donaldson said.

SHAREHOLDER RETURN NOT HURT BY BROAD OPTION PLANS, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHLEEN PENDER  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Giving stock options to most employees, not just
top executives, has a negligible impact on shareholder returns,
according to the biggest study yet on broad-based stock option
plans.
</P>
<P>
   That's actually good news for shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Companies tout stock option plans as a good way to attract top
employees, and get them thinking like investors. But many
shareholders fear that broad-based stock option plans will dilute
earnings per share.
</P>
<P>
   When employees cash in their options to buy SUVs and overpriced
bungalows, new shares begin trading _ and unless earnings grow
apace, earnings per share will fall and the stock price will
follow.
</P>
<P>
   The Rutgers University team that conducted the study didn't look
at earnings, but it did look at shareholder return, return on
assets, worker productivity and a statistic so arcane _ called
Tobin's Q _ that I won't even mention it again.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers compared 490 companies that have broad-based
plans to about 7,000 that don't.
</P>
<P>
   To try to determine cause and effect, they compared results from
1985 to 1987, before most companies even dreamed of giving stock
options to people in the mail room _ with results from 1995 to
1997, after most plans had been implemented.
</P>
<P>
   To adjust for industry factors, they also compared each company
that offered options with its two closest competitors that did not.
</P>
<P>
   The full report is available at
www.nceo.org/library/optionreport.html. Although the authors say
the report is ``written for the non-technical reader,'' it's chock
full of numbers and seemingly contradictory evidence. But here are
some things the authors feel certain about:
</P>
<P>
   _ Even before they implemented broad-based stock option plans,
companies that did so had more productive, higher-paid workforces
than other companies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Workers got even more productive after the company showered
them with stock options, but only at first.
</P>
<P>
   For example, productivity at companies with options went from
9.3 percent higher than average in 1985-87 to 29.4 percent higher
in 1995-97. Compared with their competitors, productivity went from
5.4 percent higher to 22.2 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   However, once it reached a higher level, productivity did not
grow faster at stock-option companies than at non-stock-option
companies.
</P>
<P>
   _At first blush, stock option plans seemed to benefit
shareholders. From 1992 to 1997, the median return to shareholders
for companies with plans was 164 percent, compared with only 82
percent for all companies without plans.
</P>
<P>
   But the authors felt academically obligated to compare apples to
apples, so they adjusted for differences in company size, industry,
and other factors. When they did that, the difference between
option and non-option companies became statistically insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't find a negative effect, but we're not confident
there's a clear benefit to shareholders,'' says co-author Douglas
Kruse.
</P>
<P>
   Co-author James Sesil speculates that ``the productivity gains
are making up for the (earnings) dilution,'' leaving shareholders
no better or worse off.
</P>
<P>
   _ Companies did not cut worker pay after they starting doling
out stock options; nor did they increase the premium they were
already paying.
</P>
<P>
   Kruse says companies with options paid employees about 8 percent
better than average before and after the plans were adopted.
</P>
<P>
   While workers with stock options clearly benefitted financially,
the authors aren't sure if their increased productivity comes from
working more hours, or working more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   _ The study has important implications for U.S. economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   The results ``certainly lend some support to the position that
broad-based stock option payments ... may have significantly
contributed to unmeasured hidden wage inflation,'' the authors
state.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: ``There have been competing views over whether
stock option plans are good for companies and good for investors
and good for employees,'' says Kruse. ``What we find is that
investors may be helped and are certainly not hurt, and that
employees seem to be helped. This is added to their regular
compensation, and productivity levels seem to increase.''
</P>
<P>
   LATEST BULL ON TV: How authentic is ``Bull,'' television's first
attempt to hook demographically desirable viewers with a weekly
show glamorizing Wall Street?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was rolling my eyes through the whole thing,'' says Cristina
Morgan, co-head of investment banking at Chase H&AMP;Q in San
Francisco. ``Like all TV shows, they have to overdramatize things
to make it interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she said she'd watch it again, Morgan said the one-hour
program, which debuted Tuesday night on cable channel TNT, is even
less realistic than cop, doctor and lawyer shows. Because IPOs and
currency swaps don't usually involve life or death, Bull's
producers have to go even farther out on a limb to create tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as everyone would like to believe our business is full
of intrigue and skullduggery, there's a lot of stuff that's awful
straightforward and boring,'' Morgan says.
</P>
<P>
   Most people I talked to say the show captured the essense of a
brokerage house and used the jargon accurately. But apparently most
MBAs aren't (begin italics) quite (end italics) as gorgeous as the
actors on ``Bull.'' (The only schlumpy character is a newspaper
reporter.)
</P>
<P>
   Morgan and others say the most implausible plot line involved
the head of the Wall Street firm blatantly violating insider
trading laws.
</P>
<P>
   Another blooper: Two businessmen agree to a merger, then one
turns around and hands his investment banker an envelope _ payment
for merger advisory services.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Morgan says, investment bankers get paid only if and
when a merger goes through, which is many months after the
handshake deal.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Bigelow, a vice president with Robertson Stephens in San
Francisco, caught another mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a scene where some people are talking about a merger
in front of the brokerage people.'' In practice, merger and
brokerage people usually keep their activities separate, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago _ before CNBC and day trading and Motley Fool _
Bigelow says she started to write a screenplay about a brokerage
firm, but gave up when she figured there wouldn't be an audience
for it. Maybe Bigelow was just slightly ahead of her time.
</P>
<P>
   Correction
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's column, I misquoted Stacey Ho saying the dollar
fell by half from 1985 to 1999. That should have been 1985 to 1989.
Sorry for the error, Stacey.

 &UR; SATELLITE:  &LR; Keeping employees content in their jobs by easing their
commute is a big priority for companies trying to attract and
retain workers. For many companies, telecommuting has been a
popular choice to offer employees frustrated with traffic tie-ups
and rising gas prices. However, it isn't the answer for those whose
office homes are simply too noisy or distracting. It also doesn't
work for those whose homes aren't technologically equipped for
their jobs. In these circumstances, enterprising companies are
setting up telecommuting centers somewhere between the residential
areas of their workers and the company office.  &UR; By &LR;

the newly opened New Covenant charter school in Albany last fall,
he proclaimed it a model of the kind of educational change he was
trying to create. In the months following the visit, however, New
Covenant descended into apparent chaos, with fourth-graders scoring
among the lowest in the state on standardized tests, the for-profit

   APPLES-SEATTLE (Seattle) _ It is difficult to think of any city,
other than the urban behemoths like New York and Los Angeles, and
maybe Washington, that has shaped modern living in the United
States as much as this one. Nordstrom, Boeing, Microsoft,
Starbucks, Amazon: all innovators, all based here in the Pacific
Northwest, off in a remote corner of the nation, far from the main
centers of population. Yet they play a central part in daily life
across this continent and beyond. Seattle still has its funky side.
It revels in its mellow small-town atmosphere; a Seattle ad man

 PERSONALS: A Baby by Any Other Name 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file.) &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By LEAH GARCHIK &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle &LR;  &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Following a path blazed when Candlestick became 3Com, a Hutchinson,
Kan., couple have won $5,000 by naming their just-born baby boy
 &UR; Iuma Dylan-Lucas Thornhill &LR; , his first name in paid homage to
Internet Underground Music Archive of Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its offer of the prize, to the first 10 babies
named Iuma born between August 1 and November 1, is ``the final
frontier in online marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Iuma's father,  &UR; Travis Thornhill &LR; , 22, said he had learned about
the contest the night before the baby was born and discussed it
with his wife,  &UR; Jessica &LR; , 21. They decided to go ahead with the
name because his mother, who he said is a metaphysical type,
predicted that the child would bring prosperity and good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; WATERS' WORST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; John Waters &LR; , always a fount of opinions, told the New York
Post that ``Patch Adams'' and ``Forrest Gump'' are ``the twin
towers of bad cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both movies are shockingly bad,'' he said, ``but I think
`Patch Adams' is the `Pink Flamingos' for my generation. It's an
amazingly scary movie. Making me watch `Patch Adams' is like making
my grandmother watch `Pink Flamingos.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; BRIGHT IDEAS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ In order to take advantage of the youthful passion for rainbow
hair colors, Clairol has a new XtremeFX hair color line aimed at
13- to 24-year-olds. Product manager  &UR; Karen Murabito &LR;  told the Wall
Street Journal that the company had rewritten its standard
instructions, using new ones with graffiti-style drawings and
phrases such as ``get it on'' instead of ``apply the product.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Writing in the Vallejo, Calif., journal Venus,  &UR; April Fresh &LR; 
describes the difficulties of finding brassieres appropriate for
women rock 'n' rollers. ``After coming home from show after show
with strap burns and soar (sic) breasts, I knew it was time to take
matters into my own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The RockBra, as described by Fresh but not yet manufactured,
would protect shoulders from guitar strap rub with one extra-wide
padded crossover strap. The other strap would be thin to allow the
free arm to swing around. Extra-firm padding in the cups would give
the breasts ``a safe landing area if jumping up and down is your
thing.'' The front would be cut extra high ``to prevent them from
coming out of the top of the bra.''
</P>
<P>
   The inventor says she's not ``trying to reach out to the
 &UR; Mariah Carey &LR; s or  &UR; Britney Spears &LR;  of the world. . . . It's all
about feeling good. Really good.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Stosh Wychulus &LR; , Personals' correspondent from the Market
Street Safeway in San Francisco, reports that an in-store Starbucks
Express kiosk is under construction, and coffee cup holders have
been installed on shopping carts. He's excited by the prospect of
``yuppies talking on their cell phones and mainlining caffeine as
they shop. Can aisle rage be far behind?''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Prince William &LR;  is to attend St. Andrews University in

Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   _ W reports that  &UR; Giorgio Armani &LR; , who is opening a new store in
Rome, has been lobbying the government to remove a monument he says
is an eyesore. The work, an homage to former President and Prime
Minister  &UR; Sandro Pertini &LR; , stands in the piazza outside his store.
</P>
<P>
   Rival  &UR; Gianfranco Ferre &LR;  weighs in: ``Whether Giorgio likes it
or not, that monument is part of the city's cultural face. He only
noticed it now, because of the opening of the store.''

<P>
   _ The TV series ``West Wing'' won a Family Television Award but
has subsequently returned it, reports the Chicago Tribune.
Co-Executive Producer  &UR; John Wells &LR;  gave it back after an acceptance
speech made by  &UR; Allison Janney &LR;  _ who plays press secretary C.J.
Gregg _ was edited for the telecast of the ceremony. Janney's
expressed support of an actors strike was removed from her remarks.

<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;

 PERSONALS: A Baby by Any Other Name

 &QL; 
Following a path blazed when Candlestick became 3Com, a Hutchinson,
Kan., couple have won $5,000 by naming their just-born baby boy
 &UR; Iuma Dylan-Lucas Thornhill &LR; , his first name in paid homage to
Internet Underground Music Archive of Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its offer of the prize, to the first 10 babies
named Iuma born between August 1 and November 1, is ``the final
frontier in online marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Iuma's father,  &UR; Travis Thornhill &LR; , 22, said he had learned about
the contest the night before the baby was born and discussed it
with his wife,  &UR; Jessica &LR; , 21. They decided to go ahead with the
name because his mother, who he said is a metaphysical type,
predicted that the child would bring prosperity and good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; WATERS' WORST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; John Waters &LR; , always a fount of opinions, told the New York
Post that ``Patch Adams'' and ``Forrest Gump'' are ``the twin
towers of bad cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both movies are shockingly bad,'' he said, ``but I think
`Patch Adams' is the `Pink Flamingos' for my generation. It's an
amazingly scary movie. Making me watch `Patch Adams' is like making
my grandmother watch `Pink Flamingos.' ''

 &UR; BRIGHT IDEAS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ In order to take advantage of the youthful passion for rainbow
hair colors, Clairol has a new XtremeFX hair color line aimed at
13- to 24-year-olds. Product manager  &UR; Karen Murabito &LR;  told the Wall
Street Journal that the company had rewritten its standard
instructions, using new ones with graffiti-style drawings and
phrases such as ``get it on'' instead of ``apply the product.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Writing in the Vallejo, Calif., journal Venus,  &UR; April Fresh &LR; 
describes the difficulties of finding brassieres appropriate for
women rock 'n' rollers. ``After coming home from show after show
with strap burns and soar (sic) breasts, I knew it was time to take
matters into my own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The RockBra, as described by Fresh but not yet manufactured,
would protect shoulders from guitar strap rub with one extra-wide
padded crossover strap. The other strap would be thin to allow the
free arm to swing around. Extra-firm padding in the cups would give
the breasts ``a safe landing area if jumping up and down is your
thing.'' The front would be cut extra high ``to prevent them from
coming out of the top of the bra.''
</P>
<P>
   The inventor says she's not ``trying to reach out to the
 &UR; Mariah Carey &LR; s or  &UR; Britney Spears &LR;  of the world. . . . It's all
about feeling good. Really good.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Stosh Wychulus &LR; , Personals' correspondent from the Market
Street Safeway in San Francisco, reports that an in-store Starbucks
Express kiosk is under construction, and coffee cup holders have
been installed on shopping carts. He's excited by the prospect of
``yuppies talking on their cell phones and mainlining caffeine as
they shop. Can aisle rage be far behind?''

 &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Prince William &LR;  is to attend St. Andrews University in
Scotland, where he will major in art history, says the British
Press Association.

<P>
   _ W reports that  &UR; Giorgio Armani &LR; , who is opening a new store in
Rome, has been lobbying the government to remove a monument he says
is an eyesore. The work, an homage to former President and Prime
Minister  &UR; Sandro Pertini &LR; , stands in the piazza outside his store.
</P>

   Rival  &UR; Gianfranco Ferre &LR;  weighs in: ``Whether Giorgio likes it

PROTESTS FAIL TO MAKE POINTS AMID DISORDER

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After three days of clashes and sporadic violence,
protesters at the Democratic National Convention found their
message washed out Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With protest violence being shut down by pepper spray and rubber
bullets during the first three days, and an overwhelming police
presence throughout, protests fizzled on the last day of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of protests went peacefully with one arrest:
</P>
<P>
   _ About 2,000 marched downtown for garment workers, through
areas where many work, urging more rights, fewer hours, better pay
and reformed immigration policies.
</P>
<P>
   _ A few hundred protested in front of the federal building,
urging the Navy to leave a controversial bomb range in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   _ Activists in a crowd of about 100 rallied outside Citibank,
calling the company a ``corporate slumlord.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Environmental activists protested outside Vice President Al
Gore's hotel in Culver City.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore accepted the Democratic nomination, about 2,000 people
attended a concert in the protest area outside Staples Center where
protesters and police violently clashed Monday night. The concert
turned into a peaceful march of about 500 toward the Twin Towers
Correctional Facility.
</P>
<P>
   There, people held a vigil for those arrested during the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters blamed the wilting heat, the previous violence and
the overwhelming police presence for the low energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous that the media is not paying attention to
us,'' said Maria Rangle, a downtown garment worker. ``This is what
we're protesting for _ higher wages and workers benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, a critic of the police
actions, marched in the garment worker protest and said there were
too many officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things would have been just as smooth with half the police,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But police, and their supporters, were happy with the way
convention protests turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested 193 people. Charges have been filed against 92
so far, and charges against 40 were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   There was one arrest Thursday, as a woman cited for jaywalking
during the protest against the Navy's involvement in Puerto Rico
was taken into custody because she didn't have identification. No
other arrests were reported by early Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan offered a strong endorsement of police
Chief Bernard C. Parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a strong commander,'' Riordan said of the chief, who has
faced strong criticism in the wake of the Rampart corruption
scandal. ``He's absolutely the right person for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks went to ``Dome Village'' near downtown to apologize for
the injuries to homeless activist Ted Hayes, one of several dozen
protesters injured Monday. The chief also apologized for others
injured, including news media representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sorry if anyone was injured unnecessarily,'' Parks said
at an impromptu press conference at the camp.
</P>
<P>
   But he made no apology for police actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to preserve lives and (prevent) property
damage, and we've been successful doing that,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes said he's not angry at the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had promised to be there, but we didn't realize the tense
situation that was occurring at the time,'' Hayes said. ``We blame
the unruly people who started the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan marveled at the work it took to control the protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in America are we putting many millions of dollars into
controlling strategic demonstrations like this when I think that
money should be going to poor people,'' he said. ``Let the
demonstrators get their point across. When you have turmoil, you
wonder what their message is. It gets confused.''
</P>
<P>
   That was an argument among protesters earlier in the day at
Pershing Square, where some squared off over violent protests.
</P>
<P>
   Green Party activist Whitney Zack, 56, of Oakhurst, Calif., said
she wants issues to get in the media, not the confrontations that
have been stealing headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to make ourselves human to (police) and see their
humanity,'' Zack said. ``The police will react. I got two batons in
my back (Wednesday). All you saw in the media was the skirmishes,
the arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   Zack tried to make her point to anarchists and anti-police
brutality demonstrators in Pershing Square.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Williams, 58, of San Diego, an anti-police brutality
activist, said the message was aimed at the wrong target.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of their focus seemed to be on telling us how to act and
not telling the police how to react,'' he said. ``The protesters
are out here without weapons, with all the military strength of the
police department _ the weapons, the batons, the gas, the rubber
bullets _ how is it possible that 3,000 unarmed demonstrators could
be such a threat?''
</P>
<P>
   George Becker, international president of the United
Steelworkers of America, said the police overreacted to the
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They scare the hell out of them,'' said Becker, who was
standing outside watching police in riot gear surround the
protesters at Citibank. ``These are storm troopers. They are here
to knock the hell out of these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the building, workers said they found the protest
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Cedars Bank loan officer Jim Busick watched the Citibank
protests through the windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been kind of entertaining to watch the police tactics,''
he said.

LANSING, SOX RALLY IN NINTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dreams are made of this.
</P>
<P>
   A ball club bearing generations of unrequited hope spirals into
a morass of run-scoring misery. Each inning yields another lesson
in futility, as the days of the season dwindle and the situation
grows more dire.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the Improbable, if not _ dare anyone say it _ the
Impossible Dream.
</P>
<P>
   Defying every law of winning baseball except the most important
_ it ain't over 'til it's over _ the Red Sox Thursday night ended
their minidrama in Fenway with a cathartic, 8-7 victory over the
Texas Rangers. The crucial, come-from-far-behind triumph was capped
by Mike Lansing's two-out double off the Wall with the bases loaded
in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Lansing crushed the winning hit on a night when the Sox had
seemed to invent ways to stymie themselves, leaving a staggering 15
runners on base and going 4 for 22 with runners in scoring
position. They had stranded 30 runners in the previous three games,
and their playoff chances appeared more in jeopardy with each
botched opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, they were in danger of falling five games behind
the East-leading Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, as 33,510 paying customers departed in glee and
tens of thousands of others in Red Sox country went to bed happy,
the Sox sensed something magical unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody can kind of feel the momentum changing,'' said
designated hitter Scott Hatteberg, who started the winning rally by
drawing a one-out walk off one of the game's top closers, John
Wetteland. ``We're going to be excited tonight, but we're
definitely going to carry it through (today.)''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Texas made the improbable occur. With two out
and Texas leading, 7-5, and Darren Lewis on first running for
Hatteberg, Jose Offerman whacked a single to right.
</P>
<P>
   A newcomer, Rico Brogna, who hit a two-out grand slam in the
ninth Monday night to lift the Sox to a dramatic victory over Tampa
Bay, ran for Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gilkey reached first, loading the bases, when shortstop
Royce Clayton bobbled his routine grounder. Wetteland then hit Carl
Everett, scoring Lewis and cutting the Sox deficit to 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Up came Lansing, picked up last month from Colorado with pitcher
Rolando Arrojo. Lansing took a strike from Wetteland, then pounded
his next pitch off the Wall to score Brogna and Gilkey and win the
game. His teammates promptly mobbed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't like waiting until the last at-bat,'' Lansing said,
``but they're a lot of fun when you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams, who used every available position player,
vouched for that. The Sox were trailing, 6-2, after seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great victory for us to come back like that,'' Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up the win, Rich Garces became the first reliever in Sox
history to start a season 8-0. Garces, who has now won his last 13
decisions, had seen that the Yankees won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important for us to win today because of the
Yankees,'' he said. ``Now we don't have to worry about them for a
day.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Rangers, one of this season's biggest disappointments
after winning the AL West last year, the loss seemed like a
microcosm of a season gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game mirrored our whole season a lot,'' manager Johnny
Oates said. ``It stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing was, it was the Sox whose situation seemed so
desperate earlier in the night that the Fenway organist played a
rhapsodic version of ``Say A Little Prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even that didn't help, at least until the last three innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox wasted promising scoring opportunities in each of the
first six innings. In the second, for example. Back-to-back singles
by Troy O'Leary and Lou Merloni, and a walk to Jason Varitek loaded
the bases with no outs. But Hatteberg flied to left, too shallow
for O'Leary to challenge Rusty Greer's arm. Then Manny Alexander,
playing shortstop as Nomar Garciaparra rested, went down on strikes
and Offerman flied out to left to scuttle the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Similar scenarios played out every inning until the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we had a lot of opportunities early in the game,''
Lansing said. ``But I don't think anybody was hanging their heads
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   With Texas leading, 6-1, in the seventh, O'Leary cut the deficit
to 6-2 by driving a home run around the Pesky Pole. It was
O'Leary's first home run in 86 at-bats, dating to July 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox rallied again in the eighth after Offerman walked and
Gilkey, pinch hitting for Trot Nixon, singled with no outs. After
Everett struck out, Lansing, pinch hitting for Brian Daubach,
doubled to make it 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary singled to first and Lansing scored when first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro threw the ball past the pitcher Mike Venafro, who
was running to cover first. Suddenly it was a 6-5 game.
</P>
<P>
   Texas added what seemed to be and insurance run in the ninth,
but it proved not to be enough. Garciaparra, who pinch hit for
Alexander in the seventh and finished, watched most of it from the
bench. But he liked what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never let up,'' he said. ``That says a lot about our
team.''

<P>
   With Olympus in sight and gold on their minds, the US men's
gymnastics team developed a slight stutter Thursday night at the
FleetCenter, with some of their best and brightest athletes
chopping up routines in the preliminary round of the Olympic
trials.

   The answer could come Saturday afternoon in the finals, when
Kormann and his fellow decision-makers in USA Gymnastics must
decide who will be the half-dozen Yankees to go to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Already on board, without question, will be Blaine Wilson, who
again dominated the floor. Fresh from capturing his fifth
consecutive national title in St. Louis last month, Wilson opened
with an impressive 9.95 on rings and stormed his way to a
first-place finish for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt on,'' said Wilson. ``Things felt all in my grasp. What
did I have, one, two, three, maybe four sticks? But I'm probably my
worst critic. I didn't score a (perfect) 60. But, nobody can be
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   When Saturday night arrives, the men ranked 1-4 automatically
will be ticketed for Sydney. Now with 70 percent of their scores
totaled, with the July nationals counting for 40 percent, Wilson
holds the No. 1 spot, followed by Paul Hamm, Sean Townsend, and
Stephen McCain. The other two spots will be picked by Kormann and
the governing body. And Kormann was adamant upon leaving the
building that all athletes ranked 5-17 will receive equal
consideration for the trip Down Under.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy call,'' stressed Kormann, the former Olympic
bronze medalist from Braintree. ``It wouldn't be fair to preguess
what might happen. Even the 17th-placed guy will get a fair look.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Chris Young, just back after shredding an
Achilles' tendon in January, now ranks 17th overall. He badly
botched rings (7.8) and floor exercise (7.5).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really my first meet back,'' said the amiable Young, who
is Wilson's roommate at the Olympic training center. ``I did OK.
Not great, but OK. I've got to get some of those not-so-goods to be
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 10,250 clearly saw America's best hope for a medal in
Wilson, the former Ohio State star who was a member of the '96 team
in Atlanta. His lowest mark was a 9.475 on floor, improving from
there on pommel horse (9.525), vault (9.9), and high bar (9.825).
</P>
<P>
   ``Typical Blaine, I'd say,'' said an admiring Young. ``It's his
determination, combined with how hard he works _ he just works his
rear end off.''
</P>
<P>
   Kormann was duly impressed with Wilson's first-place finish in
St. Louis. But he wasn't convinced his prized student, whom he
coached at Ohio State, was yet ready to challenge legitimately for
a medal in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Following Thursday night, Kormann wasn't ready to annoint Wilson
the next American medalist, but he saw him inching closer to the
medal stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see he is much closer,'' said Kormann. ``He could win it. He
can. No question. But he needs to refine some things, too. I've
never seen him better than he was here, and I've been watching him
since he was 10 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   The night's biggest concern for the Yanks had to be the
lackluster work of two-time Olympian John Roethlisberger. He fell
off the high bar (9.35) and then botched his first approach on
floor exercise (8.3). He is now seated No. 7 and will be reaching
in his pocket for a miracle Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson figures he'll hear from the judges Friday. He knows they
want him to improve his pointing. Touch-ups. He'll begin the day
with a round of golf, come back for a little tutoring, and hit the
floor running Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been at this now for 22 years,'' he said. ``For the first
two years after '96, I trained six and seven hours a day, every
day. Like I say, it's my job. It's what I do. If you don't go out
there confident, you are in deep trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   If some of that could rub off on his red, white, and blue
brethren, and nights like Thursday night could be eliminated, then
the Yanks could be an impressive bunch in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, there's work to do and some stuttering to stop.

<P>
   Six months ago a loose grouping of reformists, committed (at
least by local standards) to the rule of law and democratic
accountability, won Iran's parliamentary election. The future
looked uncertain but promising.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the conservatives still controlled all the effective
instruments of state power _ the judiciary, the police, the army,
the broadcast media _ it was fair to hope they would feel obliged
to pay heed to the strength of the people's voice. So they did; but
only to shut it up.
</P>
<P>
   President Muhammad Khatami and his followers run the government
and are a majority in parliament. But the power of both
institutions is circumscribed, and their decisions can be overruled
by the clerical establishment, personified by Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, Iran's ``supreme leader.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reformist message, calling for more openness and
democracy (although still within the clerical system), was spread
by an explosion of free-speaking newspapers and magazines. It was
backed cautiously by academics and incautiously by students.
</P>
<P>
   But hard-liners, recognizing their most effective enemy, cracked
down on the press ferociously. By now, all the liberal papers have
been closed, parliament has been told by Ayatollah Khamenei to
forget even thinking of reopening them, and many prominent
journalists have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The illiberalism that darkened Iran before President Khatami's
election in 1997 has not altogether returned. Socially, people can
still breathe more easily than they did under his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Young men and women can mix in public without too much fear of
being intimidated by a gang of Islamist bullyboys, or watch
satellite television with less likelihood of a crippling fine.
</P>
<P>
   These changes are probably irreversible. With Iran's vast army
of youngsters facing political and economic dead ends, even
hard-liners recognize the need for a modest degree of tolerance in
social matters.
</P>
<P>
   In other directions, however, doors are closing. Reformers,
these days, are challenged with ``legal violence.'' Academics
returning from international conferences are liable to be accused
of treason _ which makes them reluctant to accept invitations to
travel or play their part on the lecture circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Students, long in the forefront of Iranian politics, have been
battered into caution by the cruel prison sentences meted out to
those of their number, such as Ahmad Batebi, who took part in a
pro-democracy protest last summer.
</P>
<P>
   And the brutality of the police, and of their Islamist helpers,
in squashing a demonstration on the first anniversary of this
protest has discouraged ordinary people from supporting the cause.
</P>
<P>
   What, under these conditions, does ``reform'' amount to? Given
the shackled nature of the presidency, Khatami has based his policy
on the belief that the only way to move forward was to take
Ayatollah Khamenei with him: if he set himself against the supreme
leader, he would be bound to trip.
</P>
<P>
   A fair argument, but it would be more convincing if he and his
movement were in fact getting anywhere. Disillusion with Khatami
and his softly-softly approach is bound to swell.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians have been allowed to vote for what they want, but were
then stopped from getting it. People are now much more alert than
they were to what is going on; they cannot easily be fooled. And
they may not accept stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   If the clerical system cannot be reformed, their minds will turn
to the disintegration of that system. If gentle voices are gagged,
less gentle ones will take over. &QL;

<P>
   This week's reunion of divided Korean families was an
emotionally charged affair, but also an important step in
dismantling one of the last frontiers of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   It involved 100 people from the North and another 100 from the
South travelling to each others' capitals to greet relatives they
had not seen for 50 or more years.
</P>
<P>
   All the hugs and tears were a welcome sign that the two Koreas
are continuing to make progress towards unifying their divided
peninsula. Yet the small number who made the journey shows just how
wide the gulf is.
</P>
<P>
   Those from prosperous, democratic South Korea were ordinary
people, mostly very elderly, who were selected in a computer
lottery; those from impoverished North Korea were mostly
luminaries, handpicked for their loyalty to the Stalinist regime
and carefully watched over by minders.
</P>
<P>
   And, however they were chosen, these were the lucky ones.
Millions of other Koreans have relatives whom they have not seen
for half a century, and can but hope that next time it will be
their turn. The signs are that there may be a next time.
</P>
<P>
   This week's reunion was a direct result of the summit held in
June in the North's capital, Pyongyang, between that country's
leader, Kim Jong Il, and the South's president, Kim Dae Jung.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the hermit kingdom began to emerge from his shell
earlier this year in a diplomatic charm offensive. But what is he
up to?
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics observe that whether Kim Jong Il is genuinely
interested in reforming his regime or simply trying to shore it up,
he expects substantial rewards for his country. So far, things have
gone well for him.
</P>
<P>
   This week the two Koreas also opened liaison offices in
Panmunjom, a village in the demilitarized zone where the armistice
was negotiated that ended the Korean War in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Next month work should begin on reconnecting the cross-border
railway. Power lines could be next, with the South helping the
North to overcome its electricity shortages. Southern companies are
being offered investment opportunities in the North.
</P>
<P>
   The two Kims plan further cabinet-level talks, which could lead
to a visit by Kim Jong Il to the South's capital, Seoul. Or could
not: he has indicated that his journey will depend on continued
``progress.'' Translation: concessions, perhaps from non-Korean
parts of the world as well.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders, though, do not see the issues quite as the Koreans
do. A collapse of the North's economy would worry the outside
world, but not, directly, much damage it; in contrast, the results
could devastate the economy of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Americans are deeply alarmed at the possibility
that North Korea may develop long-range missiles that could reach
the western United States; but that would add little to the
military threat faced by South Korea from the North.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il has said what he would like the Americans to do:
drop his country from their list of states that sponsor terrorism.
This would allow it access to more international aid. It was
originally included in the list for harboring members of the
Japanese Red Army who had hijacked a Japanese airliner in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The North's subsequent nasty behavior has given the Americans no
reason to change their minds: North Korean agents are accused of
planting the bomb in Yangon, the capital of Myanmar, which in 1983
killed 17 visiting South Koreans, including several cabinet
ministers. They are blamed for the blowing up of a South Korean
airliner in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea also has been belligerent over international efforts
that would, in effect, pay it for freezing its nuclear program.
Then, two years ago it test-fired a missile over Japan.
</P>
<P>
   It is the rest of the world that needs to see more progress from
North Korea. Kim Jong Il clearly likes to appear to foreigners
arriving in Pyongyang as a modern, if Mao-suited, man who is a
movie buff and connoisseur of French wine. Yet he remains
worryingly unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   When Vladimir Putin visited Pyongyang last month, the North's
leader told the Russian president that it was prepared to stop
selling missiles to other nations if the Americans would launch its
satellites for it. Yet this week the North Korean leader told a
group of visitors from the South that he had only been joking.
</P>
<P>
   The two Koreas face a huge task in restoring _ rather,
reinventing _ relations. They have made remarkable progress. It is
to be hoped that they continue to do so. But Kim Jong Il has still
to convince the world that he is sincere about opening up, if he
wants his country to stop being considered as a dangerous rogue
nation. &QL;

   ``It is impossible that old prejudices and hostilities should
longer exist, while such an instrument has been created for the
exchange of thought between all the nations of the earth.'' Thus
Victorian enthusiasts, acclaiming the arrival in 1858 of the first
transatlantic telegraph cable.
</P>
<P>
   People say that sort of thing about new technologies, even
today. Biotechnology is said to be the cure for world hunger. The
sequencing of the human genome will supposedly eradicate cancer and
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The wildest optimism, though, has greeted the Internet. A whole
industry of cybergurus has enthralled audiences (and made a fine
living) with exuberant claims that the Internet will prevent wars,
reduce pollution, and combat various forms of inequality.
</P>
<P>
   However, although the Internet is still young enough to inspire
idealism, it has also been around long enough to test whether the
prophets can be right.
</P>
<P>
   Grandest of all the claims are those made by some of the savants
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology about the Internet's
potential as a force for peace.
</P>
<P>
   One guru, Nicholas Negroponte, has declared that, thanks to the
Internet, the children of the future ``are not going to know what
nationalism is.'' His colleague, Michael Dertouzos, has written
that digital communications will bring ``computer-aided peace''
which ``may help stave off future flare-ups of ethnic hatred and
national breakups.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that improved communications will reduce
misunderstandings and avert conflict. This is not new, alas, any
more than were the claims for the peacemaking possibilities of
other new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of the 20th century, airplanes were expected
to end wars, by promoting international communication and (less
credibly) by making armies obsolete, since they would be vulnerable
to attack from the air.
</P>
<P>
   After the First World War had dispelled such notions, it was the
turn of radio. ``Nation shall speak peace unto nation,'' ran the
fine motto of Britain's BBC World Service. Sadly, Rwanda's Radio
Mille Collines disproved the idea that radio was an intrinsically
pacific force once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake people make is to assume that wars are caused simply
by the failure of different peoples to understand each other
adequately. Indeed, even if that were true, the Internet can also
be used to advocate conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Hate speech and intolerance flourish in its murkier corners,
where governments (as France is now discovering) find it hard to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Internet undeniably fosters communication, it will
not put an end to war. But might it reduce energy consumption and
pollution? The Center for Energy and Climate Solutions (CECS), a
Washington think-tank, has advanced just such a case, based largely
on energy consumption figures for 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While the American economy grew by 9 percent over those two
years, energy demand was almost unchanged _ because, the CECS
ventures, the Internet ``can turn paper and CDs into electrons, and
replace trucks with fiber-optic cable.'' No wonder one enthusiastic
newspaper headline begged, ``Shop online _ save the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, earth-saving is harder than that. Certainly, shopping
online from home is far less polluting than driving to a shopping
mall. Ordering groceries online, and having them delivered, means
that, if the logistics are handled efficiently, one truck journey
can replace dozens of families' separate car trips. Reading
newspapers, magazines and other documents online is more efficient
than printing and transporting them physically.
</P>
<P>
   Yet doing things online is more energy-efficient only if it
genuinely displaces real-world activities. If people shop online as
well as visiting the bricks-and-mortar store, the result is an
overall increase in energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, it is now easy for Europeans to order
books and have them extravagantly air-freighted from America before
they are available in Europe. And it is more efficient to read
documents online only if doing so replaces, rather than adds to,
the amount of printed bumf.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, as more and more offices and homes connect to the
Internet, millions of PCs, printers, servers and other devices
gobble significant quantities of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Home computers are becoming part of the fabric of everyday life,
and are increasingly left switched on all the time. One
controversial assessment concluded that fully 8 percent of
electricity consumption in America is due to Internet-connected
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The construction of vast ``server farms'' _ warehouses full of
computers and their attendant cooling systems _ has contributed to
the overloading of the electrical power network that has caused
brownouts in Silicon Valley. &QL;

<P>
   What about the belief that the Internet will reduce inequality?
According to a study carried out by America's Department of
Commerce, households with annual incomes above $75,000 are more
than 20 times as likely to have Internet access as the poorest
households.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton, struck by the ``digital divide'' between
rich and poor, argues that universal Internet access would help to
reduce income inequality.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the cost of using the Internet continues to fall
(services offering free access are becoming the norm, and a basic
PC can now be had for little more than a video recorder or a large
television), the true reason for the digital divide between rich
and poor will become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The poor are not shunning the Internet because they cannot
afford it: the problem is that they lack the skills to exploit it
effectively. So it is difficult to see how connecting the poor to
the Internet will improve their finances. It would make more sense
to aim for universal literacy than universal Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even in the more ludicrous claims for the Internet, there
may be germs of truth. This open network, so hard for governments
to control, may indeed help to give more power to individual
citizens and encourage democracies. As democratic governments
rarely fight each other, that might promote peace. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   As for the environment, the Internet will allow many pieces of
machinery to be monitored and tuned more precisely from afar. That
will promote energy efficiency. Taxing or merely measuring
pollution will be less expensive and so easier for governments to
undertake. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Even inequality may, in some cases, be reduced thanks to the
Internet. A computer programmer in Bangalore or Siberia can use the
Internet to work for a software company in Seattle without leaving
home, and can expect to be paid a wage that is closer to that of
his virtual colleagues at the other end of the cable.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is to reduce income inequality between people doing
similar jobs in different countries, but to increase the inequality
between information workers in poor countries and their poorest
compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet changes many things. It has had a dramatic impact
on the world of business. Firms can now link their systems directly

around the clock, and can learn more than ever about their
customers. Economies may be more productive as a result. &QL;

<P>
   Was there ever an airplane so beautiful to look at? No wonder
the fate of Concorde, now indefinitely withdrawn from service by
British Airways as well as Air France, inspires a twinge of regret
even in the sternest critic of this ludicrous airborne indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   Few critics have been sterner than The Economist which, in the
late 1960s, conducted a campaign against the use of taxpayers'
money on a project that would never recoup its capital costs.
</P>
<P>
   Concorde's commercial life is clearly drawing to a close: even
if flights eventually resume, it will be difficult to rebuild lost
confidence among passengers.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of saying, ``We told you so,'' it is worth examining
the lessons to be gleaned from the airplane's history.
</P>
<P>
   Concorde was an engineer's delight: it took the jet-bomber
technologies that had evolved at the end of the Second World War
and pushed them to the frontiers of the possible, or indeed beyond
the frontiers, given that the aircraft's initial prototype could
not have crossed the Atlantic with a full passenger load.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology turned out to be a blind alley. Glamorous
though supersonic travel seemed to be, it was also so noisy that
most governments banned it over their countries.
</P>
<P>
   At subsonic speeds, the aircraft guzzles fuel. And Concorde's
limited range means that it cannot fly supersonically across the
world's largest body of water, the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the elderly aircraft's technical limits could now be
overcome. Indeed, governments and aerospace companies have
periodically flirted with building a son-of-Concorde, which could
cross the Pacific and carry three times as many passengers.
</P>
<P>
   But a sign of Concorde's commercial failure is that its design
has not been refined and replaced. One reason is that some design
limits are insuperable. A bigger airplane would make a bigger boom;
and more Concordes would do more environmental harm to the ozone
layer.
</P>
<P>
   However, a greater problem than the technology is the market.
Concorde was built in the days when air travel was for the elite.
In fact, it could never have covered its operating costs merely
from chief executives prepared to scrunch into its small body and
pay $5,000 or so to save four hours getting to New York, London or
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   It has become profitable only by dint of clever marketing,
especially by BA, of supersonic travel to tourists such as those
killed in last month's crash.
</P>
<P>
   For air travel has taken off in a quite different direction from
the one that Concorde's engineers and bureaucrat backers expected.
Flying is a mass market, with two-thirds of passengers travelling
for fun, not for business.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, building for the market, understood that capacity
mattered more than speed: its hugely successful 767s fly more
slowly than did the 707 (which in turn flew more slowly than the
VC10).
</P>
<P>
   While Concorde sped off on a flight path to nowhere, the true
advance in air travel has turned out to come from refinements of
large jets, which have grown steadily cheaper and more reliable.
</P>
<P>
   If commercial supersonic travel has a future, it is more likely
to be in the executive jet than the commercial carrier. A smaller
Concorde would make a smaller boom, and enough seriously rich folk
might want something even grander than their own Gulfstream V to
justify the immense cost.
</P>
<P>
   For the great majority of business travellers, however, there
are far better ways to speed up the irksome business of air travel.
One is to invest in ground transport: time can be saved by
unclogging (or leapfrogging) the roads between airports and city
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Another is to improve the management of flights. It is far
easier to end delays caused by air-traffic control than to quiet a
sonic boom.
</P>
<P>
   A third is to dismantle the hub-and-spoke system of routes
which, especially in the United States, compounds travel delays by
forcing passengers to take two or three flights to reach their
destination, any one of which may ruin their journey by running
late.
</P>
<P>
   The technology that will do most to speed up air travel in the
next couple of decades is on the ground, in computers and not in
the sky, however lovely the bodywork. &QL;

   While Concorde sped off on a flight path to nowhere, the true
advance in air travel has turned out to come from refinements of
large jets, which have grown steadily cheaper and more reliable.
</P>
<P>
   If commercial supersonic travel has a future, it is more likely
to be in the executive jet than the commercial carrier. A smaller
Concorde would make a smaller boom, and enough seriously rich folk
might want something even grander than their own Gulfstream V to
justify the immense cost.
</P>
<P>
   For the great majority of business travellers, however, there
are far better ways to speed up the irksome business of air travel.
One is to invest in ground transport: time can be saved by
unclogging (or leapfrogging) the roads between airports and city
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Another is to improve the management of flights. It is far
easier to end delays caused by air-traffic control than to quiet a
sonic boom.
</P>
<P>
   A third is to dismantle the hub-and-spoke system of routes
which, especially in the United States, compounds travel delays by
forcing passengers to take two or three flights to reach their
destination, any one of which may ruin their journey by running
late.
</P>
<P>
   The technology that will do most to speed up air travel in the
next couple of decades is on the ground, in computers and not in
the sky, however lovely the bodywork. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ It is fitting that Bill Clinton should have given
his valedictory performance at a Democratic National Convention in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   No group has stood more solidly behind the boy from Arkansas
than the Hollywood crowd. And no group better symbolizes both the
attraction and the ultimate hollowness of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived in office eight years ago surrounded by a
praetorian guard of Rhodes scholars and policy wonks. But over time
his center of gravity shifted relentlessly from Ivy League
universities to Hollywood swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment community was probably the only group of
sensate Americans that never harbored any doubts about his behavior
in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   And the grateful president became such a familiar figure in L.A.
that the locals will tell you he has both a mansion and a job
waiting for him when he retires, courtesy of Tom Hanks and Steven
Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   The film industry's adulation for Clinton was palpable this
week. On Saturday evening Stan Lee, the creator of Spider-Man,
hosted a $25,000-a-couple bash for Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate
campaign, with guests gorging themselves on lobster and beef and
listening to such deep political thinkers as Whoopi Goldberg and
Ted Danson.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning the Clintons headed off to another Malibu
estate, Barbra Streisand's, this time to raise money for the
president's library in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   A few Democrats worried that the first couple were soaking up
attention and money that should have gone to Al Gore. But by the
time they left town on Tuesday she had a reported $4 million and he
had $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the heir to a long tradition of mutual attraction
between the capitals of glamour and power.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower both cozied up to the
Hollywood moguls (FDR even wrote a screenplay). John Kennedy
partied with Frank Sinatra and dallied with Marilyn Monroe. Ronald
Reagan traded in a career as a B-list actor for one as an A-list
president.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has carried the relationship to new heights.
Previous presidents have always been careful to keep Hollywood at
arm's length. Clinton grew ever more dependent on Tinseltown with
every scandal that broke over his head, culminating in his use of
Harry Thomason to produce his finger-wagging denial that he ever
had sex with ``that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood crowd took to using the Lincoln Bedroom as their
favorite hotel in the capital: no sooner had Barbra moved out than
``Hanoi'' Jane Fonda moved in.
</P>
<P>
   They increasingly dominated the guest lists to glitzy state
dinners. And they encouraged everything that was least impressive
about Clinton, from his moral evasiveness to his over-reliance on
personal charm.
</P>
<P>
   If Kennedy is forever associated with the intellectuals who
designed the New Frontier, Clinton will forever be associated with
the stars who made him one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton years brought two other depressing changes in the
Hollywood-Washington connection. The first was the explosion in the
quantity of cash changing hands. The Democratic Party's various
national committees now receive an estimated 20 percent of their
money from the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the entertainment industry had already given the
Democrats some $50 million during the Clinton years, more than any
other interest group except the trade unions and the trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The second change is that Hollywood has become almost a
one-party town. Hollywood Republicans were already a beleaguered
minority when Reagan came to power. (A Reagan aide once sent out
2,000 letters seeking support from the president's old stamping
ground. He got 100 replies, 90 of them hate letters.) But now they
can probably be numbered on the fingers of one hand.
</P>
<P>
   Young actors who harbor secret doubts about liberal orthodoxies
have little choice but to hide their true feelings in Tinseltown.
</P>
<P>
   So what? Isn't money the lubricant of American politics? And
aren't most artists unrepentant lefties? Perhaps. But it is worth
noting that people do not give huge amounts of money without
expecting something in return.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's massive financial muscle has succeeded in
marginalizing important discussions, not least about the malevolent
impact of the industry's love affair with violence, just as it has
succeeded in opening foreign markets to Hollywood's products.
</P>
<P>
   It is also worth noting that filmmakers who present relentlessly
partisan views of the world risk provoking a reaction.
</P>
<P>
   America is never going to recover from the culture war that has
disfigured its politics for a generation if prime-time programs
such as ``The West Wing,'' a political soap opera about an
idealized version of the Clinton White House, routinely portray
religious fundamentalists as bigots and supporters of school
vouchers as closet members of the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's departure from office, things will be different.
The film industry's political bias prevents it from embracing
George W. Bush. But it cannot conceal its disappointment with
Clinton's chosen successor, as if it were being asked to replace a
favorite star with a reject from the afternoon soaps. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Gore has added to the tension by choosing one of Hollywood's
leading critics, Joseph Lieberman, as his running mate. Lieberman
makes no secret of the fact that he thinks some of Hollywood's
products are polluting the country's culture: to dramatize his
point, he presents a silver-sewer award to the worst offenders.
</P>
<P>
   He has backed legislation that Hollywood hates, from the 1996
law requiring that television sets include the v-chip technology
which lets parents filter what their children watch to his more
recent bid to promote official inquiries into whether entertainment
companies are marketing violent material to children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that the imaginary metro line between Capitol
Hill and Bel Air will close down any time soon. Politicians will
always need money (and will always prefer to ask for it in
Hollywood rather than at conventions of chartered accountants in
Peoria). And the more thoughtful film types will always crave the
validation that comes from associating with the powerful.
</P>
<P>
   But it does mean that the relationship between the capital of
power and the capital of glamour is about to get a lot less intense
_ and less stomach-turning _ than it has been under Clinton. &QL;

   ALBUQUERQUE AND SANTA FE, N.M. _ The Rio Grande starts life
majestically, cutting deep through the volcanic canyons of the
Colorado plateau. But by the time it reaches the desert plains of
southern New Mexico it is a shade of its former self, depleted by
irrigation channels that feed the state's thirsty crops.
</P>
<P>
   Now the river faces a new challenge: fast-growing cities
increasingly desperate for water.
</P>
<P>
   Fights over water have dominated the history of the American
Southwest. In an area where land is abundant and cheap, the only
thing standing in the path of unbridled population growth is the
supply of water in the region's rivers and aquifers.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, New Mexico has avoided the water battles that
have torn apart Arizonans and Californians. Yet, with the state's
population expected to grow hugely over the next 25 years, and with
most of that growth projected in the largest cities of Albuquerque,
Santa Fe and Las Cruces, the state has become a new battleground in
the familiar tussles between developers, environmentalists, city
officials and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for water in New Mexico's cities used to be met by
underground aquifers. But those reserves are expected to be largely
depleted over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Albuquerque and Santa Fe are planning a shift to surface water
by 2004, which means tapping (reluctantly, they insist) the flows
of the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   By the terms of an agreement known as the San Juan-Chama
project, the cities have rights each year to over 50,000 acre-feet
of water that has been diverted from the Colorado River to the Rio
Grande (an acre-foot is enough water to cover an acre to the depth
of a foot).
</P>
<P>
   The cities insist that the plan will be phased in gradually, to
minimize its effect on water levels in the river. Environmentalists
do not believe them. The scheme, they say, will simply place
further demands on an already over-exploited stretch of water.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 50 years, farmers have been sucking an
ever-increasing amount out of the Rio Grande. According to John
Horning of the Forest Guardians, based in Santa Fe, New Mexico's
farmers have for years had carte blanche to divert the river as
they see fit, creating an inefficient system of irrigation canals
that wastes more water than it actually delivers to crops.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, environmentalists claim that water diversions
upstream have acted as a tourniquet, jeopardizing wildlife habitats
farther down the river.
</P>
<P>
   The matter is currently tied up in court, with a bundle of
lawsuits brought by environmentalists to protect endangered
species, such as the silvery minnow, that live in the southern
stretches of the river in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits contend that, under the terms of the federal
Endangered Species Act, an adequate water flow must be maintained
to ensure a proper habitat for the minnow.
</P>
<P>
   In a victory for environmentalists, federal courts recently
ruled that 170,000 acre-feet of Rio Grande water be allocated this
year to allow silvery minnows to swim in the style to which they
are accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   Such federal mandates do not sit well with New Mexico's water
officials, who fear they will hinder the state as it attempts to
deliver water to Texas under the Rio Grande Compact.
</P>
<P>
   The compact, made in 1938, divides the Rio Grande between
Colorado, New Mexico and Texas, and requires New Mexico to deliver
over 700,000 acre-feet of water each year to the Elephant Butte
reservoir in the southern part of the state. It is then sent along
to El Paso, in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But as upstream burdens on the Rio Grande multiply, New Mexico
is finding it increasingly difficult to fulfil the terms of the
compact.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trouble is that, when the deal was signed, New
Mexico had fewer demands for agricultural and municipal water than
its neighbors to the north and south. So it was given less. Now its
cities are growing fast, and it needs more.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, concerns about the Rio Grande's endangered
wildlife have also led to the closure of a big channel in the south
that once delivered water to Elephant Butte more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   For Norman Gaume of New Mexico's Interstate Stream Commission,
it is simple. There is just not enough water to meet the demands of
everyone who wants it. Hence the need for hard decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the battle begins, one thing seems certain: New Mexico
will have to keep the Texans happy. Like the neighborhood bully who
can out-muscle anyone, Texas will settle for nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   Gaume recalls the ominous words of a Texas commissioner of the
Rio Grande Compact: ``Deliver, or we'll see you in court.'' &QL;

lawsuits brought by environmentalists to protect endangered
species, such as the silvery minnow, that live in the southern
stretches of the river in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits contend that, under the terms of the federal
Endangered Species Act, an adequate water flow must be maintained
to ensure a proper habitat for the minnow.
</P>
<P>
   In a victory for environmentalists, federal courts recently
ruled that 170,000 acre-feet of Rio Grande water be allocated this
year to allow silvery minnows to swim in the style to which they
are accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   Such federal mandates do not sit well with New Mexico's water
officials, who fear they will hinder the state as it attempts to
deliver water to Texas under the Rio Grande Compact.
</P>
<P>
   The compact, made in 1938, divides the Rio Grande between
Colorado, New Mexico and Texas, and requires New Mexico to deliver
over 700,000 acre-feet of water each year to the Elephant Butte
reservoir in the southern part of the state. It is then sent along
to El Paso, in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But as upstream burdens on the Rio Grande multiply, New Mexico
is finding it increasingly difficult to fulfil the terms of the
compact.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trouble is that, when the deal was signed, New
Mexico had fewer demands for agricultural and municipal water than
its neighbors to the north and south. So it was given less. Now its
cities are growing fast, and it needs more.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, concerns about the Rio Grande's endangered
wildlife have also led to the closure of a big channel in the south
that once delivered water to Elephant Butte more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   For Norman Gaume of New Mexico's Interstate Stream Commission,
it is simple. There is just not enough water to meet the demands of
everyone who wants it. Hence the need for hard decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the battle begins, one thing seems certain: New Mexico
will have to keep the Texans happy. Like the neighborhood bully who
can out-muscle anyone, Texas will settle for nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   Gaume recalls the ominous words of a Texas commissioner of the
Rio Grande Compact: ``Deliver, or we'll see you in court.'' &QL;

   MONCKS CORNER, S.C. _ Visitors who drive over the Wadboo Bridge,
30 miles from downtown Charleston, S.C., soon come upon a majestic
alley of ancient live oaks, the entrance to the monastery of Our
Lady of Mepkin.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight Trappist monks live at Mepkin Abbey, following the
simple Cistercian routine of prayer, scripture-reading and manual
labor that was laid down 900 years ago in France.
</P>
<P>
   To this serene abbey comes an increasing stream of visitors, men
and women of all faiths exhausted by the punishing pace of life and
work in 21st-century America.
</P>
<P>
   These ``retreatants'' usually stay in the abbey between one and
six days. They pray with the monks (attending the first service of
the day, at 3:20 in the morning, if they wish), observe the same
silence as the monks, eat the same vegetarian fare.
</P>
<P>
   The abbey's guest facilities, most with private baths, are full
much of the time, and rooms for weekends are booked solid for the
next six months. Both single people and married couples can be
accommodated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most come for the silence,'' explains Brother Joshua as he
takes day visitors around the church and the grounds. The monks
hope that their visitors will ``find peace, joy and perspective on
life.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the aim of Henry Luce, publisher of Time, and his wife,
Clare Boothe Luce, playwright, congresswoman and diplomat, when in
1949 they gave the Trappists a large part of the property, which
they had acquired in 1936. The Luces are buried in the abbey
grounds, on a placid green hill overlooking the Cooper River.
</P>
<P>
   Monasteries and spiritual centers throughout the United States
find that demand is booming. Type the words ``spiritual retreat''
into an Internet search engine and it will offer you dozens of Web
sites describing centers for Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Native
Americans, Hindus, New Agers.
</P>
<P>
   If you cannot actually go there, you can at least take a
breather from the hustle and bustle by making a virtual retreat in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Click on Mepkin Abbey's (www.mepkinabbey.org) Web site, and you
can link up to the Web pages of many other Trappist monasteries,
including the Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky, Mepkin's parent
community.
</P>
<P>
   Gethsemani's Web site devotes a full article to its most famous
monk, Thomas Merton, author of ``Elected Silence'' and other books.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the Internet is a mixed blessing for the
monasteries of the 21st century. Mepkin's colorful Web site guides
viewers through the abbey's history, philosophy and services; at
least half of the retreatants book their reservations by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   This is wonderful, in its way. Yet the Internet can clash with
the monks' way of life: instead of retreating from the world, they
can hook up with it by going on-line.
</P>
<P>
   So Father Francis, Mepkin's abbot (trained in the 1970s as a
concert organist at the Juilliard School in New York City), keeps a
tight rein on Internet use; only a handful of monks have access to
it. The rest have an upcoming consolation.
</P>
<P>
   The 11,000-square-foot, two-story Clare Boothe Luce Library in
the abbey grounds, due to open next January, will house up to
80,000 theological volumes (all computer-catalogued for
availability through the Internet).
</P>
<P>
   Another building project, a new ``seniors'' wing for the
monastery's many ageing monks, is scheduled to open later this
summer. Mepkin has five middle-aged men waiting to join (reflecting
a trend in Catholicism in which men are treating the priesthood as
a second career). Some people even think that older men make better
monks than young ones.
</P>
<P>
   The abbot is reconciled to the fact that a life of poverty,
solitude and simplicity does not appeal to many young men today. A
week is one thing, a lifetime another. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ If there is one component of Russia's conventional
armed forces that still keeps western defense planners awake at
night, it is the submarine fleet.
</P>
<P>
   With most of Russia's surface ships rusting away, and the number
of battle-ready army divisions languishing at less than a tenth of
the old Soviet total, it is all the more striking that Moscow's
subs have retained their ability to play underwater games of
hide-and-seek with their American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Submarines, moreover, are the only sort of big weapons platform
that post-Soviet Russia has continued to build for itself, rather
than for shady overseas customers.
</P>
<P>
   It is less than a year since the Severodvinsk shipyard in the
Arctic turned out its latest version of the Akula (Shark), a sneaky
sub that has managed to pop up unexpectedly near naval bases in
America. Lower-tech, but still stealthy and formidable, are the
diesel-powered submarines that Russia has supplied to China, India
and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   As for the giant submarines that carry Russia's ballistic
missiles, their strategic importance is huge, and growing. By 2003,
some 60 percent of Russia's long-range arsenal will be deployed on
these boats, up from 43 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, when the newly elected President Vladimir Putin
wanted to prove his macho credentials, a sleepover on a nuclear
submarine seemed a natural way of doing it.
</P>
<P>
   All this helps to explain the profound embarrassment that the
Russian leadership, civilian and military, must be feeling over the
disaster which befell the Kursk, a nuclear-powered (though
apparently not nuclear-armed) submarine in the Barents Sea, near
Norway, on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100 sailors, over half of them officers, confined
to a dark, bitter-cold, unventilated metal box on the ocean floor,
the navy found itself struggling, and failing, to cope not just
with a human disaster but a public-relations fiasco as well.
</P>
<P>
   It looked bad enough that no submarine rescue vessel was on
hand, as would normally be expected during a big maritime exercise.
Then the top brass maintained its prickly refusal to accept western
help as it undertook three unsuccessful attempts to dock a rescue
capsule with the ill-fated sub.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that failed, said the navy, it could still use
inflatable pontoons to raise the vessel. When, on Aug. 16, the
Russians finally overcame their reluctance and accepted foreign
help, it looked to be too late.
</P>
<P>
   With a British mini-submarine and Norwegian divers on their way
to the site, but not expected to get there until Saturday, the
Russians confirmed that they were no longer picking up signs of
life from the sub.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as though, in effect, some of the Arctic fleet's most
senior officers, along with their men, were sacrificed to a cold
Soviet-style concept of secrecy and pride.
</P>
<P>
   The sub was taking a leading part in Russia's biggest show of
naval force for five years: a war game in the Arctic, to be
followed by the deployment of an aircraft carrier, the Kuznetsov,
in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   All these moves were supposed to give substance to Putin's
recent pledge that Russia would soon return to the high seas as an
oceangoing naval power, capable of defending trade routes _ or
busting embargoes.
</P>
<P>
   While military muscle-flexing goes down well, many Russians were
puzzled, exasperated and dismayed by the behavior of both the top
brass and their president during the Kursk debacle. At one point,
naval commanders suggested that a collision had occurred; then they
spoke of an explosion or a brush with an old mine.
</P>
<P>
   There was particularly harsh media criticism of the belated call
for help, and this while the hitherto popular President Putin
remained on his vacation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The accident that forced the Kursk to the ocean floor, about 150
metres (490 feet) below the surface, was mysterious and
devastating. With its double-layered hull, this class of submarine,
known as the Oskar-2, was designed to withstand torpedo attacks,
while packing enough punch to sink aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Even, for example, extensive flooding of its torpedo bays would
not, by itself, have crippled the Kursk; western specialists were
baffled over what could have incapacitated the boat and forced the
crew to resort to battery power, lasting for only a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a vivid illustration of the appalling state of the
Russian submarine fleet,'' says Joanna Kidd of Britain's
International Institute for Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Kursk was an antique: it was built in 1995. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 900) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The incident shows the serious problems afflicting all parts of
Russia's defense establishment, even those that command high
prestige and can generate export earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The future looks as problematic for Russia's submarine fleet as
the other services. While 20 new attack submarines have entered
service since the Soviet collapse, the pace is slowing: only five
have been commissioned since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a massive question mark over Russia's ability to
construct enough new strategic submarines to carry a bigger part of
its nuclear deterrent; all 21 of the large boats now in service
will reach the end of their service life within ten to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Russia can hardly afford to maintain its submarines, let alone
build new ones. It has designed a new missile-carrying boat, the
Borey, but construction of the first model is slow; it will be
finished by 2008 at best. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ If there is one component of Russia's conventional
armed forces that still keeps western defense planners awake at
night, it is the submarine fleet.
</P>
<P>
   With most of Russia's surface ships rusting away, and the number
of battle-ready army divisions languishing at less than a tenth of
the old Soviet total, it is all the more striking that Moscow's
subs have retained their ability to play underwater games of
hide-and-seek with their American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Submarines, moreover, are the only sort of big weapons platform
that post-Soviet Russia has continued to build for itself, rather
than for shady overseas customers.
</P>
<P>
   It is less than a year since the Severodvinsk shipyard in the
Arctic turned out its latest version of the Akula (Shark), a sneaky
sub that has managed to pop up unexpectedly near naval bases in
America. Lower-tech, but still stealthy and formidable, are the
diesel-powered submarines that Russia has supplied to China, India
and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   As for the giant submarines that carry Russia's ballistic
missiles, their strategic importance is huge, and growing. By 2003,
some 60 percent of Russia's long-range arsenal will be deployed on
these boats, up from 43 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, when the newly elected President Vladimir Putin
wanted to prove his macho credentials, a sleepover on a nuclear
submarine seemed a natural way of doing it.
</P>
<P>
   All this helps to explain the profound embarrassment that the
Russian leadership, civilian and military, must be feeling over the
disaster which befell the Kursk, a nuclear-powered (though
apparently not nuclear-armed) submarine in the Barents Sea, near
Norway, on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100 sailors, over half of them officers, confined
to a dark, bitter-cold, unventilated metal box on the ocean floor,
the navy found itself struggling, and failing, to cope not just
with a human disaster but a public-relations fiasco as well.
</P>
<P>
   It looked bad enough that no submarine rescue vessel was on
hand, as would normally be expected during a big maritime exercise.
Then the top brass maintained its prickly refusal to accept western
help as it undertook three unsuccessful attempts to dock a rescue
capsule with the ill-fated sub.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that failed, said the navy, it could still use
inflatable pontoons to raise the vessel. When, on Aug. 16, the
Russians finally overcame their reluctance and accepted foreign
help, it looked to be too late.
</P>
<P>
   With a British mini-submarine and Norwegian divers on their way
to the site, but not expected to get there until Saturday, the
Russians confirmed that they were no longer picking up signs of
life from the sub.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as though, in effect, some of the Arctic fleet's most
senior officers, along with their men, were sacrificed to a cold
Soviet-style concept of secrecy and pride.
</P>
<P>
   The sub was taking a leading part in Russia's biggest show of
naval force for five years: a war game in the Arctic, to be
followed by the deployment of an aircraft carrier, the Kuznetsov,
in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   All these moves were supposed to give substance to Putin's
recent pledge that Russia would soon return to the high seas as an
oceangoing naval power, capable of defending trade routes _ or
busting embargoes.
</P>
<P>
   While military muscle-flexing goes down well, many Russians were
puzzled, exasperated and dismayed by the behavior of both the top
brass and their president during the Kursk debacle. At one point,
naval commanders suggested that a collision had occurred; then they
spoke of an explosion or a brush with an old mine.
</P>
<P>
   There was particularly harsh media criticism of the belated call
for help, and this while the hitherto popular President Putin
remained on his vacation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The accident that forced the Kursk to the ocean floor, about 150
metres (490 feet) below the surface, was mysterious and
devastating. With its double-layered hull, this class of submarine,
known as the Oskar-2, was designed to withstand torpedo attacks,
while packing enough punch to sink aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Even, for example, extensive flooding of its torpedo bays would
not, by itself, have crippled the Kursk; western specialists were
baffled over what could have incapacitated the boat and forced the
crew to resort to battery power, lasting for only a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a vivid illustration of the appalling state of the
Russian submarine fleet,'' says Joanna Kidd of Britain's
International Institute for Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Kursk was an antique: it was built in 1995. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 900) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The incident shows the serious problems afflicting all parts of
Russia's defense establishment, even those that command high
prestige and can generate export earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The future looks as problematic for Russia's submarine fleet as
the other services. While 20 new attack submarines have entered
service since the Soviet collapse, the pace is slowing: only five
have been commissioned since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a massive question mark over Russia's ability to
construct enough new strategic submarines to carry a bigger part of
its nuclear deterrent; all 21 of the large boats now in service
will reach the end of their service life within ten to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Russia can hardly afford to maintain its submarines, let alone
build new ones. It has designed a new missile-carrying boat, the
Borey, but construction of the first model is slow; it will be
finished by 2008 at best. &QL;

   ANIANE _ ``Jose Bov(acute)e is my friend,'' declares Aim(acute)e
Guibert, the 75-year-old maker of Daumas Gassac wines, the finest
of the Languedoc region.
</P>
<P>
   And his role model? While Bov(acute)e, the pipe-smoking and
media-savvy leader of France's small farmers, targets McDonald's as
the symbol of the evils of globalization, the silver-haired Guibert
_ a speaker at a protest rally when Bov(acute)e went on trial in
June for trashing a McDonald's building site _ has in his sights a
Californian wine giant, Robert Mondavi.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Guibert wants to block Mondavi's plan for a
winery in the beautiful garrigue, or wooded scrub, right next to
his own vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   It is an uneven contest. Guibert's family-owned domaine,
nestling in the hills above the town of Aniane, produces a mere
120,000 bottles a year of its superb red wine _ Robert Parker,
America's taste pundit, positively drools over it _ and 70,000 of
white _ ``also a knockout,'' as Parker puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Mondavi, though still family-controlled, is a quoted company
that produces over 90 million bottles a year, with an annual net
income of over $370 million.
</P>
<P>
   To hedge its bets geographically, the firm already produces wine
in Italy, Chile and southern France.
</P>
<P>
   Guibert, whose vines are tended by hand and allowed to mature
with no artificial irrigation, mixes respect with derision: ``Have
you seen how Americans make wine? It's an industrial product.
Everything is controlled _ and the end is beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Guibert's chances do not look promising. Mondavi has a polished
public-relations operation in place. Its local representative,
David Pearson, whom Guibert dismisses as ``an American violinist''
playing on public opinion, spent two years searching for this
oenologically perfect spot.
</P>
<P>
   Mondavi, he says, does not plan mass production but just 240,000
bottles a year of a high-quality Syrah-based red wine made with
much the same care as Daumas Gassac.
</P>
<P>
   As to the charge of environmental damage, he notes that Guibert
himself also cleared the garrigue to make his wine.
</P>
<P>
   One ecologists' group even suggests that the Mondavi plan, which
covers ten plots, separated by garrigue, may promote biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   The project, which depends on Mondavi obtaining a 99-year lease
on communal land, also has local political support. The Socialist
mayor of nearby Montpellier, George Fr(circumflex)eche, and his
friends in Aniane back it. Last month the Aniane town council
approved the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Mondavi is offering to help the 232 members of the
local wine cooperative to upgrade and market their wines.
</P>
<P>
   Given that 40 percent of last year's harvest is still unsold,
and the region's wine growers have taken to the streets to protest
at foreign imports, the offer is hard to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, though the final decision rests with the
national agricultural minister, and Guibert vows to keep up a legal
challenge, the Americans may well start clearing their land by next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, locals are resigned. ``The wine-growers of
Aniane,'' comments one, ``will end up as the workers of Mondavi.'' &QL;

<P>
   SYDNEY _ When Lorna Cubillo was seven, she and 15 other
aboriginal children were put into a truck by white officials at an
outback settlement in the Northern Territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the truck left Phillip Creek, everyone was crying and
screaming,'' she says. ``I remember mothers beating their heads
with sticks and rocks. They were bleeding. They threw dirt over
themselves. I remember seeing the mothers chasing the truck. And
then they disappeared in the dust of the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gunner had a similar experience when he was six and living
in an aboriginal camp at Utopia Station, a cattle property near
Alice Springs. ``I didn't see the welfare blokes and they suddenly
grabbed me by the arms and dragged me towards the truck. My mother
was there. She was crying and so were her sisters. I thought the
men were taking me away to be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cubillo is now 62 and Mr. Gunner is 52. They are members of
Australia's ``stolen generation'': aboriginal people, estimated to
number at least 55,000, who were removed from their families as
children and put in foster homes, many run by churches.
</P>
<P>
   At the home where she ended up in Darwin, Cubillo was assaulted
by a missionary; Gunner was sexually assaulted at his Alice Springs
home, also by a missionary.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of their kind, they lost all contact with their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Having lived with the traumas all their lives, Cubillo and
Gunner launched a court action against the Australian government
last year, claiming they were unlawfully abducted and that the
government in Canberra breached its duty of care towards them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Australia's six states pursued similar native-child
separation policies for more than 40 years until the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubillo-Gunner action was seen as a test case over an issue
that has caused soul-searching in Australia since a report in 1997
revealed for the first time the full story of the stolen
generation.
</P>
<P>
   The government, led by the prime minister, John Howard, fought
the case and applied early on to have it thrown out of court.
Maurice O'Loughlin, the federal judge hearing it, refused.
</P>
<P>
   That persistence produced hopes of victory among supporters of
the pair. These were heightened when O'Loughlin took the
unprecedented step of asking that his judgment in Darwin on Aug. 11
be shown live on television.
</P>
<P>
   They were disappointed. O'Loughlin accepted the two aborigines'
accounts of their sufferings as children. But he dismissed their
cases, because he found no evidence that the native patrol officers
who removed them had violated the law at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge void,'' he concluded. ``We know that Mrs.
Cubillo was taken away, but we do not know why.'' This is the nub
of where the campaign is likely to go from here.
</P>
<P>
   The Howard government, keen to avoid liability for compensation
payments, has argued that the stolen children were placed in
welfare institutions for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the government sparked widespread outrage
when it submitted to a parliamentary inquiry that the stolen
generation did not really exist, because the numbers of children
involved were small. O'Loughlin slapped that argument down,
pointedly declaring that neither the evidence nor his judgment
``deny the existence of the stolen generation.''
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that, at least until the 1950s, the separation
policies were driven by racial more than welfare concerns: to
assimilate the mainly mixed-race children who were removed, in the
belief that white Australia would eventually triumph and the
aboriginal race would die out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breeding out the color'' was how some officials at the time
described the policy.
</P>
<P>
   The case has become a key one for modern Australia's moves
towards reconciliation with its indigenous people. The judgment,
with its narrow focus on questions of law, has shown how inadequate
the court system is to resolve this issue, with its complex and
painful historical dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the judge concluded that the infant Gunner was not
removed in 1956 against his mother's wishes: he cited as evidence
her thumbprint on a form of request that the boy be given a
``western education.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard has taken the judgment as justification for his
government's refusal to make a national apology to the stolen
generation. But the issue will not go away, and it could bring the
government under more scrutiny as Australia prepares to host the
Olympic Games next month.
</P>
<P>
   The government spent A$10 million ($5.8 million) fighting the
case _ money, say its critics, that would have been better spent
compensating those who were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Another 1,000 compensation cases are in preparation, and the
Cubillo-Gunner one may go to appeal. ``We've been knocked on the
head so many times,'' says Gunner. ``But they will not destroy our
spirit.'' &QL;

cases, because he found no evidence that the native patrol officers
who removed them had violated the law at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge void,'' he concluded. ``We know that Mrs.
Cubillo was taken away, but we do not know why.'' This is the nub
of where the campaign is likely to go from here.
</P>
<P>
   The Howard government, keen to avoid liability for compensation
payments, has argued that the stolen children were placed in
welfare institutions for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the government sparked widespread outrage
when it submitted to a parliamentary inquiry that the stolen
generation did not really exist, because the numbers of children
involved were small. O'Loughlin slapped that argument down,
pointedly declaring that neither the evidence nor his judgment
``deny the existence of the stolen generation.''
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that, at least until the 1950s, the separation
policies were driven by racial more than welfare concerns: to
assimilate the mainly mixed-race children who were removed, in the
belief that white Australia would eventually triumph and the
aboriginal race would die out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breeding out the color'' was how some officials at the time
described the policy.
</P>
<P>
   The case has become a key one for modern Australia's moves
towards reconciliation with its indigenous people. The judgment,
with its narrow focus on questions of law, has shown how inadequate
the court system is to resolve this issue, with its complex and
painful historical dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the judge concluded that the infant Gunner was not
removed in 1956 against his mother's wishes: he cited as evidence
her thumbprint on a form of request that the boy be given a
``western education.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard has taken the judgment as justification for his
government's refusal to make a national apology to the stolen
generation. But the issue will not go away, and it could bring the
government under more scrutiny as Australia prepares to host the
Olympic Games next month.
</P>
<P>
   The government spent A$10 million ($5.8 million) fighting the
case _ money, say its critics, that would have been better spent
compensating those who were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Another 1,000 compensation cases are in preparation, and the
Cubillo-Gunner one may go to appeal. ``We've been knocked on the
head so many times,'' says Gunner. ``But they will not destroy our
spirit.'' &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Bad news for female managers: Their subordinates
resent being disciplined by them. Men and women alike would far
rather be scolded by a male boss than a female one.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a study of gender and discipline at work, by Leanne
Atwater, a professor at the School of Management at Arizona State
University, and two colleagues, finds that women dislike being told
off by another woman even more than men do.
</P>
<P>
   Many studies of male and female bosses have claimed that the
sexes differ in their styles of leadership: women do better at the
people side, men at the getting-the-job-done side.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists have studied the different reactions of girls and
boys to discipline at school: boys get used to being reprimanded
whereas girls, who are more rarely rebuked, take it more
personally.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody seems to have studied discipline and gender at work.
Atwater and her colleagues interviewed 163 workers from a broad
range of jobs who had been disciplined in a variety of ways, from
being fired to being ticked off.
</P>
<P>
   In about 40 percent of cases, they found, subordinates changed
their behavior as a result of their telling-off, and female bosses
were as successful in this as men.
</P>
<P>
   But male bosses were much more severe than women: they were
three times as likely to suspend or sack a subordinate, and only
half as likely to give merely an oral wigging.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, when female subordinates were asked if they felt
responsible for their bad behavior, 52 percent said no when a
female boss read the riot act _ but only 18 percent when the boss
was male.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for such differences, suggested by a member of
the audience at the Academy of Management conference in Toronto,
where the paper was recently presented, is that women tend to
resolve conflicts quickly _ and are therefore blamed for
overreacting _ while men wait in the hope that things will blow
over.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation, from Alice Eagly, a professor of psychology
at Northwestern University, is that women are recent arrivals in
managerial roles, and so have less legitimacy than men.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a problem of ``gender spillover'': people assume
women are kind and gentle at home, and expect the same at work.
</P>
<P>
   Spillover, though, works both ways. The paper is called ``Wait
Until Your Father Gets Home,'' a line that small family
subordinates are all too used to hearing. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Johns Manville Corporation agreed to be
acquired by a buyout firm and thus return to private ownership in
early July, a painful chapter in corporate history came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1920s until the 1970s, Manville had been the largest
American producer of asbestos, a product belatedly discovered to be
extraordinarily dangerous. Ensuing claims led to a bankruptcy in
1982 that penalized existing shareholders in favor of a trust fund
for victims.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Manville's time in purgatory is drawing to a close, it
looks likely that others will be forced down the same path by
increasingly virulent asbestos-related litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, the shares of four large industrial firms _ Owens
Corning, Armstrong Industries, USG and W.R. Grace _ have been
hammered. The two with most financial strength, Owens Corning
(insulation) and Armstrong (flooring), have seen their credit
ratings downgraded as well.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the companies had previously said they had
reserves sufficient to cover fully any asbestos claims, but they
have recently been forced to bump up their estimates of potential
liabilities, thus raising the suspicion that further increases are
to come.
</P>
<P>
   More devastatingly, another two firms _ Pittsburgh Corning
(glass insulation) and Babcock and Wilcox (boilers) _ have this
year gone bankrupt, citing asbestos claims as the reason.
</P>
<P>
   The filing by Babcock came after it had already settled 340,000
claims at a cost of $1.6 billion and had become unable to see any
resolution. ``The claims,'' the company groaned, ``have become
intolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the alternative? Elihu Inselbuch, a lawyer for
plaintiffs in both of these cases and another asbestos-related
bankruptcy, Raytech Corp., is blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The liabilities exceed the value of assets of all these
companies,'' he says. ``Even a liability half the size puts them
under water. There's nothing you can get but the company.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, expect the Manville model to be repeated.
Expect, too, the number of litigious victims to rise.
</P>
<P>
   When Manville first filed for bankruptcy in 1982, it reckoned on
17,000 claims. It had upped that fivefold by 1988 and has so far
settled 320,000 claims, with another 70,000 pending. It expects at
least 500,000 more, with the final claim to be submitted in 2049.
</P>
<P>
   In total, it has paid out almost $2.4 billion, another $1
billion awaits disbursement, and yet another $1.5 billion should
come from Manville's sale. In time, these numbers may appear small.
</P>
<P>
   Owens Corning's involvement with asbestos stemmed from a single
product, an insulated pipe manufactured between 1958 and 1972, with
total sales of $135 million (less than $800 million in today's
money). Yet it has already paid out $4 billion in claims.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors push up these claims. Asbestos-related
problems have a long latency period, while treatment has become
more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for cashing in has also become more widely known
(provoking several fraud investigations). And plaintiffs' lawyers
have become more imaginative, going after not only producers of
asbestos products, but also firms that merely used asbestos, says
Kenneth Bradley, editor of Asbestos Litigation Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   He cites as an example a $34 million decision that went against
a division of Royal Dutch/Shell, an oil company, in April. Shell
never made anything from asbestos but, like many oil firms, used it
in its refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms that must be surprised to find themselves caught up
in lawsuits include Campbell's Soup and Gerber, a baby-food maker.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor may be timing. According to a lawyer involved in
the cases, earlier this year efforts failed to pass federal
legislation that would control payments.
</P>
<P>
   While these drew wide support, they faced strong opposition from
trial lawyers as well as a likely veto from President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, so the idea goes, the Congress and government may
change and be less sympathetic to endless lawsuits. Thus there is a
rush to file suits fast.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that the asbestos-related companies, sick of
taking body blows, are starting to lash out themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In an intriguing reversal of roles, the Manville Trust, along
with several other defendants in asbestos cases, will go before a
Federal Appeals Court next month to get clearance for
multibillion-dollar claims against tobacco manufacturers (Owens
Corning has filed a similar suit in California).
</P>
<P>
   The premise is that the effects of asbestos poisoning are far
worse when combined with smoking cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most battered old bruisers, it seems, can still swing
the odd punch. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Johns Manville Corporation agreed to be
acquired by a buyout firm and thus return to private ownership in
early July, a painful chapter in corporate history came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1920s until the 1970s, Manville had been the largest
American producer of asbestos, a product belatedly discovered to be
extraordinarily dangerous. Ensuing claims led to a bankruptcy in
1982 that penalized existing shareholders in favor of a trust fund
for victims.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Manville's time in purgatory is drawing to a close, it
looks likely that others will be forced down the same path by
increasingly virulent asbestos-related litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, the shares of four large industrial firms _ Owens
Corning, Armstrong Industries, USG and W.R. Grace _ have been
hammered. The two with most financial strength, Owens Corning
(insulation) and Armstrong (flooring), have seen their credit
ratings downgraded as well.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the companies had previously said they had
reserves sufficient to cover fully any asbestos claims, but they
have recently been forced to bump up their estimates of potential
liabilities, thus raising the suspicion that further increases are
to come.
</P>
<P>
   More devastatingly, another two firms _ Pittsburgh Corning
(glass insulation) and Babcock and Wilcox (boilers) _ have this
year gone bankrupt, citing asbestos claims as the reason.
</P>
<P>
   The filing by Babcock came after it had already settled 340,000
claims at a cost of $1.6 billion and had become unable to see any
resolution. ``The claims,'' the company groaned, ``have become
intolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the alternative? Elihu Inselbuch, a lawyer for
plaintiffs in both of these cases and another asbestos-related
bankruptcy, Raytech Corp., is blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The liabilities exceed the value of assets of all these
companies,'' he says. ``Even a liability half the size puts them
under water. There's nothing you can get but the company.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, expect the Manville model to be repeated.
Expect, too, the number of litigious victims to rise.
</P>
<P>
   When Manville first filed for bankruptcy in 1982, it reckoned on
17,000 claims. It had upped that fivefold by 1988 and has so far
settled 320,000 claims, with another 70,000 pending. It expects at
least 500,000 more, with the final claim to be submitted in 2049.
</P>
<P>
   In total, it has paid out almost $2.4 billion, another $1
billion awaits disbursement, and yet another $1.5 billion should
come from Manville's sale. In time, these numbers may appear small.
</P>
<P>
   Owens Corning's involvement with asbestos stemmed from a single
product, an insulated pipe manufactured between 1958 and 1972, with
total sales of $135 million (less than $800 million in today's
money). Yet it has already paid out $4 billion in claims.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors push up these claims. Asbestos-related
problems have a long latency period, while treatment has become
more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for cashing in has also become more widely known
(provoking several fraud investigations). And plaintiffs' lawyers
have become more imaginative, going after not only producers of
asbestos products, but also firms that merely used asbestos, says
Kenneth Bradley, editor of Asbestos Litigation Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   He cites as an example a $34 million decision that went against
a division of Royal Dutch/Shell, an oil company, in April. Shell
never made anything from asbestos but, like many oil firms, used it
in its refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms that must be surprised to find themselves caught up
in lawsuits include Campbell's Soup and Gerber, a baby-food maker.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor may be timing. According to a lawyer involved in
the cases, earlier this year efforts failed to pass federal
legislation that would control payments.
</P>
<P>
   While these drew wide support, they faced strong opposition from
trial lawyers as well as a likely veto from President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, so the idea goes, the Congress and government may
change and be less sympathetic to endless lawsuits. Thus there is a
rush to file suits fast.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that the asbestos-related companies, sick of
taking body blows, are starting to lash out themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In an intriguing reversal of roles, the Manville Trust, along
with several other defendants in asbestos cases, will go before a
Federal Appeals Court next month to get clearance for
multibillion-dollar claims against tobacco manufacturers (Owens
Corning has filed a similar suit in California).
</P>
<P>
   The premise is that the effects of asbestos poisoning are far
worse when combined with smoking cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most battered old bruisers, it seems, can still swing
the odd punch. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Historians studying turn-of-the-century events may
be baffled by the Iraqi element. Why, they might ask, did American
and British aircraft bomb a warehouse, and perhaps a railway
station too, in southern Iraq in mid-August 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Simple, the texts will say. To protect the southern Iraqis from
the dictator in Baghdad, American and British aircraft are
patrolling the skies, preventing the Iraqis from attacking their
dissidents. Every now and then, when radar is turned in their
direction, they drop bombs on Iraqi antiaircraft sites.
</P>
<P>
   Precision bombing, regrettably, is not always as precise as it
should be. But did the patrols at least render southern Iraqis
safer from persecution? There is little evidence they did.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein will go down in the history books as one of the
nastier dictators. The question is whether his sins justify
American and British petulance at their failure to get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   The air patrols and the bombing, more effective in protecting
the autonomous Kurdish zone in the north than in the unliberated
south, are in any event a pinprick in Iraq's flesh compared with
the continuing ten-year United Nations sanctions on Iraq,
preventing it from selling its oil freely.
</P>
<P>
   The original reason for the sanctions was right and proper.
Iraq, defeated in war after invading and occupying its neighbor,
Kuwait, was to be made to destroy all its most unpleasant weapons,
and to be monitored in a way that made future production
improbable. The sanctions would then be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   After strenuous efforts, the elimination of weapons was nearly
complete. Not quite: Iraq, defiant to the last, kept some
biological bits and pieces tucked away.
</P>
<P>
   Following a series of rows, and some fierce American bombing,
the inspection regime collapsed. Nowadays nobody can control or
monitor whatever horrible weapons Iraq may be developing.
</P>
<P>
   But the sanctions regime continues, even though its original
purpose has gone up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
   To make the sanctions more ``humane,'' Iraq is allowed to sell
some oil in return for monitored food and medicine. But the latest
head of the U.N. oil-for-food mission (his two predecessors
resigned in disgust) emphasized this week that the U.N.'s
precautionary hold on an ``excessive'' number of purchasing
contracts was seriously hindering the humanitarian program.
</P>
<P>
   And UNICEF has just reminded the world that, in the 1990s, the
sanctions regime is estimated to have cost the lives of half a
million Iraqi children under five. &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ ``Why has the president been silent?'' asked the daily
Komsomolskaya Pravda in two-inch high red letters on its front page
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Below the headline there is a photograph of President Vladimir
Putin in a peaked naval cap taking the salute on the bridge of a
Russian naval vessel earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper asks why Putin took five days to make his first
brief comment on the sinking of the Kursk nuclear submarine to the
bottom of the Barents Sea: ``There was only one man who kept
silent. The Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of Russia. The
honorary sailor.''
</P>
<P>
   It notes acidly that during this period he has found time to
appoint new ambassadors to Jamaica and Chile and reverse a decision
by the city of Tula on the disposal of scrap metal, but he has not
talked to the distraught relatives of the 118 sailors entombed
aboard the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year Putin has projected the image of the
strong-willed Russian leader who would seek to restore his
country's military strength. He owed his initial popularity to his
decision to send the Russian army into Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the presidential election in March he dressed up in
a military pilot's uniform to fly in a fighter-bomber. He even
spent a night underwater in a nuclear submarine.
</P>
<P>
   It is these images which are now coming back to haunt Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Callers to Russian radio programs ask why, given his liking for
military uniform during the presidential election campaign, did he
appear in a beige T-shirt at the Black Sea vacation resort of Sochi
to make his first remarks about the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for Putin's low profile is obvious enough. From the
moment the Kursk plunged to the bottom of the sea last Saturday _
the day the president went on holiday _ Kremlin officials probably
thought things would end badly.
</P>
<P>
   The daily Kommersant says bluntly that they did not want to take
responsibility. They preferred that those carrying out the rescue
should be seen as ``ultimately responsible for the people's
deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin may have underestimated the impact of the long,
drawn out drama of the Kursk is having on Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fate of the 118 sailors, already dead or slowly
suffocating in their submarine, is having a bigger popular impact
than the death of over 2,500 Russian soldiers in Chechnya,'' said
Andrei Mironov, a Russian human-rights activist.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Putin, there is a limit to what he can do, but
what he has done he has done late. First there was a long delay in
accepting foreign help to try to save the men in the submarine.
Only Thursday was a naval conference called in Severomorsk to
investigate the cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Putin directly responsible for the stream of
misinformation and apparent lies about the Kursk which followed the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The giant submarine was first described as ``malfunctioning''
and ``descending to the ocean floor'' last Sunday. In fact an
explosion _ or just possibly a collision _ on the evening of the
previous day sent the Kursk crashing into the sea floor with no
time to send a signal or release its satellite communications
beacon.
</P>
<P>
   A major military disaster was always likely as the armed forces
try to keep highly sophisticated equipment operating on a military
budget of only $5 billion. A senior submarine officer gets paid
only $200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Putin is that he has portrayed himself as a
``hands-on'' president, in sharp contrast to his predecessor, Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   This makes it difficult for him to distance himself from the
tragedy of the Kursk. It does not mean, however, that he will not
try. When Chechen suicide bombers killed 36 Russian soldiers in
Chechnya earlier in the summer, he publicly dressed down Marshal
Igor Segeyev, his defense minister on television.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk submarine disaster does not prove that Putin is
personally ineffective, but it does show the emptiness of his
rhetoric about restoring Russia's military and political strength. &QL;

   MOSCOW _ ``I can't sit around waiting here any longer. I must go
up there,'' cried Valentina Staroseltseva, whose 20-year-old son,
Dmitry, is among the 118 submariners trapped on the Kursk at the
bottom of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the city of Kursk, which regularly sends its young
men to serve in the Northern Fleet and after which the submarine
was named, collected money to help relatives like Mrs.
Staroseltseva to travel to the Arctic coast Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Their 45-hour train ride will bring them to Severomorsk, where
they will be able to see no more of the frantic rescue operation
than they have seen for the past five days on their television sets
at home. But at least they will feel nearer to their loved ones in
their underwater nightmare _ if, that is, the sailors are still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   As it dawned on Russians that their image-obsessed leaders had
wasted days before allowing a British team to join the rescue
effort, there was mounting public anger and more sympathy for the
conscripts than the top brass on the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven of the conscripts came from the city of Kursk,
500 km (325 miles) south of Moscow, which until the tragedy at sea
was known chiefly as the site of a major tank battle during the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Kursk relatives, Mrs. Staroseltseva, a nurse, was most
open to being filmed by Russian television. The independent NTV
station showed her, looking businesslike in a red suit, preparing
to channel her desperate, maternal energy into the practicalities
of the long journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am angry that we did not let the British come sooner,'' she
said, referring to Moscow's three-day delay in accepting the
British offer of help.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a mother, I want everything to be done faster and better. I
think maybe he (Dmitry) is lying silently. As a mother, I hope he
is calm. The main thing is not to panic,'' said Mrs. Staroseltseva,
who had passed her own Orthodox Christian beliefs on to her son.
</P>
<P>
   The irony was that Mrs. Staroseltseva had been pleased to see
Dmitry sent to the prestigious Northern Fleet instead of the
notorious ``stroibat'' (construction brigade), where bullying is
rife, or, worse, to what Russians call the ``meat grinder'' _
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the submarine was so safe,'' she said. ``We called
it our submarine. We were 100 percent confident in it. We really
believed in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dmitry, who graduated with high marks from a railway college
before joining the navy, had to compete with other conscripts for a
posting on the Kursk. ``He has always loved swimming in the
river,'' said his mother. ``It was impossible to pull him out of
there. He loves machinery too.''
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent letter home, he enthused about life on the
modern, 14,000-ton, nuclear submarine, which had been the pride of
the fleet. ``It is just like home here. I'm really happy. We have
four meals a day, just like home. We will resurface in the middle
of August. See you soon.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Staroseltseva had a premonition of disaster. She said
she felt ``ill and out of sorts'' on Sunday before the news of the
sinking broke. ``Then I heard the submarine was lying on the
seabed. I understood that something had gone wrong. The only thing
that helps me now is to pray.'' &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ With every hour that passes, the chances of any of
the Kursk submarine crew surviving its sinking are dwindling. The
likely outcome will be a human tragedy and another blow to the
fragile, edgy pride of military Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the nuclear-powered submarine _ the flagship of the
Northern Fleet _ has strong symbolic significance for the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a miracle rescue, it will be the first major disaster
President Vladimir Putin has had to deal with since coming to
power, and a test of his ability to comfort and sustain, as well as
to rule.
</P>
<P>
   An untested politician and product of the foreign intelligence
apparatchik, Putin rose to power on the back of Boris Yeltsin's
senescence and the war in Chechnya. He has not, so far, had to
expend emotional or political capital on shoring up his authority.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of the vast scale of the Russian Federation, its
diverse population is highly engaged in and affected by national
tragedies. Those that emphasize the gap between the faded power of
the ``Great Soviet Union'' and associated mythologies and battered,
confused present-day Russia are especially deeply felt.
</P>
<P>
   President Putin donned an admiral's uniform when he went to
inspect the Northern Fleet after his election, a significant
gesture intended to remind the armed forces that he, rather than
any uppity defense minister or ambitious general, is ultimately in
charge of Russia's future and the projection of its military force.
</P>
<P>
   This costume drama has been followed by more concrete
undertakings. Last week's National Security Council meeting was a
bridgehead for his armed forces reform agenda. The outcome was
highly welcome to the West.
</P>
<P>
   The commitment to provide real and unsparing strategic focus, an
honest assessment of the country's decaying nuclear capability and
commitment to cut back on intercontinental ballistic missiles are
Putin's way of telling Russia's conservative military men to get
real.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the resigned joke within the Russian army was that
the nuclear forces had been ``decaying according to plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also seems to have settled the tug-of-war over the
future of military doctrine and the place of nuclear weapons in
that vision in favor of the more open-minded chief-of-staff of the
armed forces, Anatoli Kvashnin, and against the hidebound defense
minister, Marshall Sergeyev. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The only caveat is that Russians have heard at least some of
this before. First Yuri Andropov, then Mikhail Gorbachev,
recognized that the military doctrine which had led the USSR into
humiliation in Afghanistan and eaten up the defence budget
preparing to fight a war to keep the satellite states of Eastern
European within the sphere of influence had ended in tears,
humiliation and retreat. Yeltsin vowed to reform the armed forces
only to end up in an ungainly wrestling match with a succession of
appalling defence ministers, the desperate, ill-considered
intervention in Chechnya and subsequent humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin was the beneficiary of this chaos and carnage.
That does not mean that he is immune from the pressures that came
to weigh so heavily on his predecessors. He may be extremely smart:
but then neither Gorbachev nor Yeltsin - before the drink and
illness got him - were stupid. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Russians speak of the new president as bringing ``a year of
hope'' _ the very modesty of the compliment being a recognition of
their low expectations of success.
</P>
<P>
   At such a time, the Barents Sea disaster is a highly
inconvenient distraction. As the land forces have declined in
status, bedevilled by their role in Afghanistan and the high
casualty rate suffered in Chechnya, the navy has come to be seen as
the most reliable and best-trained of the services.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of NATO's Kosovo intervention, where the Russian
navy was so short-shipped and short-staffed that it could not
provide adequate naval intelligence, Putin made clear that he
intends to revive it as a modestly sized but efficient force.
</P>
<P>
   The image of a trapped submarine, forfeited to the sea in these
most sensitive of international waters, is badly at odds with the
image of revived maritime glory and confident projection of power.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev and Yeltsin struggled to pit their reforming zeal
against the grimmer realities of Russian life, and lost. When the
gap between the two grew too wide, their leaderships became mere
survival battles. From that point on, very little reform gets done
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Putin knows that he needs one big institutional reform under way
early in his presidency to provide a solid base. The armed forces
are the obvious place to start. Two pillars support his presidency
_ the domestic and the international. Both will be strengthened if
he succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   He has no shortage of brand-new friends in the West. A new U.S.
president, be it Bush or Gore, will have no interest in picking a
fight with a halfway reasonable Russian leader. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   For all the alarmist talk of the impact on U.S.-Russian
relations of the proposed U.S. Nuclear Missile Defense (NMD)
program, some senior Russian officials are privately far more
relaxed at the prospect than Western liberal opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Putin's incisions into the nuclear stockpiles indicate
that he has a clear understanding of how different the post-Cold
War order really is to the old bi-polar world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, NMD, like any major shift in the security
architecture, needs to be conducted steadily and carefully. That is
not the same as saying that it should not be considered at all.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the technology works now or not is beside the point. The
likelihood is that it _ or something like it _ will be made to work
some day in the none-too-distant future.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason if none other, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
did the right thing in seeking to create a link to Putin early in
the presidency and establishing his voice at the beginning of a new
conversation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,225) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to Russian leaders, however promising, a grain
of caution is never amiss. Yeltsin's falling star exhibited the
Western tendency to back the man rather than the reform.
</P>
<P>
   I notice that Peter Hain, the smooth-talking British Foreign
Office minister, has taken to describing the Blair-Putin
relationship as ``close friendship.'' This is ludicrous, given that
they have met briefly twice.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the strangled tones of diplomacy, friendship means more
than that, unless he was using the Soviet-speak of druzhba _ the
vow of friendship rhetorically extended to anyone Moscow was not
actually at war with.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of Putin's reforms and of Russia's relations with
the outside world are shrouded in uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   We know that the reigning in of the corrupt business oligarchs,
the reconfiguration of nuclear capability and the armed forces, and
the willingness to play a conciliatory role in the Balkans are
positive beginnings which should be recognized and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   But we also know, from the zigzags of recent Russian history,
how vulnerable its leaders are to the corrosive seepage of internal
resistance and the undermining of their first year of hope. That
has not changed.
</P>
<P>
   The West's calculations and the schmoozy boasts of intimacy on
behalf of the British government should not be based on the airy
assumption that it has. &QL;

intends to revive it as a modestly sized but efficient force.
</P>
<P>
   The image of a trapped submarine, forfeited to the sea in these
most sensitive of international waters, is badly at odds with the
image of revived maritime glory and confident projection of power.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev and Yeltsin struggled to pit their reforming zeal
against the grimmer realities of Russian life, and lost. When the
gap between the two grew too wide, their leaderships became mere
survival battles. From that point on, very little reform gets done
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Putin knows that he needs one big institutional reform under way
early in his presidency to provide a solid base. The armed forces
are the obvious place to start. Two pillars support his presidency
_ the domestic and the international. Both will be strengthened if
he succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   He has no shortage of brand-new friends in the West. A new U.S.
president, be it Bush or Gore, will have no interest in picking a
fight with a halfway reasonable Russian leader. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   For all the alarmist talk of the impact on U.S.-Russian
relations of the proposed U.S. Nuclear Missile Defense (NMD)
program, some senior Russian officials are privately far more
relaxed at the prospect than Western liberal opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Putin's incisions into the nuclear stockpiles indicate
that he has a clear understanding of how different the post-Cold
War order really is to the old bi-polar world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, NMD, like any major shift in the security
architecture, needs to be conducted steadily and carefully. That is
not the same as saying that it should not be considered at all.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the technology works now or not is beside the point. The
likelihood is that it _ or something like it _ will be made to work
some day in the none-too-distant future.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason if none other, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
did the right thing in seeking to create a link to Putin early in
the presidency and establishing his voice at the beginning of a new
conversation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,225) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to Russian leaders, however promising, a grain
of caution is never amiss. Yeltsin's falling star exhibited the
Western tendency to back the man rather than the reform.
</P>
<P>
   I notice that Peter Hain, the smooth-talking British Foreign
Office minister, has taken to describing the Blair-Putin
relationship as ``close friendship.'' This is ludicrous, given that
they have met briefly twice.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the strangled tones of diplomacy, friendship means more
than that, unless he was using the Soviet-speak of druzhba _ the
vow of friendship rhetorically extended to anyone Moscow was not
actually at war with.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of Putin's reforms and of Russia's relations with
the outside world are shrouded in uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   We know that the reigning in of the corrupt business oligarchs,
the reconfiguration of nuclear capability and the armed forces, and
the willingness to play a conciliatory role in the Balkans are
positive beginnings which should be recognized and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   But we also know, from the zigzags of recent Russian history,
how vulnerable its leaders are to the corrosive seepage of internal
resistance and the undermining of their first year of hope. That
has not changed.
</P>
<P>
   The West's calculations and the schmoozy boasts of intimacy on
behalf of the British government should not be based on the airy
assumption that it has. &QL;

   BERLIN _ Reacting to the relentless drumbeat of daily
atrocities, the German government Wednesday announced the first of
its sweeping measures to combat the far right.
</P>
<P>
   Some DM75 million has been earmarked for a program that seeks
the de-Nazification of German youth.
</P>
<P>
   Further steps will be unveiled by Gerhard Schroder personally
when he returns from his vacation at the weekend. What seemed like
a gentle comeback for the chancellor now promises to be a gruelling
chore: Schroder will be touring the East for the next two weeks,
visiting some of the worst hot spots of the resurgent far right.
</P>
<P>
   The program unveiled Wednesday is intended to be just the
beginning of what promises to be the most concerted attack on
right-wing extremism since the immediate aftermath of the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
   The money is to be spent on extra lessons for children on German
history and on the threatening concept _ often denounced by
mainstream conservatives _ of ``multiculturalism.''
</P>
<P>
   A hot line for reporting racist violence will be set up. Private
groups and charities combating ignorance and xenophobia on
shoestring budgets can look forward to a windfall of public funds.
</P>
<P>
   The government will train staff who work on public transport not
to look away when foreigners are being harassed, and hire young
computer experts to track down neo-Nazi Web sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, social workers have been arguing that
poor education, especially in the East, was one of the main causes
of the simmering hatred towards foreigners. Their pleas have until
now fallen on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   Racism is most acute in parts of the East where the local youth
have no experience of immigrants. Two years ago, nearly 13 percent
of voters in the eastern Land of Saxony-Anhalt voted for a far
right party, even though only 2 percent of the region's population
was of foreign origin.
</P>
<P>
   Extra lessons, though, will not be enough. Renate Kunast, one of
the Greens' two co-leaders, Wednesday called for retraining of
teachers in the East, because they are seen as part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The communist authorities planted the myth that Nazism had been
the work of an isolated bunch of people, successfully purged from
the Workers' Paradise, but still lurking in the decadent West.
</P>
<P>
   Many East German teachers therefore have an ambivalent attitude
to the Third Reich, and fail to see similarities between today's
xenophobic banter in the classroom and the chain of events that had
led to the rise of Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a lot more than DM75 million to wipe away the
ingrained misconceptions of two generations. The opposition Free
Democrats are urging as much as DM300 million to be splashed out on
a national brainwashing program at schools.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond further training, the government is expected to set up a
panel of eminent personalities to coordinate the intellectual drive
against far-right tendencies. The real problem, as many politicians
are increasingly prepared to admit, is that the dislike of
foreigners is anything but a marginal phenomenon in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Xenophobia is socially respectable. Crime, for instance, is
routinely portrayed by the media and leading politicians as a
foreign pursuit. Such an initiative was launched earlier this week
in Germany's most populous Land, North Rhine-Westphalia.
</P>
<P>
   The regional capital Dusseldorf was the scene last month of a
bomb attack injuring 10 immigrants from the former Soviet Union,
including six Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Clement, the Land prime minister and one of Schroder`s
closest political allies, is putting pressure on the local police
and judiciary to act tough on hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   This line of attack, coupled with moves to ban the far right
National Democratic Party (NPD), is expected to be at the center of
Schroder's plan to rid the country of neo-Nazi violence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uproar over Dusseldorf and a string of outrages,
every day brings news of fresh attacks. Wednesday, for instance,
came reports from Hamburg of a neo-Nazi youth stabbing a Turkish
man.
</P>
<P>
   On the northeastern coast, about 250 posters have gone up
attacking the ``murder'' of Rudolf Hess. Today (Thursday) marks the
anniversary of the death of Hitler's deputy at Spandau prison, and
the lads in black leather jackets and combat boots will be marching
again. &QL;

 By ANDREW GUMBEL  
 c.2000 The Independent, London

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With Democrats looking for nothing less than an
epiphany to breathe new life into their struggling campaign for the
White House, all eyes turned Thursday night to the man who embodies
many of the party's misgivings but is the only one who can truly
rekindle its hopes _ its candidate, for better or worse, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared to formally accept the party's nomination at the
closing night of the convention, the vice president knew that he
had to give the speech of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In one swoop, he had to allay fears that he is too distant and
aloof, set out a compelling policy program without appearing to
fudge on the key issues, win the confidence of the Democratic
Party's liberal grass roots while at the same time reaching out to
centrist swing voters and, above all, bridge the charisma gap that
has left him deep in Bill Clinton's shadow for the past eight years
and stir his audience to true enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   It was, to say the very least, a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore would seem to have every advantage _ experience,
brains, and the benefit of the longest boom in postwar U.S. history
_ this week's Democratic National Convention has revealed a party
fraught with doubt about his suitability for the top job.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican nominee, George W. Bush, has been ahead in
opinion polls for months and appears to enjoy a more favorable
public perception even on issues where Gore should in theory excel,
such as foreign and defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   Since no Democrat seriously believes Bush, with his limited
experience of public office, can hold a candle to Gore's grasp of
the issues, they suspect the real deficiency is one of character.
</P>
<P>
   One poll this week showed that 47 percent of voters had decided
that whoever they picked for president it would not be Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, there are fears that Gore is taking the
Democrats so far to the right _ by choosing the conservative
Connecticut senator, Joseph Lieberman, as his running mate, for
example _ that he is alienating the very people he needs to
emphasize what should be clearly demonstrable differences between
his positions and Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence in the Democratic Party has been so shaky that even
this week's high points _ Clinton's bravura speech on Monday night
and an similarly compelling oration by Lieberman on Wednesday _
have been tempered by the same haunting questions: Will this be
enough? Will Gore be able to top these fine performances, or will
he fall short?
</P>
<P>
   The strategy that has emerged is to go populist, to show Gore as
being far more in touch with the concerns of ordinary people than
the ordinary people might suspect.
</P>
<P>
   To bring the vice president down off his intellectual perch,
much of the focus has been on his ``human journey'' _ presenting
his career in dramatic, personal terms, and emphasizing his other
side as a family man with down-to-earth feelings and tastes like
any other American.
</P>
<P>
   As she presented his nomination to the floor, Gore's daughter
Karenna Gore Schiff reminisced about him making breakfast for the
family _ even if it was just toast and butter. Gore's roommate from
his Harvard days, the actor Tommy Lee Jones, recalled them shooting
pool and ``catching the odd cow'' together.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been an effort to convert Gore's awkwardness into
strengths by making it the butt of self-deprecating jokes. When
looking for a director to shoot a video of the Gore family vacation
in North Carolina earlier this month, Gore made the inspired choice
of Spike Jonze, the man who made the wacky comedy ``Being John
Malkovich.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the characters in that film find a portal leading into
the brain of the eponymous actor, so Jonze was asked to find a
portal into the enigmatic, elusive head of the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In the video, shown at the convention Thursday night, Gore
appears relaxed and understanding of the misgivings about him.
``The guy standing motionless on stage behind the president _ what
the hell makes him think he can be president?'' Gore laughs.
</P>
<P>
   He also admits his discomfort at the glad-handing side of
politics. ``I'm a lot more comfortable with the idea of rolling up
my sleeves and making the system work than I am with the
campaigning,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This theme, and the contrast it establishes with the easygoing,
good ol' boyish Bush, is clearly one that will continue.
</P>
<P>
   It was echoed on Wednesday by the governor of California, Gray
Davis (no king of charisma himself), who told delegates: ``The
American people are not looking for a rock star to be president,''
he argued, ``they want a serious man of substance.''
</P>
<P>
   If the substance is there, however, a lot of Democrats are
anxious to know exactly what it consists of. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Away from the convention floor, this week has seen the biggest
orgy of corporate-sponsored fund-raising parties in Democratic
Party history, leading many delegates to wonder whether they aren't
straying too far from the party's roots and whether Gore wouldn't
be beholden to the special interests offering to bankroll his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There are policy concerns on everything from education and
Social Security to affirmative action and defense.
African-Americans, for example, need to be convinced the ticket
represents their interests, or else the support they consistently
gave to Clinton might simply melt away.
</P>
<P>
   Other liberals, meanwhile, are being wooed by the consumer
advocate Ralph Nader, who is running on the Green Party ticket and
enjoying around 8 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman went some way to address these issues in his speech,
itself a model of easygoing populism. But it is Gore's name that
appears at the top of the ticket, and Gore alone who can overcome
the misgivings of party and country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   For all his policy wonkishness and experience of focus groups
and committee work, he is essentially a man who makes decisions
alone. He gave perhaps the truest indication of his character by
withdrawing from view earlier this month and writing his speech by
himself, with little input from even his closest colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   His appearances across Middle America earlier this week, and
again briefly on the convention floor on Wednesday, suggest he is
energized and ready to meet the challenge. Whether he succeeds or
fails, he knows it is all down to him. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ With Democrats looking for nothing less than an
epiphany to breathe new life into their struggling campaign for the
White House, all eyes turned Thursday night to the man who embodies
many of the party's misgivings but is the only one who can truly
rekindle its hopes _ its candidate, for better or worse, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared to formally accept the party's nomination at the
closing night of the convention, the vice president knew that he
had to give the speech of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In one swoop, he had to allay fears that he is too distant and
aloof, set out a compelling policy program without appearing to
fudge on the key issues, win the confidence of the Democratic
Party's liberal grass roots while at the same time reaching out to
centrist swing voters and, above all, bridge the charisma gap that
has left him deep in Bill Clinton's shadow for the past eight years
and stir his audience to true enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   It was, to say the very least, a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore would seem to have every advantage _ experience,
brains, and the benefit of the longest boom in postwar U.S. history
_ this week's Democratic National Convention has revealed a party
fraught with doubt about his suitability for the top job.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican nominee, George W. Bush, has been ahead in
opinion polls for months and appears to enjoy a more favorable
public perception even on issues where Gore should in theory excel,
such as foreign and defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   Since no Democrat seriously believes Bush, with his limited
experience of public office, can hold a candle to Gore's grasp of
the issues, they suspect the real deficiency is one of character.
</P>
<P>
   One poll this week showed that 47 percent of voters had decided
that whoever they picked for president it would not be Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, there are fears that Gore is taking the
Democrats so far to the right _ by choosing the conservative
Connecticut senator, Joseph Lieberman, as his running mate, for
example _ that he is alienating the very people he needs to
emphasize what should be clearly demonstrable differences between
his positions and Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence in the Democratic Party has been so shaky that even
this week's high points _ Clinton's bravura speech on Monday night
and an similarly compelling oration by Lieberman on Wednesday _
have been tempered by the same haunting questions: Will this be
enough? Will Gore be able to top these fine performances, or will
he fall short?
</P>
<P>
   The strategy that has emerged is to go populist, to show Gore as
being far more in touch with the concerns of ordinary people than
the ordinary people might suspect.
</P>
<P>
   To bring the vice president down off his intellectual perch,
much of the focus has been on his ``human journey'' _ presenting
his career in dramatic, personal terms, and emphasizing his other
side as a family man with down-to-earth feelings and tastes like
any other American.
</P>
<P>
   As she presented his nomination to the floor, Gore's daughter
Karenna Gore Schiff reminisced about him making breakfast for the
family _ even if it was just toast and butter. Gore's roommate from
his Harvard days, the actor Tommy Lee Jones, recalled them shooting
pool and ``catching the odd cow'' together.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been an effort to convert Gore's awkwardness into
strengths by making it the butt of self-deprecating jokes. When
looking for a director to shoot a video of the Gore family vacation
in North Carolina earlier this month, Gore made the inspired choice
of Spike Jonze, the man who made the wacky comedy ``Being John
Malkovich.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the characters in that film find a portal leading into
the brain of the eponymous actor, so Jonze was asked to find a
portal into the enigmatic, elusive head of the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In the video, shown at the convention Thursday night, Gore
appears relaxed and understanding of the misgivings about him.
``The guy standing motionless on stage behind the president _ what
the hell makes him think he can be president?'' Gore laughs.
</P>
<P>
   He also admits his discomfort at the glad-handing side of
politics. ``I'm a lot more comfortable with the idea of rolling up
my sleeves and making the system work than I am with the
campaigning,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This theme, and the contrast it establishes with the easygoing,
good ol' boyish Bush, is clearly one that will continue.
</P>
<P>
   It was echoed on Wednesday by the governor of California, Gray
Davis (no king of charisma himself), who told delegates: ``The
American people are not looking for a rock star to be president,''
he argued, ``they want a serious man of substance.''
</P>
<P>
   If the substance is there, however, a lot of Democrats are
anxious to know exactly what it consists of. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Away from the convention floor, this week has seen the biggest
orgy of corporate-sponsored fund-raising parties in Democratic
Party history, leading many delegates to wonder whether they aren't
straying too far from the party's roots and whether Gore wouldn't
be beholden to the special interests offering to bankroll his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There are policy concerns on everything from education and
Social Security to affirmative action and defense.
African-Americans, for example, need to be convinced the ticket
represents their interests, or else the support they consistently
gave to Clinton might simply melt away.
</P>
<P>
   Other liberals, meanwhile, are being wooed by the consumer
advocate Ralph Nader, who is running on the Green Party ticket and
enjoying around 8 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman went some way to address these issues in his speech,
itself a model of easygoing populism. But it is Gore's name that
appears at the top of the ticket, and Gore alone who can overcome
the misgivings of party and country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   For all his policy wonkishness and experience of focus groups
and committee work, he is essentially a man who makes decisions
alone. He gave perhaps the truest indication of his character by
withdrawing from view earlier this month and writing his speech by
himself, with little input from even his closest colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   His appearances across Middle America earlier this week, and
again briefly on the convention floor on Wednesday, suggest he is
energized and ready to meet the challenge. Whether he succeeds or
fails, he knows it is all down to him. &QL;

walk on to the platform at the Staples Center in Los Angeles and
deliver the speech of his life. Having attained his party's
presidential nomination after two failed attempts, he must now show
that there is genuine substance beneath the exaggerated ardor or

accepts the Democratic nomination for president, will keep him in
the presidential race with a sporting chance of winning. Failure
could spell the beginning of the end of his political career, at

   MOSCOW _ ``Why has the president been silent?'' demanded the
daily Komsomolskaya Pravda in two-inch high red letters on its
front page Thursday. The newspaper asks why vacationing Vladimir
Putin took five days to make his first brief comment on the sinking
of the Kursk nuclear submarine to the bottom of the Barents Sea,
while finding time to appoint new ambassadors to Jamaica and Chile.
Just before the presidential election in March Putin dressed up in
a military pilot's uniform to fly in a fighter-bomber. He even,
ironically, spent a night underwater in a nuclear submarine. It is
these images which are now coming back to haunt Putin....By Patrick

Dmitry, is among the 118 submariners trapped on the Kursk at the
bottom of the Barents Sea. The irony is that she had been pleased
to see Dmitry sent to the prestigious Northern Fleet instead of the
notorious ``stroibat'' (construction brigade), where bullying is
rife, or, worse, to what Russians call the ``meat grinder'' _
Chechnya. ``We thought the submarine was so safe,'' she said. ``We

sign up to a series of measures designed to make life calmer and
hence more enjoyable for citizens and visitors alike. The Slow
Cities project touches a nerve everywhere because one of the
growing divisions in our society is not about money but about time.
For most of us there is a genuine problem of balance: how do we get

find time for fun? The Slow Cities movement can teach us some

   LOS ANGELES _ There could be no more irresistible political
farewell. Like the flawed hero in his own Hollywood movie,
President Bill Clinton prepared to address the Democratic Party
faithful Monday night on a wave of high emotion and extravagant
praise for the man who would succeed him, Vice President Al Gore.
But the Gore camp has had to worry about being upstaged. Just by
opening his mouth and smiling his infectiously boyish smile,
Clinton risks putting his putative successor into the shade. In the
Emerald City, it will inescapably seem that the Wizard of Oz is

   LOS ANGELES _ With Democrats looking for nothing less than an
epiphany to breathe new life into their struggling campaign for the
White House, all eyes turned Thursday night to the man who embodies
many of the party's misgivings but is the only one who can truly
rekindle its hopes _ its candidate, for better or worse, Al Gore.

closing night of this week's convention, the vice president knew

   LOS ANGELES _ On Thursday night, Vice President Al Gore must
walk on to the platform at the Staples Center in Los Angeles and
deliver the speech of his life. Having attained his party's
presidential nomination after two failed attempts, he must now show
that there is genuine substance beneath the exaggerated ardor or
anger he often displays in his public appearance. Success, as he
accepts the Democratic nomination for president, will keep him in
the presidential race with a sporting chance of winning. Failure
could spell the beginning of the end of his political career, at

   MOSCOW _ ``Why has the president been silent?'' demanded the
daily Komsomolskaya Pravda in two-inch high red letters on its
front page Thursday. The newspaper asks why vacationing Vladimir
Putin took five days to make his first brief comment on the sinking
of the Kursk nuclear submarine to the bottom of the Barents Sea,
while finding time to appoint new ambassadors to Jamaica and Chile.
Just before the presidential election in March Putin dressed up in
a military pilot's uniform to fly in a fighter-bomber. He even,
ironically, spent a night underwater in a nuclear submarine. It is
these images which are now coming back to haunt Putin....By Patrick

   MOSCOW _ ``I can't sit around waiting here any longer. I must go
up there,'' cried Valentina Staroseltseva, whose 20-year-old son,
Dmitry, is among the 118 submariners trapped on the Kursk at the
bottom of the Barents Sea. The irony is that she had been pleased
to see Dmitry sent to the prestigious Northern Fleet instead of the
notorious ``stroibat'' (construction brigade), where bullying is
rife, or, worse, to what Russians call the ``meat grinder'' _
Chechnya. ``We thought the submarine was so safe,'' she said. ``We
called it our submarine. We were 100 percent confident in it. We
really believed in it.''...By Helen Womack, The Independent &QL;

   LONDON _ Just an hour's (slow) drive from San Gimignano are half
a dozen Italian towns that are trying to slow down the pace of
life. They are members of the ``Slow City'' movement, where towns
sign up to a series of measures designed to make life calmer and
hence more enjoyable for citizens and visitors alike. The Slow
Cities project touches a nerve everywhere because one of the
growing divisions in our society is not about money but about time.
For most of us there is a genuine problem of balance: how do we get
our work done, fulfill our social and family obligations, and still
find time for fun? The Slow Cities movement can teach us some
principles of how we might do so....By Hamish McRae, The

   Be careful what you wish for, because your wish just might come
true.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the stock market's recent rally as the calendar flipped
from May to June. The driving force behind the upswing: the
disclosure that the U.S. economy was no longer expanding as rapidly
as it had been earlier in the year. What was bad news for business,
in other words, had become good news for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   This was exactly what the market had been hoping would happen.
For months, Wall Street had been focused on the Federal Reserve
Board. The Fed had become the nemesis of the stock market because
of its ongoing campaign to combat even the remotest prospect of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Four times in six months the central bank had seen fit to raise
interest rates. Each time it had done so, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, and the Nasdaq had all taken a hit.
</P>
<P>
   What Wall Street wanted to know more than anything else was when
the Fed was going to end its campaign. The predominant view was
that Fed chairman Alan Greenspan would call a halt as soon as he
got some sign that his nasty medicine was actually working. Any
hint of a slowdown in economic activity might serve this purpose _
which explains why investors began to hope and pray for some lousy
economic news.
</P>
<P>
   Such twisted thinking is, of course, vulnerable to reality.
Notice what's missing in the above line of reasoning: the impact
that a slowing economy in and of itself might have on stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it customary for a drop in business activity to hurt
corporate earnings _ and therefore depress stock values? Indeed,
what looks like a boost for stocks right now may not seem so
favorable by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Worries that Greenspan's Fed may have done its job too well _
that the economy might be slowing too much _ could derail the
fourth-quarter rally that many investors are banking on to rescue
their portfolios in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Once the market gets the proof it needs that the Fed has decided
to cease its anti-inflation campaign it, too, will probably begin
asking these questions.
</P>
<P>
   How quickly the collective attention of investors shifts from
the good news about the Fed to the bad news about a slowing economy
may be the single most important unknown facing equity investors in
the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, let's go back and review the underlying
economic news that first prompted the market rally.
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, the Department of Commerce reported that spending on
construction projects had fallen by 0.6 percent in April. It was
the first decline in this important economic indicator since
September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The latest figure also represented a sharp change from the 0.8
percent gain Commerce had reported for the month of March.
Additionally, the April figure was well below the consensus
projection of Wall Street economists, who had anticipated a number
closer to zero.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, the National Association of Purchasing Management
in Tempe, Ariz., reported that its index of economic activity had
hit 53.2 in May. That suggested that while the economy was still
growing _ any reading above 50 foretells an expansion in GNP _ it
was doing so at a much slower rate than the 55.5 reading projected
by Wall Street economists (as well as the 54.9 reading recorded in
April).
</P>
<P>
   Other business-news headlines also appeared to confirm a picture
of a slowing economy. Sales at most U.S. retailers were tepid at
best in May. Kmart reported a mere 0.9 percent rise in same-store
sales for the month. The increase at May Department Stores was
slightly better, at 1.2 percent, but Saks reported only a 0.7
percent improvement in sales.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. automakers also had a sluggish month. Ford Motor said total
domestic vehicle sales rose just 1.4 percent in May compared to the
year-earlier month. That was a very different result from the 12
percent year-to-year gain Ford had reported as recently as April.
</P>
<P>
   At General Motors, total vehicle sales in May actually fell
almost 6 percent from the year-earlier total.
</P>
<P>
   More news of the Kmart and GM variety would begin to raise
questions about whether the Fed had actually given its patient an
overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Smith, Prudential Securities' chief investment strategist,
first brought this up on May 3 when he wrote, ``It always seems to
happen that rates are raised so much that, rather than simply
slowing GDP growth to a more moderate rate of growth (say, 3
percent annually), the economy actually weakens.''
</P>
<P>
   Investor anticipation of an economic slowdown will likely unfold
in two stages. At first, the focus will be on specific stocks to
avoid _ such as those of middle-market retailers and the producers
of automobiles and houses. Money will flow out of these sectors and
into areas that seem likely to sidestep the worst of the downturn
or perhaps even to profit from it.
</P>
<P>
   Stage two will occur if and when the market as a whole begins to
seem vulnerable. At current price levels, stocks are attractive
buys only if current earnings expectations for the third and fourth
quarters are actually met (or even exceeded). There's no room for
disappointment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 900) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Different sectors of the stock market are likely to thrive
during each stage. Expect to see a relief bounce in the tech sector
on June 28 if the Fed indicates that its rate hikes are over. That
bounce could turn into a red-hot tech rally if investors quickly
start to worry about slower economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   These stocks' high revenues and earnings growth rates make them
seem immune to any slowdown in the economy. If investor attention
turns to panic about growth this quickly, the rally in technology
stocks that many investors are now pegging for September could
occur much earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a few high-profile warnings about reduced
revenue or earnings prospects could also put high price-to-earnings
technology stocks under pressure again as analysts start to hedge
their forecasts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Sectors with dependable growth _ drug stocks, for example _
would become safe havens for money flowing out of the riskier
technology stocks. That kind of sector rotation could make the
fourth quarter very choppy.
</P>
<P>
   All this raises immense timing problems for investors who have
been trying to figure out when it's safe to put cash back to work
in the market and for those who, having switched sectors to avoid
the worst of the year's technology meltdown, are now trying to
decide which sectors to own for the remainder of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Investors could find themselves again facing the choice of
moving early _ and possibly in the wrong direction _ or staying put
and toughing it out. &QL;

   U.S. automakers also had a sluggish month. Ford Motor said total
domestic vehicle sales rose just 1.4 percent in May compared to the
year-earlier month. That was a very different result from the 12
percent year-to-year gain Ford had reported as recently as April.
</P>
<P>
   At General Motors, total vehicle sales in May actually fell
almost 6 percent from the year-earlier total.
</P>
<P>
   More news of the Kmart and GM variety would begin to raise
questions about whether the Fed had actually given its patient an
overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Smith, Prudential Securities' chief investment strategist,
first brought this up on May 3 when he wrote, ``It always seems to
happen that rates are raised so much that, rather than simply
slowing GDP growth to a more moderate rate of growth (say, 3
percent annually), the economy actually weakens.''
</P>
<P>
   Investor anticipation of an economic slowdown will likely unfold
in two stages. At first, the focus will be on specific stocks to
avoid _ such as those of middle-market retailers and the producers
of automobiles and houses. Money will flow out of these sectors and
into areas that seem likely to sidestep the worst of the downturn
or perhaps even to profit from it.
</P>
<P>
   Stage two will occur if and when the market as a whole begins to
seem vulnerable. At current price levels, stocks are attractive
buys only if current earnings expectations for the third and fourth
quarters are actually met (or even exceeded). There's no room for
disappointment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 900) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Different sectors of the stock market are likely to thrive
during each stage. Expect to see a relief bounce in the tech sector
on June 28 if the Fed indicates that its rate hikes are over. That
bounce could turn into a red-hot tech rally if investors quickly
start to worry about slower economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   These stocks' high revenues and earnings growth rates make them
seem immune to any slowdown in the economy. If investor attention
turns to panic about growth this quickly, the rally in technology
stocks that many investors are now pegging for September could
occur much earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a few high-profile warnings about reduced
revenue or earnings prospects could also put high price-to-earnings
technology stocks under pressure again as analysts start to hedge
their forecasts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Sectors with dependable growth _ drug stocks, for example _
would become safe havens for money flowing out of the riskier
technology stocks. That kind of sector rotation could make the
fourth quarter very choppy.
</P>
<P>
   All this raises immense timing problems for investors who have
been trying to figure out when it's safe to put cash back to work
in the market and for those who, having switched sectors to avoid
the worst of the year's technology meltdown, are now trying to
decide which sectors to own for the remainder of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Investors could find themselves again facing the choice of
moving early _ and possibly in the wrong direction _ or staying put
and toughing it out. &QL;

&HT;     HOW TO AVOID LACTOSE PROBLEMS WITHOUT HURTING NUTRITION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUTH FANTASIA  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Oh the bloating, the cramps, the, pardon me, gas.
All blamed on a sugar called lactose that's found in dairy
products.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Gastrointestinal Association, nearly
50 million Americans are lactose intolerant, and people in certain
ethnic and racial groups are more widely affected by the condition
than others. As many as 75 percent of all African-American, Jewish,
American-Indian and Mexican-American adults are lactose intolerant.
The number rises to 90 percent of all Asian-American adults.
</P>
<P>
   Simply avoiding dairy products is one way to reduce the
discomfort associated with lactose intolerance, but dairy products
are the primary source of calcium, a much-needed nutrient. In
addition, some dairy products contain very little lactose and some
prepared nondairy foods have lactose added to them. So how do you
cope with the symptoms? Here's help.
</P>
<P>
   What causes lactose intolerance?
</P>
<P>
   Cells that line the small intestine usually produce lactase, an
enzyme the body uses to break down lactose into simpler forms that
can be absorbed by the bloodstream. When the body doesn't make
enough lactase to digest the amount of lactose consumed, the
results can be distressing, though not serious.
</P>
<P>
   What are the symptoms?
</P>
<P>
   The most common ones are nausea, cramps, bloating, gas and
diarrhea that begin 30 minutes to two hours after eating foods that
contain lactose. The severity of the symptoms varies with each
individual.
</P>
<P>
   How can I tell if I'm lactose intolerant?
</P>
<P>
   Begin by keeping a record of everything you eat and what time
you eat it as well as the symptoms you have and the times you have
them. If you have symptoms after eating foods that contain lactose,
cut down on those foods and see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   If your symptoms subside, and you suspect you're lactose
intolerant, see your doctor. He or she can rule out other, more
serious conditions, determine your level of intolerance and help
you adjust your diet.
</P>
<P>
   Do all dairy products contain lactose?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but some have more lactose than others, which means you may
have more difficulty with some products. While milk might bother
some people, for instance, hard cheeses, which don't contain as
much lactose per serving, may not.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some dairy products such as yogurt and buttermilk
contain natural bacteria that help digest lactose. You may be able
to tolerate these products easier than other dairy products that
are not ``cultured.''
</P>
<P>
   Are there other foods that contain lactose?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Some breads and baked goods contain lactose, as do some
cereals, instant potatoes, soups and breakfast drinks. Margarine,
lunch meats (except kosher), salad dressings, candies and mixes for
pancakes, cakes, biscuits, cookies and sugar can also contain
lactose.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lactose is used as the base for manufacturing more
than 20 percent of the prescription drugs in the United States, and
6 percent of the over-the-counter medications. Ironically, some
tablets for reducing stomach acid and gas contain lactose,
according to the American Gastrointestinal Association. Ask your
pharmacist about lactose in medicines.
</P>
<P>
   How can I get the calcium I need and avoid embarrassing
symptoms?
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways you can lower your consumption of lactose
and still get enough calcium. First, several companies make
reduced-lactose or lactose-free dairy products that still contain
calcium.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, there are a number of foods that contain high
concentrations of calcium but no lactose, including: broccoli, bok
choy, collard greens, kale and turnip greens. Also on the list are
raw oysters, canned salmon with bones, sardines, canned shrimp,
molasses and tofu processed with calcium salts.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, lactase, the enzyme that helps break down lactose, can
be purchased in pill form and taken with meals.
</P>
<P>
   Do lactose-reduced milks taste different?
</P>
<P>
   We found that these products generally taste a little sweeter
than regular milk.
</P>
<P>
   Do I really have to give up ice cream?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. Most people find that if they eat foods that contain
lactose in small quantities, or with other foods, they can tolerate
some lactose. So have your scoop of ice cream with an apple
cobbler.

&HT;     STUDY SUGGESTS QUAKE LESS LIKELY IN BAY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Scientists reported Friday that the northern
Hayward Fault in California is less likely to experience a major
quake in the next three decades than previously thought,
reaffirming a similar conclusion issued last year.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and 2030, there is only a 16 percent chance of
another major quake on the northern segment of the Hayward Fault,
on the east side of the San Francisco Bay, according to an article
published in Science magazine.
</P>
<P>
   By major quake, they mean one that is at least as bad as the
1994 Northridge quake in Southern California. That earthquake
killed 57 people and caused $20 billion in damage.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Geological Survey and geoscientists in California
issued a report in 1999 estimating a 16 percent chance of a
6.7-magnitude quake in the Bay Area by 2030. The northern segment
of the Hayward Fault runs from Berkeley to the San Pablo Bay.
</P>
<P>
   A decade earlier, the prospects looked somewhat worse for the
northern Hayward Fault. A 28 percent estimate was issued in a 1990
USGS report.
</P>
<P>
   The Science article does not unveil fundamentally new
information, said seismologist Bill Ellsworth of the USGS office in
Menlo Park. He said the article mainly reports the same research
data used in the 1999 forecast, although in a more refined fashion
following a review by outside experts.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, lay people shouldn't take too literally the
12-point difference between the 1990 and 1999 estimates. The two
forecasts were based on significantly different data and
assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the 1990 report estimated the probability of
another quake like Loma Prieta, which hit the San Francisco area in
1989 and measured about 7.0 magnitude. By contrast, the 1999 report
used as its model a weaker quake, the 6.7-magnitude Northridge
event of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``both of those are very damaging earthquakes,'' said
Bob Nadeau, one of the co-authors of the Science article. The lead
author was geophysicist Roland Burgmann of the University of
California at Berkeley.

&HT;     A NOT-SO-COMPELLING RETROSPECTIVE ON ABBIE HOFFMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Cast box at end)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sad truth about Abbie Hoffman is that time has relegated him
to little more than an exuberant footnote to his own revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Seventies counterculturalism used to have several first names
among the often-imitated, never-duplicated Abbie. Or make that
``Abbie!'' as director Robert Greenwald and writer Bruce Grahams'
account of Hoffman's ascent and subsequent retreat into obscurity
was originally called. A title like ``Abbie!'' has you looking into
the klieg lights _ or, if it's to be done properly, the flashlights
of your local guerilla theater troop, or Tim Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing early that they would never reach those euphoric (and,
maybe musical heights) needed for something called ``Abbie!'',
Greenwald and Graham have gone for the more Hoffmanesque ``Steal
This Movie,'' a title that denotes mischief and arouses excitement
in the way only an independent flick about an independent flake
could. But in ``Steal This Movie'' the mischief and Hoffman's wit
seems to have been left on the cutting-room floor along with the
stamped-out buds. The film implies that it's up to something
appetizing, but the prevailing vibe is flimsy speechifying.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from a book of letters exchanged between Hoffman and his
wife, Anita, and a Marty Jezer biography, ``Steal This Movie''
feels inexplicably scant. His stint as a member of the Chicago
Seven receives such short shrift that baby boomers should feel as
cheated as persnickety X-Men fans. We see Bobby Seale jailed, more
or less in another movie. Greenwald uses a blowsy performance by
Vincent D'Onofrio to transport us from his early days as a yippie
performance artist in late-'60s Boston to his twilight spent
pinging between two women, and finally and most effectively, his
return to overheated protest.
</P>
<P>
   But this is Abbie 101.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's audience would have to be anyone who doesn't mind
their fiction filmmaking more doped up on '60s archive footage than
a Woodstock swap meet, with a story better told by the period
soundtrack than by its makers. It's often a lapsed, under-informed
documentary with restagings. Nearly the entire first half of
``Steal This Movie'' is unwatchable, with its Bruce Conner-load of
found shots and an instantly tiresome reportage device that aspires
to ascribe a Charles Foster Kane-level of enigmatic panache to
Hoffman's travails.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Hoffman is afforded neither aggrandized
classic-rock star status nor the mournful glow of a tarnished
American martyr.
</P>
<P>
   This Hoffman is a one-man way-back machine. It's unclear how
deep the film's love of Hoffman runs. Here, he's a loony blowhard
whose rhetoric agenda is 'round-the-clock. ``I'm an existential
loner,'' D'Onofrio's Abbie tell us, if he doesn't say so himself.
In reality, he was also a charismatic, if alienating, organizer,
who every now and again was known to get high, then stop and smell
the tear gas, so to speak. Here Abbie and Anita make politics, not
love. The people in ``Steal This Movie'' speak in bumper-sticker
phrases and Peter Max posters.
</P>
<P>
   After Hoffman's drug addiction gets him trapped by the police
then forces him underground, the film unfurls into something like a
beautiful, bizarre love triangle between Abbie, Anita and Joanna
Lawrenson (Jeanne Tripplehorn), the waitress he meets on the run
who devotes herself to nursing his delusions. D'Onofrio's
fire-breathing acquires a sullen depth as the film reveals a
reconciliation between Abbie and his son, who spends years thinking
his dad is just a friend of his mother's.
</P>
<P>
   Those passages are so eloquently done, it is hard to believe you
are watching the same film. It's not long before the original
bluster is restored, but there is a heretofore unfelt emotional
weight behind anchoring it that reduces the boring blur of the
first hour. Though it all might seem better focused if you returned
the favor by watching it from a soapbox.

 &HT;    I will go to great lengths to find a fine piece of lumber
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I am on the lookout for lumber. Black
walnut is my favorite wood to work, but it's easier to find someone
who's going to vote for Ralph Nader than it is to find black
walnut. I'll buy red oak when I find a decent deal, trade for ash
or cypress on occasion, pick up cedar if the price is right and am
considering a trip to Central Texas to pick up some mesquite and
pecan.
</P>
<P>
   I scour the classifieds constantly in hopes of catching someone
ready to unload a pile of lumber air-dried in a barn for the past
20 years, which led me about a month ago to a nice cache of red oak
1-by-6s and a scattering of 2-bys, all stored in a loft. This was
number-one grade, rough cut and straight as Dick Cheney.
Singlehandledy I climbed up in the loft and took down one board at
a time and loaded them into the trailer. The temperature in the
barn hovered at about 120 degrees, and I thought for a while that
this is how I will die, collapsing of heat exhaustion while loading
lumber. I survived.
</P>
<P>
   You can't find much quality hardwood lumber in East Texas, and
you sure can't afford to buy it at the lumberyard. What little
furniture-quality timber is cut here is sent to sawmills in
Louisiana that specialize in selling to furniture makers. Most of
the hardwood cut here goes for crossties and such. So you have few
choices if you're an aspiring furniture maker: Go to Louisiana and
buy it from a sawmill there, which can be worthwhile but requires a
trip to a foreign country, or buy every stick of decent wood you
find, even if it means climbing up in lofts in 120-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   Rough-cut lumber is nasty looking at first sight. The nastier it
looks, the more likely it's high quality, at least from my
experience. Old lumber is usually covered with dirt dobber nests,
cobwebs and plenty of red-clay dust. I've been chased by wasps,
uncovered an alarmingly long snake skin when loading one pile, and
been chewed up by fireants. My first big haul of walnut came about
a year ago. My wife thought I had lost my mind when I pulled in a
trailer loaded with filthy wood, babbling about what a wonderful
find I had made. Until you know better, old rough-cut lumber looks
like it belongs on a burn pile.
</P>
<P>
   Woodworkers who do any amount of volume always buy rough-cut
lumber because it's a fraction of the price of an already-planed
board at the store _ when you can find it. An eight-foot 1x6 of red
oak sells for $25 retail. I built a small entertainment center over
the winter that used about 30 such pieces, which would have cost
$750 just for the lumber. The rough-cut lumber I planed cost about
$200.
</P>
<P>
   Planing lumber is done with a machine that costs about $400,
which means it takes no time at all to pay for the planer if you do
much woodworking. The drawback is that planing lumber is loud,
dirty and slow work. The machine sounds like a screaming banshee
and creates enough sawdust and chips that the only practical
solution is to do it outside where you can pile up the waste.
Planing a dozen boards will fill up a 55-gallon drum with waste in
no time. But the waste makes great garden mulch, so at least I'm
not paying $5 a bag for mulch at the Big Discount Store. And I like
the idea of making my own mulch.
</P>
<P>
   There is the neighbor problem, though. The only sensible way to
plane lumber is to do a huge batch at a time, enough for whatever
project is on tap. That means often two-to-three hours of running a
machine that can out-decibel a chainsaw, which is not conducive for
peace and tranquility in a subdivision. Oh, well. At least I don't
have barking dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Planing lumber is a pain, but the end result is worth it. A
piece of wood comes alive in your hands, the grains and sworls
popping up as the rough surface is sliced away. The natural color
of the wood slowly appears as the board goes through the planer _
the purple hue of walnut, the reddish tint of oak, the blond
delicacy of ash. From there it's to the woodshop almost every night
as a baseball game plays on the television while I laboriously
build a piece of furniture that will outlast me, with any luck.
</P>
<P>
   I am a notoriously slow furniture maker. I recently built a
Morris chair, which has three reclining positions, lathe-turned
legs and uses mortise-and-tenon joinery. It's pretty. The entire
chair was built out of an eight-foot 4x4 piece of black walnut that
cost me about $30. Roughly, I estimated my time at 80 hours,
meaning I would have to sell the chair for about $600 at minimum
wage to break even _ and that doesn't count the cushion. I doubt
anybody would pay $600 for this chair, but I wouldn't sell it for
twice that anyway. This is not a living. It's a passion, an escape,
and an avocation. One of my descendants will own this chair one day
and maybe think of me.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why I spend weekends climbing around barns and
dodging critters to find that perfect piece of lumber.

 &HT;    Women pay for success
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ We're just sure Rep. James Traficant will unearth
those affidavits any day now, the ones proving that Janet Reno has
been consorting with a lesbian mobster call girl. No doubt he has
misplaced them in a drawer somewhere, right next to the finished
manuscript of Truman Capote's final novel.
</P>
<P>
   It must be true, every last word of it, and not the Youngstown
Democrat's caged-animal response to his legal troubles. Where else
could he have dreamed up such wild allegations?
</P>
<P>
   Where else, that is, but on late-night talk shows, ``Saturday
Night Live'' skits or a popular culture that relentlessly spoofs
Reno's appearance?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a male attorney general getting the same treatment. But
put a woman in the top law-and-order job, and she is SNL's Will
Ferrell in a lace nightie, mooning over the commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Traficant is known for his loose tongue. During an Aug.
7 appearance on the Fox News Network's ``Hannity and Colmes''
program, he accused Reno of everything from ``treason'' to driving
under the influence. Believed to be under federal investigation for
accepting cars and other gifts illegally, his motives are, shall we
say, suspect.
</P>
<P>
   In a supreme triumph of stiff-upper-lipdom, Reno said, ``I just
consider the source.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the source, indeed. But the source, alas, goes far
deeper than Traficant.
</P>
<P>
   What woman in power, or anywhere close to it (witness Chelsea
Clinton and Amy Carter) hasn't undergone intense public scrutiny
for her looks? I once watched, open-mouthed, as a balding, paunchy
congressman rated Hillary Clinton's appearance. Sounding like a
fraternity boy checking out the women on their way to freshman
convocation, he conceded that Mrs. Clinton wasn't bad: ``She isn't
a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reno has been the butt of talk show hosts,'' said Anne Runyan,
director of the women's studies program at Wright State University.
``It's a cultural grounding which essentially says that a woman in
power is a freak of nature. To be powerful is to be a man;
therefore to be a woman in power is to be manlike.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a political Catch-22: Women are mocked if they appear too
feminine (Pat Schroeder has never been forgiven for her brief
crying jag as she pulled out of the '92 presidential race); they're
mocked if perceived as too masculine. ``A woman can either be like
a man and therefore suffer jokes about her femininityhave I been
subsisting on blackened buffalo steak in the high mountains of
Colorado when back home tomatoes are at high tide, a second crop of
butter beans is coming on, pole beans are plentiful and, because of
the drought, figs are sweeter than they've been in years.
</P>
<P>
   I'm where I am because we had supper with our friends, Judy and
Alex Moye. There's an upside and a downside to dining with the
Moyes. The upside is Alex's charcoaled lamb chops. The downside is
they are always wanting to go somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Two summers ago, they invited us join them in their motor home
for a tour of the Northwestern United States and the Canadian
Rockies. At that time I pointed out some of the dimensions of the
Moye house on wheels, rather large as rolling stock goes.
</P>
<P>
   Last month when we arrived at the Moyes' for the lamb chops, I
noticed something different in their back yard. Alex had upscaled.
A former Eastern Airlines captain, he is working up to a land yacht
comparable to the Boeing 757 he flew between Hartsfield and
Seattle, roughly along the same route we are taking through Lost
Dog.
</P>
<P>
   After surviving an arduous trip into Egypt and up the Nile last
fall, followed by an unexpected visit to my wife's business
convention in Hawaii, I had hoped to spend the rest of the summer
at home, mowing pastures and tending my garden. I had even planned
to clean up my shop, a project I have been contemplating since the
spring of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   When the Moyes invited us along on their new land yacht's maiden
voyage I wasn't overly concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we ought to accept,'' said my wife, a direct
descendant of Marco Polo, who never passes up an opportunity to
travel on land, sea or air.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Moyes are just being nice,'' I said. ``Don't you think
we'd be imposing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said. ``They really want us to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're talking about Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Idaho and
Oregon,'' I pointed out. ``That part of the country is in a drought
worse than ours. We'd probably get burned up in one of those forest
fires.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nonsense,'' she countered. ``Alex is a pilot and knows
all about navigation. He can dodge the fires.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you're right,'' I admitted. The way he drives, Alex
would be the point leader if NASCAR had a motor coach division.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't realize how hot it gets out there,'' I said.
``According to the Weather Channel, 100-plus isn't unusual for this
time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said, ``but it's a dry heat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the mountains we'd be driving through are at
elevations of nearly 15,000 feet and even the new deluxe motor home
doesn't carry oxygen masks like jet airplanes,'' I explained. ``At
my age, I could have a heart attack and drop dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of my dropping dead didn't seem to bother her. So
here we are, in Lost Dog, on the lip of Wyoming's Flaming Canyon,
following a circuitous route to Oregon, passing the Salt Lake and
through Promontory in Idaho, where the famous gold spike hooked the
Atlantic and Pacific together via rail, and a few other interesting
stops.
</P>
<P>
   With a little luck, I think I will survive the latest of our
late-in-life explorations. Compared to China and the Australian
Outback, the sparsely populated American deserts with their
occasional truck stops seem more like New York City in the crowded
Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   However, in Lost Dog I do wonder how the dog got here to get
lost. Our tour of Wyoming has diminished my awe of Ted Turner,
whose ranches reportedly make him the world's largest landholder.
From what I've seen, you could own all of Wyoming and parts of Utah
and Idaho and not be all that well off.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday the thermometer was showing 110.5 when Captain Moye
taxied the motor home into a KOA slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see what I warned you about,'' I said to my wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't complain,'' she answered. ``It's a dry heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. We have upsides. On a three-night stop in
Colorado high country we gave our hosts a break. We put up in a
condo with a sweeping view of the mountains. When I called home to
report that we were alive, well and reasonably safe, our
semi-farmer's wife answered the phone.
</P>
<P>
   When I told her we had a fire that morning she was alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was anyone hurt?'' she asked. ``Are you safe?''
</P>
<P>
   I had to explain that the fire was in a fireplace. It was nice,
right in the middle of dog days, to open a bedroom window, sleep
under a blanket, and wake up to coffee before an open fire with the
bacon and eggs. Besides, Alex has promised to charcoal lamb chops
one evening before we get to Portland.

 &HT;    Putting schools to test
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Since Texas Gov. George W. Bush has made education
a high priority in his presidential campaign, many non-Texans have
belittled the state's educational progress.
</P>
<P>
   Texans like to brag, but there's no question that the Lone Star
state has hit upon a winning formula to boost learning among all
categories of students _ rich, poor, minorities, urban, suburban or
rural.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that Vice President Al Gore gave his acceptance
speech at the Democratic convention, the Texas Education Agency
released its annual accountability report for the state's schools.
</P>
<P>
   Performance rating results of every Texas public school are made
public each year. Parents, teachers, administrators, school board
members and taxpayers can quickly see which schools are exemplary,
recognized, acceptable or low performing.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas experience shows that this information makes a
difference. Schools take pride in a high performance rating.
Likewise, they work hard to remove a low performance rating. It's
human nature.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring each Texas school would have little meaning unless
schools had common standards. The Texas Assessment of Academic
Skills test is that statewide standard. It is targeted for specific
grades and is curriculum-based.
</P>
<P>
   NO LEARNING, NO DIPLOMA
</P>
<P>
   Texas public school students cannot graduate from high school
until they demonstrate they have learned the skills implied by
their diploma. They have ample opportunity to retake the test.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Texas has launched a new program to end social
promotions in other grades.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, students in grades 3 through 11 will have to
demonstrate sufficient learning in math, reading, writing, social
studies, science and language arts before they are promoted to a
higher grade.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' education reforms, along with reforms in North Carolina,
have been recognized as the best in the nation, according to a
school performance study by the prestigious nonprofit Rand
institution. Texas' progressive education reforms also have been
praised by other objective education researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's statewide school performance results show that the
state's public schools again bested previous performance records.
</P>
<P>
   Performance results are based on passing TAAS tests as well as
keeping attendance high and dropouts low.
</P>
<P>
   School districts and campuses that earned the highest
performance ratings had 90 percent or more of their total students
in student groups including Hispanic, African American, whites and
economically disadvantaged who passed all sections of the TAAS
test.
</P>
<P>
   While all public schools in Texas must abide by minimum state
standards, individual school districts are free to impose higher
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Waco Independent School District launched a bold
top-to-bottom accountability program three years ago that ended
social promotions in every grade. Teachers in Waco public schools
know their students have the skills required to succeed at a higher
grade.
</P>
<P>
   To be promoted, Waco students must have high attendance, pass
their classroom work and pass a curriculum-based standardized test.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, academic performance in Waco continues to improve,
especially among minorities and economically disadvantaged groups.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Waco's accountability program who warned that
minority students and those from high-poverty families could not
meet the new standards have been proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Higher standards and strict accountability requirements have
benefited minorities and economically disadvantaged students the
most. Dropouts and truancy are down. Grades are up. Academic
standards keep increasing.
</P>
<P>
   This Texas brag is no exaggeration.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ WACO, Texas _ Since Texas Gov.
George W. Bush has made education a high priority in his
presidential campaign, many non-Texans have belittled the state's
educational progress. Texans like to brag, but there's no question
that the Lone Star state has hit upon a winning formula to boost
learning among all categories of students _ rich, poor, minorities,
urban, suburban or rural. (Rowland Nethaway is senior editor of the
Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ LOST DOG, Wyo. _ Why am I here? Why have I been
subsisting on blackened buffalo steak in the high mountains of
Colorado when back home in Georgia tomatoes are at high tide, a
second crop of butter beans is coming on, pole beans are plentiful
and, because of the drought, figs are sweeter than they've been in
years. I'm where I am because we had supper with our friends, Judy
and Alex Moye. There's an upside and a downside to dining with the
Moyes. The upside is Alex's charcoaled lamb chops. The downside is
they are always wanting to go somewhere. (Jim Minter is a former
editor of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ We're just sure Rep. James
Traficant will unearth those affidavits any day now, the ones
proving that Janet Reno has been consorting with a lesbian mobster
call girl. No doubt he has misplaced them in a drawer somewhere,
right next to the finished manuscript of Truman Capote's final
novel. It must be true, every last word of it, and not the
Youngstown Democrat's caged-animal response to his legal troubles.
Where else could he have dreamed up such wild allegations?

<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The first report on a law passed by Congress in
1988 to curb abuses by the IRS is in and it turns out that of the
830 formal complaints of IRS abuse, not one _ zero, zilch, nada _
panned out. Worse, it seems the fix has had consequences more
perverse than purposeful. (Tom Teepen is national correspondent for

   CoxNet HEALTHY LIVING 0815 -- Most people need to drink more
than eight glasses of water a day. The reasons we need water are
many. After oxygen, water is the human body's most important need.
Our bodies consist largely of water, and water plays a role in
nearly every major bodily function. (Lore, Atlanta

illustration of a person pouring eight glasses of water and a
2-column color photo of a woman pouring water into a glass from a
large jug.

   WITH: FLAVORED MEDICINE -- Sour apple, cinnamon, root beer or
mint chocolate _ choose a flavor. Parents can take a vacation from
tantrums and screeching cries since pharmacist-technician Kenneth
Kramm invented Flavorx _ 42 flavors to cover the bitter taste of
some prescribed and over-the-counter liquid medicine. (Villalobos,

   TWINS _ WHITE PLAINS, N.C. _ To the world and to this day, they
are mostly objects of curiosity _ Chang and Eng, the conjoined
brothers whose May 1811 birth in Siam also spawned the phrase
``Siamese twins.'' But in the northwestern corner of North Carolina
where they settled some 30 years later, they have always been the
Bunker brothers _ hard-working tobacco farmers who married sisters,
fathered 21 children between them and lived utterly ordinary,
small-town lives. Officials recently renamed a bridge after the
twins on the White Plains farm where they lived and are buried.
Still, locals don't quite understand the outside world's
fascination with the twins, which has only grown with the
publication this summer of New Yorker Darin Strauss' acclaimed
novel ``Chang and Eng.'' To the folks who showed up at Strauss'
booksignings last week in nearby Mount Airy and Wilkesboro, and to
the1,000-plus descendants who gathered for one of their
semi-regular reunions in White Plains Saturday, it's actually a
pretty familiar story around these parts: The one about strong
family bonds. (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   SCHOOL-ADVICE _ With the school year approaching, it's time for
teachers and parents to reopen the lines of communication. To save
everyone time and stress, we asked working teachers and frenzied
moms and dads exactly what advice they would give the other side in
order to make this school year the most productive ever. (Dayton
Daily News) WITH ILLUSTRATION. EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL-COMPASS _ You may remember a time when you were a kid
and you got a toy compass maybe from the neighborhood candy store
or maybe even from a box of Cracker Jacks. Those cheesy little
devices featured a jiggling needle balanced on a pin, and the
painted end of the needle always pointed north. Unless there was a
magnet nearby or the needle fell off the pin. Today you can carry
around a digital device that does the same thing more reliably. The
Co-Pilot from Precision Navigation Inc. gives you a digital readout
that tells you exactly which way you're headed with an accuracy of
plus or minus 5 degrees. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 12. WITH

The conference _ it comes to Atlanta next week _ is hugely
successful, drawing tens of thousands of women at each stop. Lotz
says she is driven by a personal need to be closer to God and to
reach others even as some Baptist evangelicals turn their backs on
her. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   COXNET TRAVEL 0815 -- Best known as the World War II battle
site, Midway offers unforgettable natural beauty with its military
history. West of Honolulu by 1,200 miles, 2,600 miles east of
Tokyo, 140 miles east of the international date line, in a time
zone virtually its own, it floats tranquilly, its turquoise lagoon
a jewel set against the vast, deep, dark blue ocean. A bridal veil
of white surf defines the 6-mile-diameter coral reef, formed
millions of years ago on the slopes of a volcano, and sugar-white
beaches outline the three islands within it. (Pousner, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) Art includes a 4-column color photo of
dolphins swimming near Midway, a 2-column aerial photo of Midway
Island and a 2-column color photo of a woman looking at the

   TRAVEL-ABINGTON _ ABINGTON, Va. _ It is an unseasonably cool,
moonless night in this historic Blue Ridge Mountain town, a good
evening for a ghost tour in this old place that seems to have more
than a healthy share. Named Abingdon in honor of Martha
Washington's ancestral home in England, this mountain town is home
to the Barter Theater, the Martha Washington Inn and other
intriguing historic places. (O'Briant, Atlanta

   TRAVEL-BLOWROCK _ BLOWING ROCK, N.C. The legend goes that a
Cherokee brave dived off the Blowing Rock to appease his gods and
was caught in an updraft so powerful that he was lifted back to his
sweetheart's arms. I wasn't feeling quite that lucky on my visit to
this popular Blue Ridge Mountains attraction. In fact I hung on to
the flat, upturned rock _ the parapet, it seemed, of a mighty
castle _ for dear life. (Hulbert, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)

   TRAVEL-BLUERIDGE _ BLUE RIDGE, Ga. _ There it is, tucked into

the car and racing to the porch, we hear the soothing sounds of Hot
House Creek. Wooden stairs from the lower deck lead directly to the
chilly waters. (Thrasher, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) EMBARGOED

   TRAVEL-CASHIERS _ CASHIERS, N.C. _ Visiting the High Hampton Inn
&AMP; Country Club, a 1,400-acre antebellum estate that will fill your
belly three times a day and house you in a rustic cottage free of
certain conveniences. ``Son,'' I told our 12-year-old before we
left, ``this resort where we're staying is going to cost about $350
a night and it won't have a telephone or a television.'' It was
enough to turn his face away from the computer screen. ``You're

<P>
   TRAVEL-HENDERSONVILLE _ HENDERSONVILLE, N.C. _ The social
``hour'' at the Waverly Inn was already two hours old when those of
us rocking and sipping wine on the porch decided to move the party
a few blocks down Main Street to the Monday-night street dance.
That's right, a street dance. On a Monday night. That's the kind of
place this is: a small mountain town in the heart of North Carolina
apple country, where hundreds of folks cut a rug (or just watch
from lawn chairs) during the street dances (continuing through
Labor Day). (Thrasher, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) EMBARGOED FOR

   TRAVEL-LITTLE-SWISS _ LITTLE SWITZERLAND, N.C. _ Other places in
the North Carolina mountains are better-known, but none are like
this faux-alpine hideaway nestled at 3,500 feet in the southern
Appalachians. It brims daily with color and tranquillity. In the
fall, especially, Little Switzerland, just off the Blue Ridge
Parkway, is a place many folks come for a long weekend. Many come

   TRAVEL-TOWNSEND _ TOWNSEND, Tenn. _ The campfire is a portable
propane model that looks like something out of the Flintstones. The
moonlit mesa is in truth a screen-printed mural. But the guy in the
black chaps, vest and tall cowboy hat, the fellow spinning cowpoke
tales as tall as a saguaro cactus, stories that roll on like
tumbleweeds,he's got this western thing down. Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together for tonight's headliner, cowboy poet
extraordinaire David ``Buffalo Bill'' Nelson. Oh, by the way,
Buffalo, er, David is also your innkeeper. He and wife Jean operate
the western-decorated B&AMP;B Abode and Beyond, here near the entrance

   ABORIGINE-ART _ Thirty years ago, an art professor encouraged a
group of Aborigines in the central desert of Australia to paint on
canvas the symbolic patterns their people had been making in the
red dirt for eons. The dirt patterns evolved into dot paintings, a
popular form of folk art that has become synonymous with Australia
and will figure prominently in the Sydney Olympic Arts Festival. We
look at the field, which has interesting parallels with the artwork
that won praise at the last Olympics: Southern folk art.

a composite of two or more? Was he a only a fiction created as a
linchpin for Woodward and Carl Bernstein's book ``All the King's
Men''? Now Leonard Garment, an old Nixon hand who has made Deep
Throat his personal quarry, thinks he knows. ``In Search of Deep
Throat'' (Basic Books, $25) is a lawyerly deduction from plausible
hypotheses but in the end an intuitive guess. ``It is my
conviction,'' Garment writes on page 2, ``that Deep Throat . . .
was John Sears.'' (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 26

   CoxNet HEALTHY LIVING 0815 -- Most people need to drink more
than eight glasses of water a day. The reasons we need water are
many. After oxygen, water is the human body's most important need.
Our bodies consist largely of water, and water plays a role in
nearly every major bodily function. (Lore, Atlanta

   TWINS _ WHITE PLAINS, N.C. _ To the world and to this day, they
are mostly objects of curiosity _ Chang and Eng, the conjoined
brothers whose May 1811 birth in Siam also spawned the phrase
``Siamese twins.'' But in the northwestern corner of North Carolina
where they settled some 30 years later, they have always been the
Bunker brothers _ hard-working tobacco farmers who married sisters,
fathered 21 children between them and lived utterly ordinary,
small-town lives. Officials recently renamed a bridge after the
twins on the White Plains farm where they lived and are buried.
Still, locals don't quite understand the outside world's
fascination with the twins, which has only grown with the
publication this summer of New Yorker Darin Strauss' acclaimed
novel ``Chang and Eng.'' To the folks who showed up at Strauss'
booksignings last week in nearby Mount Airy and Wilkesboro, and to
the1,000-plus descendants who gathered for one of their
semi-regular reunions in White Plains Saturday, it's actually a
pretty familiar story around these parts: The one about strong
family bonds. (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   DIGITAL-COMPASS _ You may remember a time when you were a kid

magnet nearby or the needle fell off the pin. Today you can carry
around a digital device that does the same thing more reliably. The
Co-Pilot from Precision Navigation Inc. gives you a digital readout

   COXNET TRAVEL 0815 -- Best known as the World War II battle
site, Midway offers unforgettable natural beauty with its military
history. West of Honolulu by 1,200 miles, 2,600 miles east of
Tokyo, 140 miles east of the international date line, in a time
zone virtually its own, it floats tranquilly, its turquoise lagoon
a jewel set against the vast, deep, dark blue ocean. A bridal veil
of white surf defines the 6-mile-diameter coral reef, formed
millions of years ago on the slopes of a volcano, and sugar-white
beaches outline the three islands within it. (Pousner, Atlanta

moonless night in this historic Blue Ridge Mountain town, a good

Named Abingdon in honor of Martha Washington's ancestral home in
England, this mountain town is home to the Barter Theater, the

   TRAVEL-BLOWROCK _ BLOWING ROCK, N.C. The legend goes that a
Cherokee brave dived off the Blowing Rock to appease his gods and
was caught in an updraft so powerful that he was lifted back to his
sweetheart's arms. I wasn't feeling quite that lucky on my visit to
this popular Blue Ridge Mountains attraction. In fact I hung on to

the car and racing to the porch, we hear the soothing sounds of Hot

certain conveniences. ``Son,'' I told our 12-year-old before we

a few blocks down Main Street to the Monday-night street dance.
That's right, a street dance. On a Monday night. That's the kind of
place this is: a small mountain town in the heart of North Carolina
apple country, where hundreds of folks cut a rug (or just watch
from lawn chairs) during the street dances (continuing through

so close to paradise you half-expect to enter it through pearly
gates. (Hamilton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) EMBARGOED FOR

the North Carolina mountains are better-known, but none are like
this faux-alpine hideaway nestled at 3,500 feet in the southern
Appalachians. It brims daily with color and tranquillity. In the
fall, especially, Little Switzerland, just off the Blue Ridge

to like it so much they plan ahead, booking a week at the
Switzerland Inn or another nearby mountain lodge. (Skube, Atlanta

   TRAVEL-TOWNSEND _ TOWNSEND, Tenn. _ The campfire is a portable
propane model that looks like something out of the Flintstones. The
moonlit mesa is in truth a screen-printed mural. But the guy in the
black chaps, vest and tall cowboy hat, the fellow spinning cowpoke
tales as tall as a saguaro cactus, stories that roll on like
tumbleweeds,he's got this western thing down. Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together for tonight's headliner, cowboy poet
extraordinaire David ``Buffalo Bill'' Nelson. Oh, by the way,
Buffalo, er, David is also your innkeeper. He and wife Jean operate
the western-decorated B&AMP;B Abode and Beyond, here near the entrance

canvas the symbolic patterns their people had been making in the
red dirt for eons. The dirt patterns evolved into dot paintings, a
popular form of folk art that has become synonymous with Australia
and will figure prominently in the Sydney Olympic Arts Festival. We

<P>
   YAJALON, MEXICO _ Pigs snorted in mud and a chilly rain soaked
the mountains outside as Nicolas Lopez described how armed men
staged a terrifying raid on his hamlet earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Firing weapons into the air, the invaders claimed rights to the
villagers' land, setting fire to five huts, chasing about 30
families into hiding, and looting what little corn and clothes the
peasants had, Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as he shivered at the memory, Lopez managed a smile. On
Sunday(8/20) the Mayan Indian will vote in a historic election for
the new governor of Chiapas, one of Mexico's most impoverished and
volatile states. And if pre-election opinion polls are accurate,
Mexico's 71-year-old ruling party is headed for another defeat
after being trounced in July 2's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting for a solution to our problems,'' said Lopez,
who will vote for Pablo Salazar, candidate of an opposition
alliance that could unseat Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party, the PRI, from a state considered a barometer of social
justice in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Chiapas is home to the Zapatista Indian rebels, who launched an
insurrection against the Mexican government here in January 1994
that still hasn't been resolved. Since that time, armed
paramilitary groups loyal to the ruling party have also evolved,
periodically attacking Zapatista sympathizers like Lopez's hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``All government ties to these paramilitary groups will end (if
the PRI loses). One way to dismantle these groups is to simply not
guarantee them impunity any longer,'' said a sweat-soaked Salazar,
pausing for an interview and quick lunch during one of his final
grueling all-day campaign swings along Chiapas' sweltering tropical
coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are fed up and want change. And change is contagious,''
he said, waving at a marimba band in a restaurant that played a
song as a tribute to the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But Chiapas is considered a bulwark state for the PRI, and its
candidate, Sami David, has counted on a sympathetic state media
establishment that, as usual, offered slavishly favorable coverage
to him. A cordial man who is warm one-on-one, David also touched a
traditionally conservative nerve here with a campaign warning that
a Salazar victory could provoke even more instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chiapas, an era of stability is at stake,'' David told a
recent gathering of PRI youth in the capital city of Tuxtla
Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the northern part of Chiapas is a checkerboard of Mayan
Indian villages divided between Zapatistas and PRI loyalists who
sporadically clash over land rights and political differences. The
collection of huts where Lopez lived _ nestled in rugged hills
above the city of Yajalon (pronounced, ``ya-ha-LONE'') _ was
eventually occupied by Mexican Army troops. But since the villagers
also fear the army, they refused to return.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox has sparked
hope for a peaceful resolution to the cycle of violence. Fox
ousted, for the first time in seven decades, the PRI, which the
Zapatistas blame for the squalid conditions the southern state's
Indians live in.
</P>
<P>
   Before the July 2 election, Subcommander Marcos, the primary
Zapatista spokesman, issued a statement reiterating the rebels'
position that they would negotiate again if a peace accord signed
in 1996 is implemented and federal troops are withdrawn from Indian
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is a promoter of free-market economic policies, which the
Zapatistas oppose, but he has pledged to revive negotiations with
the rebels and send Mexico's Congress the stalled 1996 accord that
grants sweeping Indian rights. If elected, Salazar could also set
an example that change can be forced at the ballot box rather than
at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one, not even the most radical person in the country can
dispute the legitimacy of a Fox government,'' Salazar said,
predicting that the Zapatistas can't dismiss electoral change.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent campaign stop in the gritty border town of Hidalgo
on the Guatemala border, supporters were enraptured with Salazar's
pledge to address the demands of the poor _ including the
Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Zapatistas said our fight is against being forgotten. They
said there is a worse death than dying from diarrhea or from
curable diseases,'' the candidate shouted from the stage to wild
cheers. ``There is a worse death, say our Indian brothers, and that
is the death that comes from being forgotten. Well, you people are
about to do something about that painful reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar is a federal senator and former member of the PRI, which
he says used to be the only option available to someone who wanted
to get into political office. But he left the party in May 1999
after a long string of disputes over the government's handling of
the Chiapas conflict.
</P>
<P>
   He is unaffiliated now, but is representing a four-party
alliance that includes Fox's conservative National Action Party, or
PAN, and the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, the PRD. The two
parties clash ideologically, but for the purpose of defeating the
PRI in Chiapas they pooled their funds and worked hand-in-hand for
Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   An exhausted-looking David said he isn't giving up, and he
dismisses polls like one conducted by Reforma newspapers, which
gave Salazar a 9-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chiapas, the conditions to avoid confrontations or even
social collapse are being constructed with great difficulty,'' he
said an interview with Cox Newspapers. He had a badly bruised and
swollen ear, the result of an injury when someone threw a metal
weight at him in Salazar's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a platform for electoral reform,'' he insisted. ``The
offers for change have to be based on clarity and not on
deception.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida, won in
Chiapas last month. But Salazar is counting on the combined votes
of the PAN and the PRD to carry him to victory. His campaign
posters say, ``the PRI has already lost in Chiapas, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's victory could also inspire PRI desertion.
</P>
<P>
   Among some of Chiapas' poor peasant farmers, Fox is now seen as
Mexico's new ``tlatoani,'' the Aztec word for ``maximum leader,''
Salazar campaign aide Mauricio Gandara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that the 'Papa PRI' has died now. So they are
wondering who will be managing the money and resources. They are
thinking that now there is a 'Papa Fox,''' Gandara said. ``This is
the product of 71 years of domination by one party.''
</P>
<P>
   Araceli Burguete, a Chiapas sociologist, said the PRI still
controls many Indians in the state. It will probably be business as
usual in Indian towns where the local PRI leader habitually orders
residents how to vote, she said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But even in PRI strongholds, some residents appeared to be
bracing for change.
</P>
<P>
   Chenalho is an Indian town that produced at least one of the
convicted killers implicated in the infamous December 1997 massacre
of 45 people in the pro-Zapatista village of Acteal, just minutes
away.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Jimenez, 82, said he would listen to the advice of
village leaders, but wasn't sure who he'd vote for. He pulled
dismissively at a PRI T-shirt he was wearing and said almost
apologetically, ``This is five years old now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Luis Ortiz, a resident who has joined the movement to
deploy thousands of election observers here, complained that the
PRI had donated a Ford truck to the town ``in exchange for votes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Acteal, the site of the massacre, affiliates of the Zapatista
Army said they didn't plan to vote and declined to speak further.
Rebel leaders have been silent, other than to say they won't call
for a general boycott of the election.
</P>
<P>
   Those in Acteal who sympathize with the rebels but don't belong
to the army will cast ballots for Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Salazar doesn't win, we will think there has been fraud,''
said Spanish-speaking spokesman Agustin Vasquez. ``Acteal is
willing to vote for Salazar. The victims of the massacre are
waiting for justice and for change.''

   McDuffie is one of an estimated 30,000 Americans and Canadians _
some believe the number might run as high as 70,000 _ who have been
lured to a life in this tropical oasis.
</P>
<P>
   Once a little-known swath of mountains, jungle and beaches
sandwiched between the Caribbean and the Pacific, Costa Rica became
something of a '90s nirvana for those seeking escape, simplicity,
natural beauty and cheap living.
</P>
<P>
   Bordered by Nicaragua on the north and Panama on the south, the
country stands out among its neighbors, but mostly for good
reasons. In a region torn by dictatorships, drug trafficking and
political instability, Costa Rica has enjoyed free democratic
elections for decades.
</P>
<P>
   While its neighbors struggle to overcome poverty and illiteracy,
Costa Rica enjoys a 94 percent literacy rate and broad-based
economic prosperity with only 6 percent unemployment in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While others lack basic sanitation and adequate health-care, 99
percent of Costa Rica's 3.6 million residents are served by piped
water and 90 percent receive public health services recognized as
among the best in the region. More than 90 percent have access to
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most dramatic measure of Costa Rica's
difference: the nation abolished its army in 1949 and plowed the
money into development and social services. That stunning move
earned Costa Rica the nickname, ``The Switzerland of Central
America.''
</P>
<P>
   In another far-reaching move, leaders also set aside huge chunks
of the gorgeous countryside, so that now nearly 25 percent of Costa
Rica's territory is protected as national parks or preserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been everything I dreamed,'' McDuffie said. ``I'm
the happiest guy I know. It's such a different tempo here, a
different pace. All my dad's friends are mad at me, saying I
somehow managed to retire at 24.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as in any paradise, there are a few potholes.
Literally. The roads, while better than in neighboring countries,
suffer washouts and sporadic repairs that make driving an
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of foreigners has driven up real estate values, so
that prices in popular areas compare better to Miami than Managua.
The escalation has driven some would-be expatriates to look for
cheaper homesteads in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rican crime has also shot up, with the high-profile
murders of two American college students in March triggering a bout
of unfavorable international publicity. There has also been a rash
of kidnappings, leading many Costa Ricans to ponder whether some of
the less-appealing aspects of modern life are catching up with
their paradise.
</P>
<P>
   But the foreigners are still coming in droves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boom started about 10 years ago,'' said Ryan Piercy,
manager of the Association of Residents of Costa Rica, a private
group that provides services to incoming foreigners. ``For a while,
our group was growing by 300 percent a year. Now it's evened out to
a steady 10 percent a year. But we're seeing a lot of young people.
A few years ago, it was mostly retirees.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever visionary, Costa Rica's leaders years ago made it easy for
foreigners to move in. The law basically requires that would-be
residents have an income of US$600 per month and that they agree to
stay in Costa Rica at least four months each year.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders can own businesses _ which means they often create
employment for native Costa Ricans, known as ``Ticos.''
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie spent several months traveling the country before
finally settling down in Jaco Beach, a surf town on the Pacific
coast about two-hours drive from the capital, San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   After casting around for opportunities, he decided to open a
school catering to the hordes of young backpacker tourists who have
made Costa Rica a favorite destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to a lot of people who were going to language schools
in San Jose, and they were frustrated because they weren't seeing
the country,'' he said. ``So we designed a program that's hands-on
learning, with language, ecology, art and surfing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a struggle at times, but now in its third year,
McDuffie's ``Escuela del Mundo'' _ ``School of the World'' _ is a
growing enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our students find out about us from the Internet,''
McDuffie said. ``That's been the key. I wouldn't have been able to
do this 10 years ago because nobody would've been able to find
us.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Another ex-pat who has found his place in Jaco Beach is Dave
Klostermann, who once ran a thriving but stressful swimming pool
construction business in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got fed up with high insurance rates, workers'
compensation, crime and traffic,'' he said. ``I was working harder
for less money.''
</P>
<P>
   After investigating Montana and Idaho, Klostermann , 40, came to
Costa Rica on a lark with a minister friend doing outreach work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been told by several friends that this was the place to
come with a grubstake to buy a big farm and just sit back and watch
property values go up,'' he said. ``I wanted a place that was
growing but safe.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't get the idea that moving to Costa Rica is a
stress-free ticket to easy-street. Cars cost double what they do in
the United States. Most natives speak only Spanish. Petty theft is
a problem. Some natives grow resentful of ``gringos'' who open
businesses that compete with Tico shops.
</P>
<P>
   Klostermann wanted to open a construction business, but found
the market just wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he turned to his lifelong hobby: horses. It's taken
several years to establish his horse rental business, and along the
way there have been some spats with Ticos _ and other foreigners _
who run similar businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But things are going well now, especially after a huge new
Marriott hotel opened nearby, bringing in corporate retreats and
large groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little things you take for granted at home are harder
here,'' Klostermann said. ``Things like the power going out, and
Tico-brand washing machines. But it's a beautiful place with so
many things to do. I just hope they don't expand too much and ruin
what makes Costa Rica special.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   While some people have found paradise and new careers near the
beach, Bob Miller came to Costa Rica to coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an engineer and I came down here on a job about 30 years
ago and just loved the fact that instead of seeing guys with guns
everywhere like in other Latin countries, they didn't have an army
here,'' said Miller, 73. ``Back then, the cops were armed only with
pliers and screw drivers. If you did anything wrong, they took your
license plate and made you pay a fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller and his wife moved down permanently from Vancouver about
three years ago and now rent a house in the San Jose suburb of
Escazu. Along with thousands of other ex-pats in the San Jose area,
they have carved out a comfortable life, forming clubs, going to
movies, doing volunteer work and reading an English-language
newspaper, The Tico Times. There's now even a radio station
broadcasting in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so quiet,'' Miller said. ``Every once in a while I hear a
cowbell, but that's about it. The cost of living is far lower than
in Canada, and we get full health coverage for only US$37 a
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Piercy estimates that about 80 percent of the foreigners moving
to Costa Rica are retirees. His group offers monthly seminars on
everything from buying property to obtaining insurance and avoiding
scams. The sessions have grown so crowded _ 35 to 50 people _ that
he's considering adding a second seminar each month.
</P>
<P>
   But he recommends that would-be residents investigate carefully
before making such a big move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some people who have sold everything at home, moved
down here and signed contracts to buy a house in the first week,''
he said. ``Some of them have been burned. It's important to bring
your common sense just as if you were moving to Florida or
Arizona.''

   Chimpanzees are on their way to becoming half-decent chefs.
Captive chimps in Madrid have begun to puree their own fruits and
vegetables, in what looks like the first case of an ape
transforming food to improve its taste and texture.
</P>
<P>
   Chimps use all sorts of clever techniques to obtain food, such
as fishing termites out of mounds with sticks and bashing palm nuts
open with rocks. But these tricks do not alter the quality of the
food. ``These are not cases of transformation of food in the human
way,'' says Samuel Fernandez-Carriba, a primatologist at the
Universidad Autonoma in Madrid. ``Transformation involves things
like grinding and heating.''
</P>
<P>
   The first chimp to perform the new trick was Linda, who was
brought to the university zoo in 1992 after her previous owner had
removed all her teeth to avoid being bitten. When she had been at
the zoo about a year, the keepers noticed she was managing to eat
apples by rubbing them along a sharp corner in her enclosure so
that pulp and juice ran out on the wall. She would lick the mashed
fruit off the wall and then rub the apple some more. Six other
chimps in the same enclosure soon began to imitate her. Now the
whole group, except the alpha male and female and an infant, have
picked up the technique.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez-Carriba and his colleagues Angela Loeches and Ana
Morcillo have now watched the chimps pureeing their food for more
than 450 hours. Rather than just mashing up fruit any old way, the
other chimps have adopted Linda's means of preparation. They all
rub the fruit on a sharp corner for about 10 seconds and then lick
off the pure. Because the chimps copy the action in a stereotypical
fashion, the researchers conclude that it is a culturally
transmitted ritual. Chimps are known to have passed on around 40
other behaviors in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The gourmet chimps eat apples, carrots, lemons and oranges by
rubbing, which changes not only the texture, but also the flavor of
the food. And since they choose to take the time preparing each
dish, they may get greater enjoyment or satisfaction from the
result, Fernandez-Carriba says.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether food transformation exists in the wild, he
says. Either we just haven't seen it, or animals can't afford to
waste time preparing each meal. ``But if, like the chimps, you have
the time, you might cook all day and make something nice,''
Fernndez-Carriba says. ``Maybe this is one more piece of evidence
that we are not as unique as we previously thought.''  &QL;

NETWORKS RIDING WOODS'S WAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rob Correa quickly runs out of superlatives to describe Tiger
Woods and the impact he has had on televised golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to be original when you are talking about Tiger,''
the CBS Sports senior vice president said. ``But he has been
unbelievably great. He is the biggest sports story in recent
memory. He has changed the sport of golf much like Muhammad Ali
changed the sport of boxing. He has already surpassed Michael
Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Surpassed Michael Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   Correa is not exaggerating. At 24, Woods is the youngest player
to win all four majors, breaking the mark set by Jack Nicklaus at
26. Tiger has been equally impressive as a television attraction.
According to CBS Sports research, in 1999, when Tiger was even in
contention in a golf event, the broadcast averaged a 4.1 rating and
11 share, 41 percent higher than when he was not in contention or
did not play.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Woods has increased network ratings by 104
percent when he is in contention. He also has expanded the golf
audience among young viewers, including a 150 percent increase in
men 18-34.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger is good for everybody,'' Correa said.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, according to several agents representing other PGA
players.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Giles, a player agent with Pros Inc., which represents
Davis Love and Justin Leonard, told the Bloomberg News that Woods
has caused a drop in endorsement money for other Tour members.
``Other players are going to get less and less off-tour income;
it's that simple,'' Giles said. ``It's not going to be any
better.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Correa strongly believes that Woods is great for golf
and particularly for networks that air major events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy the argument that Tiger is hurting other player's
endorsements,'' said Correa. ``Tiger is the reason that more people
are tuning into the sport in the first place. He has raised the
awareness of the sport to include minorities, women and younger
viewers. More people are wathcing the sport now that have never
watched it before. Tiger can't be bad for the sport. He has no
negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his gushing, Correa said that CBS will not have a camera
dedicated to Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to cover the PGA Championship,'' Correa said.
``We still have to show the leaderboard. We can't go into the
weekend with any preconceived notions. Nor do we want someone to
sneak up on the leaderboard without people at home seeing how they
got there.''

   Dennis Miller thinks he's doing all right on ``Monday Night

   ``I think I'm getting wood on the ball; I'm keeping the at-bat
alive,'' Miller told Jim Litke of ``One on One Sports'' (AM 1510)
on Tuesday. ``I'm having a blast. I can't believe I walk into the
booth and have this seat on the 50-yard line. I'll be honest with
you: Before the Canton Hall of Fame game, I had been to only one
football game in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that he is unsure whether the NFL or football fans
are ready for his sarcasm. ``I'm perfectly willing to be fired if
they're not,'' Miller said. ``I don't have any qualms about that. I
have a great job at HBO. I'm not trying to be a martyr, I just do
what I do. I'm not going to be bullheaded about it. Believe me,
I'll handle it with a nice degree of aplomb if they come up and
say, `Hey listen, we think you're OK but you're not for us, you're
whacked. It's like G. Gordon Liddy said, `Just tell me what corner

should be. The current issue is devoted to Boston's Best, and
according to the magazine, Pedro is . . . it. Then why are the Red
Sox angry? The magazine didn't get the team's s permission first.

SURGERIES KEEP KRISTEN MALONEY A CUT ABOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Playing with pain is part of the game for an Olympic
athlete. What can you expect, after all, after years of
somersaulting on a 4-inch-wide balance beam, flying off the vault
with a double-twist handspring, or swinging from one bar to the
other, then releasing and landing on the mat with a loud thud.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend athlete gasps; the Olympic hopeful just shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   A little soreness is to be expected and a little pain is often
ignored. Well, until it becomes a big pain.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to Kristen Maloney, who blithely cruised
through the Worlds and Nationals in 1998 and 1999 with a stress
fracture in her right shin and persistent soreness in her left
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, last fall, doctors said, ``Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, they made an incision and hammered a titanium rod
inside the length of her right tibia, and then they tightened the
tendons in her left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   By January, she resumed training. By March, she was the top
American finisher in the International Games. In July, Maloney
almost defended her title of national champion, falling short to
Elise Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a miracle,'' declared Bela Karolyi, coordinator of the
national women's team, earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney concedes that her comeback was pretty amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was surprised at how quickly I got my skills back
from my injuries, especially after how much time I had to take
off,'' she said. ``I think I was even surprised myself.''
</P>
<P>
   So by now, nothing seems to faze Maloney, who will compete at
the FleetCenter this weekend against 13 other women for a spot on
the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   She just laughs _ not nervously, but confidently _ and says,
``I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's one person who's not surprised at Maloney's comeback,
it's Donna Strauss, who with her husband, Bill, runs the Parkettes
Gym in Allentown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss said that when Maloney, 19, was 6 years old and living
in Pen Argyl, Pa., her mother enrolled her in the gym so she'd have
something to do while her other brother and sister went to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``She started out just doing tumbling then each year got a
little bit better, a little bit better,'' Strauss said. ``Then when
she was about 12, we saw how she had a lot on perserverance and
drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Strauss taps her chest with her fist when she describes how her
star pupil blossomed into an Olympic hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``With some kids, success comes very quickly and naturally,''
she said. ``But Kristen chisled at it little by little, and I think
that's what made her such a strong competitor and has kept her
driven for this long period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   And neither challenges not adversity seemed to matter.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 12, her parents took her to a regional meet, but
told Strauss that their daughter had a fever and they didn't think
she could compete. But she did, and ended up winning the meet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Maloney's litany of injuries did concern the coach. In
June 1998, her shin started hurting but she was insistent on
competing.
</P>
<P>
   First, she won the Pacific Alliance Championship in Canada, then
won a gold medal on the balance beam at the Goodwill Games, and
finally, won the US Championships in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   All of that was with a stress fracture in her shin.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss decided to rest Maloney that fall, demanding she only
work the upper body and exercise on the stationary bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1999, she deemed Maloney ready to train vigorously.
In March, she gave her the OK to compete in the International Team
Meet in Richmond, Va. Maloney finished second in the all-around
competition and was the top American finisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shocked because she really wasn't ready to go full
force,'' Strauss said.
</P>
<P>
   The season brought more success as Maloney defended her national
title.
</P>
<P>
   But by the fall, the pain in Maloney's shin was getting worse,
exacerbated by a fall off the uneven bars in the Worlds in which
she sprained her knee.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors decided to insert the rod, a procedure that's been
used with accident victims who have had their bones crushed and to
relieve stress fractures. Maloney didn't mind at all; in fact, she
wanted to watch as the doctor hammered in the 8-millimeter wide
titanium rod along the length of her tibia.
</P>
<P>
   But her medical woes weren't over, as doctors decided to check
out her left shoulder that had been bothering her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wast just hurting on and off for a couple years and I had
therapy, but nothing seemed to help,'' Maloney said. ``So they went
in and tightened up the socket.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though soreness does go along with her sport, Maloney said
she's learned to heed the warning light that goes off when
something's beyond sore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell right away, like when I'm warming up, what's
hurting and what's sore,'' she said. ``I know my body and I know
what it can take.''
</P>
<P>
   And after all the X-rays, physical therapy, and breaks from
training, maybe the rod in her leg is a good luck charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``In certain ways, I feel better than I was before,'' she said.

TAMALES NO SUBSTITUTE FOR A PLACE ON PODIUM

   LOS ANGELES _ They ate tamales at a downtown street festival,
grooved to a free concert by salsa queen Celia Cruz, and chanted,
``Justicia Para Todos!'' (``Justice For All''), at a slew of
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came down to speaking to a national, prime-time
audience, Latinos here say they felt relatively ignored.
</P>

   Reporters didn't attend, in meaningful numbers, the daily Latino
caucuses. They didn't write about the daily events sponsored by the
nonpartisan Latino Committee 2000. And when one of the
highest-ranking Latinos in Congress spoke on the convention floor,
he was preempted by a commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angelenos didn't hear Representative Robert Menendez of New
Jersey declare in Spanish Wednesday evening: ``My Latino brothers,
we're not in need of Republican compassion. What we need is
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gloria Molina, vice chairwoman of the Democratic National
Convention Committee: ``No one is listening to us. We've been here
all week talking about who we are and what we want, and those
stories aren't being covered.''
</P>
<P>
   She points to articles about labor unions or what demonstrating
teachers seek. But few papers have elected to write about what
Latinos want, she said. Other observers say the news media, by and
large, have written only about the parties courting the Latino
vote, but rarely do they write about it from the perspective of
ordinary Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Los Angeles, reporters and networks had their chance,
and they blew it, Latinos say.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has a huge Latino population. And it seems to Latino
activists incredible that their voices were not better heard at a
convention held in California, a state that is home to a third of
the nation's registered Latino voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting the fringe stories,'' said Maria Veloz, director
of Latino Committee 2000. ``Crime, gangs. These are important
issues, but it's not everything that Latinos are about. We can't
even get coverage from our local paper; how can we expect to get it
from papers outside the state?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet from the convention floor came a carefully orchestrated
though subtle pitch to Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Los Lobos, a Mexican-American band from Los Angeles, played to a
cheering audience Tuesday night. A sprinkling of Latino politicians
spoke during the four-day convention, most of them speaking before
prime time. And the Democrats had more than 400 Latino delegates on
the floor, compared to 73 at the Republicans' convention.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos are the fastest-growing ethnic group in the United
States. According to US Census estimates, one out of every five
Americans will be Latino by the year 2025. But though they tend to
vote Democratic, they are, on average, more politically
conservative than most Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Latino vote may be crucial in several key states, including
Florida, New Jersey, Texas, Illinois, and New Mexico, said Antonio
Gonzalez, president of the Southwest Voter Registration Education
Project. ``These are going to be nail-biters. The reach-out begins
now. The conventions are basically infomercials.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the campaign trail, both Al Gore and George W. Bush have
used more Spanish during speeches in heavily Latino cities. Bush
loves to say in his Texan-accented Spanish ``Mi corazon es
Hispana'' (``My heart is Hispanic''). Gore has been known to say,
``Llamame Alberto'' (``Call me Alberto'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The DNC, for the most part, has always enjoyed that most
Latinos are Democrats,'' Molina said. ``Most of us have, at some
point, felt that they haven't made enough of an investment in us.
At the same time, it's interesting to see what's happening with the
Republican Party. They're realizing how important we are, and now
they're working very hard to catch up.''

THE MEDIA'S DEAL WITH THE DEVIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- I sat on the fine-as-silk, soft-as-a-cushion
California sand, watching the waves roll up along a beautiful
stretch of Santa Monica coastline. Suddenly the cell phone rang.
``You're on the list,'' said the voice on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   It was a perfect L.A. moment: I was on a select invite list to
one of the convention week's most sought-after private parties,
held at the Pacific Palisades home of a famous Hollywood star.
Then, as it too often turns out, there was a downside to the good
news: This party of some 500 people was considered ``off the
record.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, my benefactor told me that I agreed to that
arrangement when I took the invitation and that I misinterpreted a
later conversation about the ground rules.
</P>
<P>
   So, being an honorable woman, I will not tell you whose fabulous
backyard I stood in, under a full moon so beautiful it made the
entire tableau look like the most perfect of movie sets; what
legendary political clan circulated graciously on the lush, springy
lawn; or what network correspondent introduced her uncle the
senator, who sang an offkey duet in Spanish with a Clinton
administration Cabinet secretary, accompanied by a spirited
Mariachi band.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Boston Herald, a party for Senator Ted
Kennedy and his niece Caroline was held on Tuesday night at the
home of Maria Shriver and her husband, Arnold Schwarzenegger. It
was attended by a claque of Kennedys, some Hollywood celebrities
like Lauren Bacall and Billy Baldwin, and media bigshots, including
Tom Brokaw, Tim Russert, and Judy Woodruff.
</P>
<P>
   And now I will tell you what I learned from the experience. That
was not off the record and much more important than the event
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Being there was far too seductive. Walking the line between
working press and elite partygoer was just too hard to do. I went,
I saw and I wanted to write. At the same time, I went, I drank
wine, and I wanted to be an insider.
</P>
<P>
   During this week in Los Angeles and earlier this month in
Philadelphia, the media whined a lot about too little news and too
much spin. As a drop-in to the national political scene, I would
offer this perspective.
</P>
<P>
   I have met the enemy and it is us.
</P>
<P>
   We are the ones being schmoozed and entertained, then spun and
positioned. We are the ones who make our deals with the devil,
gaining access that makes us feel important, on the grounds that we
will not tell anyone else what we saw or heard.
</P>
<P>
   These deals have consequences. Using off-the-record is
rationalized as a way of getting at the truth, and like all
journalists I use the device. But, really, what good is the truth
if only an elite group gets to hear it on the promise they will not
reveal it to the consumers who buy their work?
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the absurdity of an off-the-record party for 500.
Revealing or not revealing the location of the swimming pool or the
sushi really doesn't mean that much to anyone. But, off-the-record
this week, there are also straight-from-the-gut, candid assessments
of the mixed messages coming from this Democratic convention and
the tough road ahead for the Gore-Lieberman ticket. On the record,
all is blandness and light.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is the true reason real people aren't reading
newspapers or watching television news as much as we and our owners
want them to.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's not that they are too busy, or too stupid to digest
politics as it is dished up by the media. Maybe they know what we
know _ that the truth is very often a secret shared by a clique of
thousands of journalists and politicians; but too often it is not
in the newspaper they buy or on the television screen they watch.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that, why not watch ``Survivor'' or ``Who Wants to be a
Millionaire?'' At least what you see there is what you get.
</P>
<P>
   Much is written these days about the intersection of business
and politics and how it drives the American electoral process. Too
often the press leaves itself out of the equation, reporting on the
dynamic as if we are just observers rather than participants in a
very complicated dance.
</P>
<P>
   Well, this dance partner is going home to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime _ as the muscle-bound host of my very last
off-the-record party would say, ``hasta la vista, baby.''

LEGENDS SHARE AN UNCOMMON GIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Tiger Woods respectfully walked into Jack
Nicklaus's house and gave (itals)him(unitals) the tour. That's not
supposed to happen, is it? What is the polite thing to say when a
visitor knows your home's layout just as well as you do?
</P>
<P>
   Woods figured the grounds out so quickly that the host didn't
have time to be hospitable. Nicklaus designed this place, Valhalla
Golf Club, when Woods was 10 years old. As he watched Woods
artfully walk over the course during the opening round of the PGA
Championship, Nicklaus looked like a homeowner who realized that he
had built too soon. Fourteen years too soon. If you had observed
and talked with the 60-year-old Nicklaus Thursday, it would have
been obvious that the Golden Bear didn't have a player like Woods
in mind when he came up with the concept of Valhalla.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time Nicklaus and Woods played together in a
tournament. Masters champion Vijay Singh was also in their group.
The three men began their work day at 9:17 a.m. By noon, Nicklaus
and Singh could have easily answered the question: How good is
Tiger Woods?
</P>
<P>
   Officially, he was good enough to shoot a 66, even though
Nicklaus said Woods could have had a 12-under 60 and that he ``was
unlucky to shoot 66. You are out there struggling for 75. (Woods)
makes you look like you are shooting 95.''
</P>
<P>
   Since we're talking about official numbers, the leaderboard
reports that Woods is now tied with Scott Dunlap for first place,
two shots ahead of Davis Love and Darren Clarke. Now that we have
that settled, can we speak honestly? Tiger Woods is going to win
this tournament. You know it, I know it, and Scott Dunlap probably
knows it, too. When Woods wins Sunday, he will capture his third
major championship of the year. No player has done that since Ben
Hogan in 1953. Hogan once said that a player can dominate his
competition with a combination of talent, intimidation, and hard
work. Woods took the late Texan's list and added another entry:
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has fused those elements so well that Nicklaus, designer
of 209 courses, was stumped when asked what kind of layouts can
neutralize the defending PGA champion. What would happen if courses
were longer?
</P>
<P>
   ``The more yardage you put on a golf course, the more dominant
he is going to be,'' Nicklaus said.
</P>
<P>
   What about shorter? ``Well, he knocks it past everything,'' he
said. ``What I am really trying to say is I don't believe you can .
. . ''
</P>
<P>
   So, what do you do? ``You are not going to harness the best
player in the world,'' he said. ``The only thing you are going to
do is make the other guys play better. I don't know. That's the
only way I can answer.''
</P>
<P>
   It may sound strange, but a lot of pros were pleased to hear
Nicklaus say that. Some of them felt slighted when Nicklaus seemed
to imply previously that Woods had psyched them out of their games.
Maybe some of them were caught in a complex Woods mind game, but
can anyone say that Ernie Els hasn't had a great year? He finished
11 under at the British Open and still lost. So it's more accurate
to say that Woods is better than everyone else _ and improving.
</P>
<P>
   At this time last year, some fans believed Sergio Garcia, who
shot 74, would be Woods's longtime rival. If not Garcia, then David
Duval, who withdrew Tuesday, Els . . . somebody. With any prodigy,
athlete, or actor, the temptation is to wonder if they will
eventually fade into oblivion (see ``Bridges, Todd'' in ``Diff'rent
Strokes''). But there will be no rivals nor fading any time soon.
Nicklaus realized that as he was roughing his way to a 77.
</P>
<P>
   The two legends, born nearly 36 years apart, studied each other
and soon understood why there is so much lore surrounding each of
them. Woods said he knew Nicklaus's mind was elsewhere, due to the
death of Nicklaus's mother Wednesday. He said he could also see
that Nicklaus was and is a thinker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell he is used to being specific on his shots,''
Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   On the 163-yard eighth hole, Nicklaus was surprised when Woods
went to work with a 9-iron (Nicklaus was using a 6-iron).
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept turning mine upside down,'' the older man said, ``I
said, `Turn yours upside down so it looks like we're playing the
same club.' He hit some long irons. Gosh, he hits the ball a long
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The men chatted and laughed a couple times as they played in the
90-degree heat. Nicklaus told Woods about a new driver; Woods
explained to Nicklaus what his strategy had been on an approach to
a hole. Nicklaus, the builder of the place, acknowledged that Woods
did some things on the course that he didn't think were possible.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, they both talked about what it's like to
work when someone close to you dies or comes close to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no desire to be here, I promise you,'' Nicklaus said.
``But I felt like it is what (his mother) would have wanted me to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 _ during Woods's first year on the tour _ his father,
Earl, was in the hospital with chest pains. ``I spent all night at
the hospital with him and didn't sleep,'' Woods said. ``I slept
sitting in a chair for a couple hours and had to go play. But I
asked my dad, you know, `(Can I) be here with you?' He said, `No,
get your butt out there so I can watch you on TV. At least I have
something to look forward to, because I have got tubes and stuff
stuck in me.'''
</P>
<P>
   As Woods and Nicklaus walked and talked, the easy thing to say
was that they had a lot in common. They do. But when it comes to
the game, Woods has few obstacles, Nicklaus-designed courses
included.

PRINCE HAS THE POWER TO CONQUER THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIANTIC, Conn. _ Pulsating beats and loud rhythms blast their
way out of a boombox, one decible after another, until no eardrum
in the cramped, stuffy boxing gym is spared.
</P>
<P>
   And, these eardrums belong to folks of various ages and ethnic
groups, many of whom wouldn't be tuned in to Mary J. Blige,
Notorious B.I.G., and Shalamar if it weren't for the 26-year-old,
5-foot-3-inch boxer in the middle of the ring _ who is getting his
groove on while his handlers slip his gloves on.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Naseem Hamed sashays around the ring, hurls his
diminutive frame into the ropes, bounces off, and delivers a
dazzling shadow-boxing display. Then the canvas becomes a dance
floor again and the popular, effervescent WBO featherweight
champion moves to the beat. Then it's back to canvas. Dance floor.
Canvas.
</P>
<P>
   The music stops and the beats give way to the
leather-upon-leather sounds of Hamed's gloves against the pads of
trainer Oscar Suarez. The sound of the punches fill the room the
way the music once did and it's hard to believe a guy that small
could hit that hard. On one combination, Hamed nearly knocks Suarez
off balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt, didn't it?'' asks Hamed, who once dislocated
Suarez's shoulder while hitting the pads.
</P>
<P>
   The punches keep coming, heads shake at the display of enormous
power and speed, and the British-born, Yemeni fighter can't help
but thinking aloud about his HBO fight Saturday night at Foxwoods
Casino, where he will put his flashy style, eye-popping talents,
and perfect record on the line against Augie Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's gonna be out,' Hamed says while finishing a flurry.
``Somebody's gonna be out.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 7-year old son of a Sheffield, England, corner grocer had to
wait four years before he was old enough for his first amateur
bout. In the meantime, Naseem Hamed trained six days a week and
once encouraged a boxing publication editor to write a story on him
because he was going to be world champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were telling me, `Naz, heavyweights get paid
unbelievable amounts of money, man. Middleweights.
Super-middleweights. Featherweights don't get nothing like that,'
'' he said. ``I said, `You watch. I'm gonna change boxing.' I was
predicted champion and a multimillionaire at age 21 when I was 10
years old.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hamed finally became eligible for amateur bouts, he
discovered he was so light that he didn't fit any weight class for
11-year-olds. He spent a year trying to gain weight, but, a year
later, was still too light.
</P>
<P>
   But his trainers signed him up anyway, and subsequently stitched
lead weights into his trunks for the weigh-in. That did it. Folks
would soon discover Hamed's fists packed a lead wallop, too.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed shot through the amateur ranks, claiming five National
Schoolboy championships, an England Schoolboy International
championship, and two junior Amateur Boxing Association
championships, growing with confidence (some would say cockiness)
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   It was around then Naseem Hamed began carving the image of a
fighter who would do as his boyhood boxing idol, Muhammad Ali, had
done decades earlier: infuse life into the sport by ushering in a
color and personality that would be loved or hated but rarely
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people out there who want to see me get beat.
Now I ain't got a problem with that, not at all,'' said Hamed.
``Want to see me get beat? Want to see me win? No problem. As long
as you interested in watching me fighting or boxing. I don't care.
Switch on or pay for the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already brought in a sparkle into boxing. Thank Allah, I
brought something into boxing that wasn't really in, because when
Ali went out, he brought a hell of a lot out with him. I want to
bring just a little bit of that back.''
</P>
<P>
   George Azar, who handles Hamed's public relations in the United
States, said Hamed was discovered by Irish boxing trainer Brendan
Ingle, who used to make fighters watch films starring Gene Kelly
and Fred Astaire to learn footwork. Hamed also studied Ali, Jersey
Joe Wolcott, and Sugar Ray Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name, `Prince,' was given to me by myself at 17, before
turning pro,'' said Hamed. ``I didn't want to be just Naseem Hamed,
because Naseem means gentle breeze in Arabic, and I'm not a gentle
breeze in the ring. So it needs to be a ringing tone people will
remember as a prince because a prince must always become a king.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a professional, Hamed dominated the Eastern Hemisphere and
moved up the super bantamweight ranks. He captured the WBC super
bantamweight title in 1994 then won the WBO featherweight crown a
year later.
</P>
<P>
   In his US debut, he scored a fourth-round knockout of New Yorker
Kevin Kelly in Manhattan to retain the WBO crown, in a grueling
match in which each fighter was knocked down three times.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed's winning ways rolled on, and he successfully defendended
his title in a 12-round unanimous decision over Wayne McCullough in
Atlantic City a year later. But it was evident that Hamed's
unorthodox boxing style was being exploited by more skilled
American fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Suarez and legendary trainer Emanuel Steward, who added
fundamentals to Hamed's arsenal, while helping him tune his skills.
</P>
<P>
   Steward said early on he was surprised how far Hamed had come
despite the fact that he never had been in a training camp, had
never done roadwork, and despite suffering a broken hand as an
amateur, never taped his hands before a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no one ever in the history of the boxing to do
what he's done and accomplished what he accomplished,'' said
Steward. ``And, I think just at the time when Oscar Suarez got
involved with him was about the time he was about to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition was stepping up. Guys like Kevin Kelly. He
really won the fight, but you could see, to me, the beginning of
the end. The mistakes he made with his unorthodox style and the
fighters were beginning to take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did was not change his basic style, believe it or not,
because it's a good, effective style for him. We've tried to take
advantage of it by making improvements, keeping his chin down more.
He's a high-energy kid and that's OK. But mainly watching his
balance, particularly when he finishes up his punches.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hamed ascended the professional ranks, he noticed the
love-me-or-hate-me reaction he wanted came in flood-like
proportions worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the fact he was one of few fighters of Arab descent
making a major impact on the sport, but he had the gall to do it
his way, to defy a sport deeply rooted in tradition and ring
etiquette (particularly in Europe) with outlandish tactics and
turbo-charged ego.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed is widely known for his ring entrances, which include
flipping over the top rope and kissing his biceps. He often drops
his gloves at his waist during bouts. He turns his back on his
opponent. He plays to the crowd. He has been able to get away with
this in part because of his enormous punching power and speed.
</P>
<P>
   He has often been villified by the traditional fans and media,
particularly those in England: Azar said British officials have
been bothered so much by Hamed's dropping his guard they they once
ruled he wasn't defending himself in a fight and awarded the fight
to his battered opponent. Hamed said, as an amateur everyone told
him they enjoyed his boxing style, but he said he does regret being
left off England's Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to tell me as an amateur, `Just make sure you
bring everything you have to the professional ranks, because you
are an exception,' '' he said. ``I see how heavyweights get so
much, and I said, `I'm going to be the first featherweight to make
history.' Because if you're an exception, television wants you,
you're gonna get paid. You're gonna get paid.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And how. In fact, for every Hamed detractor, there are throngs
of folks who can't get enough of his show. There are many who
consider him an icon, one who has helped fuel interest in the sport
among those who otherwise wouldn't watch boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Azar said he has particularly become a symbol of pride in the
Arab community and is a national sports hero in Yemen, where six
postage stamps have been issued in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Naz fights, 150 million people tune in worldwide,'' said
Azar, who pointed out his place in Fortune's list as one of the 40
highest-paid athletes in the world. ``Naseem makes as much money in
product endorsements as Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield, and Oscar
De La Hoya combined.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamed comes from a close-knit family and now has his siblings
involved in his boxing venture, Prince Promotions. Handling his own
promotions ensures big paydays.
</P>
<P>
   His oldest brother, Riath, is the CEO and has brokered deals
with Sony, addidas, Pepsi, and Audi. His brother Nabeel, a former
boxer himself, manages his training camp. Brother Ali is his
spiritual adviser. Brother Murad is in charge of the music at his
events and camp and said several hip-hop artists, including LL Cool
J and producer Sean ``Puffy'' Combs, have made tapes for him to
play at fights.
</P>
<P>
   A former salesman, Nabeel said if he wasn't managing his
brother's training camp, he would probably own his own business.
Then he added with a laugh, ``But that's boring compared to what
we're doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as Naseem said, much of this has been a bonanza for
television. Hamed's second US fight, against McCullough, reportedly
posted a 12.8 rating and was the most-watched boxing broadcast of
1998. Those who put on his fights have gotten into the act, too,
punctuating Hamed's entrance into the ring with elaborate stage
props.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically a few days before the fight he will tell (the
network) a few things, and they'll put the five different entrances
together and ask him which one he would like to pick,'' said Murad.
``Then he'll see what it's like and rehearse and he adds a few
changes in rehearsal.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamed also has right of refusal, which he has exercised. Azar
said one network televising a Hamed bout on Halloween suggested he
come from a graveyard with tombstones of all his opponents behind
him. He said Hamed balked, reminding the producers of the fatal
nature of his sport.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many believe Hamed (34-0, 30 KOs) will be recognized as the best
in his division until he beats those now widely considered the
best, Erik Morales and Marco Antonio Barerra. Lee Samuels of Top
Rank, Inc., who handles Morales, said that fight will likely come
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamed said he is not looking past the likes of Sanchez
(26-1, 23 KOs), who has won 10 straight bouts, nine by knockout.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Steward said that an opponent like Sanchez has him
concerned. Hamed, seated about 5 feet away, yelled out, ``I'm
not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The big weakness for Augie Sanchez, that's Prince Naseem,''
Steward said. ``He's never seen this certain style. He's never been
hit as hard or as fast or as accurate. I don't underestimate or
overestimate him. I feel like I'm going to dismantle him and take
him out and expose him to the world.''

SPEAKERS TRY TO SELL CANDIDATE AS A MAN'S MAN

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Al Gore was the man of the hour.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to what people close to him said Thursday night: He's a
rugged man who climbs high mountains, a brave man who volunteered
for Vietnam, a macho man who can run a marathon, a ``tiger'' of a
man when it came to fighting in Congress for people and causes he
believes in. And of course, a family man.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore even shared a photo album with scores of pictures
taken over 30 years of marriage so delegates to the Democratic
National Convention, and millions of Americans at home, could see
``the man I love in a way you may not have seen him before.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was the point. In words and pictures, the man
who accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination was
presented through a tableaux of family and friends as a man of
character and caring, good works and good fun, anything but the
wonk that voters can't warm up to.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly men. Polls show Gore has a big gender gap, and it
isn't because women are flocking to support him. It's because men,
in big numbers, prefer Texas Governor George W. Bush, who seems
manly because he owns a ranch, ran a baseball team, played hard as
a college frat boy, and wasn't always at the head of the class.
</P>
<P>
   David Halberstam, an author and journalist, remembered Gore to
the delegates as a little boy playing with a bullwhip and a
grown-up who volunteered to go to Vietnam. ``He is the first
Vietnam veteran to be nominated for national office,'' Halberstam
said.
</P>
<P>
   John Tyson, a college roommate at Harvard, admired Gore because
he could have found a way to avoid Vietnam but instead enlisted
because he came from a small community and ``knew people who would
replace him if he didn't go.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Delabar of Seattle, who met Gore while they were
stationed together at Fort Rucker, Ala., told the delegates, ``Al
always seemed to be a regular easygoing fellow.'' Just before
Delabar shipped out to Vietnam, Gore spent most of the night on a
grassy median strip searching for a four-leaf clover. Delabar said
he carried it with him to Vietnam and then in his wallet for years
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stood for more than good luck,'' Delabar said. ``It stood
for commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Frush, also of Seattle, led Gore and his teenage son to the
14,411-foot summit of Mount Rainier last summer through tordriving
rain, winds, hail, and fog. On that dark and stormy night, Frush
said, Gore made the decision not to turn back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grace under pressure, strength of character, perseverance.
These are qualities that I want in a mountaineer and that we need
in a president,'' said Frush, a lawyer and convention delegate.
``He was our spark plug. I'd tie onto a rope with Al Gore, and I'd
follow him anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland spoke of Gore as a
crusading environmentalist. No sentimental tree-hugger, Gore ``was
a tiger'' of a senator who went after midnight dumpers and the
polluters of Love Canal, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's daughter, Kristin, introduced her mother as ``one of the
coolest people you'll ever know.'' As Mrs. Gore, who plays the
drums herself, danced her way to the podium to the throbbing beat
of Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, the delegates wildly waved
placards that said, ``Tipper Rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of you know that faith and family are at the center of
Al's life,'' Mrs. Gore said. ``Many of you know Al to be a decisive
leader with strong values, deeply held convictions, and an
unwavering comitment to making the American dream a reality for all
our people.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also want you to know that as a husband, a father, and
grandfather, Al has always been there for our family, and he will
always be there for yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gosnell, a delegate from Winchester, Mass., said, ``It all
fit in with the type of man I think he is: caring, concerned,
compassionate, interested in helping people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore, a photographer, narrated an intimate photo essay with
loving detail of a man who, over 30 years of changing hair styles,
wardrobe, and jobs, came across as anything but wooden and boring.
Mrs. Gore said she was attracted to Gore because he had ``the most
intense and beautiful blue eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   She described how the couple lived in a trailer near Gore's Army
base, how she missed him when he went to Vietnam, how the family
coped with the death of Gore's father, the accident that nearly
killed their only son, and the depression that afflicted her after
the boy recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got help, and it worked,'' Mrs. Gore said, as the audience
in the Staples Center cheered. When her presentation was done, Gore
burst onto the floor of the big arena as delegates cheered and
waved white ``Gore'' pennants.
</P>
<P>
   Len Paolillo, a delegate from Pittsfield, Mass., said, ``I
learned he could balance being a public servant and being a family
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's combined the best things of manhood. He's strong
but caring,'' Paolillo said. ``He's what men should be in our
society. He respects women. He respects kids. I mean, he's a real
man.''

LIEBERMAN'S SCORN FOR HOLLYWOD NOW FORGOTTEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hollywood is the home of happy endings, and that's
just how Senator Joseph Lieberman, known for his moral crusade
against the entertainment industry's ``toxic culture,'' wrapped up
his visit here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The made-for-TV drama that might have been _ the newly minted
vice presidential candidate threatening to sanction movie moguls,
who generously fund the Democratic Party, if they don't clean up
their act _ didn't make it into prime time, or anytime, here for
the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   William Bennett, one of Lieberman's Washington allies in
attacking Hollywood's exploitation of sex and violence, said he was
disappointed that the passionate rhetoric and stinging critiques of
``the old Joe'' were missing from his convention address Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe is getting incredible pressure from the campaign. The Gore
people are saying, `fall in line' on the issues,'' said Bennett, a
Republican and former education secretary. ``He should acknowledge
Al Gore, the head of the ticket, speaks for the party. But what he
can't do is compromise his core convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman made no specific mention of Hollywood in his 30-minute
speech Wednesday night at the Staples Center. He did praise Gore
and his wife, Tipper, for leading ``a crusade to renew the moral
center of this nation,'' and said Gore ``believes as I do that no
parent in America should be forced to compete with popular culture
to raise their children.''
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut senator was a no-show, however, for at least two
forums where he had been slated to address the issue of media
violence. And in rounds of meetings with delegates he did not
mention his repeated efforts in Washington to reform the
entertainment industry through persuasion or legislation.
</P>
<P>
   No senator has sent chills through Hollywood the way Lieberman
has, and many people believed Gore was bold for putting a man with
an uncompromising moral voice on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lieberman threatened, ``If the entertainment industry
continues to market death and degradation to our children and
continues to pay no heed to the genuine bloodshed staining our
communities, then one way or the other the government will act.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was sponsor of a Senate bill to make the networks
adopt a uniform rating system. He worked with Representative Edward
Markey, Democrat of Malden, to require V-chips in televisions so
parents can block offensive programs. He wants the Federal Trade
Commission to investigate entertainment companies' marketing of
violent products to children, and this spring he asked the Federal
Communications Commission to determine if local broadcasters were
programming in the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   He held the Senate's first hearing on video-game violence, and
he annually teams up with Bennett to bestow a ``Silver Sewer''
award on the worst ``cultural polluters.'' Last year, the Fox
Network received it for some of its prime-time shows. Lieberman
also worked with Bennett and others to get Time Warner Inc., to
drop a gangsta-rap record label.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe has been central in this debate from the beginning,''
Markey said. ``He has this intangible quality of moral authority
that he brings to every press conference or gathering to discuss
the influence of the media on children and our country, and that is
what makes him a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said ``it would be a shame'' if Lieberman is forced to
muffle his message, ``because he has told me a number of times
there is nothing that is more important to him or that he is
prouder of.'' Bennett believes leaders of the entertainment
industry have asked Gore for commitments that Lieberman will be
``kept on a short leash.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway said he could not confirm
published reports that Gore had called Hollywood studio heads,
including Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen of DreamWorks SKG, to
assure them the Democratic ticket meant them no harm. Even if Gore
had called, Hattaway said, it was not to ``harangue'' them to damp
down their criticism of his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there may be private grumbling, but the industry's
public reaction to Lieberman generally has been warm and positive.
``We're all on the same program,'' Markey remarked this week to
actors and producers who are part of the Creative Coalition, a
Hollywood watchdog group against government censorship. ``We all
love Lieberman!''
</P>
<P>
   William Baldwin, the actor who heads the coalition, said Markey
was right. ``I don't think there is anybody here who doesn't agree
with Lieberman'' that there is too much gratuitous sex and mayhem
in the media. ``His isn't a First Amendment issue. It is all about
how legislators and educators and parents and show business people
can work together to protect our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin said he disagreed with Jack Valenti, president of the
Motion Picture Association of America, who initially warned that
the vice-presidential nominee could pose a threat to the industry.
Valenti left the Democratic convention midweek and told his
spokesman that he would no longer comment on Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Hollywood has a double standard: Its leaders were
brutal when Vice President Dan Quayle called for stronger family
values on television, but they have blunted their criticism of
Lieberman because they are liberals who support the Democratic
Party. It's true that celebrities including Barbra Streisand and
Maria Shriver rolled out the red carpet this week, hosting parties
that feted or raised funds for the party. One star-studded benefit
raised $1 million for Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   According to the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics in
Washington, the entertainment industry has contributed $50 million
to Democrats since 1991. Gore has netted almost $900,000 from
Hollywood for his presidential campaign, compared to almost
$700,000 for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Solomont of Weston, a major party fund-raiser, said
Lieberman is a ``non-issue'' in Hollywood because Democrats here
have a broader agenda. ``There is no ambiguity about their support
for the party,'' Solomont said. ``They have a progressive view of
the world, and they like what the Democratic Party stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the platform adopted this week, the party stands
for ``responsible entertainment.'' It says, ``The entertainment
industry must accept more responsibility and exercise more
self-restraint by strictly enforcing movie ratings, by taking a
close look at violence in its own advertising, and by determining
whether the ratings sustems are allowing too many children to be
exposed to too much violence and cruelty.''
</P>
<P>
   Montel Williams, the television talk-show host, agrees that
Hollywood has to police itelf, but he said Lieberman's calls for
regulation are ``a very scary thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody comes to me and says we need to pass laws and put
rules and regulations in place to control the industry, then I am
afraid of the message that person is sending out,'' Williams said.
``I'll make a decision about Lieberman when I hear more about him.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, an analyst of California politics, doubts
Hollywood will get a serious scolding in the Democrats' campaign.
``You don't need to bash Hollywood to get your point across,''
Jeffe said. ``And this week, being in the heart of the
entertainment industry, it almost would have been impolite.''

`KINGS' RULE AT BLACK-ORIENTED ONSTAGE COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY 
Documentary directed by: Spike Lee 
Starring: Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer,
Bernie Mac 
Running time: 115 minutes 
Rated: R (language and sex-related humor) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world can be a pretty funny place in living color. Even
funnier, though, is black and white. ``The Original Kings of
Comedy,'' Spike Lee's high-flying concert film, reminds us that for
veteran comics Steve Harvey, D. L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer,
and Bernie Mac black comedy really means black comedy, little
dependent on whites, except to skewer a few white hypocrisies about
race. It's not that Harvey, Hughley, Cedric, and Mac are Rodney
Dangerfield in quadruplicate, not getting any respect from a
white-dominated media world. They do get respect, and they earn it.
All four accomplished pros are known nationally from frequent TV
exposure and, in Mac's case, regular movie roles. For several years
they have toured, filling huge auditoriums with people who come to
be entertained by black humor to which whites are largely
oblivious. Lee's film connects us to it brilliantly.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is too skilled a filmmaker to film a stage act flatly; his
fluid camerawork here adds to the way the evening crackles with
dynamism and life. As sure-handedly as Hughley, whose act includes
ad-libbed exchanges with audience members, Lee incorporates the
audience into the experience, making us feel the tension that
exists between any good performer and his audience, making us
equally aware of the audience's comfort with the world of
experience from which almost all of the humor pushes off, whether
earthy or simply an acutely nailed piece of reportage, such as
white men confirming what to black eyes is irrationality when they
rush toward danger _ a luxury not available to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after settling in to watch ``The Original Kings of
Comedy,'' you relax, knowing that everybody involved _ comics and
filmmakers _ knows what he's doing. Time and again, we're
transported by the outpouring of liberating humor from four men who
know the territory. They never seem to be reaching for their
monologues, just selecting and shaping the vast amount of raw
material each draws upon. Harvey, that mainstay of TV's Apollo
theater series, alternates sly sendups of music and hip-hop with
riffs that allow him to plunge into language less restricted than
on TV. Hughley, more acute in the areas of white privilege and
black incredulity, blows white self-indulgence out of the water,
whether it takes the form of anorexia or listening to the band
playing as the Titanic sank.
</P>
<P>
   Rotund Cedric may look like a court jester, especially when he's
miming a street dude maximizing his coolness when lighting up a
cigarette, but he may cut deepest of all when he catalogs the
things that make a black man long for an excuse to explode. Popeyed
Mac puts a humanistic spin on family confessional material,
recalling his brother walking away when their sister got in trouble
with drugs, then generating a hilarious routine from the
experiences he and his wife, who had thought themselves at an age
beyond child-rearing, found themselves facing when the incarcerated
sister's kids moved in with them. It would be redundant to state
that all four are sharp observers, especially after they make it
abundantly clear that the price of blackness is eternal vigilance.
Not since the glory days of Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy have we
had such a concert film. ``The Original Kings of Comedy'' is not
only exhilarating and cathartic. It's too funny to be ignored.

`CELL' ENTRAPS WITH ITS HORRIFIC VISUALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE CELL 
Directed by: Tarsem Singh 
Screenplay by: Mark Protosevich 
Starring: Jennifer Lopez, Vince Vaughn, Vincent D'Onofrio, Marianne
Jean-Baptiste, Jake Weber, Dylan Baker, James Gammon, Tara Subkoff,
Gerry Becker 
Running time: 107 minutes 
Rated: R (bizarre violence, and sexual images, nudity and
language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Cell'' spends most of its time trying to live up to its
dazzling visuals. It never quite does, although it and Jennifer
Lopez are quite an eyeful. The film boasts grand, dark, surreal
landscapes of the imagination, while Lopez revels in more costume
changes than any other psychologist in recent film history as she
journeys into the minds of traumatized and comatose subjects. ``The
Cell,'' making a bid to enter the unsettling territory of ``Silence
of the Lambs'' and ``Seven'' as Lopez takes on a serial killer who
gruesomely mutilates his victims and fetishizes them after
murdering them, is one of the rare films in this creepy genre that
places an empowered woman at its center _ alongside an
all-too-depressingly familiar disempowered female victim.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many of the film's images will prove more than some
viewers can take, the film never really endangers Lopez's character
because we're clear on the fact that what we're seeing is taking
place in someone's mind while the psychologist and the killer both
lie suspended from wires in a sterile room, the cell of the title.
Unconscious, they're connected to a mind-travel device. The film
loses little time sweeping us into its virtual reality arena as we
first see a sweeping desert vista, with Lopez striding in a long,
white feathered high-collared gown along the ridge of giant sand
dune until she reaches a figure who turns out to be a troubled boy.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez's psychologist, named Catherine Deane, is diverted off the
boy's case after Vince Vaughn's FBI agent barges into the place
with the unconscious body of Vincent D'Onofrio's captured serial
killer. They need to get inside the killer's mind fast, the FBI man
explains, because a woman he recently kidnapped is being confined
in a tank that will fill with water when a timing device is
triggered, drowning her unless they can determine its location.
That's the source of the suspense. Never soft-pedaling the killer's
butchery, ``The Cell'' then has Catherine climb into her maroon
pleated form-fitting body suit, and pick her way through his
multiple personalities as she plunges into the dark dungeon of his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   While the film rides a succession of opulently macabre visuals
of a strikingly lurid splendor, to say nothing of D'Onofrio's
versatility as the tormented tormentor, its real chance-taking lies
in its decision to present the perpetrator of such nightmarish
butchery sympathetically, as Lopez's mind-traveler makes contact
with the killer's inner child, in this case a sensitive boy
viciously abused by a monstrous father. Not that learning the
genesis of the twisted rituals that accompany the killings makes
them any easier to take. The abuses heaped upon the boy will
further test audience tolerance levels and ensure that ``The Cell''
doesn't merely settle for video game territory.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, ``The Cell'' does seem directed more to the
eye than any other vital center. Huge, dark, slimy stone
staircases, rooms decked out with torture instruments set against
billowing draperies, and grisly episodes, including one that
involves evisceration in the style of a painting depicting a
martyr, vie for visual primacy with Lopez's striking costumes.
These range from the Asian royalty look in embroidered silk to the
saintly Madonna mode as Catherine attempts to go back inside the
catatonic killer's fevered cranium and save the terrorized little
boy who grew up acting out his rage and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez was brainier and sexier in ``Out of Sight,'' but she won't
go unnoticed here, even when she's only being used as part of the
lavish decor, which is most of the time. Vaughn's FBI man
represents his most comfortable performance since ``Swingers,'' and
erstwhile video director Tarsem Singh's cell phone will be buzzing
with offers both virtual and real as ``The Cell'' gets out into the
marketplace. His film isn't as wild at heart as his savagely
theatrical visuals, but they'll do a lot to persuade you that
you're spending time in the realm of the flamboyantly demented.
``The Cell'' is a film that knows how to cover its hallucinatory
bases.

WALTER MONDALE REMEMBERS THE TURBULENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Walter F. Mondale, an elder statesmen of the
Democratic Party, calls the collection of black and white men and
women from Mississippi at this year's convention ``the most
beautiful delegation in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six years ago in Atlantic City, Mondale was an unknown
attorney general from Minnesota confronted with the task of
resolving a challenge to an all-white Mississippi delegation by a
predominantly black group calling themselves ``Freedom Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondale hammered out a compromise that satisfied few on either
side yet helped save a spot on the ticket with President Johnson _
who wanted no disruptions _ for Mondale's mentor, Hubert H.
Humphrey. But Mondale's work in 1964 had a more far-reaching
impact, leading directly to a series of reforms that opened up the
Democratic Party to women, blacks, Latinos, Asian-Americans and
gays while stripping the bosses from Tammany Hall and Chicago's
City Hall of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Freedom Democrats' challenge, the rules changes
that flowed from that, the decision we made to come clean on civil
rights, all produced a peaceful revolution,'' Mondale said. ``We
made the turn the Republicans haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a long and stormy journey for the party, however, and
Mondale, a veteran of 10 Democratic conventions, reflected on the
changes in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was not a delegate, Mondale, a young party worker in
Minnesota, remembered the 1948 convention in Philadelphia.
Humphrey, the mayor of Minneapolis, triggered a walk-out by
Southern delegates with a ringing call for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   During Mondale's first convention as a delegate in 1964, he
said, ``We still had all-white, male-segregated delegations. Some
of them made it clear they had no intention of supporting Lyndon
Johnson. It was a very poisoned situation.'' The action that year
by a special subcommittee headed by Mondale eliminated the
possibility of segregated delegations in the future.
</P>
<P>
   By 1968, new party rules demanded loyalty to the ticket from
delegates. By the 1972 convention, the Democrats insisted that
delegations reflect the demographics of each state regarding gender
and racial background. Both conventions were turbulent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The civil rights issue was unavoidable, and it just tore the
party apart,'' Mondale said. ``Then the war ripped us further
apart. By 1972, we were held together by bailing twine.''
</P>
<P>
   Discord over the Vietnam War spilled into the streets of Chicago
in 1968. Four years later, delegations led by party chieftains such
as Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, were banished from the
convention hall in Miami Beach in favor of more representative
groups. The disputes that year over party rules were so protracted
that the presidential nominee, George S. McGovern, was forced to
deliver his acceptance speech about 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Order began to be restored to the party in 1976, when Mondale
wound up on the ticket as Jimmy Carter's running mate. ``Our rules
changes focused the delegate selection process on the states,
leaving the national party with nothing to do with it. Governors
and mayors had less and less influence. Things that used to be
fought out at conventions were no longer issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Democratic conventions had lost their flavor,
Mondale said, ``Well, they're certainly very cadenced now. . . .
One old-timer told me last night: `These things are not as much fun
as they used to be'.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Democratic presidential nominees have been assured
prior to every convention in the last 40 years, some incident
usually managed to enliven the gatherings. Mondale precipitated
problems at the 1984 convention that nominated him for president by
attempting to unseat the party chairman, Chuck Manatt. President
Clinton's renomination in 1996 was marred by news that his
political strategist, Dick Morris, had been linked with a
prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as we speak, someone is probably dreaming up some
disruption'' for this year, Mondale said, laughing at the thought
of a Democratic convention without some controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the party's history of turmoil, Mondale said he was
proud of the natural diversity on the floor of this week's
convention. ``Unlike the Republicans,'' he said, ``we don't need to
colorize it.''

`SURVIVOR' KEEPS VIEWERS WATCHING . . . AND TALKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``Survivor'' premiered in late May, it was viewed as a new
strain of the Springer-esque ``reality TV'' virus, and many an
eyebrow was seen heading toward the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   In the twelve weeks since that first day on Pulau Tiga, though,
``Survivor'' has grown into America's favorite new pop-cultural
obsession. It has become a mystery craze on the level of ``Who Shot
J.R.?,'' it has topped the Nielsen ratings and delivered a
much-needed young demographic to CBS, and it has served as a
launching pad for 16 mini-celebrities who are best known by first
name only. And, most importantly, despite its nonfictional
trappings, ``Survivor'' has proven itself to be an entirely
different beast from the reality likes of ``Big Brother,'' the
psuedo-voyeuristic cesspool with which it was said to form a trend.
``Survivor,'' which finishes its first season Wednesday night, has
proven itself to be drama of the first order.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, drama. There may be real bug-infested sores on
``Survivor,'' but the brilliantly edited series has played out like
the most absorbing, carefully paced fiction on TV. It's got the
scheming villainy of ``Dynasty,'' it's got the paranoia of ``The
X-Files,'' it's got the calm-faced duplicity of a ``Masterpiece
Theatre'' adaptation, and, if you view the tribal councils as
metaphorical, it's got the murder and self-preservation of ``The
Sopranos.'' With apologies to Richard, the show's resident
naturist, ``Survivor'' is a stark naked glimpse of the human drama
in a competitive setting. There's no costuming, no Denver
Carrington or ColbyCo; just a bunch of ambitious losers on an empty
island, simultaneously trying to coexist and stab one another in
the back for a million bucks. It's group mind games laid completely
bare.
</P>
<P>
   The editing, of course, is what makes ``Survivor'' more drama
than reality. Each hour has been culled from miles of footage, then
arranged into a roller-coaster of a narrative equipt with dizzying
reversals. Producer Mark Burnett and his crew manipulate viewers
shamelessly from commercial to commercial, giving us the Tagi
alliance conspiring against Sean and then _ surprise! _ giving us
the alliance booting Jenna to capitalize on Sean's alphabet
approach. In a neat series of scenes, we saw tough-talking Susan
turn one face to Richard, another to Kelly, and yet another to us.
Even the tribal councils are rigged for titillation as camp
counselor Jeff Probst reads off the votes (holding them in the now
signature gesture) in the most suspense-building order possible.
``Survivor'' isn't too far from an improvised Robert Altman movie,
where the ``script'' is constructed in the editing room.
</P>
<P>
   After all, viewers do like to be toyed with by storytellers, an
entertainment rule that the ``Big Brother'' people ignore. The idea
of real-time TV like ``Big Brother'' may be cool, in a
performance-art-meets-Internet sort of way; but the actuality has
become a prime-time yawner of epic proportions. Get out the knives,
``Big Brother'' editors, and chop chop chop!
</P>
<P>
   Also, the ``Survivor'' editors work hard to sculpt their
characters into an ensemble worthy of Aaron Spelling. Richard, of
course, is portrayed as the clever conniver, and his slimeball
alliance goons aren't made to look much better _ worse, in fact, if
you think hidden evil is more insidious than the visible kind. On
one level, Rudy is a curmudgeon passively riding Richard's
coattails; on another level, he's a judgmental homophobe who isn't
above threatening violence if Richard betrays him in their
sub-alliance. Meanwhile, the editors have given us a few good guys
_ sensible Colleen, cautious Gretchen, naive Sean _ all of whom
have been gobbled up by the hungrier reservoir dogs.
</P>
<P>
   These people are characters, creations of Mark Burnett and
``Survivor,'' and not exactly the people themselves. In an
interview with EW.com, Colleen pointed out how the show's creative
team devised their own version of her, a phenomenon often mentioned
by graduates of MTV's ``The Real World.'' ``The editing really made
it seem like I started speaking out only after Greg left,'' she
said. ``That was the storyline, I think. You know, Greg's left,
Colleen now comes into her own. But I'd been talking the whole
time.'' Kelly, who has been portrayed as a player uncomfortable
with her own opportunistic nature, summed it up nicely in this
week's episode: ``We're not evil; we just play bad people on TV.''
Does that mean Richard may not be such a creep?
</P>
<P>
   The other secret to the success of ``Survivor'': Secrecy. In
today's massive hype factory, a good secret is very hard to find.
Movie trailers, magazine profiles, newspaper reviews,
``Entertainment Tonight'' pieces _ each trumpets movie and TV plot
information like a cell-phone addict on a crowded bus. Except for a
live awards show like the Oscars _ and even the Wall Street Journal
tried to scoop that event last year by polling Oscar voters _ we
aren't allowed to enjoy much mystery these days. That ``Survivor''
has been able to keep the identity of the winner from our
spoiler-hungry press is nothing short of a millennial miracle.
What's more, Burnett may have been clever enough to plant
disinformation when conjecture began to heat up, most famously with
a hacked-up ``Survivor'' website image indicating Gervase was the
last man standing.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, I won't argue that ``Survivor'' is great art, or
that Richard Hatch now stands beside Richard III and Richard
Burton. But I do believe that the series qualifies as great TV,
that it has fully realized the potential of its medium to capture
the country's imagination and get us talking, and thinking.
Alliances, sub-alliances, strategies like booting your best
competitor first (bye, Gretchen) _ these concepts have become the
stuff of passionate mainstream chitchat, along with some pretty
rigorous character analysis of the castaways. Indeed, what has made
this the summer of ``Survivor'' is the intensity of the show's
water cooler buzz, much of which takes place on the Internet,
particularly at a coyly written site called Survivorsucks.com.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, the buzz about ``Survivor'' will segue to the
buzz about a much weighier contest. And like the castaways, we too
will find ourselves caught in a changing society, preparing to cast
votes, and very, very tired of rats.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Sean out of the picture, the competition has come down to
the Tagi alliance, comprised of the four most ruthless castaways:
Kelly, Richard, Rudy, and Susan. Will they eat each other for
dinner?
</P>
<P>
   The first season of ``Survivor'' wraps next Wednesday with a
two-hour episode at 8 p.m. and then a live, hourlong Town Hall
meeting with the castmembers at 10 p.m. The episode will include
two immunity contests and three tribal councils. At the last
council, the winner will be determined after the two finalists
stand trial by the jury of seven. The Town Hall meeting,
``Survivor: The Reunion,'' will be hosted by Bryant Gumbel and
include all 16 contestants.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Jeff Probst? The much-mocked ``Survivor'' host will
be back early next year, leading a new pack of backstabbing
adventurers through the Australian outback for ``Survivor II.''

GALWAY'S SAW DOCTORS BRING PUNK POP TO THE STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Saw Doctors have been a rabidly well-liked Irish-rock club
act, but this summer they're stepping up to headline bigger stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to make it work. You have to be ambitious, don't
you?'' says Saw Doctors singer/guitarist Leo Goran, who formed the
band with fellow singer/guitarist Davy Carton over a pint of beer
in their small Galway hometown of Tuam 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Saw Doctors received a boost by performing on several
Guinness Fleadhs in recent years, but Guinness pulled its
sponsorship this year, thus eliminating any Fleadhs this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the irreverent punk-influenced Saw Doctors were not fazed
and are instead going full-tilt into their own headlining tour. And
this time they've added two horn players, including saxophonist
Anthony Thistlewaite, formerly of the Waterboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always try to bring people something new,'' says Moran.
``It's good, because it makes us rearrange some of the old songs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saw Doctors are still looking for breakthrough status in the
States, but they've been big in Ireland for years, ever since their
album, ``If This Is Rock 'n' Roll, I Want My Old Job Back,'' went
to No. 1 in 1991. By that time the band had also scored a No. 1
Irish single, ``I Useta Lover,'' a controversial song about going
to Catholic services and checking out members of the opposite sex
there.
</P>
<P>
   They even rhymed ``Mass'' with a part of the anatomy _ and got
away with it. ``People liked the honesty of it,'' Goran recalls.
</P>
<P>
   As might be obvious, the Saw Doctors are not trying to be
trendy. ``We're not like U2,'' says Moran. ``We don't have four
costume people and four makeup people. We've never been into that.
We've never tried to be cool. . . . And U2 goes out and tries to
play into what 18-year-olds are doing. We've never done that. There
are pros and cons to both approaches _ probably more pros to theirs
_ but that's not us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in the same room a couple of times with U2, but we
wouldn't know what to say to them,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to define the Saw Doctors' sound, Moran says, ``For me,
the essence is that it's pop music that takes in rock 'n' roll and
punk, with an Irish accent and Irish idioms. . . . But we're not
virtuoso musicians. We have to rely on having songs.''
</P>
<P>
   The group has been influenced by the Sex Pistols as well as by
the Kinks (notably the band's 12-string guitar sound) and by Bruce
Springsteen's working-class anthems. ``We like the way he writes
about the connectedness of ordinary people. That has influenced
us,'' says Moran.
</P>
<P>
   The Saw Doctors have had some record label difficulties in the
States _ their last label, Paradigm, folded _ but they're now
negotiating with four other companies (including Rounder Records)
for stateside distribution. They hope to have another album out
shortly, but for now, they're ready to slam Boston again with a
show lasting up to 2 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston area has always meant a lot to us,'' says Moran.
``Our first-ever show in the States was just outside Boston _ in
Easton _ in 1991. That's something that you don't forget.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Staying Righteous: The Righteous Brothers are among the all-time
stars of pop radio. Their hit ``You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' ''
was recently named the No. 1 most-played radio song ever, totaling
more than 8 million plays and besting anything by the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   The 1965 hit was written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weill _ and
produced by the legendary Phil Spector. ``It was a two-day
situation to record it,'' Medley, now 59, says in a phone
interview. ``Phil was very, very particular, which was cool,
because the song kept getting better. Phil was an amazing producer.
He knew what he was going after and he didn't stop until the final
result. In later years, he might have gotten more `out there,' but
he was fine with us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lovin' Feelin' '' became a hit again in 1986 in the ``Top
Gun'' soundtrack. Another Righteous Brothers hit, ``Unchained
Melody,'' had a similar revival in the film ``Ghost'' in 1990. And
in 1987 Medley and Jennifer Warnes had a hit, ``(I've Had) the Time
of My Life'' in the film ``Dirty Dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   Medley has had to face tragedy as well, namely the shocking
murder 24 years ago of his ex-wife, Karen, who was raped and killed
by an intruder who has never been found, though detectives may
finally have a break in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had lost the DNA or misplaced it for 20 years, but they
found it and are now testing three or four guys,'' says Medley,
adding that it takes a few months to get the results.
</P>
<P>
   Medley, who lived in Newport Beach, Calif., then and now,
dropped out of the Righteous Brothers at the time to take care of
their son (``It didn't feel like a sacrifice _ it needed to be
done''). The group eventually reunited in 1982 and has been touring
ever since, playing up to 60 shows a year nationally, in addition
to two months annually in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're 80 years old and people still want to see us, we'll
keep singing,'' he says. &QL; 
 &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Phish on film: The new Phish documentary, ``Bittersweet Motel''
(and there's also a Web site by that name), is said to resemble the
Bob Dylan documentary, ``Don't Look Back,'' the new film concert
footage and backstage interviews and hijinks with band members. It
was directed by Todd Phillips, who also did ``Road Trip,'' ``Frat
House,'' and ``Hated'' (a documentary on New Hampshire punk rocker
G. G. Allin).

REBA'S THINKING `ANNIE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slowing down a runaway train might be an easier task than
slowing down Reba McEntire, who always seems to have a thousand
projects waiting for her. Reba is a self-professed workaholic who
can't stay in one place for too long, but she's trying to cure
herself of that so she can star on Broadway in ``Annie Get Your
Gun,'' a role that would appear tailor-made for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess timing is everything. They have asked me several years
in a row &UR;  &LR; about `Annie Get Your Gun,' but I just kept saying,
`Naah, I don't think so yet.' But the timing is right now,'' says
McEntire.
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway offer is for February to May of next year. ``I just
never felt I could stay in one place for that long,'' says
McEntire. ``I have never stayed in one place for more than four
months, except when I was a kid, and that seems like another
lifetime ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in negotiations, but I'm really hoping that it
will pull through,'' she adds of the Broadway experience. ``I'd
love to do that part. I love Broadway and I love the stage. I love
that immediate response from the audience. And instead of me going
all over the world touring, the audience would come to me in New
York. I think it would be a lot of fun living in New York for five
months. I think it's going to be a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McEntire is off to Brazil this week for a performance
_ and has been working internationally more than any country artist
in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to go out of the country has been a lot of fun,'' she
says. ``We have toured Australia and all of the UK and most of
Europe. We haven't done Asia yet, but we want to do the Orient as
soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   What prompts her to keep such a hectic pace? ``I guess just the
new things that we can do. And the thing that always gets me going
is curiosity,'' says McEntire, 45. ``If you're talking money, I
can't make this kind of money anywhere else. And if you're talking
adventure, I can't think of a job that would take me to as many
places. I just get a big kick out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   McEntire and her husband/manager, Narvel Blackstock, also spend
plenty of time with their son, Shelby, who will turn 10 soon and
doesn't quite know what to think of his busy parents. ``Shelby was
with me last night in Milwaukee and I couldn't get him up this
morning,'' says McEntire. ``I said, `Come on, Shelby.' He said,
`Mom, I'm tired.' I said, `Hey, me and your dad do this every
night, so get up!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Like McEntire, her road crew is also apparently tireless.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love their work as much as I do,'' she says. ``We work
hard all of the time. The only time I have ever taken three months
off is when I had Shelby, and that was 10 years ago. So it's not a
laid-back vacation spot out here. Of course, we do have our
vacation time, but as soon as we get back, we hit the road again.
And the people that are touring with me, they get a little antsy at
home. They love their home and they love their family, but they
were meant to be on the road just as I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma-born McEntire's dad was a rodeo competitor, so she
learned all about the road from him. ``I think it's just something
you've got to have in your blood,'' she says. ``And I honestly
think we're going faster now than we did 15 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   McEntire has released 26 albums that have sold an overall 40
million copies. Although her turf has been invaded in recent years
by the likes of Shania Twain, the Dixie Chicks, and Jo Dee Messina,
McEntire has still scored two country hits from her latest album,
``So Good Together,'' with a third likely.
</P>
<P>
   And even when she pulls back from recording and touring, she
rarely stops, because that's the time she reserves for making
movies. She has made nine films and just finished another, ``One
Night at McCools,'' in which she plays a psychiatrist and stars
next to Michael Douglas, Liv Tyler, and Matt Dillon. She expects it
will come out early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about a bar named McCools and Matt Dillon works there and
his cousin, played by Paul Reiser, is in there, also. It's about
Reiser, John Goodman, and Matt Dillon all falling in love with Liv
Tyler. They don't know what to do about it, so they go tell their
story to their confidant. And I'm Paul Reiser's confidante. I think
John Goodman goes to a priest and Matt Dillon goes to Michael
Douglas. It's a cute little story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to do more movies,'' she adds. ``I'd really like to
do a musical movie like the ones they used to do, like `Calamity
Jane.' Making movies works out very well, because when I've got to
give the crew and the band a break, I'll go do one. And I'd love to
do a motion picture like `The Patriot.' Did you see that movie? Go
see it on the biggest screen you can. I'd go see it again. Mel
Gibson is absolutely spectacular and it's just a wonderful movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The everenthusiastic McEntire does relax once in a while,
however. She plays golf sometimes _ and also likes to laze around
her pool during those rare times at home. ``I can sit out there on
the swing at the pool house and just listen to the birds chirp and
I'll be fine,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And then the road comes calling again _ the road which now may
lead her to Broadway.

LATEST `GODZILLA' IS HOT ON FIRE-BREATHING FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
GODZILLA 2000 
Directed by: Takao Okawara 
Screenplay by: Wataru Mimura, Hiroshi Kashiwabara 
Starring: Takehiro Murata, Shrio Sano, Hiroshi Abe, Naomi Nishida,
Mayu Suzuki, Tsutomu Kitagawa 
Running time: 97 minutes 
Rated: PG (monster violence and mild language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can take the boy out of Tokyo, but you can't take Tokyo out
of the boy. Which is why ``Godzilla 2000'' is miles better than
Hollywood's overblown, computerized 1998 ``Godzilla.'' You can all
but feel the new film sink back with relief into the old familiar
cheesiness, or at least a slick replica of it, complete with badly
dubbed dialogue, the all-important guy-in-the-rubber-suit look and
stomp-out-a-scale-model-of-Tokyo finale. It's got all the
pseudo-destructiveness you could hope for, and it still makes
contact with the impulses that drove the original, namely its
ability to provide a power fantasy to people feeling pretty
powerless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla,'' especially if you know the darker original without
the Raymond Burr footage spliced in, gave form and shape to the
powerlessness Japanese felt not only before US nuclear power, but
before nature itself. Godzilla, the mutant monster, became an
allegorical force of nature, beating back invading monsters, even
if it meant he caused a lot of damage in the process, before
walking back into the bay until next time. ``Godzilla'' was ``King
Kong'' with bad karma. ``Godzilla 2000'' is ``King Kong'' with bad
breath. Incendiary breath, too. It not only appeals to our inner
Godzilla. It appeals to our inner cheeseball.
</P>
<P>
   It's got a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor tied to the fact that
Godzilla now is viewed as a protector, even if he breaks the place
up protecting it. In a film at least as geared to young audiences
as to adults, his tail gives new meaning to the word backlash, his
voice (created by running a resin-saturated leather glove over a
stringed bass) tells all of Japan that he feels its pain. His fiery
dragon breath sometimes causes the pain, but who can knock it? It's
his secret weapon against his new adversary, Orga, from outer
space, dormant for many years in a flying saucer at the bottom of
Tokyo Bay until science, stirring up trouble as usual, raises it.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the film has a nice shot of a fishing boat coming into
view at a lighthouse keeper's eye level. Then the camera pulls back
and we see that the ship is being held between the teeth of
Godzilla, who promptly chomps down on it, splintering it. The
pro-Godzilla humans are a three-person Godzilla Prediction Network,
headed by Takehiro Murata, who's aided by his adolescent daughter
(Mayu Suzuki) and an intrepid reporter (Naomi Nishida). Predicting
Godzilla's return is not an arcane science. Things just start
shaking, a la ``Jurassic Park.'' The GPN philosophy is simple _
stay out of the big lizard's way.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's more reassuring than scary. Just as Dracula has been
transformed from frightening bloodsucker into breakfast-cereal-box
icon, Godzilla has been transformed in the collective psyche into a
sort of scaly Mary Poppins. The old Godzilla movies were recycled
on sci-fi channels. This new one seems headed for Nickelodeon, even
though Hiroshi Abe's security chief wants to kill Godzilla. This is
not a winning position, but his insane square-off with Godzilla
adds to the fun. Praise is in order, too, for Tsutomu Kitagawa, the
man in the latex suit, who must have spent more time battling
claustrophobia than evil old Orga.
</P>
<P>
   When the Godzilla films began, their primitive execution meant
that much of the humor was unintentionally campy. Although they've
become more sophisticated, they're careful to simulate the
rudimentary skill levels of the early days. The badly lip-synched
lines all but have little comic-strip balloons wrapped around them,
and it was shrewd to have Godzilla's foe look bigger and meaner.
When Orga puts his foot down, everybody within a 20-mile radius
knows it. So Godzilla's the underdog. But he never was a quitter.
One droll sequence involves Godzilla disappearing under a pile of
rubble after Orga drops an office tower on him, only to appear
moments later, still full of fight, having been no more than
briefly stunned. ``Godzilla 2000'' is a ton of fun, and then some.

DEMOCRATS UNLOAD ON FOES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Democrats' convention week boiled down to a
family affair _ rather, four serial family affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Day One: Clinton &AMP; Clinton. Day Two: the Kennedy Clan, unto the
Fourth Generation. Day Three: Say hello to Happy Joe Lieberman,
whose old man sold bakery rolls and later liquor, and his
85-year-old mom. Day Four: The Gores.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting this uphill battle on the terrain appropriated by the
Republicans, i.e., faith-and-family-and-the-moral-high-ground, the
Democrats under their just-promoted field commander Albert A. Gore
assembled in their final state caucuses Thursday morning. At the
Beverly Hilton, the fractious-and-often-feuding Democratic Party
family brunched on bacon and eggs and once-more-into-the-breech
speeches. The ringmaster was Ed Markey, the Malden congressman, who
presided over a three-ring circus of political talent.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after Joe-Joe-Joe Lieberman's better-than-expected
and well-delivered speech, which was short, funny, and
mistake-free, the Bay State delegates were ripe for some
rip-snortin' rhetoric. As in Philadelphia with the GOP, the podium
pronunciatos from the Dems are strictly scripted. Snarling and
gashing the other side is out-out-out; piety and
lifting-up-the-downtrodden are in-in-in.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Democratic clan gathers in its caves _ in this case
a handy cavern of the marbled Hilton _ the speeches are meatier,
gnawing closer to the bone. Barney Frank was hailed by Markey as
the Howitzer of the House, and Markey expansively predicted Barney
will be ``the first Jewish speaker of the House.'' You get the
feeling there's going to be a lot of ``the first Jewish
fill-in-the-blank'' after Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Frank proceeded to unload on Ralph Nader, hammering the consumer
crusader for ignoring guns, abortion, gay rights, and a lot of
other divisive social issues as the third party alternative. Nader
won't cost Gore Massachusetts in November, Frank said, but he'll
drain votes elsewhere with his siren song to disaffected liberals.
Frank will be the designated Nader-basher, off his acid-etched
portrait of Nader as a narrow-minded opportunistic hustler who
would ``hijack'' votes from Democrats and ``severely undercut our
efforts to do something'' on social policy. Ralph's going to be
getting an earful from Barney in the next 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On came Michael Whouley, the Gore camp insider, Dorchester's
own, who ran Kentucky for Mike Dukakis in 1988 and became a player
with Clinton in '92. ``We're going to win this election,'' said
Whouley, and he ran down the polling and electoral vote situation
for the audience of insiders.
</P>
<P>
   He derided Bush's double-digit polling lead as ``footsteps in
the sand,'' based on an illusory appeal to ``values, personality,
integrity,'' that can be whittled down by expert attack. Gore's
been only ``a two-dimensional'' figure becauswe ``he stood behind a
larger-than-life president,'' said Whouley, while Bush built his
lead as ``the anti-Clinton, throw-the-bums-out, I'm a nice guy''
crusader. ``Bush is playing with the house money,'' which he
defined as ``nominal Democrats, persuadable voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Whouley ticked off favorable protents and recent successes in
key Midwestern states, and predicted more gains ``once we move this
thing to archery range.'' The Dems will scorch Bush for colluding
with polluters in Texas and ``turning them into regulators,'' with
sacrificing interests of uninsured children and elders to big money
contributors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, wearing a Hawaiian shirt that one of his old pals said
``looks like it came from a yard sale,'' a smiling and expansive
Mike Dukakis came on to a standing-O. ``If I knew anything about
presidential politics I'd be here in another capacity,'' grinned
the 1988 nominee. He joked about Kitty getting her hair done on
Rodeo Drive, but his message was simple: Gore cannot sit there and
let the Republicans attack without returning withering fire.
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis mocked George W. Bush's vow to restore ``honesty,
integrity, and decency'' to the White House. ``You can't just sit
there,'' was the lesson he learned to his rue. ``Over 100 figures
in the Reagan administration were forced to leave office'' in
scandals, he said. Iran-Contra was a scandal of massive
proportions, he continued. ``And George Bush (Sr.) pardoned every
single person who was indicted or convicted after he lost the
election and before he left office,'' he jibed. And what about ``No
new taxes?'' They crowd hooted as Dukakis called Bush Jr.'s
morality pitch ``a lot of nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget the polls, urged the Duke. ``I was never 17 points ahead
of Bush (in '88), but that's what the polls say. This race right
now is about 35-35, with 30 percent undecided.'' Then, with a quick
plug for the high-speed train between Boston and New York, which
Amtrak-fan Dukakis has been pushing for years, he was off to pick
up Kitty at the hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates then heard from Bill Bradley, who would have
nipped Gore in New Hampshire last winter had not Whouley and his
spear-carriers pulled out a four-point win in the final furlong.

MEMO TO AL: GET HIP ON A LABEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is like being on the spin cycle at Procter &AMP; Gamble, trying
to create a new jingle for Tide. Al Bore, er, Gore needs something
that can tumble off his lips if he has any chance to win this
election.
</P>
<P>
   Columnists can sit at their terminals and intellectualize all
they want about which presidential candidate has the best
strategies for the economy, health care, education and defense. But
the reality is that this is a nation of attention deficit. Sound
bites, slogans and single sentences matter. Americans love it when
their politicians leave short droppings that do not tax their
brains, yet tells them everything they need to know about a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Already, George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, has gained
tremendous mileage and the early lead in the polls partially
because of his promises of ``compassionate conservatism.'' You
liberals and lefties can snicker all you want, but the hard fact is
that Bush put a fair amount of thought into this, meeting with
academics and grassroots conservatives who work with the poor
before making this a household phrase at the political breakfast
table.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Democrats have to fight for Latino voters and
white women. Suddenly, the Democrats have to brew a pot of caffiene
for even loyal Democrats. The damage of ``compassionate
conservatism'' is in its stealth qualities. The phrase is not
actually meant to energize loyal Republicans, and it's ultimate
purpose is not even to get Latinos and white women. It's real
purpose is to remove the aura of Republican meanness so that inert
Democrats who need to be pushed to the polls stay home on Election
Day, opting instead for Oprah, soaps and the ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 20 years, despite the fracturing of America's
attention span through the explosion of cable TV and computers, the
Republicans have been devishly good at phrases that either hit like
lightning bolts or linger until they take on their own reality.
Richard Nixon was known for representing the ``moral majority.''
Ronald Reagan surely destroyed the Democrats in the South in 1980
by going to Philadelphia, Miss., where three civil rights workers
were killed in the 1960s, and declared ``states rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan recited something that still reverberates in everthing
from local elections to the Oklahoma City bombing: ``Government is
not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.''
Reagan and his aides even created phrases that energized opponents.
His mouthing of ``constructive engagement'' with South Africa was
so clearly a sellout to apartheid that it helped energize a
worldwide protest movement against both the White House and South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's successor, George Bush the elder, was no Great
Communicator like Reagan. Yet, in his acceptance speech at the 1988
Republican Convention, he came up with ``a kindler and gentler
nation'' and ``a thousand points of light.'' Liberals and lefties
snickered. Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis even sneered at a
debate, ``I don't know what a thousand points of light is.''
</P>
<P>
   All Dukakis could offer was that the election was not about
ideology but about competence. That was as exciting as a three-hour
lecture by a computer technician. Bush ended up turning ``a
thousand points of light'' into an annual award that people were
actually honored to get at the State of the Union.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is true that the Democrats have held the White House for
the last eight years without any particular slogan worth
remembering. Back in 1992, Bill Clinton said he was proposing a
``New Covenant'' with the American people. But that sounded too
much like going to a Baptist church. He also tried ``Putting People
First.'' But that died as everyone knows that both Democrats and
Repubicans put PAC money first. You could make a small argument for
``It's the economy, stupid,'' but the reality was that Clinton
relied on a personal magnetism with his origins as a poor boy that
got him past a bored Bush in 1992 and a dull Bob Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Democrats have to contend with a Republican
candidate whose buzz words threaten to act as a buzz saw against
Democratic roots. So far, all the Democrats have been able to do,
such as did vice presidential nominee Joseph Lieberman did in his
acceptance speech Wednesday night, is keep invoke the 40-year-old
``New Frontier'' of John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats cannot win like that. Gore needs something new.
What would be the opposite of ``compassionate conservatism?''
</P>
<P>
   Could it be ``Lean and Mean Liberalism?'' They could try
something else like ``Libidinousless Liberals.'' Or ``Scintillating
Centrism.'' Or ``The Moral Moderates.'' Or ``Just Say No to Bush
Lite.'' He could say he and Clinton rescued America from a
``Bush-league'' economy in 1992. He could ask, ``Do you want to
return to the minors?'' Whatever Gore comes up with, he better come
up with it quick, or Bush will send Gore to the minors.

SHORT STORIES CAN SHAKE THE WORLD: SYLVIA BROWNRIGG'S NOVEL IDEAS
REACH AMERICAN SHORES 
</HEADLINE>
 BC- BOOKS SHOOK KANSAS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JOHN MARK EBERHART  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   Ten Women Who Shook the World, by
Sylvia Brownrigg (126 pages; Farrar, Straus and Giroux; $18)
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is shaping up to be the summer of the strange short story.
</P>
<P>
   George Saunders weighed in with his second collection of
touching but sharply satirical tales, Pastoralia. Amy Bloom offered
characters and love stories that were both disturbing and endearing
in A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You. Now Sylvia Brownrigg
joins in with Ten Women Who Shook the World.
</P>
<P>
   Actually this collection was first published in 1997 in England,
two years before Brownrigg's novel The Metaphysical Touch. The
mostly positive reviews of that novel's mix of the philosophical
and erotic led Farrar, Straus and Giroux to bring Brownrigg's short
stories to an American audience.
</P>
<P>
   American readers should be thankful we finally have the chance.
Brownrigg's stories provide a surreal but poignant view of the
nature of femaleness and the roles women play _ or are not allowed
to play _ in our society.
</P>
<P>
   Men who still think that only men should construct, for example,
would do well to read the opening story, ``Amazon,'' in which a
mythical and apparently immortal builder and her assistant create
and erect the Pyramids, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal and
the Golden Gate Bridge. Finally the assistant decides to strike out
on her own _ not to build things but to rebuild the beauty of the
rain forest:
</P>
<P>
   ``She speaks of the rubber plants that will no longer be bled to
make superballs, she chats about the wood that will never again
become A-frames. She talks of tearing down factories. She revels in
getting rid of the office sprawl.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a marvelously entertaining tale but also a lesson on the
human need to make _ and to unmake what has been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hussy From the West'' challenges patriarchal definitions of
promiscuity but also explores the very essence of what it means to
be sensual, suggesting that sexuality is only one component of a
state of mind that also includes one's relationship with everything
on earth, with all entities animate and inanimate. ``If I am
promiscuous,'' the narrator says, ``then so is that bed I slept in
where nothing happened but the hope of love; and so is that train
compartment where our eyes met; and so is my favorite novel that
has dozed beside me over the years in times of trouble or confusion
when I've needed its solace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistress of the Moons'' counterbalances the preoccupations of
``man's'' machine-driven explorations of the moon with a feminine
spirit's eros-inflected love of the universe itself. Call it mood
music of the spheres; it's an eccentric tune, but it's beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Brownrigg was born in California, majored in philosophy at Yale
and now lives in London. The Metaphysical Touch was criticized by
some for being overburdened with philosophical musings, but these
stories certainly don't suffer that fault. They are thoughtful,
yes, but never bog down into mere intellectual noodling, thanks to
Brownrigg's light touch and bright writing.
</P>
<P>
   What Brownrigg has created here, in fact, is a compact
collection of fables, oddly appealing little sketches that are not
really about characters but rather about how women think of
themselves and are thought of.

SYDNEY: FROM PENAL COLONY TO WORLD-CLASS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
SYDNEY 
The Story of a City 
By Geoffrey Moorhouse 
Harcourt, 292 pp., $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A veteran travel writer, Geoffrey Moorhouse is the author of 18
books including acclaimed profiles of New York and Calcutta. He
knows how to nail a place down, to define and describe its essence.
In Sydney's case, the essential fact is that Australia's oldest,
largest, and most interesting urban center is also one of the few
remaining world-class cities still centered _ physically and
psychologically _ on its harbor, the original reason for its
existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The harbor is the key to Sydney, its alpha and omega,''
Moorhouse asserts. ``Other great harbors of the world do not
generally so dominate the local psyche or, when occasionally they
do, are not often held in such regard.'' In New York, he notes
sniffily, you are barely aware of the harbor unless you visit the
Statue of Liberty ``or live in the borough of Staten Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Moorhouse begins with a lyrical description of what it's like to
sail into Sydney Harbor, declaring ``no anchorage in all the seven
seas has ever been safer or more beguiling.'' The final pages find
him heading out to sea _ leaving, with obvious regret, ``the most
beautiful working harbor in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As he guides a reader around Sydney past and present, Moorhouse
keeps circling back to the water's edge, even as he moves on to
topics like industrial relations (Sydney's combative dockworkers
are the shock troops of the Australian trade-union movement), urban
sprawl (the city has grown around its harbor, not away from it), or
cultural life (the landmark Sydney Opera House, which from some
angles looks like a schooner under full sail, dominates the
downtown waterfront).
</P>
<P>
   Moorhouse's enthusiasm occasionally seems a bit excessive and
his prose overripe _ ``Sydney's heart slides into view, more
stunningly beautiful at this distance than any modern city has a
right to be'' _ but clearly he's captivated not only by the city's
superb natural setting but also by its unique history and feisty
character. ``Here is a place where people fight for what they've
got and never, never back down.''
</P>
<P>
   The description of historical events and the explanations of the
city's institutions and traditions are vivid and illuminating. The
author is less successful in portraying the Sydneysiders
themselves. We learn a lot about them in the abstract, but somehow
the loud, cheery voices of the world's most affable, outgoing, and
assertive city dwellers come through only faintly.
</P>
<P>
   However, Moorhouse certainly has an eye for a telling image, and
a knack for digging up revealing factoids. In a city where just
about every neighborhood has at least one football field and/or
cricket pitch, there were until quite recently only a half-dozen or
so public libraries. Moorhouse also takes a clear-eyed look at the
city's dark side, including the near-extermination of the
Aborigines who were the original inhabitants of the area, as well
as homophobia, police corruption, and the open racism that Asian
immigrants, in particular, often face.
</P>
<P>
   Among the interesting historical facts Moorhouse brings into
focus is the role of the American Revolution in the founding of the
city. Deprived of the American colonies as a dumping ground for
undesirables, he observes, British prisons became dangerously
overcrowded in the late 18th century. So the crown decided to
transport excess convicts to Australia, even though practically
nothing was known about the sub-continent other than that it
existed. The first convict fleet arrived in 1788, and the first
boatload of shackled prisoners stepped ashore near what is now the
site of the Sydney Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Once embarrassed by its beginnings as the capital of a penal
colony, Sydney now takes wry pride in the hardihood and
achievements of the founding convict fathers and mothers, Moorhouse
relates. The city even has a convict museum, housed in a handsome
Georgian building designed by Australia's first professional
architect _ a convicted forger.
</P>
<P>
   Although he decribes the convict system as ``essentially
wicked,'' Moorhouse points out that some convict settlers ended up
well-to-do, and virtually none chose to return to England after
their sentences were up. Apparently then, as now, Sydney was easy
to like and hard to leave.

WITH SWITCH, GEORGE LOSES HIS SAFETY NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ By the end of last season, fans wanted to
see more of rookie safety Tony George. Now it appears they will be
seeing less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived my life by trying to make the best of a bad
situation and continue to move forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's overcome diabetes in becoming a professional athlete. That
meant defying the odds at every level of organized sports,
overcoming times when his blood sugar isn't regular, and overcoming
having to take insulin injections at certain times of the day.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last season, George was finally starting when
Chris Carter was injured. But Bill Belichick and his staff came in
and moved him to strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   There are many parts of the switch that bother George. First, he
has always been a free safety and now he's backing up Lawyer
Milloy, who may be the NFL's best. Third, George's not involved in
any of the sub packages on third down. He'll have to make it as a
special teams player, hardly what the third-round pick out of the
University of Florida had envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you think you're going to play one position it's
frustrating, but the mark of a true player is to bounce back and
play that position well,'' George said. ``I'm still trying to find
my role and do the best I can every time I get a chance. I want
everybody to see I can play ball and make plays wherever I go.''
</P>
<P>
   George has been watched throughout camp. He captured much
attention when he failed his running test on a hot, sultry day in
Smithfield, R.I., when he could not complete the remaining lap.
George became disoriented, his vision blurred, and he nearly lapsed
into a diabetic coma, an incredibly scary state for people of any
age.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there didn't appear to be an understanding of his
illness by the new staff. It wasn't until a day later that he was
able to explain what being a diabetic trying to play sports was all
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a bit of a problem at first,'' said George.
``With a new coaching staff, you don't have time to sit down and
explain what's going on with you as a person. Diabetes is a part of
me. After the speeches Bill gave and everything, he was basically
going with a no-excuse-for-anything policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never used diabetes as an excuse and I know that first
impressions are everything. When you're not making your times on a
running test, it looks like you're out of shape. It's hard at
first. After you explain the situation, it gives you a line on what
you're up against. I'm not using it as an excuse, but at least you
can say that's the situation and now let's go on from here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of understanding. There's no excuse not to
understand what's wrong with a player. It's part of any program and
organization. The first thing I would want them to know is my
situation with my diabetes, and even if they don't know, I don't
mind sitting down and explaining it to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With things being in such a fragmented situation with training
camp, I've finally had time to sit with the coaches and explain it.
I think they were understanding afterward. To be out there running
and you can't take another step, the coaches are thinking you're
completely out of shape. If you understand diabetes, you can say
he's giving it his all _ and he's still coming out on the short
end.''
</P>
<P>
   George thinks it's important for each coach and organization to
understand each player and ``see what their personal issues are,
whether they're mental issues, emotional issues, or family
problems. Not knowing just makes the situation worst,'' said
George.
</P>
<P>
   Though he believes deep in his heart that free safety is where
he performs best, he knows he must adapt to strong safety. Even
though he's one injury away from taking over for Milloy, it is
George who will miss Sunday's game against Tampa Bay with a toe
injury. The injury forced the team to re-sign Reggie Rideau, who
was released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always try to be out there every down and play every
down,'' said George. ``It's a little disappointing (to switch
positions), but you know what you're working for. To make this team
a success, you have to find your niche in this defense. If I have
to be the best special teams player I can be, that's what I'll do.
But if I get a role on the defense, I want to go out there and make
some plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Backing up Milloy is daunting, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm not going to beat out Lawyer,'' said George.
``There's nothing I can do except when I get my opportunity to make
plays. I feel I'm doing a pretty good job. There's always something
you have to do a little bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   And Belichick often lets him know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's a guy who's always going to find something wrong in
whatever you do,'' he said. ``He wants to make you better and a
complete player. I'm not trying to go out and do this and that, I'm
just doing what they ask me to do and do it to their satisfaction
and to my own satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   George said there was no room for discussion when Belichick
decoded to switch him in veteran minicamp in June. George said he
just did it and didn't ask why.
</P>
<P>
   Thew switch could be seen as a step back, for he could have been
competing with Tebucky Jones and Chris Carter at free safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know (if it's a step back),'' said George. ``You can
always comment on that, but it's one of those situations you just
have to go with and see where it leads. You have to do what the
coach expects you do to make it better. I made my mark on special
teams in college and hopefully I can make my mark in the pros as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there are no signs George will even get on the field
in nickel and dime situations. Veteran Larry Whigham is also a
strong safety and, with his latest injury, George might not make
the 53-man roster, which would be quite a letdown for a kid who
impressed everyone with his ability to hit in the open field a year
ago.

<P>
   JACO BEACH, Costa Rica _ Zach McDuffie had a degree from the
University of Georgia, a promising career at an Atlanta ad agency
and a rush-hour commute he couldn't stand.
</P>
<P>
   He dumped it all for a life in this Central American hideaway,
trading button-downs for baggies, his car for a surfboard, his
climb up the corporate ladder for free-form creativity.
</P>
<P>
   And he's loving every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came down here for a month the first time and fell in love
with Costa Rica,'' said McDuffie, 27. ``I went back to Atlanta and
was doing the I-285 commute, but I just kept dreaming about Costa
Rica. I finally came back to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie is one of an estimated 30,000 Americans and Canadians _
some believe the number might run as high as 70,000 _ who have been
lured to a life in this tropical oasis.
</P>
<P>
   Once a little-known swath of mountains, jungle and beaches
sandwiched between the Caribbean and the Pacific, Costa Rica became
something of a '90s nirvana for those seeking escape, simplicity,
natural beauty and cheap living.
</P>
<P>
   Bordered by Nicaragua on the north and Panama on the south, the
country stands out among its neighbors, but mostly for good
reasons. In a region torn by dictatorships, drug trafficking and
political instability, Costa Rica has enjoyed free democratic
elections for decades.
</P>
<P>
   While its neighbors struggle to overcome poverty and illiteracy,
Costa Rica enjoys a 94 percent literacy rate and broad-based
economic prosperity with only 6 percent unemployment in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While others lack basic sanitation and adequate health-care, 99
percent of Costa Rica's 3.6 million residents are served by piped
water and 90 percent receive public health services recognized as
among the best in the region. More than 90 percent have access to
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most dramatic measure of Costa Rica's
difference: the nation abolished its army in 1949 and plowed the
money into development and social services. That stunning move
earned Costa Rica the nickname, ``The Switzerland of Central
America.''
</P>
<P>
   In another far-reaching move, leaders also set aside huge chunks
of the gorgeous countryside, so that now nearly 25 percent of Costa
Rica's territory is protected as national parks or preserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been everything I dreamed,'' McDuffie said. ``I'm
the happiest guy I know. It's such a different tempo here, a
different pace. All my dad's friends are mad at me, saying I
somehow managed to retire at 24.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as in any paradise, there are a few potholes.
Literally. The roads, while better than in neighboring countries,
suffer washouts and sporadic repairs that make driving an
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of foreigners has driven up real estate values, so
that prices in popular areas compare better to Miami than Managua.
The escalation has driven some would-be expatriates to look for
cheaper homesteads in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rican crime has also shot up, with the high-profile
murders of two American college students in March triggering a bout
of unfavorable international publicity. There has alsoting around
for opportunities, he decided to open a school catering to the
hordes of young backpacker tourists who have made Costa Rica a
favorite destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to a lot of people who were going to language schools
in San Jose, and they were frustrated because they weren't seeing
the country,'' he said. ``So we designed a program that's hands-on
learning, with language, ecology, art and surfing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a struggle at times, but now in its third year,
McDuffie's ``Escuela del Mundo'' _ ``School of the World'' _ is a
growing enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our students find out about us from the Internet,''
McDuffie said. ``That's been the key. I wouldn't have been able to
do this 10 years ago because nobody would've been able to find
us.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Another ex-pat who has found his place in Jaco Beach is Dave
Klostermann, who once ran a thriving but stressful swimming pool
construction business in Los Angeles.

 &HT;    Los Angeles conventioneers try to keep the eternal flame lit
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Democratic convention now behind us, the campaign
shifts its focus from the the feel-good rhetoric _ that marked both
this and the Republican convention _ to the more serious job of
defining the differences between Al Gore and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   May God help us all.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats in Los Angeles weren't as choreographed as the
Republicans in Philadelphia, but they did their best to put on a
good show for the TV cameras:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the last surviving member of
John F. Kennedy's immediate family, exhibited the quiet dignity and
grace that was so much like her mother. Looking as though she
wanted to be somewhere else during her speech, she nevertheless
showed she was still the brave little girl a nation watched grow
up.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  While Caroline's speech was sentimental, Uncle Teddy Kennedy's
speech was a disappointment. Sen. Kennedy, looking as if he, too,
wanted to be somewhere else, stumbled through his remarks and did
little to rally the crowd. His bad back has obviously taken its
toll. The best thing about Kennedy's appearance: His mane of silver
hair.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Speaking of hair, Ann Richards, sporting a
less-than-big-hair-do, didn't get near the podium but instead held
court on CNN with Larry King. At 68, Richards looked as if she had
regained some of that zeal she lost during the 1994 Texas
governor's race when Bush trounced her. Appearing with Richards was
GOP stalwart Jack Kemp. It was entertaining to watch these old
political lions trade swipes. They should take their show on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  No doubt one of Gore's primary considerations in choosing a
running mate was that he had to make himself look dynamic in
comparison. He succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joe Lieberman's drowsy monotone acceptance speech made us
want to sit up and yawn. According to political pundits, though,
Lieberman's address to the convention was his best effort yet. It
should really be a barn burner when Dick Cheney and Lieberman
square off in a debate.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Touted as Gore's ``most important speech ever,'' the
Democratic presidential nominee has set his course and attempted to
steer away from Bill Clinton. Possibly the most asked question of
anyone associated with Gore is can he distance himself from the man
he's been in the shadow of for eight years? Gore's biggest obstacle
is still sitting in the White House and how Clinton behaves himself
over the next 11 weeks will play a big part in who will be at the
inaugural ball in January, 2001.

<P>
   MACMAHAN ISLAND, Maine _ News of the alchemy started to spread
among Maine's islanders a month ago when it began: The residents of
MacMahan Island opened a valve, flipped a switch and began drinking
the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Curious visitors have come over in boats and tromped up to the
island's highest point, where 800 pounds of hissing pressure forces
the water through membrane after membrane into a tower of trembling
clear water. Almost every one of them asks for a cup, and peers
down into it, and then takes a careful drink. Superintendant Peter
Schuerch has explained a dozen times that the islanders have
replaced their precious, hoarded fresh water with desalted seawater
_ the first community in New England to do so, experts say. He
knows he will explain it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame them, when you see where it comes from,''
Schuerch said, with a nod toward the briny-smelling harbor. ``I
mean, we just drove across it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of water-rich New England, bounded by an ocean
landscape, Maine's islanders have spent 300 years worrying about
having enough drinking water. Many of Maine's islands have no
groundwater at all, only rain and melted snow that gets caught in
the fissures between rocks, and between the plants and the people,
that goes quickly. Come the end of August, Schuerch has found
himself climbing the ladder to peer down into the cistern three or
four times a day, the way a parent might check that a sleeping
child is still breathing.
</P>
<P>
   But the perfect, obvious solution to the classic
island-dweller's problem _ to transform sea water into fresh water
_ has been shrugged off as a mirage for 3,000 years. Since the time
of Aristotle, who proposed condensing the vapor of sea water around
300 B.C., engineers and inventors have seized upon the elusive goal
of efficient desalination.
</P>
<P>
   Progress in the quest has come hand-in-hand with mounting
desperation. In the United States, new dams meet with resistance on
environmental and safety grounds. More serious pressure has come
from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East, where the prospect of
running out of water completely has made control of aquifers
politically explosive. Great fortunes have been enlisted in the
development of cheaper technology, bringing the cost down by a
factor of 10 in the last 20 years, according to Ionics, a
Watertown-based desalination giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of desalination has been slowly dropping and the cost
of fresh water has been rising. In some parts of the world, these
two lines crossed years ago, and in others they haven't crossed
yet,'' said Jim Birkett, an international desalination expert who
lives in the coastal community of Nobleboro, Maine. ``They seem to
have crossed on MacMahan Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the end of water anxiety will change life on this
mile-long island, where the candy store still operates on the honor
system and any change at all is viewed with some suspicion. Every
year, as August turned into September, Schuerch's already estimable
powers over the island's 150 summer residents _ ``I have to be the
arbitrator, I have to be the harbormaster, I have to be
omnipotent,'' he said _ became tyrannical with regard to water, to
the point, once, of cutting off the supply in the middle of a
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time when the burden on island wells is highest. If
the level of fresh water falls too low, the well can ``salt out,''
drawing up salt water from below the fresh water and contaminating
the well's supply, perhaps permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to take a chance, because once you've lost it,
you don't get it back,'' Schuerch said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The islanders' ritual husbanding worked until last year, when
the Maine Department of Environmental Protection ruled that they
could no longer flush their toilets with salt water and release the
sewage in the ocean. That sent island authorities scrambling for
additional fresh water: Collecting rainwater through roof
catchments was out, because MacMahan is too thickly wooded. Adding
to the island's two existing wells _ cut 300 and 400 feet straight
into bedrock _ would have been prohibitively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   So Schuerch returned to the idea of desalination, which had been
dismissed again and again, over the years, not only on MacMahan
Island but all through this archipelago. On Vinalhaven, Lessard
said, the running joke was that ``only Kuwait can afford
desalination.'' But his research turned up costs far lower than
expected. Islanders split the cost of installing a $50,000
``reverse osmosis'' unit, a model popular on Caribbean islands and
cruise ships manufactured by the Florida-based Matrix Desalination,
Inc. The yearly electrical cost is $200, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly but surely, authorities on coastal and island communities
are beginning to take notice, and some predict that desalination
could ease one of the chronic scarcities of life along the Maine
coast. A small number of communities in the Northeast have shown a
similar interest _ Cape May, N.J., installed a reverse osmosis unit
like MacMahan's last year, after local wells were contaminated by
seawater; engineers for the city of Brockton have spent years
lobbying to desalt water along the Taunton River.
</P>
<P>
   MacMahan is the first community in Maine to depend on seawater
for its water supply _ but, say observers, it is not likely to be
the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these things run, and run well, it's just going to change
the whole picture for development on islands, where most people
thought the limiting factor was the water supply,'' said Barry
Timson, a Hallowell geologist who has studied water supply on
Monhegan Island. ``Here's this theoretical supply, and it's less
than the present demand, so theroetically, there's room for more
development.''
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the problem. For the people who choose to live
on these rocky islands, the new fear of population growth could be
more threatening than the old fear of running out of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful what you wish for, because you just
might get it,'' said Susan Lessard, of Vinalhaven. ``In terms of
our island, it can't be a Nantucket, because it's not a sand
aquifer. It wouldn't have enough water to support that many
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerch worries about change himself, as he carries out the
duties of utilities commissioner, town planner and sole officer of
the law. Put many more than 150 people on this island, and you'd be
adding a new social phenomenon: the stranger. He'd rather that not
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot about that,'' Schuerch said. ``I think we're
good for this generation and one more.''

AT THIS RATE, GOMEZ IPO IS UP IN THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How does this rate?
</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisors Inc. made a name for itself on the Internet by
rating all kinds of services on the Web, first analyzing basic
financial offerings from banks and brokerages and later expanding
to a total of 37 consumer categories (perhaps you're interested in
the relative merits of cholesterol information on 11 competing
medical sites).
</P>
<P>
   Gomez doesn't hand out any ``incomplete'' ratings, but it might
have to do just that with its own initial public stock offering.
The IPO plan, first filed in late April, never made it to the
market but hasn't been scratched either.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of the Gomez deal getting off the ground in the spring
were stiff to begin with, faced from the start with a stock market
that had suddenly sobered up on Internet stocks. New deals were
dying left and right.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Gomez, the former Forrester Research Inc. analyst who runs
the Lincoln, Mass. company, declines to say much about what happens
next. He cites the company's still active, though now aged, IPO
registration statement, which legally limits his public comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to execute on our business plan to my
satisfaction,'' Gomez said. ``It's my responsibility as CEO to
access the market when it's right for the company.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no stroke of genius to guess Gomez is hoping the right time
turns out to be this fall.
</P>
<P>
   He would be standing in a long line of chief executives at
Internet-oriented companies who pulled IPO plans earlier this year
and are now looking for a second chance in the typically active
fall underwriting season. Some companies, like Zefer Corp. of
Boston, scrubbed their original plan and have recently refiled
registration documents for a second try.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side: Many of those companies may be running out of
chances to go public if they don't make it in the fall. Losses
burning through cash, venture investors anxious for an IPO or some
other ``liquidity event,'' and just plain lack of momentum threaten
to sap their organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully for Gomez, money would not seem to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Months before the company filed IPO plans, it raised $30 million
from a group of venture investors that include Softbank, BancBoston
Ventures, HarbourVest Partners, and the John Hancock Global
Technology Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly available financial information on Gomez is ancient
by now. But what exists suggests $30 million would go a long way.
</P>
<P>
   The company lost $13.5 million in the last nine months of 1999,
but about half were paper losses connected to stock transactions.
</P>
<P>
   At that rate, Gomez could stay afloat quite comfortably for a
long time. Following through on the big plans of springtime is
another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez was hoping to raise a lot of money with its original IPO
plan, perhaps as much as $60 million. But, despite all of the
visibility Gomez created for itself, the company generated only
$3.2 million in revenues over the last three quarters of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The days of raising $60 million for a company with $3 million of
revenues are over, unless it's working the telecommunications
business. Gomez is probably doing more business today, but IPO
expectations may be revised too.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, like other companies with postponed IPOs, also has to
face the opportunity cost of not raising tens of millions of
dollars when it had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gomez was first and remains the best-known Internet
rating service, it's hardly alone. Competition that could have been
faced more aggressively with IPO millions is broader and stronger
today, ranging from magazines ranking online stockbrokers to
full-service Internet consulting companies like Forrester and Giga
Information Group Inc. that offer their own products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are clearly the pioneer in this area and the leader in
terms of providing rankings,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Some competitors, like Steve Telleen at Giga, suspect Gomez has
focused less on ranking services for consumers in recent months and
has put more energy into targeting corporate consulting work.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the year, Gomez was earning about half of its
money from its consumer site and the other half from gomezpro.com,
aimed at e-commerce corporate clients. Gomez insists both legs of
his business remain important in similar proportion today.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez is firm about one other point, no matter what happens in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't going anywhere,'' he said.

 BIOTECH SHARES PROFITING FROM A HOT MARKET

<TEXT>
<P>
   Genome Therapeutics Corp., a Waltham, Mass. biotechnology
company seeking capital, recently decided to take advantage of a
sweet spot in the market by offering extra shares to investors.
</P>
<P>
   It hoped to shake loose $46 million, seemingly ambitious for a
company that had reported losses for three years running. But by
the time investors were done snatching up the extra shares last
month, the company had exceeded its target and more than doubled
its cash reserves.
</P>
<P>
   And Genome Therapeutics is not alone. After a brutal spring
sell-off in the high-tech sector, biotech shares have staged a
dramatic recovery, outpacing both the Nasdaq index and most
e-commerce companies. The boom has sent biotech companies rushing
to the market with intial public offerings. Others like Genome
Therapeutics have made secondary stock offerings, raising millions.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say investors are finally seeing the potential in a
sector long viewed warily, as a rising number of biotech products
reach the public and hundreds more enter the late stages of human
testing.
</P>
<P>
   The shift to profitability in some biotech companies, combined
with excitement generated by the June announcement that the human
genome had been decoded, has also fueled the new wave of investor
interest.
</P>
<P>
   People disillusioned by the lackluster performance of e-commerce
stocks in recent months have turned to biotech companies in search
of the next high-growth area. Institutional investors have pumped
money into the sector. Even day traders have jumped aboard.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 48 biotech companies have gone public
nationally and another 32 have made secondary stock offerings,
raising a record $12.2 billion, according to research by Richard
Peterson, an IPO expert at Thomson Financial Securities Data in
Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 48 IPOs, 16 have taken place already in August. Another
17 biotech companies are currently registered to make initial
public offerings at some time in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a different kind of market, these companies would have had
to raise money privately and wait for a window,'' said Gus Lawlor,
a partner at Health Care Ventures, a Cambridge, Mass. venture
capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   The biotech industry was the focus of speculative buying and
wild runups in stock valuations in the early 1990s. But a string of
disappointing drug trials and dwindling prospects for short-term
profits brought the boom to an end. Burned investors avoided the
sector for years.
</P>
<P>
   But by last year, many new biotech products had reached the
market, including treatments for rheumatoid arthritis,
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and breast cancer. They'd also diversified
their business lines, reducing risk. Investors slowly started
moving back into the sector.
</P>
<P>
   And what began as a steady growth in investor interest has now
turned into a full-scale rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, the outlook is extremely good right now,'' said David
Carlson, comanager of the Putnam Health Sciences Trust. ``But
biotech companies have seen years when they couldn't raise capital.
They are taking the opportunity while it's there, because there's
always the potential that they'll go into a period like that
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Genome Therapeutics, which markets genetic data to drug makers,
registered to sell 3 million additional shares in mid-March. A week
earlier, its share price had reached a peak of $75, after trading
at only $3 a year ago. The company shelved its offering in April
when the Nasdaq index plunged and its share price dropped below
$14.
</P>
<P>
   When the biotech sector recovered in late June, Genome sold 1.5
million shares at an average price of $31.01 and raised $46.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   The cash infusion will allow the company to advance its
genome-based drug research and pursue new avenues to profitability,
said Richard D. Gill, its president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (capital) gives us a level of security and a level of
confidence to really build the company,'' Gill said.
</P>
<P>
   Variagenics Inc., a Cambridge company that studies how genetic
variations control drug responses, made its decision to go public
in part because the market was strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at a stage where it made sense to go public,'' said
Rick Shea, the company's chief financial officer. ``But if you look
at the biotech cycle over the last 20 years, there have been long
periods of time when financing wasn't available. Certainly, we
wanted to seize the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The company sold 5 million shares in early July, raising $70
million. The money will help cover the company's current ``burn
rate'' of $1 million a month and give it the flexibility to invest
in new technologies, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Variagenics' shares jumped nearly 100 percent within days of the
offering. It has given back some of that value in the past month
but is still up 80 percent from its offering price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing is everything,'' said Dennis Shaughnessy, senior vice
president of Charles River Laboratories Holdings Inc., a
Wilmington, Mass. firm that has supplied mice, rats and research
tools to labs for more than 50 years and went public in June.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, when the company spun itself out from Bausch &AMP;
Lomb Inc., it expected to wait two or three years before going
public. But it raised $224 million with its public offering to pay
down debt from the buyout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business was doing very well, and the market was
receptive,'' Shaughnessy said. ``Drug discovery is accelerating
rapidly, and people are beginning to recognize the value of a tools
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Bruker Daltonics Inc., a Billerica, Mass.
life sciences company, raised nearly $104 million in a public
offering. Gennaissance Pharmaceuticals Inc., a genome-based drug
company in New Haven, Conn., raised $78 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, The Medicines Company, a Cambridge, Mass.
biopharmaceutical company, raised $96 million. And this week,
another Cambridge biopharmaceutical company, Dyax Corp., raised $60
million.
</P>
<P>
   Although investors in biotech companies expect the sector to
continue its strong performance for the balance of the year and
beyond, they warned that it is still a risky area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong not to expect any ups and downs,'' said
Lawlor of Health Care Ventures. ``There's a lot of uncertainty
associated with drug discovery, and there are always going to be
some disappointments.''

 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN RHODE ISLAND EYE CITIZENSHIP 
</HEADLINE>

 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ It was a dirty little secret in this seaport
city. For years, illegal immigrants filled the restaurants and
hotels, working laborious jobs the locals didn't want. Everyone
knew but looked the other way: government officials, restaurant
owners, police.
</P>
<P>
   But last September, when a Newport police officer said an
illegal immigrant bit him during a scuffle, the issue exploded.
Newport police called the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
and the raids began.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, during two INS sweeps, agents arrested 10 people.
Three have since been deported. The cases of the others are still
pending.
</P>
<P>
   The effects reverberated throughout Newport, causing dozens of
undocumented workers to flee. But the raids had another effect, one
that few had imagined. Illegal immigrants came out of hiding,
risking arrest, and banded together to protest what they called
``selective enforcement'' by the INS. Without their help, the
immigrants say, Newport's economy would crumble.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, they're taking it a step further: pressuring
Congress to grant them amnesty. They seek a repeat of the 1986
congressional act that allowed 3.7 million illegal immigrants to
become US citizens. And their cause is gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, I would've thought it was impossible,'' said
Oscar Rodri guez, 32, a Guatemalan immigrant, one of the men
arrested during the raids. ``Now I think it's a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodri guez is one of the estimated 6 million workers without
documentation living in the United States. He has been in Newport
for 12 years, working night shifts in restaurants as a prep cook.
He and his wife, also Guatemalan, have raised two children here.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Rodri guez had shied away from joining political
organizations. Now, he's a member of the United for Justice
Committee, an organization of both documented and undocumented
Latinos whose focus is convincing Rhode Island's congressional
representatives and other influential people that amnesty makes
sense.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a difficult undertaking, one that politicians such as
Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed aren't quickly embracing. Another
general amnesty, Reed has said, would give a signal to would-be
immigrants around the world: Sneak in and we'll eventually accept
you.
</P>
<P>
   Rodri guez and scores of other illegal immigrants live tucked
away, in ramshackle apartment houses a short distance from the
mansions on Bellevue Avenue. Many work a morning shift in one
place, then walk a few cobblestone streets away to work a second
eight-hour shift elsewhere. They save their money, wads of cash,
and tuck it under their mattresses _ money they later wire back
home.
</P>
<P>
   The raids galvanized some of them to abandon their quiet
existence. Dozens of people like Rodri guez and his wife, Alba, say
they'd rather be out of the shadows even if that means risking
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   They belong to a coalition of organizations in Rhode Island that
has collected 6,000 signatures so far for a national petition that
will be sent to President Clinton, and they plan to join thousands
of other demonstrators from the East Coast at a rally Oct. 14 in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are changing people's minds,'' said Juan Garci a, 47, of
Guatemala, who holds a green card. ``People need to realize that
our economy is sustained by these immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, US Representative John Conyers Jr., a Michigan
Democrat, sponsored a bill that would allow illegal immigrants to
apply for permanent residence if they can prove they have been
working here since 1986. Other members of Congress have signed on _
most of them black and Latino.
</P>
<P>
   A counter-movement is lobbying against the immigrants, saying
it's dangerous policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes no sense for the US to grant amnesty,'' said Yeh
Ling-Ling, of the Diversity Alliance for a Sustainable America, a
California-based organization that favors decreased immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Ling-Ling said amnesty would result in further burdening of
public schools and social services programs, would take jobs away
from Americans, and would heighten ethnic tension.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, United for Justice Committee members continue to
push. Garci a says the US government owes it to immigrants from
Central America because the United States destabilized the economy
in countries such as El Salvador and Guatemala, by supporting
dictatorships and allowing US companies to exploit workers and pay
little in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But in Newport, a tourist city in the nation's smallest state,
if the illegal immigrants all left tomorrow, the restaurants
wouldn't survive, said David Quiroa, a US resident who emigrated
from Guatemala and works as a maitre d' at a swanky Newport
restaurant. He heads the United for Justice Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Although the INS won't estimate the number of undocumented
workers in Newport, Quiroa puts the tally at about 200. Various
organizations that work with immigrants give state estimates at
5,000 to 50,000 illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials say employers who need workers can bring
in those with special work visas. Restaurants and hotels may hire
illegal immigrants unknowingly, but often those people have fake
documents.
</P>
<P>
   If people want to enter the United States to work, officials
say, they should apply for visas. Rodri guez, the prep
cook-turned-activist, says he couldn't apply for a visa. When he
fled Guatemala because a guerrilla military group threatened to
kill him if he didn't join, he didn't have time to look into visa
programs, pay the fees, and wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, before I leave my apartment, I always look out of
the window to see if there's a police car or immigration
officers,'' Rodri guez said. ``I don't want to go back to my
country. There is nothing for me there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he doesn't want to bump into INS agents, he doesn't
plan to move or change jobs. The INS knows where he is and if they
come after him, he won't run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep working until the day immigration comes for
me. If they come for me, here they will find me,'' he said. ``In
the meantime, I'm going to do what I can to help my people.''

   YAJALON, MEXICO _ Pigs snorted in mud and a chilly rain soaked
the mountains outside as Nicolas Lopez described how armed men
staged a terrifying raid on his hamlet earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Firing weapons into the air, the invaders claimed rights to the
villagers' land, setting fire to five huts, chasing about 30
families into hiding, and looting what little corn and clothes the
peasants had, Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as he shivered at the memory, Lopez managed a smile. On
Sunday(8/20) the Mayan Indian will vote in a historic election for
the new governor of Chiapas, one of Mexico's most impoverished and
volatile states. And if pre-election opinion polls are accurate,
Mexico's 71-year-old ruling party is headed for another defeat
after being trounced in July 2's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting for a solution to our problems,'' said Lopez,
who will vote for Pablo Salazar, candidate of an opposition
alliance that could unseat Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party, the PRI, from a state considered a barometer of social
justice in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Chiapas is home to the Zapatista Indian rebels, who launched an
insurrection against the Mexican government here in January 1994
that still hasn't been resolved. Since that time, armed
paramilitary groups loyal to the ruling party have also evolved,
periodically attacking Zapatista sympathizers like Lopez's hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``All government ties to these paramilitary groups will end (if
the PRI loses). One way to dismantle these groups is to simply not
guarantee them impunity any longer,'' said a sweat-soaked Salazar,
pausing for an interview and quick lunch during one of his final
grueling all-day campaign swings along Chiapas' sweltering tropical
coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are fed up and want change. And change is contagious,''
he said, waving at a marimba band in a restaurant that played a
song as a tribute to the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But Chiapas is considered a bulwark state for the PRI, and its
candidate, Sami David, has counted on a sympathetic state media
establishment that, as usual, offered slavishly favorable coverage
to him. A cordial man who is warm one-on-one, David also touched a
traditionally conservative nerve here with a campaign warning that
a Salazar victory could provoke even more instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chiapas, an era of stability is at stake,'' David told a
recent gathering of PRI youth in the capital city of Tuxtla
Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the northern part of Chiapas is a checkerboard of Mayan
Indian villages divided between Zapatistas and PRI loyalists who
sporadically clash over land rights and political differences. The
collection of huts where Lopez lived _ nestled in rugged hills
above the city of Yajalon (pronounced, ``ya-ha-LONE'') _ was
eventually occupied by Mexican Army troops. But since the villagers
also fear the army, they refused to return.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox has sparked
hope for a peaceful resolution to the cycle of violence. Fox
ousted, for the first time in seven decades, the PRI, which the
Zapatistas blame for the squalid conditions the southern state's
Indians live in.
</P>
<P>
   Before the July 2 election, Subcommander Marcos, the primary
Zapatista spokesman, issued a statement reiterating the rebels'
position that they would negotiate again if a peace accord signed
in 1996 is implemented and federal troops are withdrawn from Indian
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is a promoter of free-market economic policies, which the
Zapatistas oppose, but he has pledged to revive negotiations with
the rebels and send Mexico's Congress the stalled 1996 accord that
grants sweeping Indian rights. If elected, Salazar could also set
an example that change can be forced at the ballot box rather than
at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Zapatista Army and for its commanders, things have
changed radically,'' Fox said Thursday. ``It's evident that in
Mexico there is now democracy. . . Now it's up to the command of
the Zapatistas. The rest of the actors, we are ready to dialogue
and find a resolution to the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said the Zapatistas can't dismiss electoral change. ``No
one, not even the most radical person in the country can dispute
the legitimacy of a Fox government.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent campaign stop in the gritty border town of Hidalgo
on the Guatemala border, supporters were enraptured with Salazar's
pledge to address the demands of the poor _ including the
Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Zapatistas said our fight is against being forgotten. They
said there is a worse death than dying from diarrhea or from
curable diseases,'' the candidate shouted from the stage to wild
cheers. ``There is a worse death, say our Indian brothers, and that
is the death that comes from being forgotten. Well, you people are
about to do something about that painful reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar is a federal senator and former member of the PRI, which
he says used to be the only option available to someone who wanted
to get into political office. But he left the party in May 1999
after a long string of disputes over the government's handling of
the Chiapas conflict.
</P>
<P>
   He is unaffiliated now, but is representing a four-party
alliance that includes Fox's conservative National Action Party, or
PAN, and the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, the PRD. The two
parties clash ideologically, but for the purpose of defeating the
PRI in Chiapas they pooled their funds and worked hand-in-hand for
Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   An exhausted-looking David said he isn't giving up, and he
dismisses polls like one conducted by Reforma newspapers, which
gave Salazar a 9-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chiapas, the conditions to avoid confrontations or even
social collapse are being constructed with great difficulty,'' he
said an interview with Cox Newspapers. He had a badly bruised and
swollen ear, the result of an injury when someone threw a metal
weight at him in Salazar's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a platform for electoral reform,'' he insisted. ``The
offers for change have to be based on clarity and not on
deception.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida, won in
Chiapas last month. But Salazar is counting on the combined votes
of the PAN and the PRD to carry him to victory. His campaign
posters say, ``the PRI has already lost in Chiapas, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's victory could also inspire PRI desertion.
</P>
<P>
   Among some of Chiapas' poor peasant farmers, Fox is now seen as
Mexico's new ``tlatoani,'' the Aztec word for ``maximum leader,''
Salazar campaign aide Mauricio Gandara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that the 'Papa PRI' has died now. So they are
wondering who will be managing the money and resources. They are
thinking that now there is a 'Papa Fox,''' Gandara said. ``This is
the product of 71 years of domination by one party.''
</P>
<P>
   Araceli Burguete, a Chiapas sociologist, said the PRI still
controls many Indians in the state. It will probably be business as
usual in Indian towns where the local PRI leader habitually orders
residents how to vote, she said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But even in PRI strongholds, some residents appeared to be
bracing for change.
</P>
<P>
   Chenalho is an Indian town that produced at least one of the
convicted killers implicated in the infamous December 1997 massacre
of 45 people in the pro-Zapatista village of Acteal, just minutes
away.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Jimenez, 82, said he would listen to the advice of
village leaders, but wasn't sure who he'd vote for. He pulled
dismissively at a PRI T-shirt he was wearing and said almost
apologetically, ``This is five years old now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Luis Ortiz, a resident who has joined the movement to
deploy thousands of election observers here, complained that the
PRI had donated a Ford truck to the town ``in exchange for votes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Acteal, the site of the massacre, affiliates of the Zapatista
Army said they didn't plan to vote and declined to speak further.
Rebel leaders have been silent, other than to say they won't call
for a general boycott of the election.
</P>
<P>
   Those in Acteal who sympathize with the rebels but don't belong
to the army will cast ballots for Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Salazar doesn't win, we will think there has been fraud,''
said Spanish-speaking spokesman Agustin Vasquez. ``Acteal is
willing to vote for Salazar. The victims of the massacre are
waiting for justice and for change.''

THE GOOD DOCTOR
</HEADLINE>
  Drew Pinsky does his (hectic) part to make things right 
(For use after Mon., Aug, 21, 2000 by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most frequently paraphrased portion of the Hippocratic oath
is a three-word phrase that runs like a broken record through the
multifaceted career of Dr. Drew Pinsky: ``Do no harm.'' Pinsky
follows it; so do the people who work for him.
</P>
<P>
   Counseling drug addicts at a chemical dependency unit _ do no
harm. Talking to lonely teens on the radio during the wee hours _
do no harm. Starting a Web site, distributing condoms to promote
responsible sexual behavior, interviewing celebrities, serving as a
medical commentator for the voyeuristic CBS TV show ``Big Brother''
_ do no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Pinsky, in fact, describes his approach to ``Big Brother'' in
much the same way as he would characterize any new venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It's) another opportunity to make something useful,'' says
Pinsky. ``It's kind of like walking onto a battlefield: `Well, OK,
I'll just dig in and try to help wherever I can.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound maudlin. When the day is done, I hope
what I do really is useful. I hope it's not misinterpreted. I hope
it does no harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't it follow that the physician who does no harm is also
expected to do some good?
</P>
<P>
   The people who have followed Dr. Pinsky's career say the answer
is an overwhelming ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When people meet him, they immediately comment on how genuine
and real the guy is,'' says Curtis Giesen, who is CEO of Pinsky's
interactive Web site, www.drDrew.com, and who has been a close
friend of Pinsky since junior high school. ``The mantra here is `do
good.' Drew has us all saying that. We don't do anything that veers
from that.''
</P>
<P>
   ---With that philosophy in mind, ``Big Brother'' could have been
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   A show that puts 10 people in close quarters to be watched
constantly by cameras, he says, could potentially cause damage to
the participants. Pinsky, who was initially approached to host the
program, said he struggled with the ethics for a long time before
signing on as a weekly behavior commentator.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't met the housemates, all of whom are monitored by a
team of psychologists. Pinsky's role is simply to comment on what
he _ and the rest of the world _ observes six nights a week on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Does Pinsky, who advises ``Loveline'' listeners based on
information gleaned in a 30-second radio call, feel like he knows
Cassandra, Jamie, George and the gang?
</P>
<P>
   It's a loaded question, says Pinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job of looking at what they're doing is based on inaccurate
information,'' he says. ``They are not asking me to be their
doctor. They are not expressing in any detail what their feelings
are or what their internal dynamics are based on. All we have is
the behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lots of little theories. But there are so many sources
of artifice _ the money, the constant cameras, the way they are
thrown together _ that it's treacherous to make assumptions about
the behavior you're seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   He credits the producers of ``Big Brother'' with their direction
to keep his insights focused on behavior. Better TV, he
acknowledges, would be for Pinsky to unleash potentially
embarrassing personal insights about the contestants.
</P>
<P>
   But to do so would not be Pinsky. And, thankfully he says, it's
not his directive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The producers and I agree: don't hurt them,'' Pinsky says. ``I
don't think anybody has been harmed by the experience so far. Maybe
some of the people have grown a little bit and learned
something.'' &QL; 
---Just in case anybody is keeping count, his ``Big Brother''
engagement is probably Extracurricular Activity No. 75 for Pinsky.
If it often seems like the man is everywhere, that's because he is:
from home, where he cooks his children breakfast and takes them to
school, to a private practice office in Pasadena, to the chemical
dependency unit he runs at Las Encinas Hospital, to the offices of
his Web site, which was launched in October. Afternoons are often
left open for media-related meetings or interviews. Then it's back
to the hospital. Most days he tries to be home by 5 p.m. for time
with his family. The nights are for ``Loveline.''
</P>
<P>
   Sleep, says Pinsky _ only half jokingly _ is an inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   So is illness. And on a recent Thursday morning, it's the doctor
who is not well.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular Thursday morning, Pinsky's day is typically
packed. His schedule includes seeing patients at his office, rounds
at Las Encinas and a round with Conway and Steckler on KLSX-FM
(97.1). The previous evening he and ``Big Brother'' host Julie Chen
rehashed the banishment of former stripper Jordan from the ``Big
Brother'' house. Pinsky's take: Jordan created the type of tension
that the house's inhabitants _ and the voting television audience _
seemed anxious to get rid of.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are watching are making it a healthier
environment,'' says Pinsky. ``They're kicking the negative
influences out of the house which, I gather, didn't happen in
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Big Brother'' lab rats may be getting healthier. But
today, Pinsky says, he feels awful.
</P>
<P>
   Battling a lingering case of bronchitis, Pinsky tells everyone
he encounters how lousy he's feeling _ more by way of apologizing
for not being at the top of his game than by complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Pinsky was sick or well, the casual observer wouldn't
notice anything amiss. Neither would a listener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him walk in, and he's exhausted,'' says Ann Ingold,
producer of ``Loveline.'' ``His pager is going off; the hospital is
calling. But the minute he's on the air, he's 100 percent focused.
To be able to pull that off night after night _ he's an amazing
man.''
</P>
<P>
   On Conway and Steckler, Pinsky counsels, banters, reassures and
holds forth. People are calling in to ask questions of the
celebrated guest: ``When should you worry about a friend's
addiction?'' ``Does this morning-after pill really work?'' ``What
about my boyfriend?''
</P>
<P>
   Pinsky checks his pager during station breaks. Meetings are
scheduled, canceled and rescheduled, forcing him to cut out early
and have the drDrew.com agenda shuffled.
</P>
<P>
   The Ping-Ponging doesn't phase Pinsky, although he could
certainly do without the illness. There was a once a time when
Pinsky had fewer commitments yet worked !ital!more hours than he
does now. Weekend work and 16-hour days were common.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've structured my life in terms of back-ups,'' says Pinsky.
``When I was practicing full time, I used to insist on being `the
guy.' Now I have structure along with staff.''
</P>
<P>
   The one event that can't be rescheduled is the one Pinsky badly
wants to attend: the final little league game of the season for his
7-year-old triplets.
</P>
<P>
   And attend he does, although he practically falls asleep in the
bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife knows I love my work. Her concern is just that I don't
get so caught up that I'm not paying attention, to create more
structure in my day, so I have adequate time with her and the
kids,'' Pinsky says. ``As much time as I can possibly give them,
I'll give them. That's got to be Priority No. 1. If I screw that
up, there is no excuse.'' &QL; 
---Seventeen years ago, Drew Pinsky, a medical student at USC _
after getting his undergraduate degree at Amherst _ simply thought
he was performing community service. At the urging of friends, he
got on the radio at a fledgling Pasadena radio station, KROQ, and
started fielding questions from primarily teen-age callers. The
subject: usually sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it was, the middle of the night on a Sunday, and I had an
epiphany,'' recalls Pinsky. ``I was 24 years old, the kids were 17
and I put it in a historical context. In the early '80s,
adolescents weren't having sex as far as the world was concerned. I
thought, `Boy, somebody should just sit down and answer their
questions. This body of information is not that complicated.
Somebody should just tell them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For 10 years, working unpaid, radio's Dr. Drew did just that.
Eventually, Pinsky started getting $25 per show. When Pinsky and
his wife, Susan, were starting their family, he negotiated a
contract. If he was going to be spending these kinds of hours away
from home, it could no longer be on a volunteer basis. Already an
internist _ with an M.D. from USC School of Medicine _ he became a
specialist in addiction as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still resisted the idea that I was on radio,'' says Pinsky,
who used the Dr. Drew title as a way of partially shielding his
identity. ``I wasn't one to step out of line. There was all this
sort of unpleasant pressure from my peers and superiors over the
years not to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then suddenly it went from `Don't do it' to `Oh, my God, this
is a great thing. How about if I do it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Agreed Dr. Joseph Haraszti, medical director of Las Encinas:
``There was a lot of controversy when he was first going on TV, and
people didn't want him to do it. I gave him a strong endorsement.
It's a tremendous community service, a responsible and sober
approach to sex education and relationship education to teens. Kids
listen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, whether Pinsky is taking questions at university campuses
or in cyberspace at drDrew.com, he is still the wise straight man _
the guy with all the answers who takes a few shots simply because
he is sometimes less hip or funny than whoever happens to be
sharing the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, that's ``Loveline's'' sardonic co-host, Adam
Carolla, who admits, ``His lack of a sense of humor mixed with his
low self-esteem makes him easy prey. If everyone was like Drew, we
would all be living in a very boring utopia.''
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, Carolla means that as a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew is Drew is Drew, through and through. What you see is
what you get with him.'' &QL; 
---Pinsky would like to turn the microphone around. Politically
neutral though he claims to be, he wants to interview presidential
candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have particularly strong feelings for either of those
guys,'' he says. ``I just want to see them address what's really
going on with the people who need help in this country. I'd like to
ask them the tough questions and see how they respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities, he says, have been very open during interviews for
drDrew.com and for the live show Pinsky conducts for the Web site
from a Pasadena studio. Part of it, he says, stems from a
willingness to talk about themselves openly and honestly. Part of
it is the questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of my training, because of the interviewing I do in
clinical practice, I can do the kind of interview that nobody else
in the media can do,'' Pinsky says. ``I can get to more
substantial, real material in two to three questions than anyone
else in the media.''
</P>
<P>
   He has answered more than an hour's worth of questions. Another
appointment beckons. Pinsky isn't asked to sum up his philosophy or
his career, but he does so anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And the self-reflection makes him sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there's no blueprint for what I do, it's risky all the
time, and acknowledging that, taking the risk, you get used to it,
but it's not me. It's a painful place to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really just want to do something worthwhile and interesting
along the way.'' &QL;

   The quotable Richard Karn on matters of home improvement:
</P>
<P>
   On tiles: ``Don't ever put fake tile next to real tile. Don't
ever make that comparison because there's no comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   On finding a contractor: ``If you have friends who did something
reasonably on time and for what the bid was, start there. When you
get something bid out, you're going to see somebody who bids it at
$1,000 and you're going to see somebody who bids it at $10,000, and
the guy who bids $1,000 is not necessarily the guy to go with
because he's not going to tell you about all the little things that
are going to pop up.''
</P>
<P>
   On what you're up against: ``The person who owned the house
before you or the person who owned it before the person you bought
it from _ nobody plays by the rules. Nobody built it right. So you
end up having to do it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   On the marriage/remodeling partnership: ``You could be married
one year to 15 years and all of a sudden you're remodeling, and you
go, `Yeah, well I think we should do this.' 'Really? I thought you
would say we should do this.' 'No, I don't like that.' 'Well I do.'
All of a sudden, everybody has a very different sense of style deep
inside that doesn't really get pulled out until you're feathering
your nest.''

THE ACCIDENTAL HANDYMAN
</HEADLINE>
  Richard Karn no professional, but he played one on TV 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: With sidebar, `Tools of the Trade') 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Karn is sitting in a Studio City coffee shop talking
about the house he recently bought in Big Bear _ and the summer
legacy he hopes the house will start for his 7-year-old son,
Cooper. And he's telling me the place is a 3/4-acre lot with a big
back yard.
</P>
<P>
   The place is ``perfectly fine,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And I do not, for one second, believe him.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, this is not an easy person to doubt. Karn is, after
all, the man who spent eight years playing steady Al Borland on
``Home Improvement,'' the nice guy handyman's handyman, the guy who
would pull back and urge caution whenever Tim ``The Tool Man''
Taylor (a k a series star Tim Allen) would concoct some
hair-brained scheme to rip out another wall or amp up an already
lethal electric chainsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Karn is the guy whose friendly, bearded face has launched a
thousand real-life endorsements, from wares at Orchard Supply
Hardware to beard trimmers, rechargeable battery recycling and the
Internet Tool Box. The man once scored the second highest Q rating
_ which measures a performer's recognizability and likability
quotient _ of any actor on primetime TV (Allen was No. 1). My God,
if you can't trust Richard ``Al Borland'' Karn, whom can you trust?
</P>
<P>
   ``That character is him, in many ways,'' says Ralph Millard,
executive vice president of the Rechargeable Battery Recycling
Corporation, for which Karn is a spokesperson. ``He comes across as
very genuine in his speech and his actions, and he's got a certain
believability of character.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, when Richard Karn tells you his newly purchased house
is ``pretty much fine,'' you sense the man is itching _ if not to
pull out his own tool box _ then certainly to find the home's blue
prints, make a few well-placed calls and get busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My inner idea of a summer cabin is more like a log cabin,''
says Karn, 44. ``So now, I'm thinking like I did in my book when my
dad said, `Why replace the windows? They're perfectly fine.' I'm
figuring, `Why replace the house? It's perfectly fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's an Al Borland way of thinking. Richard Karn, on the
other hand, might have a different approach when it comes to
improving a homestead.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``House Broken: How I Remodeled My Home for Just
Under Three Times the Original Bid'' (Harper Collins; $23), trusty,
affable Richard Karn puts a seriocomic ``Money Pit''-like spin on
the full-scale overhaul he and his wife did to their Studio City
home in 1996. It's as close as one will get to a blurring of the
lines between Karn and his ``Al-ter'' ego: the actor who plays a
handyman remodeling his house _ with the help of professionals _
and then writing a book about the experience.
</P>
<P>
   A Seattle native, Karn's an actor first, lastut the experience.
</P>
<P>
   A Seattle native, Karn's an actor first, last and always. He
worked in professional theater before a couple of breaks landed him
the ``Home Improvement'' gig. But his tool-savvy signature role
isn't entirely fabricated. If Karn comes across as being more than
a little bit handy, you might say there's spackle in his DNA.
Karn's father, grandfather and great-grandfather were all
carpenters. He never gave family trade serious consideration.
(``That was something my dad did. I didn't seem to excel at it,''
he says.) And while tool proficiency wasn't a prerequisite for
landing the role of Al Borland, Karn admits that ``I know how to
play these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers apparently thought so as well. Focus group studies
would always reveal Al Borland as being the kind of guy you could
trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be getting these calls from all sorts of people. I
think there was a sense that Al knew what he was doing, and that he
was good at it,'' Karn says. ``The home improvement industry is
huge. If you've ever been to the hardware show in Chicago, it's
like there are so many millions of dollars going into that
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   When tackling his own house, Karn was anything but hands-off. He
didn't exactly hammer in nails or pour cement, but he and his wife,
Tudi Roche, knew exactly what they wanted. When the project grew
from simply redoing two rooms to performing nearly $300,000 worth
of remodeling, it was Karn _ still playing cautious Al as a day job
_ who OK'd the change orders and wrote the checks. Each experience,
he later discovered, became a chapter in his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd come back with stories,'' Karn says. ``Tim was going
through the same thing. (``Home Improvement'' co-star Patricia
Richardson) was going through the same thing as well. They were all
building their own homes or remodeling, especially after the
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Tim is who he is, his stories are a lot funnier. Maybe
it's just the way he tells it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that could be Karn or Al Borland talking. Both are
unfailingly modest.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the author isn't giving himself enough credit.
``House Broken,'' co-written with George Mair, is both funny and
wise. In addition to the anecdotes _ a few of which make Karn look
a little bit foolish _ there's good advice to homeowners both on
home buying and remodeling: what the language means, the mistakes
you'll make and the ones you might avoid. The book is also laced
with anecdotes about historic building goofs (plumbing problems in
the Pentagon, why that tower in Pisa leans).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Karn's beautiful house came with a price. In the
course of their odyssey, the Karns did everything from stripping
their roof and replacing gas lines to rebuilding a wine rack and
replacing kitchen cabinet knob handles. After a year and a half of
work and 101 change orders, they ended up with a home that, one
suspects is better than ``perfectly fine.''
</P>
<P>
   And it all began with windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first domino, just going `dink,''' Karn says. ``You've
got 78 styles of windows, and you're going, `Well, I should just
change those out.' So once that fatal decision is made, while the
windows are out the contractor says, `Well, you're going to see the
patchwork.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So the stucco comes off and instead of putting the fake tile,
we can shoal up the walls, make it stronger, and use real tile.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it just kept going. One thing leads to the next.
There would be a dark wall. Now all of a sudden the curtains don't
match the throw rug.''
</P>
<P>
   In person, Karn is slightly shorter than he appears on TV. His
beard, which he shaved for an upcoming episode of the American
Movie Classics' ``The Lot,'' is back and, no, he's not wearing the
Al Borland signature flannel shirt.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Lot,'' the shorn Karn takes on a Fargo-esque accent to
play a representative from the Legion of Decency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a really interesting thing hiring him,'' says show
executive producer Rick Mitz. ``I only know him one way _ he's the
straight man on 'Home Improvement' and the guy who sells tools on
commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   But that changed, Mitz says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him _ and I'm sure it drives him crazy _ `Hey,
you're really funny,''' Mitz says. ``I think he gets pigeon-holed
into the best friend roles. But he really is funny.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been two years since ``Home Improvement'' called it quits
and four years since he completed his real-life ``misadventures in
home improvement.'' In addition to appearing in a TV movie ``The
Pooch &AMP; the Pauper,'' Karn has traveled, worked on his golf game
and appeared at a couple of charity events. A spokesman for the
Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation, Karn helped
rehabilitate a house for Habitat for Humanity last April in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after ``Home Improvement'' ended, Karn had the
opportunity to appear in a Broadway play, but the process of
uprooting his family for a temporary move back east wasn't in the
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Television seems to present a more friendly work schedule to a
man who claims to be fully in the family mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I don't have this overall plan of how to move my
career. It just kind of happens.'' Karn says. ``On stage, it's
going to take you every night of the week. And you know, we're just
starting (reading) `Harry Potter.' That's my evening theater right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the Karn family handyman legacy seem to be in any
danger of dying out. After a visit to the Wild Wild West stunt show
at Universal Studios, young Cooper Karn has decided that, like his
father, he too wants to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's putting on a stunt show in the back yard, and he's cast
all the kids in his class,'' Karn says. ``So we're needing to build
breakaway walls and all sorts of things that he's outlined and
blue-printed.'' &QL;

&HT;     COACH DAVE COWENS IS ON A ROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RAY RATTO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Danny Fortson and Adam Keefe showed up 45
minutes late to their first press conference as Golden State
Warriors, leaving a body to wonder if, with true Warrior luck, they
had both signed their contracts and then flunked their physicals.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they signed, they passed, and then they spoke
cheerfully of being Warriors, which is news in and of itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, when was the last free agent who chose to come here?''
general manager Garry St. Jean asked. ``Mark Price?''
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, when was the last impact free agent to come to
Oakland willingly? ``I don't know that one off the top of my
head,'' said St. Jean, whose top of the head is considerable.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Fortson and Keefe came as part of a four-team deal with
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, Utah and Boston, but Fortson was a sign-and-trade. Which
is about as close to an actual big-deal free agent as the Warriors
have come in quite a good while.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the talk of Fortson and how he averaged 17 points
and 15 rebounds every time he played 35 minutes in a game, the most
enthusiasm in the room could be found coming out of the slightly
upturned mouth of head coach Dave Cowens, who might actually be the
answer to that free agent question of a paragraph ago.
</P>
<P>
   He was energized while discussing how Fortson would fit into the
</P>
<P>
   Warriors' first discernible master plan in six years. Fortson
would play power forward, he would get rebounds, and he would help
the Warriors run.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's an interesting notion. The Warriors running. They
</P>
<P>
   haven't bothered with that for years now, staying in touch with
the current NBA trend of reducing games to the minimum number of
possessions and the most exhaustive use of the 24-second clock.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors haven't even averaged 90 points a game since 1997,
</P>
<P>
   which you would think would be the absolute minimum standard for
an NBA team. It would also explain in part why the Warriors haven't
met the minimum standard for wins in a while, either.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Cowens is trying to construct a team that is not
only
</P>
<P>
   physically but emotionally committed to pushing the ball forward
and seeking the first best shot, as opposed to the first best
three-point shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take Dennis Rodman,'' he said, deftly avoiding the
Youngman-esque punch line, ``Please.'' ``He got the rebound, he got
the ball to the point guard, he ran down the floor, he got
underneath the basket, and then he got another rebound. You can't
run a play better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no, unless you make that first shot so you don't need
Rodman
</P>
<P>
   to get that offensive rebound. The message, though, was clear.
Cowens sees too much waste in the typical NBA game, and way too
much in the typical Warrior game.
</P>
<P>
   He wants 12 more possessions out of the Warriors every game. He
</P>
<P>
   wants to get a lot closer to 100 points a game. He wants, in
short, for the Warriors to be relevant again, to have a discernible
and watchable style. One that reminds him of his own glory days
with the Boston Celtics, when the best team in the league scored
nearly 120 points a game and the worst averaged 102.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, Fortson to be the power forward Antawn Jamison seems
reluctant to be. Hence, Keefe, who knows the running game so well
from his years in Utah that Cowens describes his knowledge as
``cellular.'' Hence, Jamison and guard Larry Hughes to help force
the tempo Fortson could spark.
</P>
<P>
   This, on top of the other changes in Golden State's dramatis
</P>
<P>
   personae, to the point where the Warrior with the longest tenure
on the team is Adonal Foyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, when you win 19 games, you're going to make a lot of
changes,'' Cowens said. ``Now, I don't know if there's ever been a
five-way trade, but we've done a lot to try and get the kind of
team we want to build here. And we're not done. We're just done for
now.''
</P>
<P>
   How good a team they have built remains to be seen, but the safe
</P>
<P>
   betting is that they may have taken themselves from 19 to, say,
27 wins. Fortson is not Tim Duncan, after all, just an earnest and
talented power forward who can make an impact on a team that hasn't
made one since the Republicans took Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It is at least a decent guess to say that these new, presumably
</P>
<P>
   faster Warriors won't win only 19 again. When asked, Cowens
says, ``Damn right!'' but the history says ``pretty damn right.''
Only six teams since the season expanded to 82 games in 1967 have
failed to win 20 games in successive seasons, and only the '87
Clippers and 93 Mavericks managed it without the excuse of
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors have gone 19-63 in each of the last two regulation
</P>
<P>
   seasons (they went 21-29 in the strike-ravaged 1999 schedule),
so Cowens better say, ``Damn right!'' More to the immediate point,
though, he'd better say that these Warriors will at least exceed
the boredom threshold. That alone would be a significant
improvement, enough perhaps to inspire other crypto-free agents to
consider Golden State as something more than a port of last resort.

&HT;     A STRONGER CAL FOOTBALL TEAM TAKES SHAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE ADAMS  
 &HT;    c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Turlock, Calif. - When Cal football training camp opened last
year, wide receivers dropped the ball left and right from day No.
1.
</P>
<P>
   This year, after day No. 1, quarterback Kyle Boller's passes
appear to be in surer hands.
</P>
<P>
   While it's much too early to say Air Cal is flying again, the
signs were encouraging Thursday, especially since last year's
ominous opening-day drops continued throughout the season as the
Bears finished dead last in the Pac-10 in passing.
</P>
<P>
   The difference has been apparent in spring practice, in workouts
over the summer and on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That's mostly because coach Tom Holmoe brought in three junior
college transfers last spring as the Bears receiving corps thinned.
Holmoe is cautious in assessing the impact of the newcomers.
``They're in the mix,'' he said. ``We have no starters. We're going
to go through this camp and determine who our starters are,
probably in the next six to seven days.''
</P>
<P>
   He can't be blamed for appearing reluctant to overly laud the
three transfers. Two years ago at Turlock, Holmoe greeted an
incoming class of coveted wide receivers _ a group called the Fab
Five.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ainsworth, last year's leading receiver and the only
player consistently able to handle Boller's bullets, flunked out of
school last spring. So did the team's No. 2 receiver, Ronnie
Davenport. Omar Bennett was academically ineligible last year and
attended a junior college to make up credits. Eddie Macha left
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Brian White is the only member of the Fab Five still with the
team, and he's off the depth chart as camp opens. Sean Currin, a
former walk-on, will contend for a starting spot this year. Still,
most eyes are on the transfers _ Charon Arnold, Chad Heydorff and
Derek Swafford.
</P>
<P>
   New wide receivers coach Ken Margerum is as cautious as Holmoe.
``I don't think we have any guys who are going to be All
Americans,'' he said. ``We have guys who can be consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Margerum is optimistic. ``I'm confident they'll line up
properly, move the chains and surprise people with their
craftiness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Center Reed Diehl says the new additions will give the Bears a
more potent air attack. ``I'm confident they can win in one-on-one
coverage,'' he said. ``We saw one-on-one coverage 60 percent of the
time last year because defenses didn't respect our wide
receivers,'' he added. ``But these guys can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Holmoe nor Margerum are ready to single out any player.
But players aren't so reluctant, and Heydorff has been attracting
the most attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some summer games he made some catches that were
phenomenal,'' Boller said.
</P>
<P>
   Heydorff, a transfer from Glendale Community College, said he
had an agenda in coming to Cal. ``The opportunity was great as far
as getting on the field and making a difference,'' he said.
Heydorff and the other receivers spent much of the summer in
Berkeley
</P>
<P>
   working with Boller, who last year often lacked touch on the
ball and wasn't helped by receivers who ran the wrong routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's worked on his skills, he's perfected them,'' Heydorff
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I can keep up my end.''

FROM CLASSIC CLINTON TO BOFFO BRADLEY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BILL THOMPSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Random comments on speakers at the Democrats' convention:
</P>
<P>
   BILL CLINTON: You don't have to be a Slick Willie fan to be
awestruck by the president's ability to beguile his listeners when
he delivers a speech.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton isn't a great orator in the classic sense. He rarely
indulges in soaring rhetoric driven by elegant language or
sophisticated symbolism. As often as not, his speeches are mostly
laundry lists of accomplishments and/or policy proposals. Usually,
they're way too long.
</P>
<P>
   But he never fails to cast a spell, to leave his audience
begging for more. It's hard to explain, but maybe the old saying
about the art of acting provides a clue to Clinton's appeal: Acting
is 90 percent sincerity; if you can fake that, you've got it made.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: The first lady/New York Senate
candidate, on the other hand, can't even do a good imitation of
sincerity. Everything she says seems contrived, forced, calculated.
If her convention speech exemplified her campaign style, I'm
guessing that Republican Rick Lazio, not Hillary Clinton, will be
the next U.S. senator from New York.
</P>
<P>
   TEDDY KENNEDY: The senator from Massachusetts has never suffered
from a lack of sincerity, but he has suffered plenty from the
passage of time. I remember standing on the convention floor at New
York's Madison Square Garden in 1980 when Kennedy delivered what
was perhaps the greatest political speech I'd ever heard. Maybe you
saw the excerpt that kept popping up on television the other night:
``The work goes on ... the cause endures ... the dream will never
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's 2000 convention speech, sad to say, fell considerably
short of his long-ago New York performance. He stumbled and fumbled
his way through some partisan propaganda about health care and
reminisced about his brothers, but it was painfully obvious that he
no longer has anything to say _ or the skill to say it. Too bad.
</P>
<P>
   CAROLINE KENNEDY SCHLOSSBERG: If it was an elegant Kennedy you
wanted to see _ if your heart craved a reminder of Camelot _ you
could find it in a rare public appearance by JFK's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline is not a polished speechifier, which made her remarks
all the more compelling. And if other speakers' sincerity was in
doubt, hers most definitely was not. She admires Democratic
presidential nominee Al Gore and clearly dragged herself into the
spotlight in hopes of boosting his campaign. Schlossberg exuded
enough class to make the convention's ``liberal night'' program
seem like a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   BILL BRADLEY: Bill Bradley? Is he the guy who ran against Gore
in the Democratic primaries?
</P>
<P>
   Yep. Same guy. If his Tuesday night speech wasn't the best he's
ever given, it surely had to be in the top two or three. It brought
to mind a delegate's comment that night in 1980 when Ted Kennedy
ended his unsuccessful campaign against Jimmy Carter. ``If he'd
talked like that six months ago,'' the delegate said after
Kennedy's spectacular speech, ``he'd have won the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bradley had talked six months ago like he did this week, he
still wouldn't have won the nomination _ but he might have given
Gore a run for his money.
</P>
<P>
   JESSE JACKSON: When you've heard one carnival barker, you've
heard 'em all.
</P>
<P>
   HAROLD FORD JR.: Keep an eye on this 30-year-old congressman
from Tennessee. Ford could very well turn out to be the next big
deal in the Democratic Party. He has charisma. He has ideas. He
even has a sense of restraint: His convention keynote speech was
less than 13 minutes long.
</P>
<P>
   JOE LIEBERMAN: The vice presidential candidate's speech was
excellent, especially if you like cheap-shot partisanship delivered
in a style so low-key and amiable that the targets of his criticism
probably didn't know they were being attacked. Gore struck gold
when he put this guy on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   KARENNA GORE SCHIFF: Al Gore loves his daughter. His daughter
loves him. What the heck. There's always room at the podium for
someone as adorable as Karenna.
</P>
<P>
   AL GORE: Check back with me later.

GETTING ATTACHED TO AN E-MAIL VIEWER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have downloaded an .Snp file on my PC.MDNM/
but cannot open it. It's an attachment to an e.MDNM/-mail. I have
tried to get the sender to help, but no one answers me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Voice in the Wilderness
</P>
<P>
   DEAR VOICE: I get that same treatment, too, although it's
usually after I start talking about the substantial raise I
deserve. I'm not greedy. I'm really not. I just want parity with
all the other columnists. I mean, let's face it, you don't see
Heloise rolling pennies at the end of the month just so she can buy
a few cans of Beanee Weenees.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry. I didn't answer your question, did I? I'm not trying
to avoid you, but this salary thing has me really torqued. It's not
like they could hire somebody off the street to do this, although
certain people will tell you that's exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, I'll try to keep focused. Just because somebody sends you
a file attachment doesn't mean you can open it. No matter what kind
of computer you have, you need the appropriate file viewer or
application to take a look at it, a fact that seems to escape most
people when they're glibly e.MDNM/-mailing their stuff back and
forth.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if some overpaid public relations person sends me a
news release in Word 2000 format attached to an e.MDNM/-mail, I
can't open it unless I sell a couple of pints of blood so I can
afford the upgrade from Word 95.
</P>
<P>
   It should be common courtesy on any e.MDNM/-mailer's part to
assume that a recipient may not have the ability to open an
attachment. Almost any word-processing document can be saved as
plain text and inserted into the body of a letter, but spreadsheets
and databases are different animals.
</P>
<P>
   You're dealing with an .Snp, which is a Microsoft Access
snapshot file, sort of a picture of the report the sender has
generated from his database. Luckily, Microsoft provides a free
viewer for these files, as well as for Word and Excel documents.
Just do a Yahoo! search for ``Microsoft snapshot viewer'' or
``Microsoft Word viewer'' or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   When you get to the download link, click on it. You should be
prompted to save it in a location of your choosing. I generally
save stuff to an empty folder, but that's up to you as long as you
can find the file later. When you do, double-click on it, and it
will install itself. It should also associate itself as the default
viewer for those files. That means you can just click on the
attachment from now on, and it will open automatically.
</P>
<P>
   .MDRV/.MDUL/.MDNM/DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Reguarding your recent
column: i am uphauled at the blatent ignorance for terminology. The
word hacker has been LONG established. i was born on a computer,
and started programming excercises when i was 6 years old and i
have been hacking ever since. ...

express a cogent thought without embarrassing yourself. They really
don't pay me enough to deal with letters like these. I'm uphauled.

million so far this year to help fellow Democrats and he is still

raised some $10 million for his presidential library, plus
California donors kicked in a bundle to bolster Hillary Rodham
Clinton's Senate campaign in New York. That's the way the system
works, and until campaign finance reform becomes a reality (don't
count on it soon), political aspirants will have to have their
hands out. By HELEN THOMAS.

tally, they are very aware of the historic fact that the ticket

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ The bombastic Pat Buchanan, who
was nominated for president last week by one wing of the warring
Reform Party, may hope to lead the nation into a future of
continued prosperity and enlightened policies. But the ideas he
espouses are not those of the future. If put into law, they would
not perpetuate prosperity or illuminate the way ahead. They would

GETTING ATTACHED TO AN E-MAIL VIEWER

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have downloaded an .Snp file on my PC but
cannot open it. It's an attachment to an e-mail. I have tried to
get the sender to help, but no one answers me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Voice in the Wilderness
</P>
<P>
   DEAR VOICE: I get that same treatment, too, although it's
usually after I start talking about the substantial raise I
deserve. I'm not greedy. I'm really not. I just want parity with
all the other columnists. I mean, let's face it, you don't see
Heloise rolling pennies at the end of the month just so she can buy
a few cans of Beanee Weenees.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry. I didn't answer your question, did I? I'm not trying
to avoid you, but this salary thing has me really torqued. It's not
like they could hire somebody off the street to do this, although
certain people will tell you that's exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, I'll try to keep focused. Just because somebody sends you
a file attachment doesn't mean you can open it. No matter what kind
of computer you have, you need the appropriate file viewer or
application to take a look at it, a fact that seems to escape most
people when they're glibly e-mailing their stuff back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if some overpaid public relations person sends me a
news release in Word 2000 format attached to an e-mail, I can't
open it unless I sell a couple of pints of blood so I can afford
the upgrade from Word 95.
</P>
<P>
   It should be common courtesy on any e-mailer's part to assume
that a recipient may not have the ability to open an attachment.
Almost any word-processing document can be saved as plain text and
inserted into the body of a letter, but spreadsheets and databases
are different animals.
</P>
<P>
   You're dealing with an .Snp, which is a Microsoft Access
snapshot file, sort of a picture of the report the sender has
generated from his database. Luckily, Microsoft provides a free
viewer for these files, as well as for Word and Excel documents.
Just do a Yahoo! search for ``Microsoft snapshot viewer'' or
``Microsoft Word viewer'' or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   When you get to the download link, click on it. You should be
prompted to save it in a location of your choosing. I generally
save stuff to an empty folder, but that's up to you as long as you
can find the file later. When you do, double-click on it, and it
will install itself. It should also associate itself as the default
viewer for those files. That means you can just click on the
attachment from now on, and it will open automatically.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Reguarding your recent column: i am uphauled at
the blatent ignorance for terminology. The word hacker has been
LONG established. i was born on a computer, and started programming
excercises when i was 6 years old and i have been hacking ever
since. ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Zero 7
</P>
<P>
   DEAR ZERO: Too bad you didn't pick up a copy of Reader Rabbit
back then. You might be able to communicate coherently or at least
express a cogent thought without embarrassing yourself. They really
don't pay me enough to deal with letters like these. I'm uphauled.

&HT;     CLINTON HAS RAISED $100 MILLION THIS YEAR FOR DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HELEN THOMAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Clinton has raised $100 million so far
this year to help fellow Democrats, according to White House press
secretary Joe Lockhart, and he is still going strong. Clinton has
been averaging about two fundraisers a week _ and there are no
signs of donor fatigue so far.
</P>
<P>
   During a weekend of party-going in the Los Angeles area, Clinton
also raised some $10 million for his presidential library that will
be built in Little Rock, Ark. In addition, California donors kicked
in a bundle to bolster Hillary Rodham Clinton's coffers in her bid
for a Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way the system works, and until campaign finance
reform becomes a reality (don't count on it soon), political
aspirants will have to have their hands out. Some candidates detest
that part of seeking public office.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Strauss, the venerable former chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, remembers when President Jimmy Carter was
running for re-election in 1980. The party was close to bankruptcy
and Strauss was asked to host a fundraiser at $10,000 a head. He
appealed to Democratic friends and others with deep pockets to
attend a reception for Carter and to kick in to keep the party
afloat.
</P>
<P>
   When Carter showed up for the fundraiser, Strauss asked him to
pose separately for photographs with each donor. Carter balked and
refused to do so, despite Strauss' pleas that he had promised the
generous contributors that they would get a picture with the
president. When Carter remained adamant, Strauss told him: ``All
right, Mr. President, but I'm going to have to give them their
money back.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the president saw the light. Without further
hesitation, Carter instructed Strauss: ``Line them up.''

   Texas Gov. George W. Bush is projecting a new confidence in his
debating skills. His decision to go to the mat with Vice President
Al Gore three times this fall and to propose two debates between
vice presidential candidates Richard Cheney and Sen. Joe Lieberman
came as a surprise after the Bush team had dragged its feet in
agreeing to a debate schedule.
</P>
<P>
   All the debaters would do well to see an upcoming PBS televised
documentary featuring anchorman Jim Lehrer interviewing some past
presidents about their debates. The TV show will be broadcast in
September. Some of the presidential recollections are painful to
this day but are nonetheless instructive on te pitfalls of
political debates.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush complained to Lehrer that the
debates ``are all about someone making a mistake.'' He ought to
know. In 1992, a bored Bush looked at his watch a couple of times
during a three-way debate with Bill Clinton _ the Democratic
presidential nominee _ and Reform Party candidate Ross Perot.
Bush's distracted gesture led the late Pamela Harriman, a strong
Clinton backer, to pat a Republican leader's hand and, with a big
smile, announce to him that Bush had just lost the election.
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer said President Gerald Ford ``can't bring himself'' to
this day to admit that he made a mistake in 1976 when he declared
in his debate with challenger Jimmy Carter that Poland was not
under Soviet domination.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's goof didn't help him in the public perception of his
knowledge of world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the sad story of Adm. James Stockdale, chosen
by Perot to be his running mate in 1992. Stockdale was at a loss
when he was suddenly thrust into the limelight in a debate with
Clinton running mate Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle. Few
will forget that poignant moment when Stockdale said, ``What am I
doing here?''
</P>
<P>
   He told Lehrer that he had been offered the No. 2 spot by Perot
only three days before the vice presidential debate and that he
wasn't privy to Perot's positions on the issues being debated. He
said his debate humiliation that night was worse than his years as
a prisoner of war in Vietnam.

   Tipper Gore and Hadassah Lieberman may be their husbands'
not-so-secret weapons on the campaign trail. They are graced with
warm personalities, especially compared with their spouses. Some
Democrats even wish Tipper was at the top of the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Strauss, former chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, thinks Tipper should follow in Lady Bird Johnson's
footsteps and undertake a whistle-stop tour through the South, to
drum up support among Southerners and women, areas where Vice
President Al Gore needs help in his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss credited Lady Bird Johnson's four-day whistle stop tour
with 47 stops and even more speeches, with helping her husband,
Lyndon B. Johnson, win a landslide election in 1964. She embarked
on a crusade to sell her husband's ``Great Society'' programs and
it was not an easy ride in the South of that era where Johnson's
push for civil rights and voting rights were passionately opposed
by some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady Bird, BLACK BIRD, GO HOME'' read some of the signs in
Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper always says she wants voters to see her husband as she
sees him as a human being and a man.
</P>
<P>
   LBJ needed no humanizing. If anything, he was all too human. The
whistle-stop with Alabama-born Lady Bird putting on her thickest
drawl didn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   If Tipper invited Hadassah along for the ride, the two women
could be a dynamic duo.

A CLOUDY `NOON'
</HEADLINE>
  Remake can't stand up to sentimental original 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients.) 
(Eds: Fact box below. Original airing is scheduled for Sun., &HT;    Aug. 21, 2000.) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ted Turner must imagine himself similar to Will Kane, the
protagonist of ``High Noon'' _ a lone, decent man battling on
despite the indifference of his countrymen: contemporary audiences
with blase attitudes toward Westerns.
</P>
<P>
   Turner alone seems to be producing for his cable stations TNT
and TBS what they called, back in the day, ``oaters.'' The results
are obvious labors of love _ in this remake for TBS of Fred
Zinnemann's beloved 1952 Gary Cooper-Grace Kelly melodrama,
cinematographer Robert McLachlan polishes Rick Roberts' handsome
production design, not to mention some spectacular vistas, to a
gorgeous sheen.
</P>
<P>
   But here the genre's cliches show their aching joints
pronouncedly (some considered the original even upon its release to
be a bit on the sentimental side), which works decidedly against
its overall effectiveness. In his book ``The Hollywood Western,''
historian William K. Everson declared Henry King's less celebrated
but far grittier 1950 effort ``The Gunslinger,'' which operated on
many similar levels to Zinneman's more popular work, to be the
superior of the two films.
</P>
<P>
   ``High Noon'' 2K stars stolid Tom Skerritt as Kne, who
discovers, seconds after marrying Quaker pacifist Amy (``Once and
Again's'' Susanna Thompson), that a killer who has sworn revenge
against him has been dubiously released from prison and is lusting
for blood on the next train to Kane's sleepy town of Hadleyville.
</P>
<P>
   Amy, naturally, thinks Kane should get while the getting is good
_ ``I don't see anything but death and destruction coming out of
this,'' she opines. The townspeople agree: The town judge (Matthew
Walker) grimly tells Will, ``You could be on your way to your
wedding bed instead of your grave.'' Will, of course, is too
willful a manly man to drop his guns and badge.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, his efforts to form a posse to battle his foe are
singularly disastrous _ as much as everyone has valued his
contribution to the community, no one wants to muss his hair or
endanger risk his life to fight for right. In 1952, this commented
archly on the encroaching American values of apathy and passing the
buck; today, it simply seems depressingly de rigueur.
</P>
<P>
   A key scene _ Kane confronting the town gentry in the church,
only to be rebuffed in a genteel and gutless fashion _ should be
the film's highlight, but instead, no thanks to nonsupple scripting
and the supporting cast's oblivious obviousness, it feels flat and
schematic.
</P>
<P>
   Skerritt plays his role with a stoicism that borders on dull
fatalism, as if he's collapsed Elisabeth Kubler-Ross's five stages
of death down to the final signpost _ acceptance. Despite the fact
that director Rod Hardy apes Zinnemann's conceit of letting the
action play out in real time, Skerritt's turn understates the
menace too much _ he's obviously working off the knowledge of too
many crass hero-against-the-odds movies. If he's channeling the
sublime cool of Clint Eastwood (who also cribbed from ``High
Noon,'' to greater effect, in ``The Outlaw Josie Wales''), he's
also draining the film of its urgency.
</P>
<P>
   The final showdown is nonetheless effective, though Michael
Madsen, playing too handily off his icily homicidal cinematic
persona, is still woefully underused as Kane's would-be killer.
Thompson, too, could have been given a better stage _ her
performance seems to end as soon as she's done burning her gaze
into Will at their wedding _ as could Maria Conchita Alonso, who
plays Kane's embittered former lover. TBS's ``High Noon'' may seek
to reinvent the cliches of the Western, but ultimately, it only
rehashes them. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``High Noon.'' &QL; 
What: Remake of the 1952 Western. &QL; 
The stars: Tom Skerritt, Susanna Thompson, Maria Conchita Alonso,
Michael Madsen. &QL;

   Everything seemed fine that spring afternoon as Capt. Ken Blyth
watched over the loading of his ship in Singapore. He was
skippering the Petro Ranger, a medium-size tanker with a $1.5
million cargo of jet fuel and diesel oil bound for Ho Chi Minh
City. It was a three-day turnaround. No big deal. After it was
over, he'd fly back to his home in Queensland, Australia, to
celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary the following week with his
wife, Denise.
</P>
<P>
   When the Petro Ranger finally slipped its berth, it was just
another cargo vessel amid the daily parade that makes Singapore the
busiest port in the world. Not far outside the harbor is the
Horsburgh Lighthouse, the last outpost of domestic law. From
Horsburgh on, you pass into the only true frontier of the 21st
century: international waters _ the no-man's land of the new world
economy. Not technically owned or patrolled by anyone, these waters
are the last place on earth where you are truly alone.
</P>
<P>
   That night, a Malaysian sailor of Indian extraction was the
officer of the watch, but instead of performing his duties, he
tuned the shortwave to his favorite Indian music station and didn't
pay attention to the radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   Just after 1 a.m., the blue speedboat opened its engines.
Cruising straight up the wake, without any threat of detection, it
pulled up to the ship's stern. There were 12 pirates on board _ as
multicultural as their 18th-century avatars: seven Indonesians,
three Malaysians and two Thais. They had learned the layout of the
ship beforehand and moved with feline grace. Securing bamboo
ladders to the stern, the men scrambled to the main deck and leapt
upon the outside ladder of the accommodation housing, climbing five
stories to the open bridge. Dressed in jeans and T-shirts and with
balaclavas pulled over their faces, they appeared in the bridge's
doorway. They were armed with machetes. The officer of the watch
panicked and fled the chart room by a back exit. The lookout was
overtaken in a struggle that thumped the floor loudly enough to
awaken the captain below.
</P>
<P>
   Blyth sat up in the dark, thinking perhaps that someone on the
bridge had been drinking. Suddenly, he was startled by the sound of
a loud banging at his door. Instinctively, he unlocked it. The door
blew open. Four hooded pirates waving machetes rushed in. A fifth
pirate stepped forward with a gun. He put the barrel to Blyth's
head and ordered the captain to place his hands in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   The pirates bound Blyth with boat lacing. He would remain bound
for the next 13 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have burn marks on my wrists,'' Blyth, 55, a tall,
blue-eyed Scot, recently told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pirates wanted me to go around with the master key _ the
one the captain has to unlock any door _ and round up the crew,''
Blyth recalled of that April 17, 1998, night. ``The idea was that I
would knock on the door, tell them not to worry and not to do
anything silly. Then the pirates would tell them to get their hands
out and tie them up.''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, every crew member, except for the officer of the
watch and an engineer who accompanied two pirates to the engine
room, was taken and dumped in the captain's day room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they took me to the bridge,'' Blyth continued. ``I was
still tied up, and then they taped my arms and legs to the chair.
They didn't understand how to turn off the automatic pilot, and the
pirates were baffled by touch-screen computerized piloting. So I
said, 'If you're going to kill me anyway, why should I help?'''
Then one of the head pirates told Blyth something that convinced
him: the names of his wife and two daughters _ and their street
address.
</P>
<P>
   The pirates unbound Blyth long enough for him to alter course,
taking the Petro Ranger far from the regularly trafficked corridors
of international shipping and into the maritime equivalent of a
dark alley. By the time the pirates retaped him to the chair, the
ship was still steaming northward but no longer on a course for
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The pirates had taped over the portholes, but the captain once
saw through a crack in the tape over the bathroom porthole that the
bottom half of his ship's identifying blue funnel had been painted
red. And could he have seen the stern, he would have found that the
Petro Ranger no longer existed. He was now aboard the ``Wilby,''
just another vessel bobbing along without notice in international
sea lanes. Over the next several days, changes in the weather and
the flies buzzing in through the vents were enough to convince
Blyth that they were nearing the China coast. Blyth theorized that
the pirates intended to meet some black-market tankers to offload
the fuel cargo. They would need Blyth and his crew to help make
that transfer. But then what?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Piracy's Rivival &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Piracy on the high seas resurfaced in the mid-1980s and in
recent years has ratcheted up to a true crisis both for shippers
and recreational yachtsmen. In 1989, there were 48 acts of piracy
reported around the world; in 1999, there were 285. So far this
year, it's up by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of piracy's revival is no different from its
appearance centuries ago. Ships serving the top trading nations
(England, Holland and Spain in the old days; America, Germany and
Japan now) are transiting through a global geography of poverty,
envy and desperation. Often these vessels are carrying on board a
king's ransom of commodities _ no longer cinnamon, indigo and flax,
but jet fuel, alkali and aluminum ingots _ all easily
black-marketed into quick money.
</P>
<P>
   Modern piracy ranges from desperate fishermen pulling off petty
larcenies at sea to highly organized syndicates slaughtering crews
to steal multimillion-dollar vessels. Today's pirates are a
troubling symptom of a new world order, one shaped by a fierce
Darwinian struggle in the feral markets of modern international
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Most piracy is of the mugging-at-sea variety. The pirates just
zip up in a speedboat, point a rocket launcher at the hull and
demand money. Lately it has been getting a little rougher. Last
January, an Australian couple were sailing around the world. In the
Gulf of Aden off Yemen, a small powerboat pulled up beside the
couple's catamaran; a burst of machine-gun fire tore through the
hull, wounding the wife. Four pirates boarded the boat, ripped out
some high-tech communications equipment, then left.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, more ambitious pirates realize that stealing some
watches and shipboard cash is small stakes when you're dealing with
a huge vessel carrying cargo worth millions. Often the pirates will
contract with black marketeers to hawk the cargo. And they also
want the ship. This may mean repainting it at sea, obtaining fake
registration papers and then selling it or just using it themselves
to become seemingly legitimate shippers. This process, known as
phantom shipping, is costly and dangerous, requiring serious
planning and organization.
</P>
<P>
   The more sophisticated forms of piracy are carried out by
Southeast Asian syndicates and Chinese triads. According to a 1998
report on piracy published by the International Chamber of
Commerce, the corporate-style organization of the syndicates is
impressive: ships can ``be hijacked to order in the Philippines for
about $300,000 and delivered within three days.''
</P>
<P>
   The global reaction to the piracy revival has been, by all
accounts, slow. So the pirates aren't too scared. Ships disappear
pretty regularly and with impunity. Once a ship has been captured,
the crew faces one of two fates. In the case of the tanker Global
Mars, which was seized by pirates last Feb. 23, the 17 crewmen were
bound and blindfolded before being set off in lifeboats. But the 21
crew members of the Hualien No. 1, which disappeared with a cargo
of river sand last Feb. 28, have never turned up and are now
presumed dead. Most seamen know such stories. They hear them and
can't believe it will ever happen to them. Ken Blyth was certainly
thinking about them when one of the junior pirates told him that
their leader wished to see him at once.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Pirate King &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blyth was escorted to his own day room, where the pirates had
set up their headquarters. The pirate king was 49 years old, a
well-educated and heavyset Indonesian of medium height. He spoke
four or five languages, including grammatically perfect English.
The pirate king's name, Blyth would learn, was Herman.
</P>
<P>
   The two men sat down and had a cup of coffee. Blyth was
surprised that Herman wanted to chat a little. ``The impression I
got,'' Blyth told me, ``was that having achieved what he had done _
the Petro Ranger was the most modern tanker he'd swiped _ he would
have loved to phone up CNN and say, 'Look what I pulled off.' He
was so exhilarated he wanted to share it with someone. I was the
only one around who could possibly appreciate what he'd done.''
</P>
<P>
   The syndicate he worked for, Herman explained, had five men in
leadership positions: one each from China, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Malaysia and Singapore. He claimed that they had ``inside access''
to Petroships, the shipping company. They knew that the Petro
Ranger would be sailing with a simple commodity _ fuel _ easily
fungible on the black market. They knew the date of embarkation.
They knew all about Blyth and most of the crew. Herman had all the
documents he would need: registration for the ``Wilby,'' papers
that identified Herman as the legitimate captain along with his
crew and bills of lading identifying the cargo on board as part of
a legitimate charter.
</P>
<P>
   Blyth was returned to his mattress, quite impressed by the
extent of Herman's operation. One thing worried him, though. Why
would Herman tell him all this if he didn't also intend to kill
him?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Great Escape &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a week, Blyth realized time was running out. Somewhere at
sea, two tankers had pulled up alongside for cargo transfers. A
third tanker was delayed, Blyth learned. The Petro Ranger idled at
sea for several days. Then, on the 13th day of the crew's
captivity, one of the pirates made a huge mistake. With the third
tanker sailing around unable to find the ``Wilby,'' the No. 2
pirate called the tanker on the public VHF frequency. The Chinese
heard him.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, a Chinese patrol vessel stopped, boarded and
inspected the Petro Ranger. But Herman handled it smoothly. He
locked Blyth and a few of his men down below in crew cabins. He
presented papers indicating that he was the captain and passed off
both Blyth's legitimate sailors and his own henchmen as his crew.
(The pirates kept Blyth's crew in check by routinely reminding them
that they knew the whereabouts of their wives and families.)
</P>
<P>
   Suspecting a smuggling operation, the Chinese withdrew and
waited to see what might happen. When the third tanker did arrive,
the Chinese sped in, stopped both ships at sea, and escorted them
to Haikou harbor on the island of Hainan in southern China. Since
the Chinese were now convinced that the ``Wilby'' was a smuggling
ship, Herman quietly contacted his syndicate and got a lawyer to
facilitate the usual round robin of bribes. Blyth learned all this
from, of course, Herman, who enjoyed summoning the captain back to
the day room to boast about his caginess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I had to get to the Chinese,'' Blyth recalled, ``and
then I could only hope that I was in fact getting to the good guys,
the ones who weren't corrupt.'' With one of his crew members,
Saini, who spoke a little Mandarin, he arranged a midnight meeting
with a Chinese lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saini explained who I was,'' Blyth recalled, ``and I gave him
my passport and some Malaysian documents stating I had command of
the Petro Ranger, which the pirates had neglected to destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Chinese soldiers came to the ship and herded
first Herman and his ``officers'' and then nearly the entire mix of
pirates and legitimate crew onto their boat. Told they were simply
going ashore to sign documents granting port clearance, they easily
complied as 30 armed soldiers held their weapons at the ready.
Blyth then pointed at each man in turn, identifying him as either
pirate or crew.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Trouble in Port &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the Chinese officials arrested the pirates, Blyth
was taken ashore and interrogated by two different law-enforcement
agencies: the People's Liberation Army, all dressed in green
outfits, and the Public Security Bureau, distinguished by khaki.
Days of repetitive interviews and odd accusations _ at one point, a
PSB official suggested that Blyth had made the whole pirate thing
up _ gave the captain the impression his ship had become ensnared
in a major power play. The PLA was deeply concerned with how this
might look internationally (and were, therefore, sort of on Blyth's
side). The PSB, however, seemed more beholden to provincial powers
in southern China, which are widely suspected not only of
tolerating piracy but also of organizing it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end Petroships retrieved its stolen ship _ but the
Chinese kept all of the remaining 5,100 tons of fuel, nearly half
the original cargo, as ``evidence'' before waiting some time and
selling it off.
</P>
<P>
   Petroships was luckier in some respects that the owners of the
Anna Sierra, which was ``saved'' from pirates by the Chinese in
1996. In that case, the cargo was sold and the authorities even
refused to permit the owners to reclaim the ship. Without care, it
took on water and to this day the ship remains beached in Beihai
harbor in southern China, a rusting monument to the inadequacy of
policing modern piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after Blyth went home, the Chinese authorities
quietly released Herman and all of his men. The Chinese have
refused to explain why they would let the pirates go, as they have
done repeatedly in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my old crew members phoned me up in early August,''
Blyth said. ``He's still at sea, and he told me that five of our
pirates, three of the Malaysians and the two Thais, have been
spotted doing piracy again, working the waters between Port Dickson
and Port Klang near Kuala Lumpur. You just can't believe it, but
they're back out there.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   On a balmy night in Albuquerque, 80 homeowners shuffle into the
cafeteria at Whittier Elementary School to listen to New Mexico's
governor, Gary Johnson, a lithe, boyish figure in a checked blazer
and clashing patterned tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made you all a pledge that I was going to put the issues
that should be on the front burner on the front burner, regardless
of the consequences,'' he says. ``Half of what we spend on law
enforcement, half of what we spend on the courts and half of what
we spend on the prisons is drug-related. Our current policies on
drugs are perhaps the biggest problem that this country has.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone tells kids not to do drugs, Johnson says. Despite this
chorus, nearly 80 million Americans have tried them, including more
than half of this year's graduating high school class. No one
condones this, he adds, but do we really want our kids to be
branded ``criminals'' for having experimented with drugs? If
they're not driving or stealing while high, where is the harm?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson looks down at his cheat sheet; he's an unpolished if
ardent speaker. Last year, he points out, 450,000 people died from
smoking cigarettes. Alcohol killed 150,000, and another 100,000
died from legal prescription drugs. How many people died last year
from the use of marijuana? Few, if any. From cocaine and heroin?
Five thousand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet we are arresting 1.5 million people a year in this country
on drug-related crime,'' Johnson says, his voice rising. ``Half of
those arrests are for marijuana, and half those arrested are
Hispanics. Tell me that half the users of marijuana in the United
States of America are Hispanic! I don't think so.'' We're locking
up nonviolent people senselessly, he tells the mostly white
audience, his blue eyes and neck veins bulging. ``We ought to
legalize marijuana. We need to stop 'getting tough' with drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe this is a Republican governor. People say
they want politicians who will give it to them straight. Well, this
is what straight must sound like. Yet people look dubious. ``If
everyone were like Gary Johnson and a triathlete, it would be
fine,'' one man tells me. They'd have the fortitude to steer clear
of legally available dope. ``But they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   That's putting it mildly. Johnson, 47, regularly finishes near
the top of his age group in Ironman competitions, which combine a
2.4 mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride and a marathon. He once ran 100
miles in 30 consecutive hours in the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   And these are just his physical feats. Johnson is manic about
being on time. He sets 10 or so goals each year and writes them on
the back of a business card; this year, the list includes learning
yoga (he's in a class each Wednesday after work), reading a book a
month and having one ``adventure'' each week.
</P>
<P>
   So how did a hokey role model like Johnson come to be viewed by
the drug policy establishment as a threat to the nation's youth? By
acting like the uncompromising heroes in the Ayn Rand novels he
admires. Last summer, a few months into his second and
(constitutionally mandated) final term, Johnson told state GOP
leaders that he was determined to make the most of his bully pulpit
while he had it. Days later, without having thought it all through
(he says now), Johnson told reporters that he would support
legalizing marijuana and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Into the Spotlight &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ka-boom! The White House drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, flew
in to condemn him. Ed Bradley came down to do a segment for ''60
Minutes.'' Johnson became the toast of the libertarian Cato
Institute and Rolling Stone magazine, on his way to a starring role
at the recently convened ``shadow conventions.'' Meanwhile, his
chief law-enforcement official quit in protest, a local sheriff
called him an ``idiot'' and his approval rating sank from 54
percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people surrounding him wish he would stop,'' says
Darren White, the top cop who quit Johnson's cabinet. ``But this is
vintage Gary Johnson.'' Meaning pigheaded or principled, depending
on whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has vetoed a record-shattering 578 bills during his
tenure, producing the state's worst gridlock _ and lowest spending
increases _ in decades.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means that Johnson, the highest-ranking official
ever to call for partial drug legalization, may have just the
temperament to force an overdue debate. Can a fitness addict who's
an improbable mix of Howard Roarke, Tony Robbins and Stephen Covey
break America's $40-billion-a-year drug-war habit?
</P>
<P>
   It is 5 a.m. in Santa Fe the morning after his elementary school
talk. I've come along for his notorious morning workout. We're
running 11 miles up a mountain in the dark. I'm gasping for air
after 10 minutes. By the 25-minute mark, he has circled back four
times to urge me on. I finally persuade him to go on alone; he'll
catch me on the way down.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has a point system for his workouts _ one point each for
a running mile, a quarter-mile swim, three miles of biking or 10
minutes of weight lifting. Johnson racks up 77 points a week. (It's
one of his goals.)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson hasn't always been this driven. His father was a public
school teacher; his mother worked at the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
A middling student, Johnson never thought about going anywhere but
the University of New Mexico. That's where the pot he started
smoking in high school became something of a lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   The governor talks about those days with remarkable candor. He
didn't just ``experiment'' with marijuana, the invariable
confession of boomer politicians. Johnson told me he was high two
to three times a week between his senior year of high school and a
year after college, when he decided it was a ``handicap'' and
stopped. He also tried cocaine twice. ``Whoa!'' Johnson remembers
feeling. ``I understand why people do it. This is
UN-be-LIEV-able.'' And therefore too dangerous to continue, he
reckoned.
</P>
<P>
   Having put himself through school with a string of construction
jobs, Johnson began his own handyman and remodeling business. His
break came a decade later, when his company got a hefty chunk of a
huge Intel plant expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal swiftly took Johnson's revenues from $1.5 million to
$38 million, sparking a classic small-business crisis. Endless days
spent chasing receivables to meet his firm's swelling payroll drove
him to the brink. ``I felt like I understood suicide,'' he recalls.
To cope, he took a night course in time management in 1987. It made
him reassess everything.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Turning Point &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized, looking back over my life,'' he says, ``that when
I was fit everything seemed to work.'' He gave up liquor, ramped up
his fitness program and began writing down goals.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, at age 40, the now-prosperous Johnson told friends he
was ready to run for the U.S. Senate. But the incumbents looked
entrenched, so he decided he would become governor. Republican
elders were amused. They told him a likable young businessman could
have a big future if he started with the state legislature. Johnson
thanked them for their advice, plunked down half a million dollars
(serious money in New Mexico politics) to win the GOP primary and
rode Newt Gingrich's coattails into the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   I ask Johnson about his political philosophy. He says he is not
a true libertarian, because he thinks government often has a role.
But he will never qualify as a ``compassionate conservative.''
After six years of his stewardship, New Mexico remains among the
nation's poorest states, with one of the highest levels of
uninsured citizens. Shouldn't government do more on health
coverage? Johnson dismisses the problem, saying that many folks
don't want insurance and that with emergency rooms, nobody really
goes without.
</P>
<P>
   What about help for the working poor in an age when unskilled
folks are losing ground? ``I don't buy into that,'' Johnson snaps.
``Anybody that wants to be an entrepreneur in this country can make
an absolute fortune.'' Even somebody who cleans houses, he says.
</P>
<P>
   How's that? I ask, huffing behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I started a business tomorrow just cleaning houses by
myself,'' he says, ``I think I could make $100,000 a year. You
clean four houses at $100 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what these people do when they come in and clean. In
three hours I could do what they do. I just don't buy into the
notion that anybody can't still make it today if they are willing
to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Paradoxical Approach &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's empathy gap highlights a paradox in his approach to
drugs. His fierce belief in personal responsibility is what
convinced him that the drug war is a waste of money; if you're
spending $40 billion and the drugs keep coming in, he figured, why
not just legalize the stuff and work on people so they don't get
hooked? Yet he has vetoed millions for drug treatment partly
because he seems to feel people should be able to straighten
themselves out by an act of willpower, just as he did. As a result,
he has alienated natural allies in the public health community in a
state that boasts the county with the highest death rate from
heroin overdoses in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, government at all levels spent less than $5 billion on
drug control and incarcerated about 50,000 Americans for nonviolent
drug offenses; today, it spends some $40 billion and jails more
than 450,000 (more than Europe, with a larger population, jails for
everything). Blacks make up 17 percent of cocaine users but also 88
percent of those convicted on crack cocaine charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Johnson isn't the first official to say there's something
wrong with this picture, but a crusade by a sitting Republican
governor marks a new high point for dissent. For years,
conservative intellectuals like Milton Friedman and William F.
Buckley Jr. have made a libertarian case for legalization. But both
political parties found prison-building, ``tough'' sentencing laws
and calls to ``Just Say No'' politically irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1988, Kurt Schmoke, the black mayor of Baltimore and a
rising Democratic star, stunned the U.S. Conference of Mayors by
saying the drug war was doing more harm than good. All options,
decriminalization included, he said, should be considered.
Schmoke's stand landed him on the front page of newspapers around
the country. When he was re-elected twice afterward, it proved that
a black, big-city mayor, at least, could buck the bromides and
survive.
</P>
<P>
   The year since Johnson glibly floated the notion of providing
heroin legally by prescription has seen the taming of governor. He
now seeks legalization for marijuana only and promotes ``harm
reduction'' strategies for other drugs, a policy associated with
reformers like Ethan Nadelmann of the George Soros-backed
Lindesmith Center. These analysts view drugs as a public health
problem, not a criminal one, and back broad programs for needle
exchange and methadone maintenance. They also criticize ``mandatory
minimum'' sentences that can leave nonviolent drug offenders in
jail longer than rapists or burglars.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who has himself fought to fix unfair sentencing laws,
nonetheless views much of the harm-reduction agenda as a ploy to
pave the way toward full legalization. Johnson's efforts, he tells
me sharply, are ``irresponsible,'' ``misguided'' and ``anathema to
America's parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but back at Whittier Elementary School, at least, a
lot of parents see it differently. A Vietnam veteran, an elderly
man in a red baseball jacket and a 40-ish professional type rise
one after another to say they don't usually agree with Johnson but
admire his courage in raising this issue. There's assent and
applause from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says that a number of governors have told him privately
they respect what he's doing; they also say their careers would be
over if they tried it. But the issue is gaining steam. A California
ballot initiative this November would divert nonviolent first-time
drug offenders to treatment; New York's chief judge recently
introduced a similar system administratively. Johnson, meanwhile,
has his first-ever bipartisan task force coming back in December
with a slate of reforms in drug policy, which he says could even
include pardons for nonviolent offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is determined to get something done. He has been at it
only a year, and he has two and a half more to go before he leaves
office. After that, as everyone in the state seems to know,
Johnson's only firm plan is to climb Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing this, Raymond Sanchez, the speaker of New Mexico's
House of Representatives, hunts down his copy of ``Into Thin Air,''
Jon Krakauer's best seller about the 1996 Everest disaster, and
cites this passage to sum up what you need to know about Gary
Johnson: ``Any person who would seriously consider'' climbing
Everest, Krakauer writes, ``is almost by definition beyond the sway
of reasoned argument.''

entrepreneurial boom. Dozens of services, from restaurant guides to
surf forecasts, have already captured a large user base and new
ones are announced almost daily, offering games, weather, traffic
information, stock quotes, even cartoons. While Internet companies
in the United States struggle to generate profits, many Japanese

RESCUERS REACH SUBMARINE DECK BUT ARE UNABLE TO OPEN ESCAPE HATCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER with JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian effort to save the 118 crew members trapped
aboard a crippled submarine was dealt a major setback Friday when
workers hooked a rescue capsule to the deck but were unable to open
the escape hatch, Russian navy officials told state television.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Vyachevslav Popov, the commander of the Russian Northern
Fleet, told Russian television Friday that the rescue effort began
last Saturday, four hours after the accident occurred, as soon as
the navy found the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concentrated all our efforts on saving the crew,'' Popov
said. ``The rescuers are tired but they continue their work.''
Russian officials said they would continue to try to rescue the
crew.
</P>
<P>
   After days of trying, Russian navy officers finally reached the
escape hatch at the rear of the submarine with a rescue capsule.
But the deck was so badly damaged the capsule was unable to
establish an airtight lock. Without such an airtight seal, rescuers
cannot open the hatch and enter the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   The damage to the deck around the hatch makes any successful
rescue extremely unlikely. Russian President Vladimir Putin
acknowledged on Friday what some Russian officials have been saying
since the accident happened: that there was never much hope of
rescuing the crew. Putin said that when he was informed of the
accident he asked Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev about chances to
save the crew of the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer was, `There is an extremely small chance for
rescue, but it exists,''' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers on Friday tried several times to make a seal between the
submarine and the rescue capsule, but as soon as they pumped out
water, more rushed in. The rescuers in the capsule kept working
until its batteries ran out and the team was forced to return to
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The failure Friday was a big disappointment for the navy.
Officials had already ruled out trying to enter through the two
front escape hatches, saying they were too badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear if the deck around the rear hatch was deformed in
the initial accident that crippled the Kursk or immediately
afterward, when the submarine crashed to the floor of the Barents
Sea during a military exercise.
</P>
<P>
   With the newly acknowledged extent of the damage, the next best
hope is likely a British rescue sub that is being transported to
the scene of the accident. It is due to reach the Kursk Saturday,
but it is not clear if the British submarine will be able to make
an airtight connection.
</P>
<P>
   Putin will return Friday to Moscow, cutting short a summit
meeting with leaders of the former Soviet states. The Russian
president has been criticized for making only a few public comments
since the accident. Putin said Friday that he initially wanted to
fly to the accident scene, but decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I did the right thing, because the arrival of
non-specialists from any field at the disaster area would not help
high-placed officials and more often would hamper work,'' Putin
said. ``Everyone should keep to his place.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for rescuing any crew members have been steadily falling.
There have been no signs of life since a tapping noise from the
hull stopped a few days ago. And as more is learned about the
extent of the damage, many officials believe crew members could
have perished immediately after the accident.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Popov said Friday that much of the damage was caused by an
explosion, but he did not know what caused the explosion. Some
Russian officials have speculated that a collision with another
vessel set off one of the torpedoes in the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said Thursday that catastrophic damage and
``irrefutable data'' pointed to a collision. They said the object
or ship that had collided with the Kursk has not yet been
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Any vessel that could cause the sort of damage described by the
Russian officials would itself have suffered enormous damage, and
no such vessel has been reported.
</P>
<P>
   George Tenet, the director of the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency, visited Moscow Friday, Russian officials said. But it was
not clear if Tenet had traveled to Russia to discuss the accident
or another security matter.
</P>
<P>
   Russian navy commanders met for eight hours Thursday with Deputy
Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov at Severomorsk, headquarters of the
Northern Fleet, and decided to continue the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   They said they would continue studying a plan to raise the
vessel with pontoons and begin salvaging operations to recover the
two nuclear reactors on board that could pose a long-term threat to
the fisheries of the Arctic seas.

   FIRESTONE _ Ford is getting plaudits for its handling of the
Firestone tire recall involving its popular Explorer SUV,
particularly since the automaker's release of Firestone data
showing that Firestone's ATX series is exceptionally prone to tread
failure and the company suspected a problem at least by 1997. But
legal and scientific experts say Ford is just trying deflect blame
and save its brand name; the Explorer's suspension design means
that tire failures are far more likely to trigger a rollover,
compared with other SUVs, and that Ford's decision to use cheaper
glass in side windows means passengers are more likely to be
ejected and killed. Ford's redesigned 2002 Explorer, with a
different suspension, is set to be unveiled in January. (Carmody,

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ WACO, Texas _ Since Texas Gov.
George W. Bush has made education a high priority in his

educational progress. Texans like to brag, but there's no question
that the Lone Star state has hit upon a winning formula to boost

&HT;     GORE: BORING BUT HIGH ON CONTENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ By failing to deliver in his presidential
acceptance speech, Al Gore didn't let anybody down. He lived up to
the expectations. And in the process he found his identity.
</P>
<P>
   We know this much: Al Gore's picture is not in the Toastmasters
Hall of Fame. Few people outside of Henry Hyde and the cast of
``Big Brother'' can make television as utterly lifeless as Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But we knew that coming in. We knew Gore was going to be a bore.
We knew he'd barrel through his punch lines like a freight train
painted flat gray. We knew he'd give us substance and issues to
chew on - humor be damned. We knew, ultimately, that Al would be
Al.
</P>
<P>
   And right now that's looking pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, this is not a thrilling election. The economy is
still on fire. And the Republicans can make Bill Clinton the
lightning rod all they want, but this election isn't about Clinton
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   And so Americans have been reduced to thinking about two not
very exciting guys wanting very badly to get a job that doesn't
seem half as exciting or important as Martin Sheen makes it out to
be on TV.
</P>
<P>
   While George W. Bush put some charisma and attitude on the table
two weeks ago in his acceptance speech, he did little to disprove
the notion that he is ``The Candidate,'' a hollow man with almost
no substance, questionable mental ability and a lineage that
doesn't inspire in the same way as the Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Bush's rousing speech was empty of content. But it was
fun to watch and made for good television.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore doesn't care about good television. He knew that short
of an improvisational back-flip or saying something like, ``I know
who wins `Survivor,''' he wasn't going to thrill us.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he gave us the beef.
</P>
<P>
   That was pretty wily. And it was refreshing. You've got to like
a guy who comes out and eschews rousing rhetoric and carefully
crafted applause breaks and instead lays down what sounded
suspiciously like a State of the Union Address.
</P>
<P>
   Good old Al. That political wonk. No dressing up in the phony
clothes of entertainment and inspiration. Nah, how about some
content from an actual political platform instead?
</P>
<P>
   The kids won't like it. But it's good for them. Really, that was
50 minutes of spinach compared with W's box of Cheesy Poofs.
</P>
<P>
   As Dan Rather said afterward: ``Tonight, Al Gore bet on
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   He did indeed. Substance is dangerous. Television especially
hates substance. It gums up the works. By not igniting the verbal
fireworks we've come to expect at these affairs, Gore sent the
pundits straight to the knee-jerk reaction anyone could have seen
coming down the road like a neon Kenworth: The speech was flat, it
didn't ``play'' on television, it didn't Clintonize the audience
like an illicit orgasm.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   If Al Gore tried to channel Jerry Seinfeld or suddenly become
the white Jesse Jackson, nobody would have bought it. They would
accuse him of selling out, of pandering to what's expected of
politicians in these big speeches. Instead, Gore seemed intent on
being just what we know him to be: Boring but earnest, a guy who
knows his numbers and has a gigantic heart and who will do good
things for people _ but not someone who gets rewarded for those
virtues by being let into the cool crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He's Anthony Edwards in a George Clooney world. That's an ``ER''
reference for you PBS fans. Good for Gore. He wanted to let the
world know who he is. ``I stand here tonight as my own man,'' he
said, not only distancing himself from Clinton but also revealing
his true self. He told family stories of his mother and father. He
passionately kissed his wife, several times.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, he blew through his applause breaks, obliviously. He
went on long, windbag sentences that changed pitch and tone
ineffectively. He laughed a weird, non-flattering laugh. His neck
and head worked as one piece, while his upper torso seemed to knot
up and stiffen as we watched.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, he didn't dance.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated core Democratic beliefs like inclusion for all
people, higher wages, affirmative action, pro-abortion rights, laws
against hate crimes and more. He made 50 minutes seem like a long,
long time.
</P>
<P>
   But savvy Democrats probably breathed a sigh of relief. Two
weeks agoit looked like there was a new Reagan on the horizon and,
for them, maybe another Michael Dukakis. But Al Gore came through
in a different way on Thursday. He said, ``This is me, this is what
I know, this is what we're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So let the pundits say Gore was a bore. Because the next stage
of this election will shift from staged infomercials to the
debates. And W doesn't get in a steel-cage death match with a man
so confident of his platform that he took the bells and whistles
off it and gave it to the country in prime time, like it or not.

&HT;     THE KISS THAT ROARED 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Al Gore held Tipper and kissed her full on
the lips the way they must have as young lovers, I knew he had
found his real self.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't a geek anymore. He was the young hunk in the old
photographs. Any politician can kiss babies, but not many can plant
a perfect Rodin kiss on his wife of three decades in front of
millions of people. They didn't unlock for a full seven seconds,
and for a while I thought Gore's acceptance speech might need one
of Tipper's warning labels.
</P>
<P>
   Strong political women around me shivered. Men laughed in
appreciation. We remembered that the most basic family value of
all, love, starts with a kiss. If George W. Bush knows what's good
for him, he'll get his lip consultant working on kissing and not
just smirk removal. With a kiss, the Tennessee prince awoke from an
eight-year slumber. Poof, Bill Clinton was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know who I truly am,'' said Gore, and spoke of
his wife as ``someone I've loved with all my heart since the night
of my senior prom.''
</P>
<P>
   You knew he wasn't lying, and you also knew he isn't exactly the
stiff he's supposed to be. He looked as if someone had taken the
coat hanger out of his suit.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote his speech from the heart, and it worked. Well, it was
a good speech for Al Gore, and one of his better moments was
admitting he's not the most exciting man in the world, while
finally exciting us.
</P>
<P>
   Gore came to talk issues, just as Bush had talked generalities
about values, and Gore trounced him on values, too. Where anyone
got the idea that issues are different from values, I don't know.
But Al Gore explicitly made the connection.
</P>
<P>
   Giving all children health care and a good education is a family
value. Giving the elderly affordable medicine, and not gutting
their Medicare and Social Security, is a family value.
</P>
<P>
   Gore inherits his family values from his strong New Deal family,
and basically the fight between Gore and Bush comes down to
advancing the New Deal, or repealing it so the rich can be
richer.It's a very clear choice this election.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be honest here. I like Al Gore because of the woman he
kissed. Seven years ago, Tipper Gore visited San Francisco and I
interviewed her. I asked if she'd noticed all the homeless lying on
San Francisco sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I have seen them, and it's outrageous,'' she said with a
passion reporters usually don't hear from prominent individuals.
``This country badly needs mental health programs to take care of
these people.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an issue (and value) I care strongly about, too. So we
talked for quite a while about the scandalous state of mental
health care and the stigma that prevents some people from seeking
care, and others from providing help.
</P>
<P>
   Some people would rather not see. Tipper has been opening their
eyes. As a first lady, she really would be something. At the end of
the interview, I mentioned the famous Harvard-Yale game of 1968, in
which Harvard scored 16 points in the last 46 seconds to tie Yale.
Al Gore's roommate, Tommy Lee Jones, was a guard on the Harvard
team.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Tipper became a 20-year-old again, and whooped,
``Harvard beats Yale, 28-28!'' _ which was the headline in the
college paper. This woman's enthusiasm is amazing. Anyone married
to Tipper must be OK, and it's easy to see why Al keeps kissing her
like that.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore always seemed stiff at the podium, making hand gestures
that didn't fit his words, and emphasizing the wrong words, often
lowly little prepositions.
</P>
<P>
   There was a little of that in his speech. Just enough to let you
know who he was. He's not some guy who changed his whole mouth to
give a speech, like Bush, who scowled for 52 minutes to keep the
smirk at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Gore stayed focused and serious, yet loose, with no goofy smiles
and only one forced joke. Finally, the Al Gore on the podium was
beginning to morph with the Al Gore you see in a small room.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago I went with Gore to a classroom in nearby
Cupertino where he was going to demonstrate the educational
usefulness of the Internet to reporters and high school students,
who already knew more about it than any of us.
</P>
<P>
   Gore really knew how to use the Internet, which was unusual for
a middle-aged man at the time, but then he did invent it. When he
tried to get into the Library of Congress, though, nothing
happened. Gore started making jokes with the kids about government
inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The kids loved this big guy sitting at a little desk hitting
keys to no avail, and wisecracking about it.
</P>
<P>
   Watch a politician in a room filled with high school kids, and
you learn a lot about him. Gore does well in such a room. Look at
this guy, and the infectiously happy Gore and Lieberman families.
Maybe Al Gore is not all that exciting, but he likes kids and vows
to protect a woman's right to choose. He may get that women's vote
after all.
</P>
<P>
   And he can kiss.
</P>

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Officials of the San Francisco International
Airport announced last week that the $850 million International
Terminal would open at least six weeks later than planned because
of construction delays, prompting concern for tenants who are
finishing stores and restaurants and hiring workers.
</P>
<P>
   Nidal Nazzal, who owns Burger Joint, one of the 16 restaurants
slated for the new terminal, plans to open in mid-September as
originally scheduled. But that is well before the Nov. 1 to Dec. 15
time frame that airport officials now believe is more realistic for
the opening of the new wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will give us a little time to get the kinks out so when
the airport finally does open, we'll be really ready,'' said
Nazzal, who has already hired eight employees and plans to serve
airport workers until the terminal opens. ``But it's hard not
knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   For tenants, every day past the original opening _ Sept. 26 _
translates into losses.
</P>
<P>
   Many have already hired employees and must pay their salaries if
they want to keep them. They have advertised September opening
dates. Most have loan payments. On top of that, construction costs
are two to three times higher than most of the tenants expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delay is just one more thing,'' said Michael Levine, a
partner in Il Fornaio/Cafe Del Mondo at the International Terminal
and chairman of the newly formed San Francisco International
Airport Restaurant Association. ``The reality is, you don't have a
Host Marriott. You have individual entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine was referring to the airport's decision to abandon the
practice of hiring a master concessionaire, like Host Marriott
International, in favor of selecting local businesses to fill most
of the 140,000 square feet of retail space in the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Airport spokesman Peter Nardoza said the airport had agreed to
defray some costs by covering the salaries of already-hired
employees from Sept. 26 to the new opening date _ whenever that is.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, the airport will pay the interest on loans
that come due after the original start date and before the
businesses start making money. And some other unexpected costs may
be covered by rent credits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to see them lose,'' Nardoza said. ``If they have
legitimate costs that are unexpected, we'll work with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nardoza said the airport, which does not rely on tax dollars for
operations, hoped to recoup those extra costs by filing claims
against contractors responsible for the delays. He declined to
identify any of the contractors who might be sued. He said delays
from labor strikes were not subject to such claims.

   MALE-BODIES (Undated) _ The new book, ``The Adonis Complex''
(Free Press), tries to show exhaustively how concerns about body
image have come to dominate, and tyrannize, many American men.
``There's no question that there's a much greater emphasis on male

   HOTEL-BUTLERY-SCHOOL (Undated) - Butler training school at the
St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan. Alex Witchel writes: ``When I stayed
at the St. Regis a few years ago, I opened the door to a young
woman dressed in white tie and tails who identified herself as the
butler. Since I had no idea what to do with her, I sent her on her
way. A female butler. What a funny idea. During my fifth hour of
butler training last week, I was no longer amused. Maybe it was
having to wear the white tie and tails in 80-degree heat. Or maybe
it was the new Manhattan phone books that needed to be carried into
the rooms and the old ones carried out. Or maybe it was that the
butlers training me had a quality _ a stillness, a patience, an
obedience of sorts _ that I will never have in this lifetime. If I
could have gotten my hands on the guest who left her underwear
piled in the bathtub and her shirt draped over a bedroom lamp, she
would not be alive today.''

KEEPING RACCOON OUT OF CHIMNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August   20, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. A raccoon set up shop in my chimney with her babies. I wasn't
sure what I was going to do, but they left after about two weeks,
on their own. Now I wonder what to do about the chimney where I am
sure they left their calling cards. I opened the fireplace damper
and out dropped a few small pieces of concrete and a bit of dust.
Should I have the chimney swept? We don't use the fireplace much.
</P>
<P>
   B.E., Salem, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is not much you have to do except put a stainless steel
cap on the chimney to keep out raccoons and other vermin. You could
have the chimney swept, but I think this will stir up more debris
and scat than if you let it alone. I think it is best left as is.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have received some very different opinions about staining
my house, which is sided with cedar clapboards that are stained a
dark brown (I think it is an oil-based stain) that is not peeling
but dry; the last stain job was in 1981. One painter does power
washing, another does not. One says oil is good, another said it is
not. One said my clapboards have a solid stain, another said it was
oil. There are sections of the house that are plywood, and one
painter said it is stained with a solid stain. I thought it was
paint. Now I am confused and don't know what to do. What should I
do?
</P>
<P>
   BERNICE KREIGSMAN, Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. With all those conflicting opinions, the handyman is confused
too, but he still has his opinions: The clapboards are stained with
a semitransparent stain (no other finish could last 19 years
without peeling), and anything new you put on should be an
oil-based semitransparent stain of the same color. Trying to change
colors or using a solid-color stain is asking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The plywood was stained, with a solid color stain, which looks
like paint. Continue with a solid-color stain. Avoid changing
colors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I hear weird sounds in my attic and crawl space behind
built-in drawers in my bedroom. They sound like mice, only at night
and not downstairs. How do mice get up there? I have a trap door
but little room in the attic. I can get at the crawl space by
pulling out the drawers. What can I do? I don't want to leave them
to die.
</P>
<P>
   ALERTED AT NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   A. Chances are they are mice. Squirrels would make a lot more
noise. You hear the sounds at night because all is quiet. In the
daytime the mice are quiet because you are making so much noise.
They have found a home in your attic and got there because they are
excellent jumpers and climbers. They will stay there as long as
there is food.
</P>
<P>
   You can put traps behind those built-in drawers, and in the
attic, as far as you can reach around that trap door. Snap traps
are effective but sticky traps are easier to use. Some people say
the sticky traps are cruel, but mice are vermin and have no right
living in your house; besides, they can carry a deadly disease. You
can even get live traps for mice, but then you have to dispose of
them; transporting them away from the house is illegal. Killing
them is not.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid using traps and disposing of the mice, you can use
D-Con instead. It is very effective, and contrary to some opinions,
it does not leave dead corpses in the house to rot and smell up the
place. Keep the D-Con away from pets, people, and other animals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a lot of latticework on my porches, part of it is
painted and part is stained. For some reason, I am getting mildew
on the lattice. It is the first time it has happened in some years.
Why?
</P>
<P>
   I know I have to treat the lattice to get rid of the mildew. Can
I pressure wash with bleach? Can I use JoMax solution? What would
be most effective, and how can I keep the mildew from returning?
</P>
<P>
   CLAIRE MELVILLE, Salem, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Who knows why the mildew appeared this year after many years
of none at all? No one can tell for sure, but I can suggest that
conditions were just right for mildew to grow: The paint and stain,
which is mildew-resistant, has gotten old and less effective, and
just enough moisture appeared on the lattice to attract the
wandering mold spores that are all around us, just waiting to land
on the right surface and start growing.
</P>
<P>
   Do not power wash with bleach; you'd scatter too much bleach
around and wouldn't hit the lattice enough. Use a regular hose
spray with the right bleach solution. You can use the JoMax, which
must be mixed with bleach; it simply makes the bleach more
effective longer.
</P>
<P>
   After bleaching and rinsing, you could repaint or restain the
lattice; as I said, exterior paints and stains are mildew
resistant, but are effective for only about two years.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is to replace the wood lattice with vinyl lattice,
which will resist the mold.
</P>
<P>

AL GORE IN, AL GORE OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August   20)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So now we have a closer race.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore made the biggest speech of his life his best before
20,000-odd Democrats who wondered if their guy had it in him. They
headed for the exits Thursday night with more confidence than when
they trickled in through the sweaty gantlet of cops, metal
detectors, and ragtag demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   It was Pumped-up Al, not the plodding and phlegmatic
Throttlebottom Al, who bounded on stage to a passionate smooch from
second lady Tipper. He had to wait out a series of chants and
martial airs before he could blurt out what his party wanted to
hear, was desperate to hear:
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand here tonight as my own man!''
</P>
<P>
   Yayyyyyyy! Finally, the Ghost of Big Bill, the shade of
Christmas Past, was ushered from the stage. Till that moment, the
race was cast as one between Bush Jr. and Clinton Jr. But there was
more pressure on the vice president here than there was on Texas
Gov. George W. Bush in Philadelphia. The Republican hope enjoyed a
wide but shallow double-digit polling lead as Gore stepped to the
mike. Where GOP delegates were confident, even cocky, Gore's crowd
wondered if their guy has what it takes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore stilled a lot of doubts about the Second Banana in the
White House with a speech that was confident in tone, skillful in
delivery, larded with specifics, and most important, laced with
fighting spirit. It was the tonic this crowd needed after a week of
programmed pitches geared to the middle of the spectrum, those 20
percent or so of voters who slosh and slide from one party to the
other as the professional pols try to pique their interest.
</P>
<P>
   Now all four of the national candidates performed adequately in
their baptismal convention acceptance speeches. Bush had a very
good convention in Philly, and running mate Dick Cheney, while the
most partisan of the four, didn't do badly either. Connecticut Sen.
Joe Lieberman's folksy half-hour of introduction to a national
prime time audience was similarly successful.
</P>
<P>
   Calm, poised, energized at the right moments, and very much in
control of his pace and his material, Gore came out from under the
shadow of Mount Clinton steering a freight-train load of specifics.
His handlers say he wins only if he persuades moderates there are
major differences between him and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But it was an evening more Freudian than fractious. Gore never
mentioned Bush, except once as ``my opponent.'' It was a text
purged of partisanship, except upon issue grounds. Every allusion
to the Ghost of Bill triggered wild joy in the bleachers. ``... I
won't always be the most exciting politician,'' he ventured, and
everyone knew to whom he referred. Then came the kicker: ``But I
pledge to you tonight: I will work for you every day, and I will
never let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Every major bloc in Gore's base got stroked appropriately: for
the 300 teachers union delegates, there was ``Education has to be
the number one pririty.'' Astonishingly, the percentage of voters
surveyed by Voter.com who named education the most important issue
was 18 percent nationally. Why astonishing? That's the same
percentage as the combined total of voters who list tax cuts, the
environment, guns, crime, and foreign affairs as their biggest
concern.
</P>
<P>
   For the 30 percent of the delegates who are union members, Gore
waved a minimum wage hike, and health insurance soon for all kids.
For the elderly, there was a pledge to safeguard Social Security,
Medicaid, and a new prescription drug benefit. For pro-choice
women, it was abortion: ``I will protect and defend a woman's right
to choose.'' His hole card in this race is the choice issue: ``The
last thing this country needs is a Supreme Court that will overturn
Roe v. Wade.'' The next president may get three or four Supreme
Court vacancies to fill.
</P>
<P>
   For parents of college students, it was a tax deduction for
tuition payments. For the reformers, he vowed campaign finance
reform, and background checks, and trigger locks on guns. For
minorities, he embraced affirmative action. For gays, it was a
promise to push for a law against hate crimes. The list was long.
``We've got to win this election,'' he urged. It was populism-plus,
middle-class warfare by the numbers. ``I will fight for you.'' The
foes he named were not Bush-Cheney, but the bogeymen named Big
Tobacco, Big Oil, HMOs that ``play God,'' big polluters, and drug
and insurance combines that offer fat targets for working-class
resentment.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Ghost of Clinton receded, the Goblin of Ken Starr
crept back onstage. In a news leak whose timing could not have been
coincidental, Robert Ray, Starr's obscure successor as chief cook
and bottlewasher of L'Affaire Lewinsky, is impaneling yet another
grand jury to criminally indict Clinton for whatever. It smelled
awfully fishy, considering the timing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his strong speechifying, Gore left town with the same
problems he flew in with. His problems are his race, region,
gender, and economic bracket. He trails among whites, in the South,
among men, and the upper-income crowd.
</P>
<P>
   His handlers crafted a strategy that depends upon him holding
California and New York with appeals to women on abortion,
minorities on affirmative action, and liberals on guns and the
environment. If he makes this a referendum on the Four E's,
education, economy, environment, and equality, his game plan
envisions, he leapfrogs Bush's edge in likability.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the presidency is more than a popularity contest,'' Gore
said in his closing pitch. ``It's a day-to-day fight for people.''
He's got a little over 10 weeks to clinch the sale, and looming
between now and election are the Olympics, the World Series, and
two or three debates with Bush. His speech should bump him up in
the polls, so the race should be closer today than it was last
week.

&HT;     DOCUMENTARY LOOKS INSIDE SOUTH AFRICAN TRUTH PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Note cast box at end)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The exorcism comes late in Deborah Hoffman and Frances Reid's
shattering ``Long Night's Journey Into Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliably unobtrusive documentarians, Hoffman and Reid turn their
video cameras on South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission
and the individuals who come before it seeking amnesty or
enlightenment, without chipping away at the mysterious ethos
glowing around.
</P>
<P>
   The foreignness of the system intercut with the shocking
capacity for forgiveness is unmistakably powerful. But apartheid
and the commission are decidedly otherworldly _ in its sincerity
and ornate scope, it's unlike any justice system in the world. If
the commission is post-apartheid, it's also extra-legal justice, an
odd characteristic not lost on the film, which took home Sundance's
top-documentary prize in January.
</P>
<P>
   Complex legal explanations are jettisoned and a dizzying array
of footage is employed to bring the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission to some spiritual level, one that transcends legality.
The film implies that the law is hardly equipped to deal with the
human stain on a political incident _ as self-evident as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman and Reid assume that this disjunction between South
Africa's system and, say, the United States' would become evident
to the film's audience. It doesn't take long. Half way through you
start thinking of mourned victims of American police violence like
Abner Louima and the Amadou Diallo, both in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But if Southern trees bear strange fruit, South African ones
have something downright rotten dangling from their branches.
Broken into four movements, each involving a grisly case taken all
the way to the commission, ``Long Night's Journey Into Day'' is
about the multitude of voices articulately requesting amnesty for
human-rights crimes committed between 1960 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Each case's violators and their victims' relatives, the
supporting players and the key commission figures are interviewed.
(The actress Helen Mirren supplies the transitional narration.)
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman and Reid stitch a plaintive sampler of what the
commission sees for itself and what it can only imagine. The tiers
of honesty, disgust and bottomless humanity are uncommonly moving.
Their pain is heartbreaking; their humanity the ultimate mother's
milk.

&HT;     `KINGS': SPIKE LEE'S EXCELLENT STAND-UP COMEDY CONCERT FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Every Saturday night, you can see Steve Harvey presiding over
AmateurNight on ``Showtime at the Apollo.''
</P>
<P>
   The dreamers who emerge from backstage to perform in a
scandalous outfit or shameless weave win his disapproval. The
hyperkinetic dance troupes and near-weekly, truly soulful
renditions of ``I'm Telling You,'' ``The Rapture'' or ``I Feel Good
All Over'' leave him in awe, particularly when belted in full
gutturalness and with a soaring dismount by some white or Korean
cutie from Astoria. And should the audience have to summon the
show's dreamy muse Kiki Shepard to escort off some poor brother
trying to have a Bobby McFerrin moment, Harvey feels our pain by
mocking theirs.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Apollo'' was an entire race's ``Star Search,'' Harvey was
its Ed McMahon. As the emcee of ``The Original Kings of Comedy,''
the shrewdly executed, often hysterical Spike Lee-directed stand-up
concert film, Harvey has another set of dreamers poised to get a
piece of what Chris Rock, Chris Tucker and Dave Chapelle have.
</P>
<P>
   Between routines by D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and
Bernie Mac, Harvey gives a few minutes of warm-up shtick, ripping
into Rae Carruth (the former member of the NFL's Carolina Panthers
who is on trial for murder), stealing a jacket from someone in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The people who've been bum-rushing sold-out stadium box offices
for the past three years know all too well who Harvey and the
comics behind the curtain are. Lee's documentary is for the
uninitiated _ for folks who didn't know there was a ``Steve Harvey
Show'' or that Mac plays Moesha's Uncle Bernie or that Hughley has
an eponymous ABC sitcom about a black family in suburban America.
Yes, it's meant as a bawdy, XXL coming-out event for anyone who
doesn't think UPN and WB spell appointment television.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has captured on digital-video, shot gymnastically by Malik
Hassan Sayeed, a thundering pair of tour dates at the Charlotte
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon used to say his show would ``reach for the stars and
catch 'em.'' Meanwhile, the self-described Kings of Comedy are
already stars in black America, but when Mac pleads for a sitcom of
his own in one of the film's addictive entr'actes, a candid envy
overwhelms his mockery. Mac performs last, as though he were the
film's secret weapon, like the other three guys he's upstaged by
Sayeed's cameras and the rhythms in Barry Alexander Brown's
cutting. Laughing at his act, though, it's evident, both to him and
to us, why he's still languishing in development hell: There is no
place on television for his blatancy.
</P>
<P>
   Looking every bit like vintage Nipsey Russell, Mac comes on as
the wry, sadistic, deprecating American id, his pop-eyes roiling,
his shtick delivered in the self-conscious cadences of the ghetto's
Mae West. He's a fascinating, vivid storyteller when you can surf
the undulations in his speech. His best bits are pointed familial
dissections, the evolution of his 20-year marriage since he became
uninterested in sex and his inheritance of a relative's children,
who seem to be the same demonic kids the late Robin Harris
inherited from his girlfriend Bebe in his stand-up act.
</P>
<P>
   They're crassly funny passages, informed, miraculously, by Mac's
tough, stubborn affection, the stuff of sitcoms not ready for prime
time. It's our loss. But not everyone's: The occasional
exasperated-looking white person seems miffed that she's not
watching the Martin Scorsese's ``King of Comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is designed to follow a path from Hughley's innocuously
charming shibboleths about cheap black people and the joys of
caller ID to Cedric's more shapeless jabs at makeover-ready people
in the audience to Mac's own blunt self-analysis. Structurally,
``Kings'' is the avuncular summer-cookout version of ``Richard
Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip,'' with Sayeed's photography finding
twice as many iconic angles as Haskell Wexler's and Harvey spitting
Pryor's image like a Halloween sight gag.
</P>
<P>
   Physically, Harvey is what Pryor would have looked like if he'd
had an interest in primping and lucidity. ``Sunset Strip'' was more
or less remade as Eddie Murphy's ``Raw.'' And Lee's film resides in
Pryor's deep, inimitable shadow. It's a thrill ride as opposed to a
seminal journey and psychological profile.
</P>
<P>
   As funny as ``Kings of Comedy'' is as a concert film, it's
wanting as documentary. Who are these guys? There's one revealing
sequence involving the potential fallout from Harvey's decision to
borrow that jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise the interludes consist of their four-way banter but
seem to have mistaken being backstage with seeing
behind-the-scenes. Lee is using the documentary format to be
hands-off, as though he'd spent all his persuasion points in the
creepy, bravura scene between George Wallace and his black
right-hand man in ``Four Little Girls.'' (The ton of cutaways,
however, to audience members convulsing with laughter is Lee having
a carnivalesque moment with our own unrestricted glee: Is that what
I look when I'm laughing at these guys?)
</P>
<P>
   But the tour's name, for instance, is a question left begging.
</P>
<P>
   The ``original'' kings of comedy? What kind of comedy? When the
tour began in '97, I thought Pryor had licked his fight with
multiple sclerosis and had hit the road with Bill Cosby and Dick
Gregory. But ``The Kings of Comedy'' is new-school product in
old-school packaging. Back in the day, Pryor was as much a king as
he was a rock star, living from a jazz musician's text. Did he fall
or was he pushed? In either scenario, the king's horses and the
king's men failed to reassemble him. Now we have a multitude of
supplicants calling themselves kings. But what kind? Which country?
</P>
<P>
   The title is merely that, but perhaps in the fiercely aggressive
way Run DMC called themselves the kings of rock in 1984. The
difference, of course, being that that group had a kingdom over
which their rule was indisputable. And the word ``new'' _ not
``black'' _ rested tacitly between the ``king'' and the ``rock.''

 ATTENTION EDITORS: EMBARGOED AGAINST USE BEFORE SUNDAY 
 By J. SCOTT ORR  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Now that the last piece of confetti has fallen at
the political conventions in Philadelphia and Los Angeles, the next
downpour to hit this campaign for the White House will be a
blizzard of green.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 presidential campaign has already been the most
expensive in American history. Now, as the general election battle
is joined, special interest groups are embarking on a spending
spree of historic proportions, with much of the money expected to
fund attack advertising.
</P>
<P>
   For Republican nominee George W. Bush and his Democratic
counterpart Al Gore, the spending by national party committees and
outside groups on attack ads will be a blessing if it allows them
to avoid getting their hands dirty as the mud flies.
</P>
<P>
   Observers of campaign spending expect record outlays by groups
like the Republican National Committee, the Democratic National
Committee, the religious right, organized labor, corporate-backed
political action committees and many, many others. Much of the
money will go for so-called ``issue advocacy'' spots, the most
negative form of campaign advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know from previous studies that issue ads are distinctly
more attack-oriented than any other form of political discourse,''
said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public
Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing is more issue ads that attack and more of
them earlier in the campaign. Attack is emerging as the dominant
form of issue advertising,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   How much will be spent on the campaign? The public may never
know since independent expenditures are unlimited, unregulated and,
in many cases, unreported. It is clear from anecdotal evidence,
however, that the total for the 2000 election cycle will make
spending on all previous races look like chump change.
</P>
<P>
   We know that Bush and Gore can spend only the $67.6 million they
each received in public financing. That is in addition to the $81
million already spent by Bush and the $42 million spent by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures will be dwarfed, however, by the investments of
others. The DNC and the RNC are sitting on campaign war chests
totaling more than $250 million. Add to that hundreds of millions
in unregulated spending by special interest groups and the total
could easily top $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by the Annenberg Center, at least $114
million had been spent on ``issue advocacy advertising'' by last
March. But since special interest groups were not required to
divulge spending on issue advertising, that figure ``represents a
fraction of the total expenditures expected for the cycle,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the current system argue that the Supreme Court
was clear in its 1996 decision that such spending by individuals
and groups is constitutionally protected political speech. Banning
issue advocacy, they say, will limit free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few nonprofit groups will want to risk their tax-exempt status
or incur legal expenses to engage in speech that could be
interpreted by the Federal Election Commission to have an influence
on the outcome of an election,'' said Laura W. Murphy, director of
the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   She told Congress recently that attempts to limit issue advocacy
will ``create burdensome laws that will abridge the very speech
that the First Amendment was designed to protect -- political
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Issue advocacy advertising cannot expressly advocate the
election or defeat of particular candidates, but it can praise or,
as is usually the case, attack candidates by name.
</P>
<P>
   The ads typically are narrow in focus -- they may support
prescription drug benefits or oppose gun control for example -- and
they are exempt from Federal Election Commission reporting
requirements under the 1996 Supreme Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this month, however, spending on issue ads by
tax-exempt groups will have to be reported to the Internal Revenue
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Called 527 groups after the section of the Internal Revenue Code
that gives them tax exemptions, these former ``stealth groups''
will be required to file monthly or quarterly reports outlining
their contributors and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Thousand of groups -- including state and local political
organizations, political action committees, unions and others --
met the Aug. 1 deadline to identify themselves to the IRS and state
the purpose of their planned spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there are thousands of groups that have been
identified to the IRS and therefore to the public is encouraging,''
said Marianne Holt, senior associate with the campaign finance
watch dog group the Center for Public Integrity.
</P>
<P>
   She cautioned, however, that this disclosure may not necessarily
make it clear to the public exactly what goals the groups are
pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of this law is to help people recognize the true
identity of groups that are using pseudonyms to shield themselves,
but groups can easily be misleading on their forms in the statement
of their purpose,'' Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   One 527 group, called Republicans for Clean Air, drew fire from
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) when it spent $2.5 million attacking
McCain's environmental record in advance of the March 7 Super
Tuesday primaries. Bush denied any connection to the group even
though it was organized and funded by two of his long-time
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing with the IRS, the group identified its purpose as
``raising public awareness about the threat of air pollution,
especially from the nation's coal-burning electric power plants.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Citizens for Better Medicare, identified as a 527 group, has
been running issue advertisements against drug price controls for
the elderly for months, according to the Center for Public
Integrity. The group, which is funded largely by drug
manufacturers, plans to spend $50 million on ads this year.
</P>
<P>
   The group's statement to the IRS is vague about its purpose,
however, saying that it is ``engaging in an issue advocacy and
grass-roots lobbying program that will raise public consciousness
about the importance of the social, economic and political values
it favors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for consumers of these messages to know who is
sponsoring them,'' said Lorie Slass, of the Annenberg Center. ``If
a group is called Citizens for Better Medicare, people should know
that it is funded by the pharmaceutical industry and what their
agenda is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al Gore or George W. Bush, or the Democratic or Republican
party is identified with a message, people process it differently
than if it comes from a group with a name like, say, Citizens for a
Better World or Americans for a Sound Economy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By law, issue advertisements cannot be run in coordination with
political campaigns, but they do offer a convenient shelter for
candidates who don't want to be seen as slinging the mud
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's kind of a good cop, bad cop relationship here,'' said
Holt. ``The interest group does the dirty work, while the candidate
can continue to be the good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore are calling for a clean campaign and neither
has been particularly harsh in attacking the other so far. Still,
they are no doubt mindful that the attack money is out there.
</P>
<P>
   For the record: Gore supports campaign finance reform
legislation that would rid elections of soft money including issue
advertising while Bush supports banning only soft money from unions
and corporations.

<P>
   Convergence is a word that may evoke New Age images of modern
shamans reading crystals during planetary alignments. But for
international investors, convergence more prosaically refers to a
shrewd investment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, it most commonly refers to nations joining the
European Union or the European Monetary Union. Countries making
that move have to meet a number of policy requirements that
``converge'' with the norms of the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For example, countries wanting to adopt Europe's single
currency, the euro, are expected to have inflation rates below 2.5
percent, public debt of less than 60 percent of gross domestic
product, and budget deficits below 3 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
   Those are pretty strict targets, stricter than the measures the
countries must first adopt to join the European Union before
entering the monetary union. Part of the controversy surrounding
the euro has been the lack of flexibility it gives individual
countries to pursue their own economic goals.
</P>
<P>
   But for investors, such policies translate into sound economic
conditions, lower interest rates, more investable companies
(particularly as nations privatize state-owned enterprises) and
considerable market rallies. Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece all
experienced strong stock-market performance leading up their
respective entries into the EU.
</P>
<P>
   ``Countries [entering the EU] have a very solid set of
guardrails guiding their economic policies,'' says Steven
Schoenfeld, head of international equity strategies at Barclays
Global Investors.
</P>
<P>
   A kind of ``virtuous cycle'' is formed, says Schoenfeld.
Countries are invited to join because they look like they are
already pursuing sound policies. Those policies are cemented by the
process involved in joining either the EU or the currency. They
become more attractive places to invest because many investors pay
closer attention to a country once it moves from being an emerging
economy to being part of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The key, then, as seen in the Italy-Spain-Portugal-Greece
experience, is to get in early.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just interesting history. The potential for another
convergence rally exists now, as a total of 13 nations have been
invited by the EU to apply for membership. Cyprus, the Czech
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia were invited in
1997, while the EU made the same offer to Bulgaria, Lithuania,
Latvia, Malta, Romania, Slovakia and Turkey last December.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to hear a lot more about ``convergence plays'' in these
countries. However, potential rallies are not clear-cut. Some of
these nations won't make it into the EU for years, and some don't
offer investors much anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The countries that are now up for membership, even if they meet
the economic requirements, may run into political problems. Most in
this batch are from Eastern or Central Europe, and the rest of the
EU, which must ultimately approve the entry, may balk at some to
avoid angering the Russians. Cultural differences may delay Muslim
Turkey's entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``To buy to expect a rally like you saw in Italy, Portugal,
Spain and Greece when they joined is a mistake,'' says David
Aserkoff, an Eastern and Central European strategist for Credit
Suisse First Boston based in London.
</P>
<P>
   Aserkoff believes the prospects for convergence rallies are out
there, but are still several years off. ``Four years ago, I said [a
convergence play] would be within five years and I'm still saying
that,'' he says. ``It's always five years away.''
</P>
<P>
   Barclays' Schoenfeld thinks that Poland and Hungary are the most
attractive countries now. Aserkoff thinks Turkey will make for an
interesting opportunity over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investors have numerous choices to invest in Central and
Eastern Europe. There are several closed-end funds. The Central
European Equity Fund (CEE on the new York Stock Exchange) has 23
percent of its portfolio in Hungary, 22 percent in Poland and 7
percent in the Czech Republic. The Central European Value Fund (CRF
on the New York exchange) has 20 percent in Poland and 16 percent
in the Czech Republic. The Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Eastern
Europe Fund (RNE on the New York exchange) has 39 percent in Russia
(not likely to join the EU soon), 21 percent in Poland and 14
percent in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Turkish Investment Fund (TKF on the New York
exchange) invests solely in Turkey. Meanwhile, Barclays is planning
to offer a Greek exchange-traded fund later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the convergence play happens or not, ``there are plenty
of other good reasons to buy these stock markets,'' Aserkoff says,
pointing to good companies at good prices. In addition, the
policies the countries pursue to enter the EU improve market
conditions even if actual entry is far away.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they may converge, without converging. Sounds
downright New Age-y.

   INVESTORS SEEK CONVERGENCE PLAYS IN EUROPE, by David Kurapka
</P>
<P>
   Convergence is a word that may evoke New Age images of modern
shamans reading crystals during planetary alignments. But for
international investors, convergence more prosaically refers to a
shrewd investment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, it most commonly refers to nations joining the
European Union or the European Monetary Union. Countries making
that move have to meet a number of policy requirements that
``converge'' with the norms of the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, such policies translate into sound economic
conditions, lower interest rates, more investable companies
(particularly as nations privatize state-owned enterprises) and
considerable market rallies.

A NEW VERSION OF THE BIBLE TESTIFIES TO COWBOYS' FAITH
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JIM JONES 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Cowboys are pretty religious. I've seen them
kneel in prayer behind the bucking chutes at the Southwestern
Exposition and Livestock Show and Rodeo in Fort Worth before taking
a ride on a dangerous bull.
</P>
<P>
   Others make the sign of the cross before putting their lives on
the line.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise when I learned this week that the
International Bible Society is issuing a new Bible aimed strictly
at cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Way for Cowboys,'' a pocket-sized volume with a saddle on
the cover, includes the New Testament, Psalms and Proverbs, cowboy
poetry and prayers, and testimonies of faith from ranchers and
rodeo heroes.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first cowboy Bible.
</P>
<P>
   I've almost worn out a small, green Cowboys for Christ version
of the Scriptures. The handy-sized New International Version of the
New Testament marked by a cross and shield was given to me by Ted
Pressley, who 30 years ago founded Cowboys for Christ, the first
and largest Christian organization focusing on cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had that Bible for 25 years,'' Pressley said this week.
</P>
<P>
   The newest cowboy Bible is being issued in cooperation with the
Fellowship of Christian Cowboys and Jeff Gore Ministries, two of
many Christian groups that have begun cowboy ministries.
</P>
<P>
   One section of The Way for Cowboys is titled ``How To Find Your
Way Around the Bible.'' Specific Scriptures are recommended for a
person who is afraid, agitated, angry, anxious or discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Also included is a philosophical comment about what it means to
be a cowboy. It begins:
</P>
<P>
   ``The word `cowboy' has stood for independence, honesty and
freedom for more than 100 years. It brings to mind a campfire on a
starry night, riding the range with the wind in your face and
conquering a ton of bucking bull for an eight-second ride.''
</P>
<P>
   It continues: ``Cowboy is an attitude, a mind-set. It's a return
to a simpler time where the rich smell of fresh dirt behind the
plow or the aroma of a new batch of grain at the feed store was all
you needed, a time when a man's handshake and his word was as good
as money in the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Billings, a spokeswoman for the International Bible Society
in Colorado Springs, Colo., said it's not easy to define
``cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who wears boots and a scarf around their neck thinks
they are cowboys,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She's right.
</P>
<P>
   As a resident of Cowtown, I visit Fort Worth's Stockyards. I see
real cowboys _ men and women who compete in rodeos and work on
ranches. I've met cattlemen and a drover for Fort Worth's herd of
longhorn cattle that are driven through the Stockyards each day for
the benefit of tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But most people I see wearing cowboy hats and jeans are
stockbrokers, real estate agents, vendors, bankers, contractors and
even journalists.
</P>
<P>
   I recall wearing my black cowboy hat to a cowboy wedding held
upstairs at Fort Worth's famed White Elephant Saloon. I fooled a
young wedding guest _ doubtless not from hereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   She snapped a photograph of me and commented, ``I wanted to get
a picture of a real cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of us have fantasized about the cowboy life since we were
youngsters, and it still has an appeal, said Pressley, a former
rodeo performer who raises horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Rexall wranglers out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboy churches have sprung up across the nation. One of the
first I visited was in a small rodeo arena at Billy Bob's Texas,
the legendary nightclub on Fort Worth's north side.
</P>
<P>
   Pressley has his own cowboy church at the Cowboys for Christ
headquarters on Boat Club Road in northwest Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons for the popularity of the Cowboy Bibles is
their handy size. You can put them in a saddlebag or a briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   People carry the Bibles everywhere they go, Pressley said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I'm not a cowboy, my compact Wild West version of
the Scriptures follows me just about everywhere I travel. It's good
to have the wisdom of the ages so close at hand.

 &HT;      SUMMER IS TOUGH ON AREA LAWNS 
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    BY KATHY HUBER
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: We returned from vacation to find dead areas in our lawn.
Chinch bugs? How should we treat these areas? _ T.K., Houston,
Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: We, too, returned after three vacation weeks to find the
lawns in our neighborhood drought-damaged and stricken with various
pests _ a summer form of brown patch; take-all patch; chinch bugs;
and sod webworms. And it is often difficult to distinguish one
problem from the next, so if you're not sure, seek the help of a
certified nursery professional or lawn expert.
</P>
<P>
   According to these professionals, chinch bugs have wreaked havoc
on lawns. The first signs of these pests are irregular patches of
dead or stunted grass that are surrounded by a ``halo'' of
yellowing and dying grass. These patches of dying grass, often
found in the hottest, driest areas of the lawn, such as those near
the drive or sidewalk, expand and merge as the pest population
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Before you treat, make a positive identification that chinch
bugs are your problem. The damage these insects cause looks like
drought damage _ irregular brown, dead areas _ so look for the
pests in the yellowing areas (not the dead areas) before treatment.
Chinch bugs are only about [-inch to 1/5-inch long and have black
bodies and white wings with black triangular markings. The
beneficial big-eyed bug resembles the enemy, but, of course, has
big eyes. If you don't see the chinch bugs near the soil surface,
push a bottomless can several inches into the ground in an area
where the grass is turning yellow. Fill the can with water, wait
several minutes and any bugs will float to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Chinch-bug damage also can resemble brown patch symptoms. The
difference: Brown patch, a fungal disease, usually creates circular
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Proper lawn care can go a long way in discouraging chinch bugs.
Irrigate sunny areas that quickly become hot and dry. Sufficient
moisture can suppress chinch bugs. Mow at proper heights. Avoid
thatch buildup _ a haven for chinch bugs. If chinch bug populations
become a real threat to the lawn, apply an appropriate insecticide.
But don't overdo it because such treatments often wipe out
beneficial insects and those organisms that decompose thatch.
`Floratam' is one St. Augustine variety that is touted as resistant
to chinch bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Sod webworms create patches of chewed blades. If they are
present, you may notice webbing in affected areas in the early
morning. The worms are the night-feeding larvae of a white to gray
moth that deposits her eggs on the lawn in late afternoon or early
evening. During the day, the worms burrow into the turf and the
layer of thatch. To discourage, rake up dead grass and thatch.
After the next mowing, rake again. New, green blades may reappear,
especially in well-maintained lawns.
</P>
<P>
   To test for sod webworms, soak an area of the lawn with a highly
diluted soap solution. The webworms should rise to the surface. If
you're still not sure, ask your nurseryman for pest identification.
Beneficial nematodes and Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are weapons
against this pest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you make some suggestions for low-maintenance plants _
medium-size shrubs, vines and small trees _ to be planted around a
small patio that is nestled between two three-story townhouse
buildings? The bed will get about 3{-4 hours of daily sunlight. _
S.B., Houston, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Ornamental trees to consider for your patio include the
Chinese fringe tree (Chionanthus retusas), a beautiful spring
bloomer that produces showy, 4-inch flower clusters and matures to
15 to 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican plum (Prunus mexicana) is a 15- to 35-foot,
drought-tolerant native that also tolerates clay soil and will give
you fragrant white blooms in early spring that will fade to pale
pink and small purple plums for the birds or for jelly. Its trunk
bark ages to a blue-gray.
</P>
<P>
   The gumbo-tolerant parsley hawthorn (Crataegus Marshallii) has
white spring flowers, parsley-shaped bright green foliage and fall
color. The Texas redbud (Cercis canadensis var. texensis) is a
drought-tolerant native that provides masses of tiny rose-pink
blooms in early spring. The foliage is glossy and rounder than that
of other redbuds.
</P>
<P>
   Medium-sized shrubs you might consider include Gardenia
jasminoides `Veitchii,' a 3- to 4-foot compact shrub with 1- to
2-inch fragrant white blooms. Give these good drainage and an
organically enriched soil. Abelia grandiflor `Francis Mason' (or
other lower-growing abelias) matures to a height of about 4 feet.
This evergreen shrub has graceful, arching branches with dense,
glossy foliage that is bronze when new. Leaves become dark green,
then bronze again in the fall. The delicate, bell-shaped,
pinkish-white blooms appear late spring to fall. Abelia tolerates
partial sun and is drought-resistant but likes water when the soil
is dry.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese mahonia (Mahonia fortunei) is an attractive evergreen
good for shade or filtered sunlight. The yellow flowers are
followed by blue berries that are food for the birds. The
pest-resistant Chinese mahonia likes an organically enriched soil
that drains well. Mature height is about 4 feet.
</P>
<P>
   A grouping of dwarf nandinas is a possibility, as is dwarf
yaupon (Ilex vomitora `Nana'), a dense 1- to 2-foot mound of small,
dark foliage. Plumbago produces a 4-foot cloud of phloxlike blue
(or white) flowers for months each year.
</P>
<P>
   I like to use Dietes bicolor and Dietes vegata for their
evergreen clumps of swordlike foliage and beautiful flowers. D.
bicolor, sometimes called African iris, produces 2-inch pale yellow
blooms with maroon-chocolate patches. D. vegata, or butterfly iris,
produces slightly larger white flowers with blue markings. These
plants are easy and rewarding. I'd try to work some gingers, rain
lilies and leopard plants (Ligularia) into the small garden as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Vines for the patio garden include butterfly vine (Mascagnia
macroptera), which produces yellow blooms followed by chartreuse
seed pods that turn a golden brown and resemble butterflies, and
black-eyed Susan vine (Thunbergia alata), which produces yellow,
orange or cream blooms, often with a contrasting eye.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the spring, I purchased a candlestick tree and planted it
in a large pot. It was about 5 feet tall and now is 10-12 feet
tall. It has not bushed out at all. Is it supposed to bush out? _
M.A.P., Montgomery, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Usually, candlestick trees bush out, and width can equal
height. Gardeners prune plants hard in early spring to encourage
branching, and they tip-prune during the growing season to
encourage a bushy habit. Gardeners tip-prune young plants, too. If
you're willing to wait a little on the flowering, you could cut
your stalky plant back about a third, and perhaps it would branch
some and then flower.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We recently moved to Friendswood, and the lawn is going to
need a lot of work. Could you tell me if zoysia would be good for
this area? _ G.P., Friendswood, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, zoysia should do fine, but I would research this
turfgrass before planting. Zoysia is a warm-season grass that is a
slow grower, but once established it provides a beautiful, dense
lawn. It is touted as drought-tolerant, browning with a lack of
moisture but responding well when irrigated. This grass will also
brown with a hard frost, but it greens early in spring. Zoysia is
said to be tolerant of various soils, but it needs good drainage.
</P>
<P>
   Zoysia does best with frequent, close mowing and moderate
nitrogen fertilization. Watch thatch buildup. Late spring and early
summer are ideal times to sprig, plug or sod with zoysia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My morning glories won't bloom. Any suggestions? _ F.S.,
Houston, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: It is possible your morning glories have received an
abundance of nitrogen (perhaps picked up when you fertilized the
lawn) and have put on a lot of growth at the expense of flowers.
Morning glories bloom best in full sun and in a soil that's not
overly rich in nitrogen and that is on the dry side. Perhaps yours
will come around. Sometimes they flower best in late summer, so
there's a good chance yours will still bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I moved to a new home, and I am finding so many unknown
treasures in my yard. I am enclosing a few pictures to see if you
can identify two plants. The first grows on bamboolike stalks, has
leaves with velvety undersides and red with yellow blooms. The
second plant is invasive and grows rapidly. The flower is like an
unopened hollyhock or single hibiscus. _ J.J.M, Houston, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The first plant is a spiral ginger, so called because the
foliage of so many in the genus Costus spiral around their reedlike
stems. The red cones are beautiful in the garden and in indoor
arrangements. The second plant is a member of the mallow family, as
is the hibiscus. It is a turk's cap, Malvaviscus drummondii. This
perennial is native to our state as well as other Gulf Coast
states. It may reach 3 feet in height or tower above 8 feet,
usually dying back in winter but regrowing come spring. It will
colonize by self-layering. Turk's-cap produces bright red blooms
summer and fall and is a favorite with hummingbirds and
butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   To K.B.: Thanks for the dahlia update.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw tomato plants in a nursery this week. Can we plant them
now? _ D.W., Houston, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, some gardeners do grow a fall crop. To do so, plant in
the second half of July and into August. Hurry. Plant sturdy, dark
green transplants in a sunny spot and in an organically enriched,
well-draining soil. Plant deeper than originally grown to encourage
development of a strong root system that will in turn encourage
good production.
</P>
<P>
   As the plants become established, water deeply. Mulch with
organic material such as compost or leaves. This helps retain soil
moisture and keep weeds down. Tomatoes are heavy feeders. In
addition to enriching the soil with organic matter prior to
planting, periodic applications of fertilizer are needed for
maximum yields.
</P>
<P>
   Cage your tomato plants just after transplanting to keep them
off the ground and away from damage and disease as they grow.
Should an early fall freeze threaten, wrap the cages with row cover
or a sheet to create a greenhouse for each plant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the back corner of my son's garden, we found a small tree
loaded with green fruit that looked like apples, but we were not
aware that apples grow in Houston. However, that's what they are,
and they are very tasty. My son has decided they are `Golden
Delicious,' but we read that those trees require something like 140
days of temperatures below 45 degrees, not likely in Houston. I am
enclosing a small branch of the tree in hopes that you can help us
identify it and give us some information on apples. _ B.C.,
Houston, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm afraid I can't identify your apple by the foliage, so I
would suggest you call the Harris County Extension Service,
281-855-5600, and ask for help. Perhaps an agent can identify the
variety, especially if you're able to take him or her a fruit. The
extension service also can give you publications on growing apples
in our area.
</P>
<P>
   `Golden Delicious' needs 700 to 800 chilling hours for good
flower development, so while it may do fine in the upper regions of
Texas, it is not the best choice along the Gulf Coast. Houston
receives 600 or fewer chilling hours, those times when the
temperature is in the 32- to 45-degree range. Apple varieties
suitable for our area include `Anna,' which requires 100 to 300
chilling hours, and `Dorsett Golden,' which needs only 100 to 200.
Both of these will produce a little fruit without
cross-pollination, but it is recommended that gardeners plant both
varieties since they flower at the same time and will increase
production through cross-pollination.
</P>
<P>
   Well-maintained apple trees can set more fruit than the trees
can support. Such excess can result in broken branches, stunting
and alternate bearing, that is, bearing every other year. To
prevent the problem, thin young apples when they are about the size
of marbles. Remove all but one apple per cluster.

CANADIAN PARENT COMPANY LAIDLAW WOULD CONSIDER SELLING GREYHOUND
LINES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MITCHELL SCHNURMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Dallas-based Greyhound Lines, the nation's
largest bus company, is again facing a financial crunch, but not
because its venerable business is declining.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the trouble stems from Greyhound's parent company,
Laidlaw, a Canadian firm that has stumbled under a big debt load
and some failed investments.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Laidlaw's chief executive, John
Grainger, said he hopes to restructure Laidlaw around its core
transportation business, with Greyhound playing a key part in that
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not rule out the sale of the bus company.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into the straits we're in, any reasonable offer I
guess would have to be considered, wouldn't it?'' Grainger said.
``But that is not our plan at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Grainger elaborated on his position in a second conversation,
emphasizing that Laidlaw is not actively seeking a buyer for
Greyhound.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company is not for sale,'' he said. ``If someone made an
unsolicited offer, yes, I would have to consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   Laidlaw has been under pressure this year as its stock price
plunged and its losses soared. Last month, as it worked on a plan
to deal with creditors, the company hired a turnaround specialist
and gave him the title of ``chief restructuring officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Laidlaw's stock, which traded at more than $14 a share two years
ago, closed Thursday at 51 cents, down a penny. The company lost
nearly $2 billion for the nine months ended in May.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, Laidlaw has not made interest payments on more than
$3 billion in debt, and this month it cut off financial support of
its Greyhound subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Greyhound disclosed this week that it is seeking outside
financing to cover capital expenses, such as new buses, and the
cash shortfalls that strike during seasonal slowdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Laidlaw had provided the funds for those purposes,
Grainger said. But now Greyhound is on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can stand alone if they have to,'' Grainger said, noting
that Greyhound was self-financed before Laidlaw acquired the firm
for about $800 million in March 1999. ``It's actually a positive
story. It presents an opportunity for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to owning Greyhound, Laidlaw is the largest provider
of school bus service in North America. It operates an ambulance
service, which it is trying to unload; and it holds 44 percent of
Safety-Kleen Corp., an industrial waste recycler that filed for
bankruptcy protection in June.
</P>
<P>
   In a securities filing this week, Greyhound said there was no
assurance that it would secure financing. The company said it ``may
not be able to continue to operate as a going concern'' if
alternate funding sources could not be found.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman said the warning was made several weeks ago,
when the process was in its early stages.
</P>
<P>
   She said company executives are now in ``substantial talks''
with prospective lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will find the funding,'' said Kristin Parsley, a Greyhound
spokeswoman. ``We just need it before the down periods in winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the financial squeeze is surfacing at a time when
the bus company is enjoying its best prospects in years.
</P>
<P>
   Greyhound, which serves 3,700 destinations in the United States
and Canada, struggled for most of the '90s. It reorganized under
bankruptcy protection at the beginning of the decade and faced
insolvency a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   But a new management team began to turn around the operation in
the mid-'90s. In '98, Greyhound reported a net profit of $35
million.
</P>
<P>
   It slipped back into the red last year, primarily because it
paid $21 million in stock options as part of the Laidlaw sale.
</P>
<P>
   But Greyhound's financial position has grown stronger under
Laidlaw, an analyst said. It spent nearly $80 million last year on
new buses, real estate and facility improvements. And having
Laidlaw as its parent let it cut its insurance and security
deposits by nearly $46 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended in June, Greyhound's operating income
nearly doubled to $16.7 million and its revenue increased 13
percent to $258.8 million. Summer traffic remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually had our most successful July 4 period in company
history,'' Parsley said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Velgot, an analyst at Tejas Securities Group in Austin,
said he believes that Greyhound will raise the funds it needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had financing before Laidlaw and now they're even
stronger,'' Velgot said. ``I don't think they're in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those situations where the trouble is really at
the holding company level, not at the core operations.''

SOMETIMES, OUTDOORS IS NOT VERY BUNNY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, not all our old bunny beliefs have been wrong: Rabbits do
hop.
</P>
<P>
   They eat their veggies. And they are _ what shall we say? _
fantastically fecund.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems as if the rest is up for bunny debunking.
</P>
<P>
   The latest thinking by a new breed of bunny activists is that
these creatures belong indoors.
</P>
<P>
   And that they don't necessarily make good pets for kids.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that they are sensitive creatures who require a lot
more care than people realize. Of course, not everybody is in for
all the new spin. But for groups dedicated to saving the thousands
of unwanted pet rabbits who pour into shelters around the country
(especially post-Easter), there is a terrible misunderstanding
between people and the bunnies they buy.
</P>
<P>
   The word from aficionados is that domesticated rabbits are as
full of personality and as interactive as dogs and cats. They are
curious, quiet, and gentle. An enthusiastic bunny will even greet
you at the door when you get home at night, rearing up on its hind
legs and putting front feet on your knees.
</P>
<P>
   There are 45 breeds recognized in the United States, shown in
170 varieties, from 2-pound Netherlands dwarf to the Flemish giant
who can weigh in at 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   But bunnies, most everyone agrees, are fairly fragile.
Veterinarian Greg Mertz, who runs the Odd Pet Vet clinic in Dedham,
Mass., (and who believes bunnies and kids do mix) can attest to
this. His son Harry had a rescued and beloved bunny named Bunny who
was literally frightened to death by a neighbor's dog.
</P>
<P>
   The dog never got at the rabbit, but just the menace was enough
to send the animal into a fatal panic. This is one of the major
reasons rabbit experts feel pet rabbits should be indoors, not
outside in a hutch. Outdoors, dogs, raccoons, coyotes, and owls can
come after the trapped prey animals.
</P>
<P>
   Do bunnies belong in the barnyard or the family room?
</P>
<P>
   Karen Dunlop Couture, a national educator for the House Rabbit
Society Inc., says rabbits are treated as secondclass pets. And
unfairly so. Couture, who runs a business called the Bunny Nanny, a
bunny-sitting service for about 120 clients, says these animals are
loaded with personality.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Couture says, ``rabbits are very quiet, very gentle,
very smart'' (so much for the term dumb bunny). And there are lots
of different bunny personalities. One very territorial bunny whom
Couture cares for growls and charges her when she comes in his
house. She has to use a broom to protect her ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Another bunny she knows, Hazel, loves people, but intimidates
and dominates the two cats who live with him.
</P>
<P>
   And Paula Raposa, of the House Rabbit Connection Inc., another
non-profit rescue group, says her bunny, Maggie, chases after the
vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that bunnies may have as much charisma as more
familiar pets, but require different caretaking. First, you have to
bunny-proof the house. Mostly that means using tubing to protect
electrical cords from bunny nibbling.
</P>
<P>
   You also need to build a bunny secure zone, a cage at least six
times the size of the bunny where the animal can get away from it
all. Here, you will want to place a litter box. With a little
training, the bunny will urinate in the box, though you will find a
few fairly unobjectionable pills here and there.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling rabbit reproduction is another important issue.
Bunny ``bucks'' and ``does'' should be neutered or spayed right off
the bat.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you only have one bunny, neutering stops a male's
marking behavior, and spaying prevents uterine cancer, which
plagues domesticated rabbits. Unspayed females have an 80 percent
chance of developing this cancer by the time they are 3 years old,
according to the House Rabbit Connection.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal bunny owner, Couture says, is a 9-to-5 working adult
who runs a quiet household and is willing to make a 10-year
commitment to their pet. Rabbits are crepuscular, active at dawn
and dusk. That means they are at their hoppingest when people are
around.
</P>
<P>
   But Mertz believes that kids and bunnies can be a great
combination. Mertz says Bunny would often sit contentedly on
Harry's lap as the boy watched TV. Even though Bunny is long gone,
and many animals have entered the Mertz household, Harry regards
Bunny as the best pet he ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Mertz says, curiously, that rabbits remind him most of horses _
in their view of the world, and in their fragile physiology. It's a
wise assessment. In Roger Caras's insightful ``A Perfect Harmony:
The Intertwining Lives of Animals and Humans Throughout History,''
he writes, ``The rabbits of the world belong to the order
Lagomorpha and not to the rodents, as so many people seem to
believe. They are, in fact, more closely related to the ungulates,
hoofed animals, than they are to rats, mice, squirrels and their
kin.''
</P>
<P>
   Raposa says her group saves rabbits from shelters, fosters them,
and finds new homes for them. But before they do any of that, they
try to counsel current bunny owners so they won't give up the
rabbit in the first place.

&HT;     DECISION TIME COMING FOR THE COWBOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BRENT ZWERNEMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ While the entrenched veteran Cowboys are
winding down after a month of training camp, most of the rookies
and ``bubble'' players are wound tighter than ever, as if their
professional lives depend on the next week.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, they do.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas will trim its roster from 88 to 65 Tuesday, and narrow
the squad to a final 53 five days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can imagine how the younger players (feel), knowing
they're going to cut this group down,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones
said. ``But they wouldn't be going through this if they didn't want
to be on the Dallas Cowboys or in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, here's a glance at the team by position, and
who needs a big showing starting 8 p.m. Saturday at Denver:
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback: Rookie long shot Clint Stoerner completed 8-of-12
passes last Sunday against Oakland, strengthening his chance to
step in first after starter Troy Aikman against the Broncos.
Meanwhile, Paul Justin's best chances of being the No. 3 appear to
be behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Running back: Michael Wylie (3.7 yards per carry), Troy Hambrick
(3.4) and Michael Black all have played decently in camp and in the
preseason, but the Cowboys can't keep all three. Hambrick should
stick because he can play fullback or tailback. Wylie is versatile
enough to play in the slot at receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver: San Antonio's Wane McGarity has finished strong at
camp, if not in preseason games. Should Dallas keep six receivers,
an unlikely scenario, look for Alice's Chris Brazzell to stick
after a hot-and-cold camp.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end: The Cowboys continue searching for a blocker _ the
candidates are recent addition Lawrence Hart, Rickey Brady and Tyji
Armstrong _ who also can play in three-tight end sets with David
LaFleur and Jackie Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line: Things are much clearer with Erik Williams
finally in house after his vacation from camp. While Solomon Page
is the right tackle of the future, the line is much stronger for
now with him at right guard. That means Jorge Diaz, who started the
past four seasons at Tampa Bay, is now a capable backup. Many of
the reserve offensive linemen are banged up, making it hard for
coaches to evaluate them.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line: Brandon Noble has seemed a little more polished
than Michael Myers in the preseason, and has had a hand in more big
plays _ literally. Noble blocked a Sebastian Janikowski field-goal
attempt Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker: Darren Hambrick took it personally when the Cowboys
signed Joe Bowden to compete on the strong side, and has responded
with a good camp. How deep is this position when Bowden and Barron
Wortham, starters for the AFC-champion Tennessee Titans last
season, may be backups? Corey Atkins, Orantes Grant (despite a
great camp) and Brandon Tolbert are on the outside looking in.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback: Kareem Larrimore, a rookie from West Texas A&AMP;M,
played decently Sunday in his first start in Kevin Smith's absence.
Coach Dave Campo is quick to remind that veterans Charlie Williams
and Duane Hawthorne, both hampered by injury during camp, will be
available. Second-round pick Dwayne Goodrich is a bust until he
proves otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Safety: In every preseason Cowboys game, free-wheeling free
safety Jason Kaiser seems to be in on multiple plays. But he may be
a victim of numbers, as coaches are counting on a healthy Izell
Reese to plug in for hard-hitting George Teague.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams: Rookie Tim Seder is now the lone kicker. No
pressure, right? Wrong. Now all he's got to do is make all his
kicks, so the Cowboys don't rush in a veteran. Micah Knorr, who's
handling kickoffs and punting, about has that job wrapped up over
Barry Cantrell, who's been hurt. Darran Hall has at times looked
exceptional returning kicks, but so did Jason Tucker last year. And
Tucker, who's been injured, is a much better receiver.

BRITAIN AND FRANCE WILL COOPERATE TO RETURN CONCORDE TO SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ British and French aviation regulators formed a
committee Friday to examine ways to return the Concorde to service
``in safe conditions'' that would protect it against the flaws
behind last month's crash near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first indication since the crash on July 25, which
killed 113 people, that France and Britain, whose flagship carriers
alone fly the needle-nosed Concorde, were eager to return the plane
to service. British aviation authorities, following their French
counterparts, this week ordered the supersonic plane grounded,
effectively ruling it unfit to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Following a meeting of French and British aviation authorities
in London, a statement said both sides ``share the same
determination to find a solution that will put the Concorde in
service in safe conditions.'' French officials have said they
believe a tire blowout sent chunks of rubber through a fuel tank,
causing it to burst into flames as the plane sped toward takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by the French transportation ministry said French
and British experts would jointly monitor the inquiry into the
causes of the crash and cooperate in proposing modifications to
prevent ruptured tires from causing a fire. Aviation experts say
that a final decision on whether to return the Concorde to service
would probably hinge on the cost of modifications needed to make it
airworthy. The companies that built the Concorde are now part of
BAE Systems, formerly British Aerospace, and the European
Aeronautics, Defense and Space Co., a recent merger of French,
German and Spanish aerospace groups.
</P>
<P>
   Ruptured tires have been a problem for the Concorde since the
plane entered service in 1976. Though the Concordes flown by
British Airways were modified to correct the problem, those of Air
France were not. That issue could prove crucial if efforts by Air
France and its insurers to reach an amicable compensation agreement
with families of the victims fail. Most victims were German
tourists flying to New York to board a cruise ship. But they also
included an American, Christopher Behrens, a retired promotion
executive for Air France.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Samet, a French lawyer representing the family of one
German passenger, said a class action suit was being considered,
though any civil court action would have to await ``the outcome of
the inquiry and the establishment of a chain of responsibility.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jean-Michel Ricquel, a spokesman for Reunion Aerienne, a
consortium of British, French and Italian insurers that is the
Concorde's main insurer, said compensation discussions had
proceeded until now ``in an amicable fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer for other German families, Christof Wellens, said
Friday that if the talks failed, the group was preparing a class
action suit, possibly before a U.S. court. Courts in the United
States tend to make higher awards than those in Europe. Wellens
said compensation amounts of about $2.7 million had been paid out
on average in past compensation suits before U.S. courts. He said a
class action suit would be admissible in the United States because
one of the passengers was American.
</P>
<P>
   Air France has said it would pay full compensation to the
families of the passengers and of the four people who were killed
on the ground in Gonesse, the town outside Paris where the plane
crashed in a ball of fire. Ricquel of Reunion Aerienne said it was
premature to speculate on the amount of a compensation agreement.

CURING THE BLAHS OF AUGUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 20)  
 By PATRICIA A. TAYLOR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geography can play a big role in the August psyche of a
gardener. In my travels at this time of year _ through northern New
England, around Minneapolis and in the San Francisco Bay area _ I
have consistently met gardeners who are proud to display their
colorful borders.
</P>
<P>
   This is in marked contrast to where I live. In the humid,
insect-prone mid-Atlantic region, August gardens tend to be
worn-out disasters. I've yet to encounter anyone here saying, ``You
must see my August garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, though, I've been voicing a modified version of that
sentiment, thanks to a wonderful, carefree group of plants. Holding
back their flower power until this listless month, their freshness,
in whites, pinks, yellows and blues, creates a joyful sight in
drooping, mildewed borders.
</P>
<P>
   Several sweet pepperbushes (Clethra alnifolia) start the month
with an intoxicating oomph. Their panicles _ 2 to 4 inches, in
light to white pink _ emit a lush fragrance that permeates muggy
humidity. Those in sun start their bloom period of two to three
weeks in early August, and those in shade a week later. A dwarf
form, Hummingbird, is only 3 feet high, and the species plant tops
out at 6 to 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The cheerful golden yellow flowers of brown-eyed Susans
(Rudbeckia triloba) usually open the first week of August. This
little known, 3- to 3 1/2-foot biennial cousin of the popular
black-eyed Susan resists mildew and thrives in full sun to part
shade. Its numerous branches, jutting out from the sturdy main
stem, are dotted with 1-to2-inch flowers for more than six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the quiet of deep shade, the soft yellow, 2-inch dangling
flowers of wax-bells (Kirengeshoma palmata) usually open in
mid-August and hold for almost a month. The maplelike leaves on
this 3- to 4-foot perennial contrast handsomely with hosta foliage.
</P>
<P>
   Three tried and true hostas are flowering stalwarts in my August
borders: H. lancifolia, H. plantaginea and H. Royal Standard.
</P>
<P>
   Lancifolia has slim, dark green leaves that are only 5 by 2
inches. The abundant flowers are a rich bluish purple, last three
to five weeks, and float 12 inches above neat mounds that are about
36 inches wide and 18 inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   Plantaginea is an old-fashioned hosta treasured for its
fragrant, gleaming white flowers. These bloom for more than three
weeks and are lovely in arrangements. The warm green heart-shaped
leaves measure about five by seven inches and form mounds similar
in size to those of lance lily.
</P>
<P>
   Closely related, Royal Standard differs significantly in that it
thrives in full sun as well as shade. It's a much bolder plant,
too, with densely packed upright leaves that form large clumps two
feet tall. While the flowers are not as fragrant as plantaginea's,
their bloom period is one or two weeks longer.
</P>
<P>
   The elegant pink buds, flowers and seed capsules of hardy
begonia (B. grandis subsp. evansiana) start their eight-week color
presence in early August. Technically a tuber but generally sold as
a perennial because it is hardy to Zone 6, hardy begonia looks like
an angel wing begonia. Two to 3 feet tall, it has large leaves with
soft red undercoats.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic chives (Allium tuberosum) are usually found in vegetable
beds. I've sprinkled them about my sunny flower borders, where they
bloom for three weeks in August. They are 2 to 3 feet tall and
feature white umbrella-shaped flowers heads that crown slim stems.
And yes, you can use the ribbonlike foliage as a mild food
seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   The September Charm anemone hybrid, despite its name, blooms
throughout most of August in my garden. Its lovely lavender pink
flowers bob about in sunny areas on slim 3-foot stems.
</P>
<P>
   Two other perennials' bloom period of six weeks or longer starts
in mid-August, adding elegant coolness to sunny and partly shaded
areas.
</P>
<P>
   One _ hardy ageratum (Eupatorium coelestinum) _ is covered with
blue flowers that to a nonscientific eye look the same as those on
the annual ageratum. The fuzzy swaths of blue, crowning stems of
one to three feet, are smashing. Be warned that this is an
aggressive spreader. But I resist yanking it all out in early
spring because of its beautiful August presence.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is what many view as the piece de resistance in
August gardens: Lobelia Ruby Slippers. This magnificent hybrid was
created by the North Carolina breeder Thurman Maness 15 years ago
and has gone on to win fame and fans across the country. Its
luscious wine red petals cluster on imposing spikes 4 to 5 feet
tall and thrive on side shoots after the spikes are cut.
</P>
<P>
   All these newly opening flowers soothe my psyche in this hot,
humid month. They may do the same for yours.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The maitre d'hotel at Coup, a swanky New American
restaurant in the East Village, smiled as he fingered the coat
check. Coup is a place of daring high-modern style, and one can
only imagine what finery has passed through its coat room. Yet even
so, this article cut a figure: sleek of line, cutting edge in
design, of the moment and yet blue-collar practical. ``I'm so glad
you had this ticket,'' he said with a smile, ``to distinguish it
from all the others back there.'' He handed over my scooter, and I
rode off into the night.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to travel everywhere for one week on these two
resin wheels, testing whether the stylish new scooters are a viable
alternative to cabs and hoofing. Since arriving from Hong Kong at
Christmas, the chrome Razor scooters, which go for about $100 a
pop, have been selling out at both Toys ``R'' Us and the Sharper
Image, appealing equally to superannuated kids and to the regular
kind. With a handful of other manufacturers and distributors
jumping on the Razorwagon, the devices have become a new form of
transit for the masses. When historians recount New York's summer
of 2000, they will tell of plaster cows and of grown professionals
on little chrome scooters, a confluence of cutesy infantilism that
made even the political conventions seem grown up.
</P>
<P>
   But on to the road test. As a mode of transportation, sadly, the
scooter proved the stiletto heel of the two-wheeled set: great to
look at, lousy for carrying laundry to the dry cleaner. Do not be
seduced, as I was, by images of dapper men and women in graceful
glide, cool breezes slicing through the hot city. Scootering is
work, especially at rush hour. The small wheels bog down on the
city's rough surfaces, and the base rides so low that a bump of any
size becomes a potential obstacle. By the time I reached the office
my first morning, a 40-block ride, I was drenched in perspiration,
my knee was bruised from a near tumble and my hands ached as if I'd
been working a jackhammer.
</P>
<P>
   These things I learned: cracks and seams in the sidewalk are not
the scooterist's friend, a polite ``excuse me'' cuts you only so
much slack and the scooterist's code is a subtle one. One
afternoon, as I passed a fellow rider somewhat my junior _ by, say,
about 30 years _ I threw him a fraternal salute. The boy stared
back blankly and whizzed by. This, I figured, is the code of the
road, at least when some crazy adult lets go of his handgrip,
posing a threat to self and all around.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as I glided down Murray Hill, on Manhattan's East Side,
weaving perilously among the scaffolds, I felt part of a new urban
tribe, joined by our insouciant disregard for the slow pace of
pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune magazine reported last month that the Amish have taken
to these new nonmotorized scooters for small errands, but while
they may be an appealing alternative to buggies on the Pennsylvania
Dutch back roads, the city scooter is a thing of freedom and menace
all its own. Ours is a hardened attitude that says, ``I know it's
raining, but I can't hold an umbrella and manage my scooter at the
same time.'' Or perhaps just, ``Yes, I am insured.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the pavement-bound, they mostly didn't get it.
Construction guys asked for a lift; others shot dirty looks,
rightly fearing for their ankles.
</P>
<P>
   When I did impress a couple of gym bunnies on Eighth Avenue with
my lapidary roll, they simply parked themselves in my path,
astounded that they had just read ``a whole article'' about these
gizmos in a men's fashion magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. Now get out of my way. Sic transit Razor.
</P>
<P>
   I also learned that, contrary to what you might think, it is
actually the stationary leg, not the pushing one, that gets the
more rigorous workout. Or rather, the gluteal muscles attached to
that leg. If you aren't careful to switch legs from time to time,
you might find that your seated position begins to lean to the left
or right, poor form in most any occupation.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, once you get the hang of it, there is real
fetishistic satisfaction in unfolding the finely machined frame _
every bar and bolt sliding silently into place _ and in breaking it
down again before entering the Metropolitan Museum or your local
noodle house. For those of us who have never had call to assemble a
high-powered weapon in a James Bond movie, this seems the next best
thing.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, steady rains and the scooter-related return of an
old repetitive-strain injury cut my experiment short. It was a
relief to rejoin the slow-moving ranks of the asphalt-bound. As a
trend, scootermania properly belongs in the category of irrational
mob behavior, like soccer rioting or Capri pants: one person starts
shouting something, an alpha male does this or that and before you
know it, everybody is on scooters. I was ready to get off the
razor's edge.
</P>
<P>
   But before I pass my scooter along to my 12-year-old son, there
are still a few New York environs I'd like to try on wheels. Right
now I'm weighing the ``1900'' exhibition at the Guggenheim. See you
there, and stay out of my path.

AMERICANS, MEET THE BLUE TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 20)  
 By RUTH LA FERLA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looked like an instance of fashion by fiat. When she strolled
out in front of the cameras at the Democratic National Convention
on Thursday night, Tipper Gore was sheathed in blue, her lustrous
coat by Ellen Tracy lending her an aura of beatitude. Gore was just
the last of the candidates' wives who arrived for their respective
spotlight moments decked out in tints of blue like so many blossoms
in a Victorian nosegay.
</P>
<P>
   There was Hillary Rodham Clinton, wearing not her customary
neutral trouser suit, but a matching skirt and jacket of the purest
cornflower blue. Onstage, before taking the podium, she received a
group hug from a flock of women, most of them suited in blue. Next
was Hadassah Lieberman, who played to the crowd in a suit whose
hyacinth hue looked freshly plucked from a suburban garden.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Gore took center stage, embracing her blue-clad
daughter Karenna, one could not help but wonder. In politics, where
no gesture can be counted as spontaneous, this ubiquitous blue suit
looked contrived, a result of canny image coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Those acquainted with the closets of the candidates' wives deny
anyone acted in concert, but concede that blue, often considered
safe and dull, was indeed the most popular choice for women on the
convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue, I can't imagine a better choice,'' mused Bonnie McNies,
an image consultant, who used to advise Gore as a senator's wife.
McNies trilled a hymn to the Democratic ladies' color of choice.
``Blue is soothing but powerful,'' she said. ``It's smart, but not
trendy like black. It suggests harmony among team players. It
suggests unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is certainly savvy about the associative powers of
color, especially the power of certain colors to flatter or disarm.
Robin Givhan, a former style reporter for The Washington Post, who
is now at Vogue, suggested the first lady might lately have adopted
blue along with skirts both to soften her image and to define it
more sharply. ``Everyone assigns a color to recent first ladies,''
Givhan noted. ``Nancy Reagan had red. Barbara had cadet blue. But
Hillary never had a color.''
</P>
<P>
   In the collective consciousness, blue is often the color of
clarity, piety and goodness (think of a Swiss mountain lake or a
Raphael Madonna). To some minds, blue also conveys true love and
fidelity. And sure enough, Gore treated audiences on Thursday night
to a vintage snapshot of herself hanging laundry in front of her
trailer home, garbed in _ what else? _ a housedress of faded blue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore underscored the meaning of true blue by introducing her
husband simply as ``the man I love and have loved for 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that week, Lieberman, wore blue as she introduced her
husband as ``the love of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Did any or all of them choose blue to make a political
statement?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' said Camille Johnston, Gore's press secretary.
``There is no consensus-building around wardrobe here.'' So, as
fashion people are so fond of saying, maybe it's just something in
the air.

SUCCESS IN THE CARDS FOR TEEN MUSIC GROUP 3 OF HEARTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HURST, Texas _ While most girls their age spent their summer
vacations dancing at teen clubs, Blaire Stroud, Katie McNeill and
Deserea Wasdin were taking dance lessons from Toni Basil _ you
know, the girl who did that ``Mickey'' song in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   While their friends were hanging at the mall, these three were
inking a concert-tour deal with Seventeen magazine.
</P>
<P>
   And while their peers were out buying the latest records by
Britney and 'N Sync, they were making their own record _ and
meeting 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   It's been quite a summer for the three girls in 3 of Hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Following in the footsteps of country sensation LeAnn Rimes,
R&AMP;B/pop singer Jessica Simpson and, most recently, 13-year-old
North Richland Hills pop gal Mikaila, 3 of Hearts, based in
northeast Tarrant County, is the latest local teen act to get
signed to a major label.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, they're not being marketed as a trio of Britney
knockoffs. Rather, the girls' music will be serviced to country
radio first, with a possibility of crossing over to pop _ a la
Faith Hill and Shania Twain _ on down the road. On their debut, due
in March, there's an emphasis on Dixie Chicks-style country, with
pedal steel and fiddles. Pop touches are there as well, along with
an occasional nod to Latin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're totally different than anything that's out there,'' says
Blaire Stroud, 17. ``First off, we're country, and we're the only
young, non-sister (female) country act right now. There's no one
else doing what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   A CD is not the only thing in store for the girls, all seniors
at L.D. Bell High School.
</P>
<P>
   A TV series is a major possibility, says their manager, Ken
Kragen, who also manages Kenny Rogers, among others. On a recent
trip to Los Angeles, the girls met with ``Beverly Hills, 90210''
producer Aaron Spelling, and Kragen says negotiations with various
producers and networks are under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sing like angels and look like `Charlie's Angels,''' says
Kragen. ``We've just sort of scratched the surface of
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes a 50-city mall-tour sponsored by Seventeen.
</P>
<P>
   Kragen says he wants the girls to strike while the iron is hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get as many things going at once, because
those opportunities may not be there when they get older,'' he
says. ``Teens are so hot right now, in sports, in music, in
entertainment. Everyone wants to climb aboard a hot bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   During an interview this week at Stroud's home, the three girls
seemed both genuinely unaffected and totally stoked by the
limelight they're about to step into. One second, they seem like
your typical teen girls, giggling about boys, dancing around the
house (they're all cheerleaders), bouncing on a trampoline.
</P>
<P>
   Next second, they're pulling out photos of themselves taken with
various celebrities, from Aaron Spelling to the members of 'N Sync.
``I'd never been so nervous in all my life,'' Wasdin, 16, says of
meeting the teen-pop sensations.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're just people, just like us,'' Stroud says.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one reason the girls are so well-grounded is because
they've already had several tastes of success, having appeared on
the Grand Ole Opry, ``Positively Texas'' and at this year's Fan
Fare concert in Nashville, where the trio performed to more than
25,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was awesome,'' says McNeill, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Stroud, Blaire's mother and the group's co-manager, chalks
up the girls' earnestness to, simply enough, the fact that they
knew what was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly tell you that this is what they've always
wanted to do,'' she says. ``And they've been preparing for it for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a tragic event to form the trio, though. They met at
Bedford Junior High, but did not start singing together until they
were enlisted to sing ``He Leadeth Me'' a cappella at the funeral
of a friend's grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a weird story, but that's how it happened,'' says
Jan Stroud. ``After that, we just knew there was something special
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Naming themselves Girlfriendz, which they later changed when
they caught wind of another outfit with the same name, the trio
started performing at places such as Johnnie High Country Music
Revue (where Rimes got her start) and the Grapevine Opry. A friend
sent a demo tape to local record producer Peter Svendsen, who
helped Rimes, among others, jump-start her career.
</P>
<P>
   Svendsen took the girls under his wing, accompanying them to
Nashville, where they showcased for nine labels in two days. They
went with RCA.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to record their debut CD this summer, RCA
spared no expense, hiring a powerhouse recording team that included
in-demand producer Byron Gallimore, whose credits include Faith
Hill, Tim McGraw and Jo Dee Messina.
</P>
<P>
   The girls also had to make time this summer for dancing and
acting lessons. ``We have a different choreographed dance for every
song,'' says Wasdin.
</P>
<P>
   The disc and tour, Kragen is quick to remind, are just the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're stars. They can sing, dance and act. They're the whole
package.''
</P>
<P>

TO CIVILIZE A CHILD, TRY PARENTING
</HEADLINE>
 
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  By J.R. LABBE 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Why can't all of us _ including the media _ give parents more
control over what their children see on TV, in the movies, on the
Internet, and video games?''
</P>
<P>
   So lamented first lady/New York senatorial candidate Hillary
Clinton in her Monday night speech at the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon me for disagreeing with the smartest woman in America,
but the only parents who don't have control over what their
children see are the ones who choose not to exercise it.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a couple of suggestions for Hil to take on the campaign
trail _ suggestions that might appeal more to some of those
undecided voters in Scarsdale and White Plains than turning to
government for all the answers.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the ``off'' button.
</P>
<P>
   It's called don't let your children have TV sets hooked up to
VCRs and DVD players in their bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   It's called monitoring your child's access to the family
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   It's called screening the videos and CDs that your children buy
or borrow.
</P>
<P>
   It's called knowing who your children's friends are _ and who
their friends' parents are _ so you can be confident that when
little Jennifer and Joey are next door or down the street, they
aren't watching or listening to anything you disapprove of.
</P>
<P>
   It's called being parents who are engaged and involved in their
children's lives. It's called being the adult in the relationship,
the grown-up who firmly but lovingly uses one very simple word:
``no.''
</P>
<P>
   What a concept.
</P>
<P>
   It's apparently a concept too hard for many people to grasp,
including some people running for elected office. Therefore,
government must step in as that oft-cited village to help raise the
children.
</P>
<P>
   So we get V-chips that are supposed to keep the little ones from
accessing programs that we don't approve of, and a TV ratings
system so convoluted that no one understands the warning chyrons
that appear in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. Parenting
tools, they're called.
</P>
<P>
   Not all die-hard Democrats buy these high-tech substitutes for
parents.
</P>
<P>
   James A. Fox, an expert on violence and crime trends, has been
an adviser to the Clinton White House on a number of occasions. In
Fort Worth this week to address the Crime Prevention Resource
Center about juvenile crime, Fox said that this country is moving
in the wrong direction by trying to handle the problem of violence
and sexual content in the media by enabling adults to parent by
long distance via remote control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental issue is not what the kids are watching, but
who's watching the kids,'' Fox said. ``Too many children are
undersocialized and undersupervised.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said that 60 percent of America's children do not have a
full-time parent at home; 49 percent of those children are younger
than 6.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is an increasing level of vulgarity and violence in
the media, and not just on cable TV and in the movie houses. But
part of the reason is that the ratings and the V-chips _ tools that
were supposed to give parents ``more control'' over the content of
what their children watched _ backfired.
</P>
<P>
   The networks ``guiltlessly infused TV shows with sex and
violence,'' Fox said, because the onus is on the parents to use
them. Hey, they warned you. If you're too lazy or too inattentive
or just too busy with things in your life other than your children,
that's not Rupert Murdoch's problem now, is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``No parent should be forced to compete with popular culture to
raise their children,'' Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman protested
Wednesday night during his acceptance speech for the Democratic
vice presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon me, but who let Hollywood take your kids to raise? When
did it become acceptable for parents to cede authority to the
networks or the movie moguls or the music producers for their
children's cultural edification?
</P>
<P>
   People who want to get the media's attention, who want to make a
statement about the garbage that is masquerading as popular
culture, can do it without V-chips and ratings and government
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   It's called being a parent.

NEW FILM SHOWS TAMMY FAYE IS LOVING, FORGIVING AND NONJUDGMENTAL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The word that keeps coming up in descriptions of ``The Eyes of
Tammy Faye,'' the new documentary about former televangelist Tammy
Faye Bakker Messner, is ``kitsch.'' And Fenton Bailey, the movie's
co-director, doesn't quite get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose it comes from the fact that people find Tammy
herself very kitschy or in some sort of poor taste. This is, of
course, what's she's been so ridiculed for,'' Bailey says in his
plummy British accent. ``I just find it very surprising, really. I
suppose it reveals just how much we judge books by their covers and
just how prejudicial we are about visual things.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie seeks to get beneath the surface of Messner's famed
makeup. Bailey and his filmmaking partner, Randy Barbato _ who is
atypically absent during a brief phone interview _ were curious
about Messner when she was still Tammy Faye Bakker, long before the
PTL scandals broke in the mid-'80s.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't approach her until the late '90s, when she was a
semi-recluse who had weathered a scandal-riddled divorce, a battle
with drug addiction, and the conviction of her second husband, Roe
Messner, on bankruptcy-fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really know the story that we were going to tell
when we started out,'' Bailey says. ``What we did know is that here
was a very entertaining person, and here was someone very different
from the public image. Contrary to the two-dimensional cartoon
image, (she) was a real complicated person.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie traces Messner's life, beginning with her teen-age
church-going days, her youthful marriage to Jim Bakker and their
founding of the PTL empire. Part of the kitsch accusation comes
from the movie's use of sock puppets _ Messner's own _ to introduce
the various ``chapters'' of her life. But the movie's intentions,
and execution, are more earnest than the sock puppets might lead
you to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers paint a sympathetic portrait of Messner, who is
seen as loving, forgiving and nonjudgmental. They're also kind to
Jim Bakker, who is portrayed as humble and penitent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is nothing mean-spirited about her,'' Bailey
says. ``I think the reason PTL was such a success is, OK, so they
talked about God and they talked about Jesus, a lot, but the real
core message was a humanist message _ and a message about love. I
think that was real atypical to a lot of other religious
broadcasters or evangelists.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real appeal of Messner, Bailey believes, is in her
open-hearted emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always criticize her for crying,'' he says. ``And yet
she's not particularly self-pitying. And she doesn't have a sort of
victim mentality. She laughs a lot and she cries a lot, and maybe
it would be good for all of us if we just bawled a bit, too.''

DIGITAL ACTORS VYING FOR HOLLYWOOD'S A-LIST

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Angelina Jolie was cast as Lara Croft in the movie version
of ``Tomb Raider,'' most gamers applauded the choice; Jolie, they
say, has the look and the attitude to convincingly play the star of
the popular video game. A handful of fans, however, were nonplused
_ Lara Croft is a sex symbol in her own right and one of the most
downloaded faces on the Internet. Why couldn't she play herself?
</P>
<P>
   The answer ``Because she's not real'' won't cut it anymore. The
busty, butt-kicking Lara Croft is a digital creation, and not even
a state-of-the-art one. But with recent advances in
computer-generated imagery, filmmakers could develop
photo-realistic human characters for the movie. In fact, the
upcoming ``Final Fantasy,'' set for release in 2001, features a
``human cast'' created entirely in the computer. A peek at a teaser
trailer on the film's Web site (www.finalfantasy.com) shows just
how realistic they are; although no one is likely to mistake them
for living, breathing human beings, they are the most convincing
facsimiles anyone has come up with yet _ and even greater advances
are promised before the film's release.
</P>
<P>
   Topping that, a Hollywood Reporter article this week stated that
Andrew Niccol (who wrote ``The Truman Show'') plans to use a
computer-generated actress opposite Al Pacino in his next movie,
``Simone.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors should be worried, right? After all, Lara Croft is
already an international star, the dream girl of millions of
hormone-juiced teen boys. And photo-realistic human characters
aren't going to show up late to the set, pout in their trailers,
throw tantrums or demand salary increases. Even so, it seems it's
the very people who are likely to do that _ the stars _ who are
least threatened by the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that the human spirit is ever something that
can be crushed,'' says Orlando Jones, who currently appears in
``The Replacements'' but is probably best-recognized as the guy in
the ``Make 7-Up Yours'' commercials. ``I think there's something
just electric between an audience and a performer that I'm not sure
animation will ever (equal). You're going to have to do it through
voice, and you're going to have to do it through the programmer
putting in those nuances that seem particularly human, but all
those things come back to the human spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Others agree. ``I don't think there's a lot of concern among
principal actors,'' says Allen Weingartner of the Screen Actors
Guild. ``There's sort of a human spark that they have that a
digital character can't provide.''
</P>
<P>
   There must be some concern, though: Weingartner's full title is
``senior administrator of industrial and interactive contracts.''
And digital characters, most notably Jar Jar Binks from ``Star
Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' have already been used. But
Weingartner points out that even Jar Jar wasn't completely digital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think you will eventually see a movie with one completely
digital character,'' he says. ``It hasn't happened yet. With Jar
Jar, there was an actor who did the voice.''
</P>
<P>
   And even ``Final Fantasy'' _ whose makers declined to comment
for this article _ is providing work for familiar names: Alec
Baldwin, James Woods and Ming-Na, to name a few. And SAG is
watching ``Simone'' carefully, to make sure that a guild member is
used in developing the computer-generated character. ``They better
have lists of hundreds of girls he looked at,'' SAG spokesman Greg
Krizman told The New York Daily News. ``We have plenty of actors
and actresses out there who wonder about computer-generated
directors.'' (Krizman's comments were reprinted on the Internet
Movie Database).
</P>
<P>
   Further down the acting food chain, though, there may be cause
for worry. Digital technology has already been used to increase the
number of extras in scenes (recent examples include ``The Patriot''
and ``Gladiator'') and to substitute for stunt people in especially
risky situations.
</P>
<P>

nn
</P>
<P>
   ```Titanic' is a case in point,'' says Bob Hoffman, an effects
supervisor at Digital Domain, which did the effects for the movie.
``You have a character fall 350 feet, hit a propeller, then drop
300 more feet into the water. There is no stunt man alive who could
do that or who would even be nuts enough to try.'' So a stunt man
fell 50 feet, and then the fall was digitally ``extended.''
</P>
<P>
   Effects supervisors stress that movies are a collaborative
process, and the effects are just part of the process. They're not
in the business to make Frankenstein creations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'd ever want to put an actor out of work,''
says Chris Mitchell of Industrial Light and Magic, George Lucas'
effects house. ``People may want to create substitutes just because
they can, but I don't see it.'' Mitchell, in fact, recently worked
in tandem with an actor-director: He was lead animator on Clint
Eastwood's ``Space Cowboys,'' which used digital duplicates of
Eastwood, Donald Sutherland, Tommy Lee Jones and Loren Dean for
spacewalk scenes (a duplicate James Garner wasn't needed, since he
remains on the ship).
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this stuff that we're doing in space, in this
weightless environment, we had to do digitally,'' Mitchell says.
``If we have someone just hanging from wires, they look like
they're hanging from wires. Some of that stuff you can get away
with, but most audiences are too sophisticated for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology is so sophisticated now that most moviegoers
didn't realize that ``Space Cowboys''' spacewalkers occasionally
were not the actors themselves but digital mock-ups. It would
therefore stand to reason that if digital effects are that
convincing, it could be a way to steer around skyrocketing actor
salaries. But as it turns out, the technology is often still more
expensive and labor-intensive than using an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a meeting about this once,'' Weingartner says. ``And
(director) James Cameron came by and said something interesting. He
said, `If I go onto a sound stage and tell an actor what I want, I
can tell him to do it and he'll do it and I leave. If I want the
computer guys to do something, I tell 10 people what I want and I
leave.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, substitutions occur _ sometimes in desperate situations.
When Brandon Lee died during filming of ``The Crow,'' and Oliver
Reed died before production was complete on ``Gladiator,'' digital
technology was used to help ``complete'' their roles. And if it
could be done so seamlessly when someone dies, who's to say that it
can't be done in other emergency situations _ say, when actors go
on strike, as they're currently doing against the advertising
industry?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, commercials have used digital spokespeople already.
Digital Domain created Mya, a computer-generated personality, for a
Motorola campaign. ``It premiered during the Academy Awards during
March,'' Hoffman says. ``That was long before the actors strike, I
might add. And even in the case of that commercial, we worked with
an actress to provide the movements and the voice.'' And
apparently, you can be too realistic: ``It was so real,'' Hoffman
says, ``that the client actually asked us to make it more cyber.''
</P>
<P>
   Effects technicians see the co-existence of actors and digital
characters as nothing new; after all, Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse
became stars, and didn't usurp real actors. The time may indeed
come when digitally created actors who look and act like real
humans will be widely accepted by audiences. But neither actors nor
computer effects pros see the real, live movie star going away soon
_ especially since today's passion for celebrities is fueled as
much by what stars do offscreen as on.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, says Jones, there's one very good reason why Hollywood
isn't likely to reach ``Matrix''-like levels of digital dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think that the machine technology is gonna take
over,'' he says. ``But somehow, they forget that we're running
those machines.''

AUTOMAKERS PAYING THE PRICE OF HIGHER RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 20)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ When automakers brought out their 2000 models last
fall, executives were jubilant. Their companies were enjoying
record sales, and the Federal Reserve's two interest rate increases
seemed to be having little effect; the manufacturers simply offset
them by subsidizing their discounted auto loans more heavily.
</P>
<P>
   Auto sales remain strong, but the optimism has faded. Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has pushed up short-term interest
rates four more times since last autumn. Trying to avoid raising
interest rates for their discounted loans, automakers stepped up
the subsidies even further, but the mounting costs crimped profit
margins. They wound up having to raise rates anyway on their
lowest-rate loans this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan was trying to slow it down and we didn't believe it
_ we thought it was just a bump; we'll eat it,'' said Tom McAlear,
the chief operating officer of DaimlerChrysler Financial Services,
the North American lending unit of the German automaker. ``Finally,
we said, `Alan, you're serious, we believe you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Economists are fond of repeating the adage that monetary policy
affects the real economy with long and variable lags. The lag has
seemed longer than usual for the current round of rate increases.
The continued strength of the stock market has played a role, but
so has the remarkable stamina of auto sales even as rates have
risen.
</P>
<P>
   When the Fed raised interest rates in 1994 in leaps of half a
point and even three-quarters of a point at a time, the automakers'
finance subsidiaries reacted with alarm, swiftly passing on
matching rate increases to their loan customers. The automakers,
particularly General Motors, were still reeling from the 1991
recession and in no mood then for a war of discounts.
</P>
<P>
   But the current round of Fed increases crept up on an industry
that has been very profitable since the mid-1990s. Each increase
came in just a quarter-point increment, and most have been hailed
on Wall Street as the last. One result has been a gradual
ratcheting up of incentive costs, escalating into a discounting war
that no automaker is willing to lose, even as everyone in the
industry hopes that the Fed will not act again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little heat on _ we're hoping for no more
increases,'' said G. Richard Wagoner Jr., GM's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet and computer companies now rule Wall Street, the
auto industry remains a cornerstone of the real economy. Autos
still account for about 4 percent of the nation's economy, a
percentage that has barely budged in decades. General Motors, Ford
Motor and DaimlerChrysler are each eight times the size of
Microsoft in sales, and economic output is measured by final sales
of goods and services, not by stock prices. Yet GM's market value
is now just a tenth of Microsoft's, one reason that Carl Icahn
bought a big stake in GM last week.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer interest rates are the crucial economic factor in auto
sales. Four-fifths of all vehicle buyers finance their cars,
minivans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles through loans or
leases. They closely study monthly payments, which depend on
interest rates. By contrast, the price of filling up the tank, high
this summer, has rarely had much impact on auto sales over the
years, except when the overall economy was weak.
</P>
<P>
   Banks raised their auto loan rates repeatedly over the last year
in response to Fed actions. The average bank rate for four-year
auto loans is now just over 10 percent, compared with 8.3 percent
in the spring of last year, said David L. Littmann, the senior
economist at Comerica Bank in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   After the recent increases, automakers' finance subsidiaries are
now charging an average of about 7 percent. Their average for the
second quarter, 6.48 percent, was actually a few hundredths of a
point lower than a year earlier. Automakers tried to raise their
finance subsidiaries' rates last winter, but they retreated rather
than lose market share to rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the manufacturers have been financing a
growing number of their customers' purchases, and the subsidies to
keep rates so low have pushed automakers' marketing costs to as
much as $2,300 a vehicle. Sales continue to roll along at a very
strong pace of 17.5 million cars and light trucks a year, a little
slower than last winter on a seasonally adjusted basis but still
ahead of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how much longer it will be before the auto
industry gives in and raises or restricts its subsidized rates, at
the risk of losing sales. James Holden, the chief executive of the
Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler, says this has begun to happen,
but slowly. ``We have stopped matching every Fed increase and
holding flat payments,'' he said. ``Payments have gone up.''

 &HT;    BRITISH RESCUE TEAM SET TO ARRIVE, AS RUSSIAN ATTEMPTS TO SAVE
SUB CREW FAIL
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British team that represents the last best hope for
the crew aboard a downed Russian submarine is expected to arrive at
the rescue site Saturday afternoon and make its first dive before
nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-member team is optimistic despite diminishing prospects
that they will find any of 118-member crew of the nuclear submarine
Kursk alive when they reach them.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday told his countrymen
that there had been little chance to save the crew from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who has been attacked in the Russian press for the
belated requests for international assistance, said he had been
told by Russian Naval officers from the start of the crisis a week
ago that the chances of finding any survivors was slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer was 'there is an extremely small chance for rescue,
but it exists,''' Putin said in televised remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Putin defended his decision to stay on holiday when the crisis
struck, saying his first wish had been to fly to the scene, but he
had feared he would hamper rescue work. ``Everyone should keep to
his place,'' he said slowly, and looking grave.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare show of emotion, Putin said he knew personally the
commander of the Kursk and this made the disaster even harder to
stomach, knowing that the chances of success were few.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no signs of life since tapping on the hull
reported by Russian officials in the early days of the crisis
ceased on Wednesday. While Russian Naval officers have put the best
face on this chilling fact, their words have been betrayed by daily
revelations that damage to the Kursk was so devastating that many
officials believe the crew may have died soon after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   While it is still unclear what happened to the Kursk, it is
widely accepted that two explosions _ the second with the power of
two tons of dynamite _ were reported from Kursk at about the time
the Oscar-class submarine sank. A hole was torn in the 14,000-ton
submarine, once thought to be virtually unsinkable, from the nose
to the conning tower.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the crew worked in the portion of the submarine that was
most heavily damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk plummeted to the seabed in less than two minutes,
providing too little time for the crew to release a buoy or send an
emergency signal.
</P>
<P>
   Currents around the submarine, which is sinking in the mud at
350 feet below the surface of the Barents Sea, have been so strong
that Russian rescue teams have failed repeatedly to dock with the
Kursk using tethered diving bells.
</P>
<P>
   One capsule made it to the deck Friday, but was unable to enter
the vessel because the escape hatch reached by the capsule was
badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, British rescuers remain hopeful of saving
crewmembers.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the British Defense Ministry said the rescue
team's LR5 mini-submarine is fitted with different equipment to the
Russian rescue capsules. ``We do not know what to expect until we
get there,'' she said. ``But the LR5 submersible has different
technology to the Russian capsules and we have not given up hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-foot LR5, described as an ``underwater helicopter'' is
the most advanced machine of its type in the world, the spokeswoman
said. It is fitted with a ``mating wedge'' which makes airtight
connections possible in difficult positions.
</P>
<P>
   While one escape hatch is very badly damaged, the team is hoping
that another hatch can be made to work. The British team should be
able to open the hatch from the outside without assistance from
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfectly straightforward escape hatch system which can
be opened from the inside and the outside,'' said Richard Sharpe, a
retired Royal Navy nuclear submarine captain and editor of Jane's
Fighting Ships, a respected publication on military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ee to four hours. The LR5 will stop after every three trips to
recharge its batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have provided necessary data on the Kursk for the
rescue attempt, but questions remain over the currents around it.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, the British team aboard the Normand Pioneer was on
schedule to reach the rescue site by the afternoon, the defense
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of Russia's Northern Fleet said Friday that an
explosion had crippled the Kursk, but he said it wasn't clear what
caused the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an explosion inside a compartment of the submarine,
but the reason for the blast could be because of something from the
outside, I mean a collision, or ... (an explosion) inside,''
Vyacheslav Popov said on RTR television.
</P>
<P>
   Other Russian officials have said there had been a collision
with an unknown object, while U.S. surveillance equipment and a
Norwegian seismic institute recorded two explosions.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public statement since the crisis, Popov said from
the deck of a rescue ship that he and his fleet had done everything
they could to save the crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a clear conscience that we have not lost one minute,
one hour, it is very difficult,'' he said. ``I will stay until I
fulfill my duty whatever the end is.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Western newspapers, expressing a public mood of
helplessness and outrage, have openly accused the authorities of
neglecting their duties while men were in peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``The behavior of our president is immoral,'' said Boris
Nemtsov, head of the reformist parliamentary group that backed
Putin in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those dying in the Barents Sea did not merit our statesmen
interrupting their summer holidays,'' said the daily Izvestia.

SCRAWN TO BRAWN: MEN GET MUSCLES, OR PRAY FOR THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 20)  
 By GUY TREBAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   It started with Woodstock _ the video, not the event. Although
old enough, barely, to have attended the original 1969 festival, I
opted to skip the brown acid and spend that fateful weekend working
my summer job. I've never regretted particularly that I wasn't on
hand at the Yasgur farm for the grooviness, the mud and Jimi
Hendrix's wah-wah pedal, although the rampant nudity sounded like
fun. I had no idea how much fun until a friend invited me over
recently to watch the documentary film on television.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's a cheap gimmick to quote Oscar Wilde when you've got
hold of a tricky thesis, but you'll forgive me, I hope, for
invoking him here. ``It is only shallow people who do not judge by
appearances,'' Wilde wrote in ``The Picture of Dorian Gray.'' And
watching ``Woodstock,'' it was hard to keep from thinking that
there was something important to be learned from the way people
appeared 30 years back. I don't mean the crocheted ponchos and
granny glasses. I mean anatomically.
</P>
<P>
   People were much thinner then, especially guys. They had lean
torsos and narrow shoulders and scrawny legs. A lot of them had
stoner's swayback, but that's a separate issue. It occurred to me
watching ``Woodstock'' that I'd happened on a piece of evidence
documenting a powerful change in the social landscape. You have
only to check out MTV's perennially rerun spring break special to
see how radical the evolution in men's bodies has been.
</P>
<P>
   The age cohort on spring break is the same as at Woodstock. Any
similarity ends with that. Where the average 20-year-old man at
Woodstock had a body that looked fine by most objective standards,
that same man today would be judged a pathetic dweeb. The women,
too, look different, of course, although not as markedly. Even
braless hippie chicks knew pretty well what the culture expected of
them.
</P>
<P>
   But hold a picture of the Woodstock man alongside the MTV guy,
and you'll be shocked by the difference. Where one has a perfectly
agreeable pectoral arrangement, the other resembles a Playtex
model. Where one has a flat stomach, the other possesses an
abdominal six-pack with musculature that looks acid-etched.
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock guys were all thin in the fashionably groovy
scrawny/sexy/semiwasted rock star mode, while the contemporary guy
resembles a plastic action figure. His is the image of a recent New
Yorker cartoon in which a woman replies to a hunk's barroom
approach by saying, ``Sure, we can have dinner,'' but only if his
breasts sign a ``noncompete clause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine today's kids trying to fit into those
Woodstock clothes?'' asks Lou Schuler, fitness editor for Men's
Health, a mass market monthly published by Rodale. Rodale, you may
recall, is the Pennsylvania-based press founded on a roster of
organic gardening journals. Now, with the phenomenally successful
Men's Health and its new teen-age spinoff, MH-18, it has become a
publisher of what amounts to eugenics primers _ wish books whose
surrealistically godlike cover models provide, as Schuler says,
``the definitive cultural icon of masculinity.''
</P>
<P>
   That icon has a thin waist and wide shoulders. He has ``muscles
that you can see from 50 feet away,'' Schuler says. Never mind, he
adds, that the actual models chosen for Men's Health covers are
members not only of a self-selecting minority but of one that's
``super genetically gifted.'' Few men are physically able to
achieve a tiny waist, a washboard stomach and a massive torso,
Schuler concedes, adding: ``It's not necessarily an unreachable
ideal. But it's an ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of that ideal is the subject of ``The Adonis
Complex'' (Free Press), a new book that tries to demonstrate how
concerns about body image have come to dominate, and tyrannize,
many American men.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that there's a much greater emphasis on
male body image than there was a generation ago,'' said Dr.
Harrison G. Pope Jr., one of the book's three authors and a
professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the iconographically innocent era of Woodstock, Pope
said, ``men didn't go to the gym five days a week.'' They didn't
employ personal trainers, measure themselves in terms of body fat
percentage or spend $2 billion a year on commercial gym
memberships, and $2 billion more on home exercise equipment.
</P>
<P>
   They probably read Rolling Stone, too, not muscle magazines. But
now even Wenner Media, Rolling Stone's parent company, has gotten
into the fitness act, publishing its own regular exhortations, in
Men's Journal, on how to achieve six-pack abdominals and a pert
behind.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, ``The Adonis Complex'' reports, American men underwent
690,361 cosmetic surgical procedures, including 217,083 hair
transplant operations and 54,106 liposuction procedures, not to
mention surgery to augment their pectoral muscles, their buttocks,
their calves and even their penises. A recent survey conducted by
Dr. Charles Ysalis, a Pennsylvania State University researcher,
also found that _ beyond the steroid abuses now considered
commonplace among the adult male population _ 40 percent of
American boys 12 and over report that they have experimented with,
or plan to use, anabolic steroids to look better naked, as the gym
ads say.
</P>
<P>
   Many men, in other words, seem to be suffering a crisis of
identity whose remedy is apparently to become cartoons. None of
this would particularly shock women, who are accustomed to
negotiating a reasonable self-image against body ideals that might
include such implausible models as Barbie and Calista Flockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``For men there's something new in all this,'' said Susan Bordo,
a humanities professor at the University of Kentucky and the author
of ``The Male Body'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, 2000). On the one
hand, Bordo said, men now ``can experience the pleasure of
self-display, a pleasure that women have always known, that
experience of your body as the erotic center of the world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But that pleasure is not without cost: many men are now
developing women's maladies _ a cruel cultural trick if ever there
was one. ``There's a serious increase of eating disorders among
men,'' Bordo said, ``of steroid abuse, of exercise compulsion.''
</P>
<P>
   One result is the beefcake parade you'll see at New York-area
beaches these last weekends of summer. At Jones Beach recently,
there were enough supermanly specimens to give Charles Atlas the
willies. Similarly at Fire Island Pines, the beach resembled a
``Gladiator'' casting call. Even at Robert Moses State Park _ never
much of a muscle beach _ there was so much hypertrophy on display
that most guys with ordinary physiques took refuge behind their
Igloo coolers.
</P>
<P>
   When Jane Pratt, the editor of Jane, began planning the
magazine's August beefcake issue, her intention was parodic. ``The
idea was to poke fun at Playboy,'' she said. ``We made lists of
questions like you'd find in the Playboy centerfold: `What's your
biggest turn-on?' Things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The actors and models approached for the issue were let in on
the conceit, and told they would be photographed nearly naked in
come-hither poses. ``Most of these guys are in good shape to begin
with,'' Pratt said. ``Our idea was to have fun with reverse sexism.
But I ended up feeling so bad for these guys, for how distorted
their body images were. We've featured women in bathing suits
plenty of times, but we've never gotten so many calls from subjects
begging us to airbrush their pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Even models with buff bodies were paranoid about love handles.
They wanted signed agreements that gave them the right to see how
the other men looked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Men's Health started doing covers that said, `Get abs
like this in 10 days!''' Pratt recalled, ``it was a first in terms
of putting pressures on men that women's magazines have always
promoted. It's been at a ridiculous level for women for so long. I
remember when it was just women who were obsessing over every
square inch of their bodies. Now, men are going to that place where
women always were. It's not that much fun here. I think we should
all get out.''

&HT;     FAMILY HOLDING AUTHORITIES AT BAY THREATEN `CIVIL WAR' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DICK REAVIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRINIDAD, Texas _ John Joe Gray, a smiling, bearded man of 51,
says that for years, ``I've been preparing for the tribulation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that my tribulation came a little early,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gray speaks in the past tense: His tribulation (something that
causes suffering) began with his arrest in December on charges of
assaulting a peace officer. Released on bond after 15 days in jail,
he returned to his 47-acre farm on the Trinity River to consult
with his wife, Alicia, and the couple's six adult children _ and,
Gray says, with God _ about what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   The family decided he shouldn't cooperate further with the
authorities, even if that meant becoming a bond violator, even if
that meant resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Grays decided to resist, with arms, if law
enforcement officers make any move upon them. They apparently have
dug in on the farm, saying they fear a repeat of the federal raids
on the home of a white supremacist in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and the
Branch Davidian cult compound near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country is fixing to be in a civil war. If they come
right onto us, I think that that could start it,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're taking volunteers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Henderson County, the area southeast of Dallas
where the farm is located, now are considering what they can do to
get Gray and a daughter, Lisa, to court.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Gray failed to appear for a child custody hearing following
her divorce from Keith Tarkington, of Gun Barrel City, some 15
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's two children, over whom Tarkington won custody, are
presumed to be on the Gray family property, and Tarkington is
demanding the authorities deliver them to him.
</P>
<P>
   John Joe Gray said he does not plan to surrender the children,
``as long as God allows us to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will they send children to the safety of child welfare
authorities _ even if officials rush their property in a blaze of
gunfire, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``God didn't put them in charge to raise our children. We're
supposed to raise them,'' he said. ``I am more afraid of God than
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the adults carries a firearm, as well as a bayonet.
Though they have no electricity, in the name of self-sufficiency,
they have rigged generators. The Grays have built sandbag
fortifications, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what I expected,'' said Gary Thomas, the chief
investigator for the district attorney in neighboring Anderson
County. ``Several (reporters) have told me that they have actually
seen people walking around with sidearms and they have actually
talked to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers Gray mentions are apparently beginning to filter
in. Two camouflage-clad sympathizers were guarding the property's
southern perimeter Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The looming standoff, John Joe Gray said, is for him the
culmination of years of prayer, Bible study and militia activism.
``God gave us our rights, and the government was put here to
protect them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the government, he said, has denied constitutional rights
because it is now under the control of ``international bankers, the
New World Order, the Masons and the Illuminati.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray has been a familiar figure at the Henderson County
Courthouse in recent years, sometimes as a protester, sometimes as
a concerned citizen and sometimes as a defendant facing minor
charges. He has been arrested on charges of lacking a driver's
license and not placing Texas plates on his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   He explains that he does not want to be a part of the
``Babylonian government,'' a biblical reference to an apostate
regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to get my driver's license renewed, eight or 10
years ago, they asked me for a Social Security number. I showed
them that on the back of the card it says that Social Security
numbers are not supposed to be used for identification, and so they
issued me the license, anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the last time I went, they insisted on the number. I don't
use that number, because I don't want to be a part of the federal
system.''
</P>
<P>
   He also does not pay income tax, although he views county taxes
as just.
</P>
<P>
   As Gray and his children, mostly in their 20s, eye the tree line
where they believe the authorities have set up surveillance, Alicia
Gray talks about her life.
</P>
<P>
   She and John Joe married 32 years ago, when she was 16 and he
was 18. ``We have never been separated once,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life was hard at first,'' she said. ``We had to live with my
mother and stepfather until we got our first house. We had to pay
$50 a month for that house, and for awhile, we didn't ever know
where the $50 would come from.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joe soon founded a home-building company, she said. Some 15
years ago, they sold the property on which its office stood to buy
their spread along the Trinity.
</P>
<P>
   If authorities move upon the family, she said: ``I don't want to
die, I want to see my grandchildren grown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But whatever happens here,'' she said, ``the world is going to
see that God is Lord of Lords and King of Kings.''

 &HT;    BRITISH RESCUE TEAM SET TO ARRIVE, AS RUSSIAN ATTEMPTS TO SAVE
SUB CREW FAIL
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British team that represents the last best hope for
the crew aboard a downed Russian submarine is expected to arrive at
the rescue site Saturday afternoon and make its first dive before
nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-member team is optimistic despite diminishing prospects
that they will find any of 118-member crew of the nuclear submarine
Kursk alive when they reach them.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday told his countrymen
that there had been little chance to save the crew from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who has been attacked in the Russian press for the
belated requests for international assistance, said he had been
told by Russian Naval officers from the start of the crisis a week
ago that the chances of finding any survivors was slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer was 'there is an extremely small chance for rescue,
but it exists,''' Putin said in televised remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Putin defended his decision to stay on holiday when the crisis
struck, saying his first wish had been to fly to the scene, but he
had feared he would hamper rescue work. ``Everyone should keep to
his place,'' he said slowly, and looking grave.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare show of emotion, Putin said he knew personally the
commander of the Kursk and this made the disaster even harder to
stomach, knowing that the chances of success were few.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no signs of life since tapping on the hull
reported by Russian officials in the early days of the crisis
ceased on Wednesday. While Russian Naval officers have put the best
face on this chilling fact, their words have been betrayed by daily
revelations that damage to the Kursk was so devastating that many
officials believe the crew may have died soon after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   While it is still unclear what happened to the Kursk, it is
widely accepted that two explosions _ the second with the power of
two tons of dynamite _ were reported from Kursk at about the time
the Oscar-class submarine sank. A hole was torn in the 14,000-ton
submarine, once thought to be virtually unsinkable, from the nose
to the conning tower.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the crew worked in the portion of the submarine that was
most heavily damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk plummeted to the seabed in less than two minutes,
providing too little time for the crew to release a buoy or send an
emergency signal.
</P>
<P>
   Currents around the submarine, which is sinking in the mud at
350 feet below the surface of the Barents Sea, have been so strong
that Russian rescue teams have failed repeatedly to dock with the
Kursk using tethered diving bells.
</P>
<P>
   One capsule made it to the deck Friday, but was unable to enter
the vessel because the escape hatch reached by the capsule was
badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, British rescuers remain hopeful of saving
crewmembers.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the British Defense Ministry said the rescue
team's LR5 mini-submarine is fitted with different equipment to the
Russian rescue capsules. ``We do not know what to expect until we
get there,'' she said. ``But the LR5 submersible has different
technology to the Russian capsules and we have not given up hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-foot LR5, described as an ``underwater helicopter'' is
the most advanced machine of its type in the world, the spokeswoman
said. It is fitted with a ``mating wedge'' which makes airtight
connections possible in difficult positions.
</P>
<P>
   While one escape hatch is very badly damaged, the team is hoping
that another hatch can be made to work. The British team should be
able to open the hatch from the outside without assistance from
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfectly straightforward escape hatch system which can
be opened from the inside and the outside,'' said Richard Sharpe, a
retired Royal Navy nuclear submarine captain and editor of Jane's
Fighting Ships, a respected publication on military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Even if everything works, it is a high-risk operation, Sharpe
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has ever done it and lived from 350 feet,'' except
under carefully controlled test conditions with expert divers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the rescue team arrives, a remote-operated mini-submarine
equipped with television cameras will be sent down to clear away
debris and also inspect the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   Once it is established that the hatch is accessible, the LR5,
with two pilots and three Russian medical and technical experts,
would descend to link with the submarine's hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Excess water would be pumped out before the entry hatches of the
Kursk and the LR5 are opened. It is thought that the hatch to the
rear of the conning tower will be used as the Kursk has suffered
considerable damage to its fore-sections.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian team would then enter with bottled oxygen and
breathing equipment. Only when they are inside and have assessed
the state of the crew will it be possible to know how long the
rescue will take.
</P>
<P>
   Any survivors would be brought to the surface 16 at a time _ a
round trip taking three to four hours. The LR5 will stop after
every three trips to recharge its batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have provided necessary data on the Kursk for the
rescue attempt, but questions remain over the currents around it.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, the British team aboard the Normand Pioneer was on
schedule to reach the rescue site by the afternoon, the defense
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of Russia's Northern Fleet said Friday that an
explosion had crippled the Kursk, but he said it wasn't clear what
caused the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an explosion inside a compartment of the submarine,
but the reason for the blast could be because of something from the
outside, I mean a collision, or ... (an explosion) inside,''
Vyacheslav Popov said on RTR television.
</P>
<P>
   Other Russian officials have said there had been a collision
with an unknown object, while U.S. surveillance equipment and a
Norwegian seismic institute recorded two explosions.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public statement since the crisis, Popov said from
the deck of a rescue ship that he and his fleet had done everything
they could to save the crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a clear conscience that we have not lost one minute,
one hour, it is very difficult,'' he said. ``I will stay until I
fulfill my duty whatever the end is.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Western newspapers, expressing a public mood of
helplessness and outrage, have openly accused the authorities of
neglecting their duties while men were in peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``The behavior of our president is immoral,'' said Boris
Nemtsov, head of the reformist parliamentary group that backed
Putin in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those dying in the Barents Sea did not merit our statesmen
interrupting their summer holidays,'' said the daily Izvestia.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Oxford English Dictionary decided to open a North
American office this year to document the evolution of American
English from the thick of it, it engaged a young American
lexicographer with impeccable credentials who also happened to be
the author of a 288-page book on a certain inelegant word.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Sheidlower, known far beyond the anonymous world of
dictionary-making as an energetic and accessible expert on
neologisms and slang, now sits ensconced in a building in Old
Saybrook, Conn., which the OED shares with a hearing-aid company
and a dentist, and toils over how best to define terms like
``McMansion,'' ``chowhound'' and ``jiggy.''
</P>
<P>
   (As in ``gettin' jiggy wit' it.'')
</P>
<P>
   Sheidlower works mostly alone, but invariably attired in a suit,
a formal man with a visceral distaste for casual Friday and other
evidence of shifting standards of appropriate dress. He has
nevertheless spent his career tracking with equanimity the
ceaseless mutation of the American language, often into zones that
its stuffier defenders have scorned.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing contradictory in that, he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be interested in slang or dialect or things that
people call ungrammatical but still think that there is a formal
way of speech,'' said Sheidlower, who has something impish about
him that is reminiscent of a young Michael Palin. ``Our entire
conversation has been conducted in a relatively formal standard
English despite the fact that I know a lot of words that will make
people's hair crawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because that is what we do as intelligent adults in the sort
of conversation we're having now: We use standard English. In the
same way, I think it's terrific that they're making suits out there
that don't have any _'' he paused, executing the rhetorical
equivalent of a grimace ``_ sleeves, or whatever. But that's not
what  &UR; humans &LR;  do.  &UR; Humans wear suits. &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   In lexicography, Sheidlower is an unusually public figure. In
addition to having written ``The F-Word'' (Random House, 1995), he
was the project editor of ``The Random House Dictionary of American
Slang,'' the originator of a ``Word of the Day'' feature on the
Internet (http://www.randomhouse.com) and the author of ``Jesse's
Word of the Day: From Abacinate to Yonic'' (Random House, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   He has written about language for periodicals ranging from The
Atlantic Monthly to Dictionaries, the journal of the Dictionary
Society of North America. He has served as the resident linguist on
National Public Radio's ``Weekend Edition.'' He has written
scholarly articles on such matters as the principles for the
inclusion of new words in college dictionaries and the expression
`` &UR; Not! &LR; '' (It antedates ``Wayne's World'' by a long shot. Theodore
Dreiser, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Edmund Wilson used it.)

   ``There is a kind of pixie-ish quality about Jesse, with his
white shirt and bow tie in which he tells you things that he finds
slightly embarrassing but he's sort of forced to tell you because
it's all about words,'' said Richard W. Bailey, the vice president
of the Dictionary Society of North America and a professor of
English at the University of Michigan. ``It's as if every word had
a closet and in that closet there are often skeletons. And Jesse
has been there.''

   Asked over lunch to describe a word whose definition had been
giving him trouble, Sheidlower recounted the difficulty he was
having defining the phrase ``bitch-slap.'' Connotationally, it
means to slap a person; specifically, it is to slap a person as a
pimp would slap a prostitute. But, he said, one cannot use a simile
in a definition.
</P>
<P>
   Can you bitch-slap a person anywhere or only in the face? he had
wondered. With an open hand or the back of the hand? Can you
bitch-slap a man or only a woman? Is it to hurt a person? No, it is
to show social dominance. ``So all of these things have to be taken
into account,'' Sheidlower said. ``And figuring out that this is
what is going on takes thought and discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Among colleagues, Sheidlower's age has been a subject of
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the mysteries, of course, is how old he is,'' said
Bailey, who has known Sheidlower for 10 years but does not know the
answer. ``I think there is a lot of wonderment and speculation
about this, because he's been doing this work forever yet he looks
as if he's 30. More people have said to me, `How old is Jesse?'''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two.
</P>
<P>
   Sheidlower grew up on Long Island, N.Y., dreaming of
astrophysics. His grandfather sold butterflies to collectors; his
parents manufactured ant farms, rock tumblers and other science and
nature toys. Intending to study science, Sheidlower went to the
University of Chicago. Then he switched to classics and English.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating, he spent a year at Trinity College, Cambridge,
studying early English in the department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and
Celtic. He got a job in marketing at Alfred A. Knopf in Manhattan
in 1991. Six months later, when a friend left the reference
department at Random House, Sheidlower took his job and began his
career in lexicography.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, while still at Cambridge, he had found what is
known in lexicography as an important antedating _ the use of a
word in a particular sense years before what was thought to have
been the earliest usage. The word was ``tool,'' meaning to drive
along a road. He found it in a letter written by Lord Byron in
1819, 13 years before the earliest example cited in the OED.
</P>
<P>
   The example had gone unnoticed, Sheidlower said, because Byron
had used it punningly, in a sexual sense, and a fastidious editor
had euphemized it to ``fool'' in an early edition of Byron's
letters. Sheidlower sent it to the OED and joined the dictionary's
force of mostly volunteer readers, who comb publications for
material and ship in their gleanings.
</P>
<P>
   At Random House one day, Sheidlower's boss happened to mention
the slang dictionary project, languishing in a drawer because the
project editor had died. Sheidlower took it on, and the first two
volumes came out in 1994 and 1997. Then in 1999, when he learned
that the OED would be opening a North American office, he applied
for the job of principal editor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a background in historical and modern lexicography,
which is quite unusual,'' said John Simpson, the chief editor of
the OED, who hired him. He knew the history of English, Simpson
continued, and the dictionary's distinctive style. He knew his way
around computers, and was young and enthusiastic and personable
enough to supervise the OED's stable of North American readers.
</P>
<P>
   Since starting last spring, Sheidlower has been making an effort
to include vocabulary traditionally neglected by the OED, which has
a reputation for covering literary language at the expense of what
Sheidlower calls ``other registers.'' In his own reading and what
he assigns, he has been mining sources ranging from the script for
``Clueless'' to a magazine about massage.
</P>
<P>
   Recent readings for the OED: ``Psychotic Reactions and
Carburetor Dung,'' by the 1970s rock critic Lester Bangs; a
collection of previously unpublished stories by Dashiell Hammett;
``The New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story,'' by Michael Lewis;
and the complete scripts from the first season of ``The Sopranos.''
(``This is really good stuff!'' Sheidlower exclaimed.)
</P>
<P>
   One of his readers, a Minnesota stevedore who specializes in
historical reading, has been scouring the journals of the Lewis and
Clark expedition. A lawyer in Texas specializes in black folklore
and late-19th- and early-20th-century Texas folklore. Others can be
found reading all sorts of publications _ Wooden Boat, The Jewish
Bakers' Voice, magazines about model railroads and aromatherapy,
regional daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Sheidlower not only manages the reading program and reviews
existing OED entries for American content but also drafts entries
for the OED's new electronic third edition. As a rule of thumb, the
dictionary requires at least five examples of a word or usage from
three different printed sources over about three years before it
considers drafting an entry.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Sheidlower has worked on entries for
``whack,'' meaning to kill; ``blunt,'' meaning a cigar stuffed with
marijuana; ``Juneteenth,'' the African-American holiday; ``Perl,''
the computer language; and ``porn,'' referring not to pornography
but to any source of obsessive, voyeuristic interest, like
magazines about expensive houses (shelter porn) or food pictures
(gastro porn).
</P>
<P>
   He is tracking the use of ``so'' as an adverbial intensifier
meaning ``extremely,'' but in cases that do not normally take
comparison, as in `` &UR; so &LR;  1995'' or ``We are  &UR; so &LR;  out-of-here.'' He
also serves as an invaluable scout on the front lines of American
usage for the dictionary's six other top editors, all of whom are
back in Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   After the editors decided against including ``master of the
universe'' in the third edition on the grounds that it had little
currency independent of Tom Wolfe, Sheidlower convinced them
otherwise. He challenged an intended definition of ``mailbox,''
which in England means simply a box for sending out letters but in
America means both that and a box in which letters are received.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't clear,'' Sheidlower recalled. ``They were mashed
together, and they needed to be disambiguated.''
</P>
<P>
   Disambiguated? a visitor asked. That's a word?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Sheidlower said without a second's hesitation. ``Mostly
used in computational lexicography. But it's a word.''

IN FASHION, THEY ALL SCREAM FOR CHLOE SEVIGNY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Aug. 20) 
 By BOB MORRIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What is it about the young indie actress Chloe
Sevigny that has turned the fashion world into a pack of dogs
howling about her as if she were a full moon, or a lamb chop? Is it
that she's alternative? Not quite pretty? Is it that she wears
vintage prairie dresses one day and Yves Saint Laurent the next and
that at the same time she seems to care and not care about it?
Could it be the odd dress by Alber Elbaz she wore to a New York
City Ballet benefit last spring, or the fact that she pretended not
to know who designed it when approached by a supplicating Andre
Leon Talley, editor at large of Vogue?
</P>
<P>
   Are people clamoring for Chloe because she eschews being on
magazine covers (why bother when The New Yorker already had Jay
McInerney profile her as ``super-cool girl'' six years ago)? Is it
because Gwyneth's too pretty and Courtney's too mean? Is it that
the name Chloe Sevigny is exotic, or that until recently, as was
well known, she lived with her mother in Darien, Conn., even as she
took downtown by storm?
</P>
<P>
   Is it because, after giving off nothing in ``Kids,'' her first
movie, and in later ones like ``The Last Days of Disco,'' she
surprisingly turned out to be a talented actress in ``Boys Don't
Cry,'' as the backwoods girlfriend of a cross-dressing woman? Or is
it because she has the nerve to say that she detests seeing her
face on H&AMP;M department store ads around town, but would rather make
money that way than in bad movies?
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, the banquettes are alive with the sound of
Chloe, recently labeled by Vogue as ``the New Postmodern Grunge
Audrey Hepburn.'' Of course, fashion people are always fussing over
this one or that one. It justifies using exclamation points for
something other than shades of mascara. In 1964, it was Baby Jane
Holzer, a mod young Park Avenue wife who acted in Andy Warhol
movies and who did the swim and was called ``the most contemporary
girl I know'' by Diana Vreeland. Ten years later, according to
Vanity Fair's new `` `It' Parade'' issue, it was Ali McGraw, among
others. Now, and despite the fact that Vanity Fair did not include
Sevigny on its `` `It' Parade'' list, she's It, the anti-actress,
unfashionably fashionable, fresh, raw, unreachable. Being so
adamantly anti-It only makes her It-ier, it seems. ``Born Free!''
sings the cover line next to her face from the latest issue of
Interview. ``She refuses to be a puppet for the media,'' proclaims
Ingrid Sischy, the editor in chief, in her introduction, adding
that Sevigny and Harmony Korine, the writer of ``Kids'' (about
teen-age punks and a seducer with HIV) and ``Gummo'' (about cat
killers, among other things)are the Elizabeth Taylor and Richard
Burton of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has something to say about her, it seems. ``She's like
this skater kid who just fell into the right shoes and an Yves
Saint Laurent dress,'' said Stefan Campbell, a stylist, who found
Sevigny cute when she had the gumption to show up uninvited for a
Vibe magazine skateboarding fashion shoot years ago. ``Designers
and photographers love her because plain girls can make clothes
come alive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Fahey, a publicist at Chanel, who's a fan, said: ``She was
in the store a while ago to look at clothes for the Oscars, and she
had on this Hello Kitty-like underwear and I just thought that was
so cool.'' Jorge Ramon, senior fashion editor of Teen People,
added, ``She's an anticheerleader, which I love, and she makes
wearing a beret look fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   A New York novelist I know calls her ``ugly-beautiful'' and
extols her for escaping the unifying hands of stylists. An online
editor, who said she can't decide if Sevigny is bright or not, but
thinks she's a really nice person even though she has never met
her, declared that we have a moral imperative to support her
because of ``Boys Don't Cry,'' which earned her an Oscar nomination
as best supporting actress. Another person admires her for sticking
by the collections of Elbaz, the low-key designer who was deposed
last spring by the hot shot Tom Ford at Yves Saint Laurent. Yet
another lauded her virtue for understanding vintage fashion and for
pushing Imitation of Christ, a friend's new clothing line. Michael
Kors, meanwhile, has declared her a major muse and Nicolas
Ghesquiere, another designer, who is revitalizing Balenciaga, calls
her ``sophisticated and negligent and emblematic of the new
generation of actresses.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's just a short list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it was power that created high style,'' Tom Wolfe wrote
about Baby Jane Holzer, who has moved on to become a bona fide
has-been. ``But now high styles come from low places, from people
who have no power, who slink away from it, in fact, who are
marginal, who carve out worlds for themselves in nether depths, in
tainted undergrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   From skate-rat girl who worked in a vintage clothing store to an
icon who allows the fashion world to congratulate itself for lining
up behind someone who treats it with indifference, things haven't
changed much in 35 years, it seems. At a moment when everything, no
matter how contrived, is supposed to seem effortless, Chloe
Sevigny's ``accidental'' rise to just-under-the-radar prominence is
a lesson in how naive some ambitious people can be about actresses
who seem to be without ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have witnessed her climb more closely have a more
nuanced view. ``There's something very natural about her,'' said
Clifford Streit, a producer who worked with her in ``American
Psycho,'' her latest film. ``But it's not an accident. She knows
how to project an image on the public and make it appear
effortless.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Zalaznick, the producer who cast Sevigny in ``Kids'' in
1994, observed: ``It's basically a full-time job making it into the
world she's in. And no matter what she wants you to think, she's
definitely working it hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Sevigny, who got her start in the business by working on the
costumes for ``Kids,'' declined to be interviewed. Her publicist
said she would like to disassociate from fashion right now.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vogue and VH1 are planning their joint fashion awards
show for October. Who do we think is on the top of every Vogue
editor's list for the best personal style? ``Her aura has been
hanging over every single meeting,'' said Zalaznick, who is the
show's executive producer. ``It's this fascination with unfabulous
fabulousness, and it's a little ridiculous. I mean, if it's about
fashion why not just obsess over a model? Does it make these Vogue
people feel more beautiful themselves for thinking she's so
beautiful?''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say. All I know is that these days the Chloe watch
never stops.
</P>
<P>
   The week before last, for instance, the possibility of her
appearance either enhanced or sucked the air out of two parties,
depending on your point of view. One, at the Rainbow Room for the
director Wit Stillman's novel ``The Last Days of Disco, With
Cocktails at Petrossian Afterwards'' was Chloe-free because she had
Polish lessons for a new part. The other, a singles bash in
Chelsea, featured Paul Sevigny, Chloe's
commodities-trader-turned-celebrity-D.J. brother spinning CDs.
Despite his rapid rise, not everybody loves his taste. ``Just for
the hope of seeing his sister,'' said one disgruntled celebrity
guest, ``we had to put up with his music.''
</P>
<P>
   This, too, will end one day. In the meantime, all hail our new
dis-ingenue.

 &HT;    In the end, secret's often in the finish
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finishing wood is a chore rather than a pleasure for most
woodworkers, but it will make or break your project. No matter how
finely designed and constructed a piece may be, a bad finish ruins
it.
</P>
<P>
   A reader named Dennis McLeroy sent me an e-mail a few days ago
on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently completed a solid cherry cradle for good friends
of ours. I'd like a suggestion on finishing. I want the wood to
retain its ability to darken to its natural patina, but at the same
time would like a nice, not glossy, finish. I know I'm probably
opening Pandora's box here, but what would you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   A: The entire subject of wood finishing is indeed a Pandora's
box, but if you break it down into the possible, the improbable and
the impossible, it gets easier.
</P>
<P>
   You can select a finish by establishing parameters. First,
consider your skill level and your equipment. Do you have spray
equipment and a spray booth? Are you an expert with a brush?
</P>
<P>
   Do you want a hard, glass-like finish or a soft sheen?
</P>
<P>
   If you want a glassy finish the prime choice is lacquer. In that
case, you'd better have spray equipment and skill using it, or be
an absolute wizard with a brush. The second choice would be
varnish, and again you need an excellent brush technique.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these finishes have a major drawback: they are difficult
to repair.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you leave out such romantic things as French polish, we
are left with an oil finish. The village idiot can apply a good oil
finish; I am living proof of that. The drawback with pure oil
finishes is that they don't provide much protection.
</P>
<P>
   Thus some enterprising woodworker invented the oil-varnish
finish, using various portions of tung or linseed oil, polyurethane
and a thinner such as turpentine. The result looks like a pure oil
finish, but it will provide a good deal more protection, and it is
easily repaired.
</P>
<P>
   I used to make it up myself, but over the intervening years it
has become commonly available in various commercial forms.
</P>
<P>
   Highland Hardware in Atlanta (www.highland-hardware.com)
features the Sam Maloof finishes. The main finish is an oil-poly
mix. The secondary finish is oil-wax. I don't know that you need
the latter; Sam applies it outdoors, because he heats it up before
application.
</P>
<P>
   Woodcraft (check the Web site at www.woodcraft.com) has several
oil-varnish finishes. Some even come in a range of glosses.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, however, you achieve the degree of sheen or gloss you
want by applying more coats. The process is simple: flood the stuff
on, adding more if the wood sucks it up, and then wiping off the
excess before it begins to stiffen. With use, you'll learn about
how long you can wait before rubbing it off.
</P>
<P>
   Some instructions will tell you to apply a new coat every 24
hours. That may be fine in dry areas, but in a humid climate I'd
wait at least 48 before reapplying.
</P>
<P>
   The wood will age nicely, and repair simply involves applying
more finish.

ELIZABETH NICHOLS, 47; CHRONICLED BATTLE WITH CANCER IN VIDEO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elizabeth (Tucker) Nichols of Harvard, Mass., whose battle
against breast cancer was chronicled in the video ``When Breast
Cancer Comes Back: Skills for Living,'' died of the disease Sunday
in Harwich Port. She was 47.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nichols, known as ``Liz,'' was born in Fitchburg. She
designed jewelry and was an adminstrative assistant at Paine Webber
in Boston and BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   She was first diagnosed with cancer seven years ago. She
underwent a lumpectomy and received radiation treatment,
chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. Eighteen months later, when
cancer was discovered in her other breast, she underwent a
mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. A year later, cancer was
found in her bones. She received a stem cell transplant and
continued to receive chemotherapy and radiation treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nichols was the narrator of ``When Breast Cancer Comes
Back,'' which chronicled several women dealing with a recurrence of
the disease. She appeared on TV's ``Today Show'' last fall to
discuss the film.
</P>
<P>
   In promotional material for the video posted on the Web site
AboutHealth.com, she spoke of her reaction when her oncologist told
her she probably had six months to live. She said she tried not to
dwell on the bleak prognosis because, ``It will spiral you down, it
will bring you down, and it will carry you further and deeper and
deeper into the abyss.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she avoided despair by living in the day. ``I did get
that coat for Christmas,'' she said. ``I wore that coat every day
and loved it and whether I'm not even here next year, I don't even
care, because I enjoyed it for now. I enjoy going outside for now.
I enjoy every single thing that I do, for now. None of us know how
long we are going to be here. None of us know.''
</P>
<P>
   She leaves her husband, Carlton ``Tuck'' Nichols; a son, Carlton
`Tripp'' of Harvard; a daughter, Elizabeth of Harvard; a
stepdaughter, Alexi Nichols of New York City; her father, Norman D.
Tucker Jr. of Shirley; and four brothers, Norman ``Kit'' Tucker III
of Fitchburg, David Tucker of Martha's Vineyard, Gregory Tucker of
Burlington, Vt., and Douglas Tucker of Granby.

   ADULT-STUDENTS _ WASHINGTON _ Older students are changing higher
education, and it is changing them. This fall, more than 40 percent
of the students at the nation's 2-year and 4-year colleges and
universities will be 25 or older, according to the Education
Department. Most of them work, commute to classes and raise kids.
Why and where they go, and what the impact is. (Mollison, Cox News

   ADULT-SINCLAIR _ DAYTON, Ohio _ On campus or via the internet,
students from near and far flock to Sinclair Community College, the
only two-year college among six cited nationally for ``best
practices'' in serving adult students. Its 21,000 students include
8,000 in their 20s, 3,700 in their 30s and 4,000 older than that.
How Sinclair accomodates their needs. (Jo Smith, Cox News Service)

   ADULT-TYPICAL _ Theresa Johnson works. She's 36. She is divorced
and raising two kids. She's an undergraduate at Iowa State
University. In other words, she fits the College Board's composite
criteria for the typical adult college student. Johnson fervently
believes that the pros of attending a university with schedules and
programs heavily weighted toward much younger students still
outweigh the cons. (Mollison, Cox News Service)

   GA-EXECUTION _ Alexander Williams was not yet an adult and he
was mentally ill when he kidnapped, raped and murdered a
16-year-old Augusta, Ga., girl. His lawyers argue that the state's
plan to execute him on Thursday violates international common
decency that says it's wrong to execute the mentally ill and

   MEXICO-CHIAPAS_ From the tropical coast to the Mayan highlands,
the fever for political change _ through ballots, not bullets _ is
sweeping Mexico's Chiapas state. On Sunday, Aug. 20, the state
famous for its armed Zapatista Mayan Indian rebels will elect a new
governor. In the wake of Vicente Fox's historic opposition victory
in last month's presidential election, polls show that change could
be contagious: Even in Indian communities once under tight control
by the ruling party, posters for a Fox ally are up on dirt-floor
homes. An old man wearing a ruling party shirt says he's not so
sure he'll vote for that party now. Chiapans appear to be slightly
favoring Pablo Salazar, a former ruling party member who is now
representing an alliance that includes Fox's conservative National
Action Party and the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party. If
Salazar wins, one of the main reasons for the Zapatistas rising in
protest is eliminated. Mexico's ruling party would be ousted from a
state infamous for its ruling-party corruption and grinding social
inequality. A historic new Fox-Salazar combination would be in
place that could usher in new negotiations with the rebels.

   TWINS _ WHITE PLAINS, N.C. _ To the world and to this day, they
are mostly objects of curiosity _ Chang and Eng, the conjoined
brothers whose May 1811 birth in Siam also spawned the phrase
``Siamese twins.'' But in the northwestern corner of North Carolina
where they settled some 30 years later, they have always been the
Bunker brothers _ hard-working tobacco farmers who married sisters,
fathered 21 children between them and lived utterly ordinary,
small-town lives. Officials recently renamed a bridge after the
twins on the White Plains farm where they lived and are buried.
Still, locals don't quite understand the outside world's
fascination with the twins, which has only grown with the
publication this summer of New Yorker Darin Strauss' acclaimed
novel ``Chang and Eng.'' To the folks who showed up at Strauss'
booksignings last week in nearby Mount Airy and Wilkesboro, and to
the1,000-plus descendants who gathered for one of their
semi-regular reunions in White Plains Saturday, it's actually a
pretty familiar story around these parts: The one about strong
family bonds. (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   SCHOOL-ADVICE _ With the school year approaching, it's time for
teachers and parents to reopen the lines of communication. To save
everyone time and stress, we asked working teachers and frenzied
moms and dads exactly what advice they would give the other side in
order to make this school year the most productive ever. (Dayton

   DIGITAL-COMPASS _ You may remember a time when you were a kid
and you got a toy compass maybe from the neighborhood candy store
or maybe even from a box of Cracker Jacks. Those cheesy little
devices featured a jiggling needle balanced on a pin, and the
painted end of the needle always pointed north. Unless there was a
magnet nearby or the needle fell off the pin. Today you can carry
around a digital device that does the same thing more reliably. The
Co-Pilot from Precision Navigation Inc. gives you a digital readout
that tells you exactly which way you're headed with an accuracy of
plus or minus 5 degrees. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 12. WITH

</P>
<P>
   Eds: The following stories from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
are part of a Fall Getaways package of the Southeast Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-ABINGTON _ ABINGTON, Va. _ It is an unseasonably cool,
moonless night in this historic Blue Ridge Mountain town, a good
evening for a ghost tour in this old place that seems to have more
than a healthy share. Named Abingdon in honor of Martha
Washington's ancestral home in England, this mountain town is home
to the Barter Theater, the Martha Washington Inn and other
intriguing historic places. (O'Briant, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-BLOWROCK _ BLOWING ROCK, N.C. The legend goes that a
Cherokee brave dived off the Blowing Rock to appease his gods and
was caught in an updraft so powerful that he was lifted back to his
sweetheart's arms. I wasn't feeling quite that lucky on my visit to
this popular Blue Ridge Mountains attraction. In fact I hung on to
the flat, upturned rock _ the parapet, it seemed, of a mighty
castle _ for dear life. (Hulbert, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-BLUERIDGE _ BLUE RIDGE, Ga. _ There it is, tucked into
the trees just off the road: Our pine-log-sided North Georgia cabin
with a red tin roof. Up the Creek, ie back of a horse. Lovelier.
Less familiar. Maybe it's because this place, the 1,000-acre
Cataloochee Ranch, is so close to paradise you half-expect to enter
it through pearly gates. (Hamilton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-ROOFTOP _ ASHEVILLE, N.C. _ If you're heading here to
look at the fall leaves, one of your best viewing sites might be
from the roof of the Biltmore House. That's right. The roof. The
guided 75-minute Rooftop Tour will take you up amid the turrets and
gargoyles, where you can get a panoramic view of the gardens, the
French Broad River and Mount Pisgah. (O'Briant, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-LITTLE-SWISS _ LITTLE SWITZERLAND, N.C. _ Other places in
the North Carolina mountains are better-known, but none are like
this faux-alpine hideaway nestled at 3,500 feet in the southern
Appalachians. It brims daily with color and tranquillity. In the
fall, especially, Little Switzerland, just off the Blue Ridge
Parkway, is a place many folks come for a long weekend. Many come
to like it so much they plan ahead, booking a week at the
Switzerland Inn or another nearby mountain lodge. (Skube, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-TOWNSEND _ TOWNSEND, Tenn. _ The campfire is a portable
propane model that looks like something out of the Flintstones. The
moonlit mesa is in truth a screen-printed mural. But the guy in the
black chaps, vest and tall cowboy hat, the fellow spinning cowpoke
tales as tall as a saguaro cactus, stories that roll on like
tumbleweeds,he's got this western thing down. Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together for tonight's headliner, cowboy poet
extraordinaire David ``Buffalo Bill'' Nelson. Oh, by the way,
Buffalo, er, David is also your innkeeper. He and wife Jean operate
the western-decorated B&AMP;B Abode and Beyond, here near the entrance
to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. (Pousner, Atlanta

   ABORIGINE-ART _ Thirty years ago, an art professor encouraged a
group of Aborigines in the central desert of Australia to paint on
canvas the symbolic patterns their people had been making in the
red dirt for eons. The dirt patterns evolved into dot paintings, a
popular form of folk art that has become synonymous with Australia
and will figure prominently in the Sydney Olympic Arts Festival. We
look at the field, which has interesting parallels with the artwork
that won praise at the last Olympics: Southern folk art.

   SKUBE-ON-BOOKS _ Who was Deep Throat, the unnamed source who met
Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward in an underground parking
garage at 2 in the morning? Did he even exist? Was he one person or
a composite of two or more? Was he a only a fiction created as a
linchpin for Woodward and Carl Bernstein's book ``All the King's
Men''? Now Leonard Garment, an old Nixon hand who has made Deep
Throat his personal quarry, thinks he knows. ``In Search of Deep
Throat'' (Basic Books, $25) is a lawyerly deduction from plausible
hypotheses but in the end an intuitive guess. ``It is my
conviction,'' Garment writes on page 2, ``that Deep Throat ... was
John Sears.'' (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 26

   OLY-SWM-JOSHDAVIS _ Four years ago, Josh Davis had to be the
happiest and luckiest man in Atlanta. Although he didn't win a
single individual medal at the Olympics, he struck gold three times
as a relay swimmer for the United States and left the Games with
more of that precious metal draped around his neck than any male
athlete from any country. Times change, and so has Davis' role. He
still is not the individual star of the U.S. team, but the
27-year-old former Texas Longhorn is its leader, the emotional rock
for a squad that certainly will need one in Sydney, Australia.
These Olympics will be no house party for the U.S. swimmers the way
the Atlanta Games were. The rest of the world has been improving,
and the talented Aussies will be defending their home surf in a
country that's fanatical about the sport. ``Everyone's talking
about swimming there. It's kind of like the NBA and NFL over
here,'' said Olympic swim coach Richard Quick. (Maher, Austin
American-Statesman). 35.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-SWM-TEXAS _ At the recent U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials there
were times when there were so many Longhorns in the final it was a
wonder they didn't turn the pool orange. The Three Amigos, seniors
Jamie Rauch, Scott Goldblatt and Nate Dusing, all finished in the
top six in the 200 meter freestyle and are eligible to swim on the
U.S.'s 800 meter relay team in Sydney. The 100 meter butterfly was
another Texas affair with Longhorn recruit Ian Crocker beating
Tommy Hannan. If you count Gary Hall, who had a cup of coffee at
Texas, eight of the 24 men selected to the team were either former,
current or incoming Longhorns. And there were a rash of Texas
swimmers who didn't make the team but still turned in impressive
performances, including incoming freshman Brendan Hansen, who
finished third in both the 100 and 200 meter breaststroke. (Maher,
Austin American-Statesman). 24.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-BKO-FORTNER _ Former Longhorn basketball standout Nell
Fortner has a big task at hand. She is head coach of the U.S.
women's Olympic basketball team. Like the men's national team, they
are expected to return home from the 2000 Summer Olympics in
Sydney, Australia next month with a gold medal ? and nothing else
but souvenirs. But the U.S.'s trip to the Olympics every four years
in basketball is not as easy as it used to be, as other countires
have colsed the talent gap. There's as much pressure on Fortner to
carry on a tradition of dominance as on her 12-player superstar
roster. She's looking forward to it. (Estwick, Austin

   GORE _ GORELA CROSSE, Wis. _ Al Gore and running mate, Sen.

   SYRIA-TRAVEL _ DAMASCUS, Syria _ From the ornate tomb of the

the best of classic Arab and Moslem culture. Visitors can step back
in time, dining in courtyards enclosed by the black and red blocks
of classic Arab architecture and touring dozens of castles in the
countryside. There's no McDonald's and little Coca-Cola, but you
can shop for dehydrated Newts in the medicinal herb stalls of the

family members were encased behind eerie carvings of their

Palmyra, about 4,000 years old, is still only lightly visited.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ WACO, Texas _ Since Texas Gov.
George W. Bush has made education a high priority in his
presidential campaign, many non-Texans have belittled the state's
educational progress. Texans like to brag, but there's no question
that the Lone Star state has hit upon a winning formula to boost
learning among all categories of students _ rich, poor, minorities,
urban, suburban or rural. (Rowland Nethaway is senior editor of the

   ERNESTMURRAY-COLUMN _ With the Democratic Convention now behind

and, because of the drought, figs are sweeter than they've been in
years. I'm where I am because we had supper with our friends, Judy
and Alex Moye. There's an upside and a downside to dining with the
Moyes. The upside is Alex's charcoaled lamb chops. The downside is
they are always wanting to go somewhere. (Jim Minter is a former

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ We're just sure Rep. James
Traficant will unearth those affidavits any day now, the ones
proving that Janet Reno has been consorting with a lesbian mobster
call girl. No doubt he has misplaced them in a drawer somewhere,
right next to the finished manuscript of Truman Capote's final
novel. It must be true, every last word of it, and not the
Youngstown Democrat's caged-animal response to his legal troubles.
Where else could he have dreamed up such wild allegations?

   Having raced east to catch the sunrise, Democrats Al Gore and
Joe Lieberman shoved off from the banks of the Mississippi River
today for a paddlewheel cruise on the Mark Twain riverboat meant to
stir heartland excitement for their freshly launched campaign. The
two, along with their families, set off on their ``Charting
America's Course'' cruise in La Crosse, Wis., barely 12 hours after
closing their convention half a continent away. The folksy,
made-for-pictures tour goes through battleground states that could
well decide the November election: Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa and
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   . . . BUT NOT THAT KIND OF PICTURE
</P>
<P>
   An unwieldy entourage of campaign aides and journalists also
piled onto the 120-foot, triple-decked Mark Twain, complete with
calliope. Boats of Secret Service agents sputtered along on either
side of the Mark Twain, whose maximum speed is a mere 8 mph. Posing
near the bow, Al Gore turned down photographers' suggestions he
balance himself hands-free _ as Leonardo DiCaprio's character did
in ``Titanic.'' ``No. Wrong metaphor,'' Gore chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   INVASION OF TENNESSEE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, who laid low on his Texas ranch for the four-day
Democratic convention, burst back on the campaign trail today with
a joint visit to Al Gore's backyard with running mate Dick Cheney.
``We like playing on the other guy's turf,'' said Bush's chief
strategist, Karl Rove. Bush suggested in Memphis that Gore's
acceptance speech reflected ``the rhetoric of the past'' and
underscored seven years of inaction. But Bush also gave his
Democratic rival a nod for attempting to emerge from the shadow of
President Clinton. ``I mean he's standing on his own two feet,'' he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A BOUNCE, BUT NOT A BIG ONE
</P>
<P>
   Fresh surveys suggested Al Gore gained a post-convention bounce
as candidates usually do after their nomination when voters show an
initial emotional reaction. An overnight NBC News poll gave Gore 46
percent and George W. Bush 43 percent. With an an error margin of 4
percentage points, that makes for a dead heat. A
Voter.com-Battleground tracking poll released today showed Bush
holding a 45 to 40 percent lead in a four-way matchup with the
Green Party's Ralph Nader at 3 percent and the Reform Party's Pat
Buchanan at 1 percent. A day earlier, that same poll (3 percentage
point error margin) had Bush up 48-37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD WORD FOR MCCAIN FROM DOCTORS
</P>
<P>
   John McCain's skin cancer likely has not spread, his doctors
said today. The 63-year-old senator planned surgery Saturday to
remove more skin and lymph nodes around the spots of melanoma,
which is the most serious form of skin cancer. The lymph nodes will
be tested to make certain the cancer has not spread. McCain and his
wife, Cindy, met with doctors for about 3 1/2 hours at the Mayo
Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz., today. They said tests didn't find any
evidence the cancer has spread to other areas of McCain's body,
such as the lungs or liver.
</P>
<P>
   SURGERY FOR BUCHANAN, TOO
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan had his gall bladder removed. The Reform Party
candidate was admitted to Washington Hospital Center after
experiencing repeated episodes of stomach pain during the last few
months, according to his sister, Bay Buchanan. Buchanan had known
he had gallstones, and was waiting until after the November
election to have them removed. But after an episode of discomfort
last week he decided to do it sooner. During the surgery doctors
decided to remove the entire gall bladder.
</P>
<P>
   BUT IT'S A HAPPY HOLLYWOOD ENDING
</P>
<P>
   William Bennett, one of Joe Lieberman's Washington allies in
attacking Hollywood's exploitation of sex and violence, said he was
disappointed that the passionate rhetoric and stinging critiques of
``the old Joe'' were missing from his convention address. ``Joe is
getting incredible pressure from the campaign. The Gore people are
saying `fall in line' on the issues,'' said Bennett, a Republican
and former secretary of education. ``He should acknowledge Al Gore,
the head of the ticket, speaks for the party. But what he can't do
is compromise his core convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   TWO WAYS TO SAY `NO'
</P>
<P>
   Denied a chance to address the Republican convention, NAACP
president Kweisi Mfume stood on the Democrats' podium and praised
Al Gore and Joe Lieberman for having ``listened and responded and
stood with us'' on issues such as hate crimes, health care and
racial equality. ``We offered to give both major political parties
our best thinking on matters of concern to the millions of
Americans who believe as we airness and equality and fair
play,'' Mfume said. ``The Democratic Party said `No problem.' The
Republican Party said `No thanks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   MAKING BIG OIL A BIG ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   While Dick Cheney and his lawyers are scrambling to find a
solution to a knotty problem that could cost him a fortune _risk
political criticism by keeping millions of dollars worth of stock
options in Halliburton Co., the Texas oil services giant from which
he just retired, or forfeit the money _ the Democrats stepped up
their criticism. The Gore campaign highlighted Cheney's connection
to the oil industry. ``It seems big oil is making a big investment
in the Bush-Cheney ticket,'' said Gore campaign spokesman Doug
Hattaway. ``People would rightfully wonder whose side Dick Cheney
is on in taking on oil companies on the subject of gas prices and
pollution controls.''
</P>
<P>
   NOW, TO PUT THAT FIRE INTO THE SPEECHES
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's passionate kiss left more than just Tipper breathless.
The delegates in the convention hall were impressed as well. Gore
gave his wife a long, full-on-the-lips smooch after she introduced
him Thursday night for his acceptance speech. ``Wow. He's got
fire,'' said Wisconsin delegate Barbara Hintz. ``Did you see his
kiss?'' marveled Alison Cameron of Houston. ``I was like, Oooooh!''
Then, in the speech, Gore described Tipper as ``someone I've loved
with my whole heart since the night of my high school senior
prom.''
</P>
<P>
   EVERY MOTHER'S HAPPIEST DREAM
</P>
<P>
   Two dignified old ladies sat in the convention audience, busting
with pride. Both Al Gore and Joe Lieberman have lost their fathers,
but their octogenarian moms _ two once-formidable women rendered
fragile by age _ wouldn't have missed the convention for anything.
``Mom is 85 years old, but I'll tell you, she never felt younger
than she feels today,'' Lieberman said from the stage as his
mother, Marcia, beamed. ``Mom, thank you, I love you. And you and I
know how proud Pop would be tonight.'' And Pauline LaFon Gore, 87,
the family matriarch known throughout Tennessee as Miz Pauline, saw
a life's ambition fulfilled when she watched her son accept the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   UNDER THE PINK, IT'S STILL GREEN
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000 campaign, the gay community has written more and
bigger checks than ever before, making ``pink money,'' as it is
known, one of the most important financial sources for the
Democratic Party. In all, gays have contributed about $5 million
this election to the Democratic National Committee alone _ a total
that puts them among the top tier of Democratic givers, along with
unions, trial lawyers and the Jewish community. Al Gore tapped into
the gay community to bring another several million dollars into his
presidential campaign, making it a significant source of funds
among the $48 million raised for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   POINT, CLICK, PAY UP
</P>
<P>
   Americans clicked their way onto the Internet during the
conventions to donate enough money at a pace brisk enough to
surprise the infant Web fund-raising industry. One of the
Internet's leading political fund-raising companies _
eContributor.com _ said its clients raised about a quarter-million
dollars through Web sites between July 24 and Monday's start of the
Democratic convention _ an increase of 242 percent from late July.
The average Internet donation was $123, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   SEEING SOME STARS FOR THEIR MONEY
</P>
<P>
   After taking center stage on the final day of the convention, Al
Gore shared the spotlight with Barbra Streisand and Whoopi Goldberg
at a fund-raiser that fattened party coffers by more than $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg served as master of ceremonies at the Shrine
Auditorium, where the Academy Awards are handed out each year,
while Streisand provided the finale for a concert that included
singers Enrique Iglesias, Baby Face and Boyz II Men. Tickets sold
for as little as $150, but the best seats went to co-chairs, who
raised or donated $50,000, and vice chairs, at the $20,000 level.
</P>
<P>
   PARTY'S OVER _ LET'S GO HOME
</P>
<P>
   For the thousands of demonstrators who went to the convention to
press their causes, the last day on the streets ended simply: no
shoving, no rubber bullets and no arrests. After a final festive
march from the convention site to the jail where nearly 200 of
their number had been booked over the previous week, they simply
turned around and went home early today. Outside the jail, a masked
anarchist tried to urge protesters to continue blocking the street.
``Are we just going to go home and watch our TVs?'' he implored.
But the crowd melted away down side streets under the watchful eye
of riot-gear-clad police officers.
</P>
<P>
   TAMALES ARE , it was Mummers and cheesesteaks. In L.A., it was
traffic snarls and helicopter noise. Indeed, there was little
evidence of a convention at all once out of sight of the Staples
Center. Center City Philadelphia, by contrast, was festooned with
bunting and swamped with signs. And the legions of smiling
volunteers in Philly were nowhere to be found in glitzy Southern
Cal.
</P>
<P>
   MONDALE _ ISN'T THAT A SUBURB OF L.A.?
</P>
<P>
   Walter Mondale, vice president under Jimmy Carter and the
party's nominee against Ronald Reagan in 1984, made a surprise
visit to the Michigan delegation. He spoke briefly about the
importance of campaign finance reform and Rep. Debbie Stabenow's
race for the Senate, then posed for pictures. Mondale said he was
invited by former Michigan Gov. Jim Blanchard. ``He said the
Michigan delegation is running short of free speakers,'' Mondale
joked. ``I'm here, I'm free and I'm worth what you're paying.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When I stayed at the St. Regis Hotel a few years ago,
I opened the door to a young woman dressed in white tie and tails
who identified herself as the butler. Since I had no idea what to
do with her, I sent her on her way. A female butler. What a funny
idea.
</P>
<P>
   During my fifth hour of butler training last week, I was no
longer amused. Maybe it was having to wear the white tie and tails
in 80-degree heat. Or maybe it was that the butlers who were
training me had a quality _ a stillness, a patience, an obedience
of sorts _ that I will never have in this lifetime. If I could have
gotten my hands on the guest who left her underwear piled in the
bathtub and her shirt draped over a bedroom lamp, she would not be
alive today.
</P>
<P>
   Though I was clearly a bust at butling, St. Regis Hotels and
Resorts has had no trouble finding more appropriate candidates
since it started the training program in 1991. While initially most
guests were as puzzled as I was by the notion of a butler, in the
last two years the service has taken off, increasing occupancy
rates and customer loyalty. Other luxury hotels have started
imitating it, especially as the economy booms and people have more
money than time.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cotter, a vice president and managing director of St.
Regis, said that before joining the hotel he worked at the
Waldorf-Astoria and New York Palace, where ``we put butlers in the
towers of both hotels in imitation of the St. Regis.'' Under his
watch, the St. Regis has recently expanded its butler services to
its hotels in Houston and Washington. This winter, ski butlers will
arrive at the St. Regis in Aspen, ``which will extend our service
right to the slopes, so no one has to worry about their gear,''
Cotter said.
</P>
<P>
   Off the slopes, the St. Regis butlers _ there is one on each
floor _ are considered the primary contact for guests, who can
channel all requests through them, without ever calling the
concierge or housekeeping. ``We live at such a frantic pace, and
having the butler, someone whom you trust, is important,'' Sharon
Telesca, the director of sales and marketing for the St. Regis New
York, said. ``Sixty-five percent of our business is repeat, and
these people have come to consider the butler their personal
assistant at the hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Reisman, director of public relations for the Ritz Carlton
in Philadelphia, which uses the term ``club concierge'' for many of
the tasks that fall under the butler's purview at the St. Regis,
said: ``The term butler, in America, anyway, gives the connotation
of luxury and a higher level of service, even though that service
has always been available by another name.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Ritz-Carlton has recently added a technology butler, who
fixes computers, beepers and cell phones, and a bath butler, who
will draw a guest's bath from a menu of options.
</P>
<P>
   Telesca conceded, ``People have said it's a marketing gimmick,
and it is, but it is also a service people are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Some guests like the service so much, they have hired the
butlers away for their very own. The St. Regis recruits graduates
from butler and hotel schools, but unlike the loyal family retainer
in England who will carry the tray forever, here the butler is on a
management track. In addition to providing guest services, each
butler manages the 20 rooms on each floor and deals with all the
other departments in the hotel. One former St. Regis butler now
manages the Carlyle Hotel; another manages a chain of hotels in
Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Lau, also a former butler, is now the training manager
for the program at all St. Regis properties, including the branch
that is to open in Los Angeles next month, and the St. Regis Club,
105 rooms that will be managed by St. Regis at the Essex House in
New York, also opening next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first generation of butlers were trained by Ivor
Spencer,'' Lau said, referring to the premier butler trainer in
England. ``We took the master skills from a private house and used
them in a hotel setting for our guests, who are CEOs, celebrities
and royalty. The butler is the nerve center of the hotel for the
guest.''
</P>
<P>
   The usual training period for a St. Regis butler is 30 days,
during which time trainees trail a butler, learning everything from
cutting a cigar to opening a bottle of Champagne. Lau said trainees
also ``do a lot of role-playing, trying to anticipate the guest's
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lau showed me to the presidential suite, where the nightly fee
is $11,500. As we settled at the dining room table, he surveyed it
sideways. ``This needs polishing,'' he noted. He also had the
unsettling habit of running his hands along the walls or on
moldings in the hallways, checking for dust, and more than once, he
bent over to remove a small speck of something from the floor or a
table, tucking it into his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're trained to pay attention to detail,'' he said,
enumerating the butler's myriad duties, including my personal
favorite, packing and unpacking. Do people really want a stranger
going through their things?
</P>
<P>
   Lau nodded. ``We never unpack toiletries unless requested,'' he
said, ``but guests often send their luggage ahead and have the
butler unpack, using his or her judgment about what needs to be
pressed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are often asked to hang the clothes by color, which is how
some people organize their closets,'' he continued. ``But if you
don't like us to unpack, we will include it in your guest history
and won't offer the service again. A lot of people love it.''
</P>
<P>
   He told of one guest who travels with an enormous assortment of
vitamins; the butler must arrange them from Vitamin A onward, but
never on a surface where the guest has to bend down.
</P>
<P>
   He's kidding, right? Lau shook his head seriously. ``When I was
a butler, I found this to be very interesting about other people's
lifestyles,'' he said. ``It's something for your life library.''
</P>
<P>
   Other selections might include the night that the guest in the
presidential suite requested Lau and two other butlers to stand
along the wall like movie extras, while a party of 10 was served
dinner. Then, there was the morning a CEO's shined shoes
disappeared; it seemed another guest found the sight of them in the
hallway aesthetically unpleasing and threw them away. The hotel,
needless to say, replaced them. Did they kick out that guest?
</P>
<P>
   Lau looked surprised. ``No,'' he said. ``He comes back often,
and when he does, we are very careful to keep all the shined shoes
in the pantry until the wake-up calls.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With these kinds of considerations, don't the butlers ever feel
like slaves? ``No,'' Lau said firmly. ``They are managing the
lifestyle of the guest. And it is a stepping stone for their
careers.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly is for Keiley Rea, the 16th-floor butler to whom I
was assigned. A 24-year-old native of Northampton, England, she has
been at the St. Regis for five months and is already, Lau said,
quite promising.
</P>
<P>
   Rea familiarized me with the large board in the butler's pantry,
where the status of every room and its guests is updated hourly _
vacant or occupied, clean or dirty, inspected or not. When she
brings anything to a room, she does not use a cart, since the
hotel's idea of the butler is to remind a guest of home. Or the
home they wish they lived in.
</P>
<P>
   I looked through some guest histories. One ``loves Grgich Hills
white wine as amenity upon arrival,'' and another ``waited too long
for breakfast'' in March of 1998. That incident remains listed as a
reminder not to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   I accompanied Rea on inspections of cleaned rooms, and Lau came
along, to check on his charge. She put on one white glove to check
dust on the moldings and the headboard, then got down on her hands
and knees behind the desk. She opened each drawer and swept her
hand underneath the paper liners. She looked beneath the sofa
cushions for crumbs and arranged the chocolates, so that all the
St. Regis logos faced up. She held the bar glasses up to the light
to see if they were clean and double-checked the expiration dates
on items in the mini bar.

<P>
   In the bathroom, she ran her gloveless hand over the insides of
the bathtub, checking for stray hairs (yuck!), and when she checked
the bathrobes, she rearranged a satin hanger, so its bow faced
forward.
</P>
<P>
   The entire process took 15 minutes. Lau then pointed out that
one bathroom sconce had a light bulb with the wrong wattage. Except
for the tips of her ears turning red, she remained composed. ``Yes,
thank you,'' she said evenly. I would have smacked him.
</P>
<P>
   As we moved on to the occupied rooms, she was distressed to find
an ash in an ashtray, but went into the bathroom and emerged,
relieved. ``The guest has been back,'' she said. ``There is a used
washcloth as well.'' She placed it on her silver tray and made a
note to have it replaced. She also refolded the toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice for the guest to see that the butler's been in,''
she said comfortably, heading back to the pantry for the umpteenth
time. I nodded. And I couldn't help but think that it was ever so
much nicer to have a butler, than to be one.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 20, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   PARTY-LOYALTY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Although some rhetorical
sameness wafted from the two recent presidential conventions, there
was little of the partisan bite of yesteryear. Yet two-thirds of
Americans still consider themselves Democrats or Republicans. Party
still matters, and party attachment is still considered a good
predictors of how people will vote _ if they vote. But appealing to
those loyalties, while still wooing the independents who decide
elections, is a complex challenge these days. By Robin Toner. (Will
move in `a' catgegory)
</P>
<P>
   FOREST-FIRES-REVIEW (Seattle) _ Amid the worst wildfire year in
nearly half a century, much political finger-pointing is under way.
But the Forest Service, for its part, blames Smokey the Bear and
fire suppression efforts. ``Most of these areas that used to burn
every 10 years or so haven't had a fire in a half-century,'' said a
Forest Service fire ecologist. ``These forests are long overdue.
They were just ready to go.'' By Timothy Egan. (Will move in `a'
catgegory)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SUBMARINE-STORIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The world has been
transfixed by the sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk and the
desperate attempts to reach the 118 men inside. Tales of sea
adventure and calamity, both in fact and fiction, have always held
deep appeal. But what is it about the sea _ and especially
submarines _ that makes being trapped below the waves often
resonate even more than similar disasters on land, like mine
cave-ins? Part of the answer is that for all the advances in
science, the sea remains a mysterious _ and mystical _ force. By
Christopher Drew.
</P>
<P>
   DISABILITY-STUDIES-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ Pressing the
frontier of disability: it has expanded beyond law, medicine and
public policy into academia, in which it provides another point of
view for Richard III or discusses whether the tippy-toed Barbie
doll is technically disabled. Major universities are developing
disability studies programs. This fall the first international
conference on disability studies will be held in Washington. By
Patricia Leigh Brown.
</P>
<P>
   BASEBALL-VIOLENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ There have been some ugly
incidents on the baseball field this season but so far nothing has
approached the horrifying moment 35 years ago when politics
intruded on baseball with a shock that many recall vividly today.
What people remember is the violence that exploded on Aug. 22,
1965, during a game at Candlestick Park in the bitterly contested
National League pennant race between the Los Angeles Dodgers and
the San Francisco Giants. But few recall the politics that fueled
it. By Allen Barra.
</P>
<P>
   (will also move in `s' category)
</P>
<P>
   VEEPS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ With the election 79 days away,
Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman have already done just about
everything running mates can do for their tickets, from reflecting
well on the presidential nominees who chose them to providing a
lift for their national conventions. But those contributions have
been significant. A look at Cheney, Lieberman and other vice
presidential nominees of campaigns past. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   SOUNDOFMUSIC-SINGALONG-REVIEW (New York) _ ``The Sing-a-Long
Sound of Music,'' the audience participation of the 1965 film
classic, will open here. During standards such as ``Sixteen Going
On Seventeen,'' ``So Long, Farewell'' and ``Climb Ev'ry Mountain,''
moviegoers will sing along to the lyrics, which appear on the
screen as subtitles. By Thomas Vinciguerra.
</P>
<P>
   MILLIONAIRE-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' has turned into an empire, with 27 versions being
produced and broadcast in countries around the world. The questions
are almost approaching educational. Some examples are presented.
</P>
<P>
   NY-VIRUS-REVIEW (New York) _ Commercial enterprise springs from
almost every tragedy, and the West Nile virus is no exception. Some
of these ventures, however, seem a bit more dubious than others. By
Jennifer Steinhauer.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-MEDIA-REVIEW (Undated) _ Iran's crackdown on
reform-oriented writers, editors and media spreads to cartoons. The
conservative courts have closed 24 reformist publications since
late April. A magazine called Tavana was banned after publishing a
caricature of President Mohammad Khatami, who is himself a
reformer. But it showed him without his clerical turban and robe.
That, the court said, amounted to defamation. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-CARTOONISTS-REVIEW (United Nations) _ At the United
Nations, where one person's joke can strike other people from other
cultures as incomprehensible or offensive, diplomats favor the
universal language of the political cartoon. Over the next few
weeks, a panel of diplomats and American celebrities will choose
the winner of a $10,000 prize for the best political cartoon on a
U.N. theme. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-JOKES-REVIEW (Jakarta) _ A look at some of the jokes
told by President Abdurrahman Wahid. By Seth Mydans.

<P>
   Remember Linus Torvalds? Last year, the Linux operating system
he created was going to revolutionize the software industry, do
more damage to Microsoft than the Justice Department and make
investors rich. This year, Linux stocks have been in a prolonged
downward spiral and Torvalds has been replaced as a media favorite
by Napster's co-founder, Shawn Fanning, the latest technologist
viewed as most likely to wreak havoc on traditional businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Individual investors might see the depressed stock prices of the
companies that sell services and products supporting the free Linux
operating system as a buying opportunity. Last week, the stocks
even showed signs of recovery after a Linux conference in San Jose,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But a key problem remains: Wall Street is not buying the Linux
pitch. Professional money managers have done little beyond
pocketing quick gains after the gold rush last year of initial
public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   That presents two caution flags for the average investor: What
is holding Wall Street back, and how far can Linux companies go
without institutional support?
</P>
<P>
   Consider VA Linux Systems. Last December, this Silicon Valley
company, which makes and supports Linux-equipped servers, gained
almost 700 percent on its first day of trading, the biggest gain
ever for a public offering.
</P>
<P>
   But only 24 out of several thousand mutual funds now hold the
stock, according to Morningstar Inc., while 35 hold Red Hat, the
North Carolina company that sells Linux-related applications.
</P>
<P>
   For two companies that are considered leading lights among the
Linux stocks _which also include Caldera Systems, Corel and Cobalt
Networks _ this is scant endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, some of last year's other hot initial public
offerings have received a far warmer reception. Ariba, the Internet
software company, has 158 fund holders. Phone.com, which makes
software for cellular phones, has 132, while Brocade
Communications, which makes the switches used in computer networks,
has 213.
</P>
<P>
   Why the lack of interest in Linux?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of indifferent at this point,'' said Andrew S.
Cupps, manager of the $857 million Strong Enterprise fund. ``We've
looked at Red Hat and VA Linux, but we've decided to watch for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   From the standpoint of technology, Cupps is intrigued by Linux.
But he and other professional investors question how much money
companies can make selling services and products around a free
operating system. Even though VA Linux's stock has fallen 80.8
percent this year, and Red Hat's by 77.8 percent, Cupps is
concerned that valuations are still high.
</P>
<P>
   So are his colleagues at Strong Capital in Chicago. Last year,
Ronald Ognar and Derek Felske bought 3,500 shares of VA Linux for
their Strong Mid-Cap Growth fund. They have since sold their
shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``By definition, nobody owns the code, so nobody can sell it,''
Cupps said. ``They have to be creative and find other ways to drive
revenue. The way each company does that is through services. The
irony is they're being valued like software companies, but their
revenue models are going to be more like technology consultants.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hurley, a money manager at Bowman Capital, a $5.5 billion
Silicon Valley investment firm, said, ``I'm not sure how this
becomes a big, profitable business.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, Linux has made its strongest impact in the market for
servers, the powerful computers that drive technology networks. But
Hurley said he believes that the chiefs of technology departments
at many large companies are hesitant to take a chance on Linux.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get paid to be a hero,'' Hurley said. ``You get paid
to make sure that things don't break, and when they do break, you
can fix them instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman had a position in Red Hat at the end of March, according
to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. But it currently
has no positions in public Linux companies.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Gerster, a technology analyst for T. Rowe Price, agreed
with Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Linux momentum was dot-com-driven last year _
companies putting in Linux to start their Web operations because it
was inexpensive,'' Gerster said. ``But as they became real
businesses and wanted more support, they either bought Sun servers
or a Windows NT server.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology investors do agree that Linux, with its open source
code, has tapped into a deep well of desire among young software
developers, but convincing Wall Street will be more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux, in its quarter ended April 28, had $34.6 million in
revenue, up 71 percent from the previous quarter and 710 percent
from the comparable period a year earlier, but still lost 23 cents
a share. The brisk revenue growth has not been enough to convince
more than a couple dozen fund managers that the company is worth a
$1.7 billion market capitalization. ``They're trying to figure out
our business and our business models,'' said Larry Augustin,
founder and chief executive of VA Linux. ``It's mostly a matter of
time, where people show consistent results.''
</P>
<P>
   VA is priced at about 22 times its last 12 months of revenue,
cheap compared with Red Hat's price-to-sales ratio of 78.3, but
well in front of Dell, which is priced at about three times its
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Linux for real? Yes,'' said Gerster of T. Rowe Price.
``Will it generate enough revenue to justify the market caps? I
don't think so, and that's why people aren't investing.''

DIAGEO AND PERNOD TO MAKE JOINT BID FOR SEAGRAM'S WINE AND SPIRITS
BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Diageo PLC of Britain, the world's leading liquor
company, and Pernod Ricard SA of France announced Friday that they
would team up to compete for the wine and spirits business of the
Seagram Co., a move likely to start a bidding war with Allied
Domecq PLC, the No. 2 liquor concern, that could push the price
towards $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram's spirits businesses, which include Chivas Regal premium
Scotch whiskey, are to be sold as part of the company's acquisition
by Vivendi SA, the French utility-to-media conglomerate, which
wants to use the proceeds from selling the liquor assets to reduce
its $6.6 billion in debts.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram's wine and spirits business, the third biggest after
Diageo and Allied Domecq, represents one of the last major jewels
up for grabs in a scramble for profitable, high-profile brands. The
major challenger to the Diageo-Pernod Ricard bid, Allied Domecq,
owner of Ballantine's Scotch whiskey and Kahlua liqueur, needs an
acquisition on this scale to draw level with Diageo. Allied Domecq
had initially been viewed as the front-runner for the Seagram
liquor business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already confirmed our interest in bidding for
Seagram's drinks business,'' said Anthony Cardew, a spokesman for
Allied Domecq, which, in addition to its liquor businesses,
operates the Baskin-Robbins ice cream and Dunkin' Donuts chains.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo sold 91 million 12-bottle cases of liquor in 1999, while
Allied Domecq sold 48 million and Seagram's sold 41 million,
according to industry figures.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo, owner of brands that include Johnnie Walker Scotch
whiskey, Smirnoff vodka and Gordon's gin, gave no details of its
bidding agreement with Pernod Ricard, which has brands including
Pernod and Ricard aniseed spirits, Wild Turkey bourbon, Jameson
Irish whiskey and Havana Club rum.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram's portfolio ranges from Chivas Regal to Martell cognac,
Crown Royal Canadian whiskey and Captain Morgan rum. It also holds
distribution rights to Sweden's top-selling premium vodka, Absolut,
until 2004, but it remained unclear whether those rights would be
included in the auction. If they are not included, the price is
likely to be lower, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo and Pernod Richard The two companies said in a statement
only that they had ``agreed to work together to make an offer for
Seagram's wine and spirits business in the forthcoming disposal
process.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Up until a few days ago, Diageo had been widely expected to
strike a joint bidding deal with privately owned Bacardi to bid for
the Seagram's businesses, but those talks apparently collapsed over
how to divide Seagram's brands.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo was likely to be interested in Seagram's Canadian whiskey
and rum brands, while Pernod Ricard, the world's fifth largest
liquor company, would primarily want Chivas Regal, the analysts
said. Pernod said its ``major interest is in the Scotch whiskey
category.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale is critical to Diageo's long-range goal of securing its
leadership of the liquor business as it sheds other interests to
focus on spirits and Guinness beer holdings. It has just sold its
Pillsbury food division and plans to spin off its Burger King
fast-food chain. Diageo called Seagram's business ``a logical
extension to our focus on beverage alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of the likely bidding war sent Allied Domecq stock down by
as much as 3.6 percent to 314.5 pence, or about $4.72, a share, and
Diageo was down 2.5 percent at 596 pence or $8.94 a share. In
Paris, Pernod Ricard rose 2.56 percent to 60 euros or $54.60 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Pernod Ricard has been looking to expand in the liquor business
despite a major setback last year when regulators blocked its
planned sale of Orangina soft drinks to Coca Cola Co., ending
speculation that it planned to use the proceeds to bid for Allied
Domecq.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential bidder in the Seagram auction, which is likely
to get under way in the next few weeks, is the Bronfman family,
which founded Seagram and owns 24 percent of the company. But there
was no immediate word Friday on whether that bid would proceed.

LA LUNA: BEING INVENTIVE WITH PERIOD INSTRUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the early days of the period-instrument movement,
when accomplished players were comparatively few, listeners grew
used to seeing the same musicians performing under the flags of
several ensembles, each of which either explored a different corner
of the repertory or helped bring to life a different leader's
interpretive ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Now the pool of musicians able to turn out polished, technically
first-rate performances on period instruments in the United States
is large enough to support active early-music scenes on both
coasts. Yet the urge to regroup apparently remains as strong among
early-music players as among jazz musicians.
</P>
<P>
   La Luna, a quartet that specializes in baroque chamber music, is
a group drawn from other groups, and rather far-flung ones. Ingrid
Mathews, one of the two violinists, is the music director of the
Seattle Baroque Orchestra, and the quartet's harpsichordist, Byron
Schenckman, is the Seattle group's artistic director. The other
violinist, Scott Metcalfe, and the cellist, Emily Walhout, are
members of the King's Noyse, a Renaissance ensemble based in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   La Luna made its public debut at the Boston Early Music Festival
in 1995, and since then has toured and made recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The Frick Collection, which has an unimpeachable record of
spotting fine period-instrument bands early in their careers,
presented La Luna in its New York debut on Wednesday afternoon. The
program was devoted to 17th-century Italian composers, both famous
(Frescobaldi, Rossi, Marini and Cavalli) and obscure (Falconieri,
Selma y Salaverde, Fontana and Castello), and it offered a thorough
examination of this ensemble's considerable strengths as well as
the charms of the repertory.
</P>
<P>
   The works at hand _ canzonas, sonatas, fantasias and assorted
dance movements _ were composed to entertain by way of a form of
virtuosity that was subtle compared with that of romantic times.
Where romantic virtuosity seeks to evoke a sense of the heroic, or
at least, the larger than life, the baroque variety is about
inventiveness.
</P>
<P>
   It would be incorrect to say that technical polish is beside the
point. Falconieri's and Marini's violin lines and Frescobaldi's
keyboard writing made great demands. But what dazzles in these
works is not so much the grand gesture as the tiny one _ the
fleetness of a passing embellishment, for example, or the deftness
with which two strands of counterpoint are wound together.
</P>
<P>
   La Luna played its program with an involving zestiness. Matthews
and Metcalf each produced a distinctive violin sound _ hers was
brighter, his had a viola's depth _ that worked particularly well
in trio sonatas where the two lines had a conversational give and
take. Matthews often seemed to have the edge when the music
demanded agility, although in the florid passage work of the
Fontana Sonata No. 17, Metcalf easily matched the clarity and
shapeliness of her ornamentation.
</P>
<P>
   Baroque works often require a cellist to provide only a steady
bass line, mirrored and expanded upon by the harpsichord, but La
Luna chose works _ a gallarda by Falconieri and a sonata by Marini,
for example _ that gave Walhout a bit more to do. She executed her
soloistic moments deftly and with an appealingly rounded tone. And
Schenkman brought a dramatic interpretive touch to a handful of
Frescobaldi solo works.

UTOPIAN DREAM SAID TO HAVE FAILED IN EAST AND WEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1988, Susan Buck-Morss, a professor of government at Cornell
University and an authority on Marxist thought, visited Moscow to
meet with a group of Soviet philosophers. She had written a knotty
but keen book about Theodor Adorno and the Frankfurt School of
philosophy (``The Origin of Negative Dialectics'') and admired the
philosopher Walter Benjamin, who himself went on a pilgrimage to
Moscow in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that I had been schooled in Western Marxism had
everything to do with my desire to enter into a collaboration,''
she writes. ``Yet this Marxist orientation,'' she adds with some
chagrin, ``was of very little interest to my Moscow counterparts.''
In fact, when she began a lecture by citing Marx, the audience
laughed; they thought she was mocking standard ritualistic
invocations of Marx and Lenin.
</P>
<P>
   But Buck-Morss wasn't intending satire. In fact, one of her
worries in her new, and eccentric, book is that with the fall of
the Soviet Union, the great dream of a ``mass utopia'' that marked
the 20th century in both East and West _ a dream in which Marx
played an important role _ is near extinction. There was nothing
wrong with the dream, Buck-Morss argues, but its execution went
awry, and despite most assumptions it failed in the West as well as
in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Her argument, which sometimes glints with insights but is almost
always clouded by distortion, deserves some close attention, for it
is exactly the kind of argument that is bound to be heard more
often as problems facing the formerly communist countries mount, as
the memories of the Soviet past recede, and as the very notion that
totalitarianism even existed comes under increasing challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Buck-Morss suggests, there is a ``hegemonic
discourse'' _ a dominant interpretation _ that affirms the moral
superiority of the West after the collapse of the Soviet Union and
the fall of the Berlin Wall: Totalitarianism was evil and democracy
virtuous, and virtue emerged victorious.
</P>
<P>
   But, Buck-Morss argues, this is all wrong. The Cold War, far
from being a battle between radically different societies, was
actually a ``story of similarities.'' East and West saw each other
as evil and ``refused to face their own failures as democracies.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck-Morss' similarities are actually symmetries. When she talks
about the 1920s for example, she outlines the various failures in
American ``democracy'' (the ironic quotation marks are hers): the
``red scare'' that brought all protesters under suspicion, the
Espionage Act of 1918 making criticism of the military punishable
by 20 years' imprisonment, attacks on aliens, labor unrest. ``The
record in the Soviet Union,'' she continues, ``is hardly more
heartening.'' There was the violence of the civil war, the quashing
of protests and, in the late '20s, Stalin's ``ruthless
destruction'' of peasants.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledges that the ``body count was incomparably higher''
than in similar repressive events in the West, but even this is an
understatement that tries to preserve a symmetry where there is
none. Flaws in a democratic nation that could be and generally were
corrected by legislative and constitutional process are being
compared with the murder and starvation of tens of millions of
people in a social engineering experiment that created one of the
century's worst horrors.
</P>
<P>
   This is the pattern of most of Buck-Morss' symmetries. There are
sins of misplaced blame on both sides: After World War II, the
Soviets interpreted fascism as a capitalist phenomenon, exonerating
East German communists, while in the West, socialists were slurred
by being ``lumped together'' with fascists as totalitarian.
</P>
<P>
   There are also sins of violent excess: In the East, the class
war led to ``the danger of suffocation'' of liberties; in the West,
aggressive territorial ambitions led to ``grotesque'' weapons and
``orgies of annihilation.'' But all these symmetries are weighted
to give what Buck-Morss elsewhere calls ``the benefit of the
doubt'' to the East.
</P>
<P>
   When Buck-Morss turns her attention to cultural symmetries, it
comes as a bit of relief _ even though she tends to view art in the
Marxist manner, asserting that the aesthetic experience should
teach a political lesson.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible not to be intrigued by the similarities she
points out between the 1933 image of King Kong on the Empire State
Building and the 1933 plans for a gargantuan Palace of the Soviets
topped by a colossal statue of Lenin, or to be reminded of the
strange cultural interplay that moved the designers of Radio City
Music Hall to visit the Soviet Union for ideas, or Soviet planners
to seek out the factory designs of Henry Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Such detail (and some fascinating illustrations) are far more
concrete than Buck-Morss' political arguments. Still, in her world,
abstractions rule. And historical judgments have less to do with
life as it is lived than with the wish for what it could have been
or should still be.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no wonder that Buck-Morss caused some dismay among her
Soviet colleagues when she kept focusing on the commonalities
between East and West. They kept insisting, instead, that there
were ``modern horrors'' that were unique to them and that were not
being comprehended.
</P>
<P>
   The critic Frederic Jameson, who joined Buck-Morss in a Soviet
conference in 1990, even pointed out that the Cold War roles now
seemed reversed, with Western Marxists criticizing ``capitalist
commodity culture,'' while the Soviet philosophers used the
vocabulary of ``Cold War anti-communism.''
</P>
<P>
   This was, of course, because these Western intellectuals knew
all the flaws that scar the democratic state, all the weaknesses of
democratic culture, all the unkept promises and unmet ideals. They
dreamed of a more perfect world. But the Eastern intellectuals may
have known something more profound: that in the midst of a world of
imperfections and injustices, some distinctions are still worth
making.

&HT;     MILITARY INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF DESERTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ U.S. officials are seeking the return of a former
Army Reserve intelligence unit commander accused of deserting his
post.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Jeremiah J. Mattysse, who is now in Israel, has been
investigated here for activities that included allegations of a
liaison with a mistress. Until February, he led the U.S. Army
Intelligence Support Center at Camp Bullis, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse has been charged with desertion, absence without leave
and conduct unbecoming an officer after failing to return to duty
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Hanley, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Reserve Command,
would not elaborate on Mattysse, whose unit had access to
classified information produced by the CIA and other intelligence
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is basically a case of an individual who has not reported
to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the Pentagon, State Department, Army Reserve
Command headquarters in Little Rock, Ark., and Israel have been in
contact over the disappearance of Mattysse.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry into Mattysse's conduct began as a result of a
relationship he had with a married woman, Hanley said. He declined
to discuss details about her.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Mattysse's military intelligence background, ``We've
taken reasonable and prudent steps to ensure that the security of
the military intelligence mission remains as high as it ever is,''
Hanley said.
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse, 49, commanded the unit, a facility in which Army
Reserve intelligence specialists are trained, until his
reassignment as a special projects officer with the 90th Regional
Support Group in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hanley stressed that Mattysse was charged with just three
violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice after failing to
return to the unit, he said: ``As in any case, the possibility of
additional charges always exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse has been AWOL since Aug. 8, when he failed to report
back from leave, and now is in Israel, Army spokesman Russ Oaks
said.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said the U.S. government is working
with the Israeli government to secure Mattysse's return.
</P>
<P>
   A number of officials said they did not know if Mattysse is
Jewish or could claim Israeli citizenship. But Israel has
extradition arrangements with the United States and has returned
Americans in the past, said Mark Regev, a spokesman for the Israeli
Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, he said, will ``cooperate fully. We always do with the
Americans on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse was accused by his estranged wife, Vanda, of having an
illicit affair with a San Antonio woman. A divorce complaint Vanda
Mattysse filed March 7 in Albemarle County, Va., claimed he not
only had the affair, but also spent ``thousands of dollars on his
paramour.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse's San Antonio lawyer, William A. Wilson, cited
attorney-client privilege in declining to discuss the case. Vanda
Mattysse's Charlottesville, Va., attorney, Patricia M. Brady, did
not return a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse's father, Curtis James Banker Sr., said late Wednesday
he had not talked with his son and did not know his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Banker, of Plattsburgh, N.Y., said he gave Army investigators
the same information when he recently talked with them.
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse was born Curtis James Banker Jr. on Sept. 29, 1950, but
later changed his name.

FINANCE, BY AN EX-PUNK ROCKER 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 20) 
 By ABBY ELLIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing you learn quickly about Ken Kurson, who as founder and
editor of Green magazine has become the financial mentor for the
Limp Bizkit set: he does not have an ounce of pretension. He is
slightly rumpled, chronically bemused. A mischievous glint leaps
out of his eye during a conversation. He always looks ready to hop
on his Vespa motorcycle to take a friend on his ``Sopranos'' tour
of New Jersey. And that's precisely the point.
</P>
<P>
   Kurson, who is 31, has made personal finance palatable for
people who might otherwise believe that it belongs on the shelf
with Geritol and Dentu-Creme. He derives enormous pleasure from
explaining in everyday language the murky world of stock indexes,
P/E ratios and betas.
</P>
<P>
   His common-sense views _ already heard in his guest appearances
on CNN, CNNfn, ABC, MSNBC and National Public Radio's
``Marketplace'' _ are getting a wider audience. Early last month,
Green began providing two articles a week to the business section
of Salon, the online magazine. Also in July, he began twice-a-week
appearances on ZDTV, the Ziff-Davis cable channel, directly from
Green's offices. Next month, United Feature Syndicate (Peanuts,
Manners, Dilbert, etc.) will begin selling a weekly package of
Green content to newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, all this is not Money for Morons. For all his
glibness, Kurson is very serious _ passionate, really _ about
showing young people the money. ``Five years ago, I paid a couple
hundred bucks for the trademark to the phrase `Personal Finance for
the Unashamed,' and that's who Green is for _ those who don't care
how cool it is to admit they care about their lives and their
futures,'' he said at a restaurant near his Midtown Manhattan
offices. His advice is wide-ranging. He adheres to the idea that an
investor should subtract his age from 100 and invest the remainder,
as a percentage, in stocks. But he says a sector fund can be a good
compromise between the passivity of investing in a general mutual
fund and the ``take-chargedness of individual stock-picking.''
</P>
<P>
   In the preface to his book, ``The Green Magazine Guide to
Personal Finance,'' (Doubleday, 1998), he wrote: ``It's not about
the ability to quit your job at any moment or to jet off to suave
locales. It's about knowing that you have some control over the
things that matter to you. It's about working at a job because you
love it, because it elevates you, instead of because you're deeply
in debt, stuck with rent you can't afford or so afraid of investing
you bury your savings in jars, scattered around the backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurson does have the backyard, if not the jars. He lives in
Montclair, N.J., with his wife, Rebecca, a literary agent. He keeps
the Vespa and a Harley Davidson in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   David Granger, editor in chief of Esquire, saw Kurson's
noncomformist streak in full color as soon as he chose him to write
a monthly money column, ``Green,'' in 1997. ``The day I told him he
got the job, he went out and dyed his hair orange,'' Granger
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But then Kurson has always believed that money matters should be
fun. ``I've never met anybody who thought they could bring joy to
people by telling them how to spend and save it,'' Granger said.
``He might be the only financial writer in the world who makes that
part of his mission. He has a real feeling that understanding
personal finance can improve people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurson says his financial skills date from the late 1980s, when
he played the bass in a Chicago punk rock band called _ you guessed
it _ Green. He ended up in charge of the band's books and
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he headed to New York, figuring to get into journalism,
and landed internships and jobs at Rolling Stone, Harper's and
Worth. (He had attended the University of Chicago for two years,
but he calls college ``soul-deadening.'')
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he began publishing an irreverent eight-page
publication, calling it The Kenny Quarterly, which he furtively
photocopied at his day job as an editor at United Media and
distributed to friends in need of financial advice. Its one and
only issue was a hit _ especially among investment professionals
who in turn gave it to friends and family who hadn't previously
found discourse about Simplified Employee Pensions particularly
fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995, he and his best friend, John Packel, turned The
Kenny Quarterly into Green. It now has a paid circulation of
25,000, with enhanced prospects for growth since Eastern
Distributors, a major magazine handler, recently agreed to handle
it. The Web site has 335,000 unique users, according to PCData
Reports last month.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the magazine and the Web site,
www.greenmagazine.com, were bought by Ilife..com (formerly
Intelligent Life), based in North Palm Beach, Fla., and the owner
of financial sites including Bankrate.com, for about $830,000 in
cash and stock, plus options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I doing well? Absolutely,'' he said. ``My dad was a
traveling salesman of motorcycle parts. Some years were good;
others we had to sell our piano and all our furniture. I probably
make more than he ever did. But I'm poorer than 90 percent of the
people I've interviewed in my career as a business journalist. I'm
on the phone all day with people, many of whom are brilliant and
hard-working but plenty of whom are lazy dunces _ who spend more
than my annual income on wine.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees few limits to young people's appetite for what he is
serving up. ``The Internet has changed just about everything,'' he
said. ``Not the fundamentals of corporate economics, but the way we
live. Green is for a person who essentially didn't exist as
recently as 10 years ago: the guy who likely won't stay in a job
long enough to learn where the bathroom is, let alone retire with a
gold watch; the gal who never wanted to learn the word mutual fund
and suddenly finds herself controlling a substantial sum of money
that can be invested in any of 7,923 funds, or thousands of stocks.
These are people whose parents told them even less about money
management than they did about religion and sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, despite his anti-establishment roots, will he apologize for
being a die-hard capitalist. ``I write about money for two
reasons,'' he said. ``It fascinates me, and it is the most powerful
way for people I care about to enact the kinds of lives they want
and deserve.''

MUSIC REVIEW: MESMERIZING SOUNDS FROM EAST TO WEST ON A SUMMER
NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anoushka Shankar's father, Ravi Shankar, learned what it was
like to play Indian classical music for uncomprehending audiences
at 1960s rock festivals like Monterey Pop and Woodstock. Ms.
Shankar, who is 19, had her version of the experience on Thursday
night at Central Park Summerstage, where she shared a bill with
Roni Size's band, Reprazent, a dance-music dynamo.
</P>
<P>
   The audience that packed every square foot of Rumsey Playfield
was there for Size's feverish drum-and-bass propulsion, and it
eventually got exactly what it wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Reprazent merges human and machine, with Size and three fellow
disc jockeys (Krust, Die and Suv) working computer consoles behind
Rob Merrill on drums, Si John on bass, a singer, Onallee, and a
rapper, MC Dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   They take the relentless computerized beat of drum-and-bass,
which has threatened to become a dance-music cliche, and partly
humanize it with a flesh-and-blood rhythm section. At the same
time, they pile on so many samples and effects that the music turns
dizzying and enveloping. Each sound has been shaped to create
maximum disorientation. Notes began with one timbre, only to mutate
and distort a fraction of a second later; sounds echoed all around
the beat, toying with time perception.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of playing nonstop music, like a dance disc jockey,
Reprazent performed discrete songs drawn from its 1997 album, ``New
Forms'' (Mercury) and its coming one, ``In the Mode'' (Def Jam), to
be released on Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new material moved toward hip-hop and
rhythm-and-blues. ``Who Told You'' picked up the blunt beat and
plinking synthesizer of Detroit ghetto-tech, with MC Dynamite
rapping in sync with the bass drum; ``Lucky Pressure'' had Onallee
singing rhythm-and-blues verses and refrains over a backdrop of
melancholy string-orchestra chords and the fast beat. But the core
of the music was its hurtling momentum and aural density, an
ominous thrill ride through a barrage of perfectly placed zingers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shankar gracefully handled a crowd that treated her ragas as
a backdrop to conversation. Before one piece, she gently asked
people to be a little quieter during the slow, exploratory
introductions to the ragas because she couldn't hear herself. She
kept those preludes fairly short, floating their wisps of melody.
Then she was joined by two tabla drummers, Bikram Ghosh and Tanmoy
Bose, for the faster, flashier sections of the ragas; they engaged
Ms. Shankar and each other in quick volleys.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shankar started her career performing alongside her father,
who is also her teacher, and her impressive technique drew
immediate praise. But she was playing music she had memorized,
while Indian classical music revolves around improvisation.
Performing on her own, she has begun to improvise, and her
inexperience shows.
</P>
<P>
   Like her father, she plays long lines of what would be
eighth-notes in Western notation. But where her father makes those
phrases jab and strike, Ms. Shankar does not yet match his
flexibility of rhythm and pitch or his aggressive sense of
direction. But she's fast-fingered and sure, and when she and the
drummers chased each other through her speedy finales, conversation
gave way to applause. To connect the disparate styles, the concert
included Asian underground dance music, which blends electronic
dance beats with traditional voices and drumming from India and
Pakistan. A short set presented a trans-Atlantic alliance: the disc
jockey Siraiki, from the New York Asian underground parties called
Mutiny, and Chandrasonic, the Asian Dub Foundation in England,
traded drones, hovering voices and breakneck drum-and-bass beats.

JAZZ REVIEW: SANCHEZ MINES LATIN ROOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  By   BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new album by the saxophonist David Sanchez, ``Melaza''
(Columbia/Sony), is full of 16th-note runs, played by Sanchez and
the alto-saxophonist Miguel Zenon, as they go through hairpin turns
of Latin rhythmic accent; the writing is frequently complicated, in
a jazz sense, and rather busy. Sanchez's set at the Blue Note late
on Wednesday night, on the other hand, was lighter on composition
and seemed to be all about clearing the mind.
</P>
<P>
   Written parts fell away quickly; a thrashing carpet of rhythm
established itself between the drummer Antonio Sanchez, the bassist
Hans Glawischnig and the percussionist Pernell Saturnino. Sanchez
was freed by that rich texture of drumming, often playing slowly
and loosening up.
</P>
<P>
   As an introduction to Sanchez's piece ``Against Our Will,''
Saturnino played a clay pot for a good long time, letting a
rhythmic cycle take shape at its own speed. The vamps took over the
set; the band left behind modern jazz as a harmonic construct, with
all its moods of irresolution, and submerged themselves in six-way
rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   Both in the studio and onstage, Sanchez makes music with a
definite plan. It's not swing-based jazz, nor is it trying to scale
the wall of post-Coltrane expressiveness; though he has great range
as a saxophonist, there's cultural specificity coming from the
rhythm section that reins him in.
</P>
<P>
   His new material borrows from 100-year-old Puerto Rican rhythms,
bomba and plena; at one point, Sanchez and Zenon produced the
tambourine-like pandero drums specific to plena, and tapped out
complementing patterns. He is doing what so many of the smartest
musicians of the Americas are doing, whether in jazz or rock or
dance music: fueling futuristic ambitions with old vernacular
traditions, and making music that easily claims art status and yet
doesn't float away on self-generated intellect.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A changeable sky will be the rule of the day over the mountains
of New York and New England as a pool of cold air arrives several
thousand feet above the ground. Pockets of morning sun will yield
to cumulus clouds, some of which will lead to showers. Partial and
fleeting afternoon sunshine will alternate with showers. Clouds
will crumble after sunset, setting the stage for a chilly night
across much of the interior Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Widely separated thunderstorms will erupt over the upper Midwest
as a compact jet stream disturbance moves over eastern Wyoming and
Montana. A few storms will ignite over the western Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   The western Gulf states and lower Mississippi Valley will have
stifling heat. Isolated thunderstorms will develop near a weak cool
front dipping into the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: ALBERTO'S STAMINA
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday morning, the long-lived storm Alberto intensified
into a hurricane for the third time since it became a tropical
storm on Aug. 4. At 5 p.m. Friday, it passed a milestone, having
maintained at least tropical-storm strength longer than any
previous August storm on record, eclipsing the mark set by
Hurricane Felix in August 1995. The latter was a devilish storm
that taunted the East Coast and battered beaches with large waves,
but Alberto has created few problems, except for disrupting a few
shipping lanes over the open Atlantic.

   ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER _ Democratic presidential nominee Al
Gore, and running mate Joseph Lieberman embarked on a four-day trip
down the majestic Mississippi River on Friday, trying to catch a
wave of political momentum in the wake of the Democratic Party's
national convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Their voyage, on a 120-foot boat named after legendary author
and humorist Mark Twain, coincided with the first sign that Gore's
issue-filled acceptance speech may have given the vice president an
important boost in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   NBC-TV's overnight poll of 500 likely voters showed Gore with 46
percent, Republican presidential nominee George Bush with 43
percent and Green Party nominee Ralph Nader with 7 percent. The
margin of error was +/- 4.4 percent. NBC's overnight poll after
Bush's acceptance speech at the GOP convention two weeks ago had
Bush at 44 percent and Gore at 41 percent, with the same margin of
error.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane was elated by the latest
poll, but cautioned against reading too much into it. ``The polls
are going to bounce around a lot over the next two weeks,'' he
said, underscoring the importance of the presidential nominee's
decision to quickly begin campaigning in these Midwest swing
states. Although President Clinton carried the crucial Midwest in
both 1992 and 1996, Gore has consistently trailed Bush in polls
here.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic ticket boarded the triple-decker Mark Twain in La
Crosse, Wis., Friday morning, having raced from Los Angeles on Air
Force Two to arrive on the banks of the Mississippi River around
dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Just 12 hours earlier, Gore had accepted his party's
presidential nomination with a 50-minute speech in which he not
only contrasted himself with Bush on a variety of issues but vowed
to usher in a ``new time'' of opportunity for American families.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of La Cross residents gave Gore, Lieberman and their
wives a spirited send-off at sun-drenched Riverside Park with a
rally of music, balloons, confetti, barbershop-style acapella
singers and a white-suited Mark Twain impersonator.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, his voice showing slight signs of wear after an intense
two weeks of campaigning, said special interests have erected a
``mighty wall of resistance'' to the changes he has promised if
elected president.
</P>
<P>
   But with Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin sharing the stage
with him, Gore reiterated the importance of one change _ campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here knows that our democracy must be reclaimed from
special interests,'' he said. ``We want to give it back to the
people. And we have to get all of the special interest money out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Feingold is the Democratic co-sponsor of the campaign finance
reform measure introduced by Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who gave
Bush a tougher-than-expected contest for the GOP presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, fresh from a four-day convention that tried to rekindle
the ``New Frontier'' spirit of John F. Kennedy, also struck a
Kennedyesque tone in his riverside remarks, summoning younger
voters to ``allow yourself to believe'' in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of where you stand, get involved and allow yourself
to participate fully with your heart,'' he said. ``We have always,
in every generation, had enough men and women and young people who
have been willing to come forward and say: 'This is our country, it
is the best in the world: the hope of human kind.'''
</P>
<P>
   Before boarding the riverboat, Gore shook hands with hundreds of
supporters, often reaching four-people deep into the crowd to grab
hands as a U.S. Secret Service agent held him by the belt to
prevent him from toppling forward.
</P>
<P>
   He hugged Denise Hedrick Mulvaney, a 31-year-old nurse from
nearby Sparta. ``I'm pregnant, and my baby book is going to say: Al
Gore was president when you were born,'' she told Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mark Twain pulled away from the dock at La Cross, Tipper
Gore snapped photos while Gore, Lieberman and Hadassah Lieberman
clapped and pumped their arms in the air to the beat of a rock
classic, ``Proud Mary,'' with its well-known refrain of ``rollin'
on the river.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore declined an invitation from photographers to pose at the
bow of the ship with arms spread, like Leonardo DeCaprio's
character in the Academy Award winning movie, ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong metaphor,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The trip down the Mississippi, which ends Monday night with an
arrival in Twain's boyhood home of Hannibal, Mo., will take the two
politicians through media markets in five Midwestern states that
could swing either for the Gore or Bush tickets this fall:
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But the churning waters of the Mississippi, its lush green banks
and the gleaming white Mark Twain, outfitted with a red faux paddle
wheel and patriotic red, white and blue bunting, provided the Gore
campaign _ and news organizations _ with spectacular images of the
vice president and his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't all imagery.
</P>
<P>
   On board the boat's sunny deck, Gore and Lieberman led a
floating town hall meeting with local citizens, discussing the vice
president's proposal to use $250 billion of projected budget
surpluses over the next 10 years to provide prescription drug
benefits under the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the discussion, Gore noted that he got less
than three hours sleep en route from Los Angeles. To stay awake, he
said, he had used up ``two or three of those daily Diet Coke
rations'' _ his preference to coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said of Gore: ``I'd put this guy with two and a half
hours sleep against anybody with a full night's sleep, and I think
he'd make more sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's hitting his stride,'' Karenna Gore Schiff, the
candidate's daughter, told reporters as the Mark Twain made its way
southward for a dockside rally planned Friday night in Prairie du
Chien, Wis.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Easter Island. Papua New Guinea. The Galapagos Islands. The
itinerary sounds like something Charles Darwin or Margaret Mead
might have dreamed up.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who sign up for ``Mysteries of the Earth,'' a new
private jet tour offered by TCS Expeditions, will also study
Polynesian culture on the Cook Islands, hunt for herbs in the
Brazilian rain forest and gaze at orangutans in the jungles of
Borneo. And that is only the first half of the trip. Then comes a
safari in Tanzania, an elephant trek in Nepal and bird-watching in
the Seychelles.
</P>
<P>
   If this is the kind of whirlwind tour that excites rather than
exhausts you, be sure to check out the price before you start
packing: $34,950 a person, double occupancy. And even if you can
afford it, you're way too late: the tour, with departures next
February and March, sold out months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the private jet vacation has arrived. For years no more
than flashy blips on the travel industry's radar screen, deluxe jet
trips have built a booming business in the last five years,
according to individual tour companies, though no organization
tracks their combined revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In an age gilded by 10 years of prosperity, there seems to be no
shortage of affluent travelers who want to cover as much prime
territory as they can in the most expedient _ and most comfortable
_ way possible. They can choose among tours of 14 to 26 days in
length and ranging from $25,000 to $62,000 in price. Offered by
TCS, Travcoa, Abercrombie &AMP; Kent, Intrav and a few other high-end
operators, the tours use charter aircraft _ usually Boeing 737's
and 757's and Lockheed L-1011's _ reconfigured to make them more
commodious.
</P>
<P>
   TCS Expeditions uses 757's set up to seat 88 passengers instead
of the usual 233. This year, the company is sending 1,500 people on
18 theme journeys, ranging from a European golfing trip that stops
at six courses in four countries (including Gleneagles in Scotland
and Ballybunion in Ireland) to a ``Lost Cities'' tour that goes to
Laos, Mongolia and Uzbekistan, among other places.
</P>
<P>
   T.C. Swartz, the president of the company, said bookings doubled
last year. Like other tour operators, he is surprised not only by
the sudden popularity of the trips but also by their apparent
habit-forming nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly 70 percent of those who book one of our tours will book
another,'' Swartz said. ``I used to think of these as
once-in-a-lifetime trips. Obviously I was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Business is also up at Intrav, based in St. Louis. It was among
the first to offer private jet tours when it started
around-the-world Concorde trips in 1987. (In the aftermath of the
Concorde crash in France last month, Intrav, like other companies
that charter Concordes, is choosing another aircraft.)
</P>
<P>
   David Drier, a senior vice president of Intrav, said recently
that its number of jet trips had nearly tripled in the last five
years, to 29 this year. Among them is ``Exploring the Ancient
Cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean,'' which uses a Boeing 737
that seats 44 passengers instead of the usual 120. The two-week
tour, with various stops in Greece, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and
Jordan, costs $27,500.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Upchurch, chief executive of Virtuoso, an association of
244 independent luxury travel companies with combined revenue of
$2.5 billion, said the tours' popularity had ``taken us all by
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributes the recent interest to several factors. There is
the strong economy, of course, something that has benefited luxury
travel in general. (His association's clients spend an average of
$6,000 a person for trips that last an average of seven days.)
</P>
<P>
   Upchurch also cites what he calls the ``degradation of
commercial aviation,'' which at this point ``can almost be
described as hand-to-hand combat.'' Private jet tours _ with their
promise of smooth, personalized service; palatable multicourse
meals; and direct flights from one out-of-the-way location to
another _ offer an attractive, if expensive, alternative to
overbooked commercial flights and long delays.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Weigel, 47, a real estate investor from Chattanooga, Tenn.,
signed up for the $28,300, 18-day ``Biarritz to the Bosporus'' trip
from Intrav last spring. In one 48-hour period, his group flew from
Biarritz, on the west coast of France, southwest to Bilbao, Spain,
for an afternoon at the Guggenheim museum there, then returned to
Biarritz for the night before heading to Madeira the next morning.
On the way there, they stopped for a few hours in Granada, Spain,
for tapas and a tour of the Alhambra.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had gone on commercial flights, it would obviously have
taken many days,'' said Weigel who, at the end of the tour,
overheard someone comment that his only regret was that he hadn't
spent enough time on the plane. That comment, he added, ``just
about says it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Upchurch says there is one primary reason that luxury travel in
general, and jet tours in particular, have been so successful in
recent years: the accrual of wealth by the maturing post-World War
II generation. While jet tour operators say most of their clients
are retired or semiretired, they are noticing a steady influx of
people in their 30s and 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has heard so much about the impact of the baby
boomers that it's beginning to sound like white noise,'' Upchurch
said. But, he added, ``the travel industry hasn't seen the full
brunt of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not just a group of people with a lot of money,'' he
said. ``They are the best-educated, best-connected, best-traveled
and most demanding group of consumers in the history of mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Their parents, the mainstay of deluxe travel, viewed travel as a
luxury, not a right, Upchurch said. But those of the post-World War
II generation see it the other way around, and their guilt-free
spending seems to be affecting their elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years, there was a reluctance to spend such money on
expensive travel options, even if you had the means,'' said Drier
of Intrav. ``Now the attitude is, `Why not? We deserve this!'''
</P>
<P>
   A new demand for ``unique'' experiences goes hand in hand with
this new attitude. ``It's not enough to say you've gone to India or
Australia,'' Drier said. ``It's what you've done when you're there
that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   On the ``Nepal and the Desert Kingdoms of Rajasthan'' tour,
offered by Intrav, guests spend the night in the royal tents of the
Maharaja of Jodhpur. On a jet tour around South America,
Abercrombie &AMP; Kent arranges an after-dinner re-enactment of the Rio
carnival. And on a recent around-the-world tour, Travcoa arranged
for two hairdressers from Nairobi, Kenya, to fly to Nice, France,
with its group of dusty, -disheveled clients, so everyone could
arrive in appropriate form for an evening in Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   Weigel, who has taken four jet vacations with Intrav, has his
own favorite experience: rising at dawn for a hot-air balloon trip
to the Masai Mara Reserve in Kenya, where a table had been set up
in the wilderness for a white-linen Champagne breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   For many people who take these tours, the extravagances _
breakfast on the plains of Africa, lunch on the lawns of the Umaid
Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur, India, Christmas dinner at the Grand
Hotel Victoria-Jungfrau in Interlaken _ are outshone by the routine
luxuries: first-class accommodations everywhere possible; guides
who include academic experts and former ambassadors; airline crews
trained at prestigious hotel schools.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be a few drawbacks. Some travelers point out
routine annoyances, like the respiratory illnesses that bounce back
and forth among aircraft-bound tour members, and the decidedly
feverish pace of many trips. David Dibner, a retired business
executive, said TCS Expeditions' ``Lost Cities'' tour left him and
his wife, Frances, nearly exhausted after ``three weeks of
two-night stands'' in Jordan, Cambodia and other exotic places.
Dibner said he recognized the value of visiting ``extraordinary
locations that the average tourist would not know how to get to,''
although, he said, his first jet tour would probably be his last.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, however, is likely to keep Weigel from taking another
one. He even says the tours are a good deal. ``People constrained
for vacation time get the biggest bang for their buck,'' he said.
``So for me, it's obviously a value worth repeating.''

<HEADLINE>
WITH 5,000 SOCIOLOGISTS AT THE OTHER CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a dire prospect that greeted the 5,000 or so sociologists
who converged on two Washington hotels last week for the start of
the 95th annual meeting of the American Sociological Association.
Titled, with the flair for which their calling has become known,
``Oppression, Domination and Liberation: Challenges for the 21st
Century,'' the event promised insights not only into the
``continuing problem'' of racism but also into ``other
manifestations of social inequality such as class exploitation and
oppression on the basis of gender, ethnicity, national origin,
sexual preference, disability and age.'' It was a big tent.
</P>
<P>
   Like the political conventions that have enlivened the summer
weeks, this one laid claim to great historical accomplishments and
pledged further achievements. Instead of the rousing phrases of
political party platforms, however, the sociologists' platform was
framed in the lab-sounding lingo of social science as it drew
attention to the leading role of sociologists in researching
``societal conditions and studying strategies for bringing social
and political change, including individual and group protest
against oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   Workshops and seminars lured the conventioneers with an
inclusive and diverse menu that signaled the assumptions of
victimization to which this year's get-together was dedicated:
``Beyond Triple Jeopardy: Women of Color, Public Policy and the
Limits of Citizenship''; ``Gender Oppression and Gender Democracy
in Global Market Society''; ``Postmodern Critiques of Science and
the Rise of Reactionary Modernism in South Asia''; ``Social
Definitions of Virtue and Blame: Moral Fault in Child Care''; and
``Who Needs the Worker?: Restructuring in the 21st Century.'' The
titles cried for a colonoscopy.
</P>
<P>
   On my way to a Saturday morning panel on ``Gender Discrimination
Revisited: Subtle, Blatant and Covert,'' I was stopped short by the
appearance of Ralph Nader, which also evidently diverted other
panelists from their proposed rounds. By comparison with the Nader
event, which filled a sizable room, the gender panel made do with a
sprinkling of two dozen women; when I peeped in, a small woman in a
large hat was calling fervently and very sociologically for ``a
feminist paradigm.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader was accompanied by two academics, Steven J. Rosenthal of
Hampton University and Charles Derber of Boston College, and a
Boeing machinist who kept reminding us that he brought a view from
the shop floor. Rosenthal called for ``an end to the system that we
are all fighting against.'' He preached a nondiscriminatory policy
of overthrow: ``Every protest action that occurs deserves our
support.'' Derber pretty much agreed, adding some plugs for the
Nader candidacy. Nader's own talk, more or less on ``After Seattle:
The WTO and the New World Order,'' was received with enthusiasm.
Most of the audience rose to greet him and then gave him a warm
send-off.
</P>
<P>
   What was a presidential candidate doing making a campaign
address under auspices of a group purportedly given to scientific
independence of a sort? Well, his call for action against the ills
of American society was thoroughly in the spirit of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   I arrived early for ``Confronting Racism, Sexism and Homophobia
in Academia,'' drawn by a hard-sell come-on: ``This thematic
session problematizes institutional structures and culture in which
women and minority academics function on a daily basis. ... The
second theme, `Marginality,' will focus on the questioning of
prevailing paradigms in sociology that despite unreal claims
display provincialism that is neither reflective nor representative
of the experiences of women and minorities.'' It is the rare
sociologist who can forgo a paradigm or two, but ``problematize''
began to sound as though somebody was kidding the profession's
pretensions.
</P>
<P>
   The first panelist, Ann Tickamyer of Ohio University, was not as
combative as the session's title. Her specialty of ``spaciality,''
which I came to understand was the study of how the allotment of
physical space is used by the powers that be to keep others in a
subordinate condition, seemed a plausible undertaking, but
Tickamyer's paper was so clogged with her craft's jargon (``access
to gender space''; ``maxi- and micro-analysis;'' ``complex
multirational'') that it left little breathing space.
</P>
<P>
   She was followed by Lionel Cantu, an assistant professor at the
University of California at Santa Cruz, who kept announcing himself
as ``a pro-feminist gay Chicano.'' The gist of his talk was that
everyone ought to fight against his own demons of prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? But a drawn-out account by the next speaker, in praise
of the way the ancient Iroquois resolved disputes, drove me from
the room and thus deprived me of the final contribution, a graduate
student and an untenured professor ``speaking out'' against racism,
sexism and homophobia. Most of the audience demonstrated its
courtesy or solidarity or low expectations by staying on.
</P>
<P>
   The very well-attended Saturday afternoon session, ``Sexism and
Feminism: Challenges for the 21st Century,'' was organized by Joe
R. Feagin of the University of Florida, the outgoing president of
the American Sociological Association. Feagin, who is known for his
championship of sociology's mission to redeem society, had
reportedly encouraged the panelists to put in a few words along the
way on how to achieve social justice, which may have accounted for
a University of Cincinnati professor's resort to a praxis or two in
calling for a fusion of theory and action and knowledge and power
and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   The freshest voice here, as well as the zippiest phrase
(``gender vertigo''), was supplied by Barbara Risman of North
Carolina State University, who drew attention to the responsibility
of women (as well as men) for ending sexism. Her even-handedness
made her something of a daring figure in the chorus of exhortation.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of quiet hours Sunday morning at the National
Gallery of Art, I returned to my labors in time to catch ``Marxism
and Capitalism in the 21st Century.'' The analyses of the ups and
downs of capitalism by Robert Brenner of the University of
California in Los Angeles and the highs and lows of Marxism by
Giovanni Arrighi of Johns Hopkins University were pretty
straightforward, offering data and historical interpretation, with
little of the rah-rah spirit that flavored other panels.
</P>
<P>
   That was exactly what displeased some in the audience, who
sought a call to action. One critic even hurled the charge of
``implicit racism'' at the panelists for not acknowledging the
pernicious situation in South Africa and had to be subdued by the
moderator. Another wanted more in the way of paradigm and praxis.
Brenner was spurred into uttering a few kind words for the Seattle
protesters, but Arrighi refused any crowd-pleasing. He expressed
skepticism at the thinking behind the antiglobal eruptions and went
so far as to dismiss Marxist theory as a muddle that was failing to
catch up to the continuing transformation of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   It was a downer, but the audience found a restorative within the
hour in Feagin's presidential address, a paean to ``societal
usefulness,'' chock-full of condemnations of racism, sexism,
exploitation, domination, resource inequality, environmental
degradation and other sins. He got a solid round of applause.

CONVENTIONEERS WEIGH IN SARTORIALLY, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY AND JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's a bipartisan dilemma and a weighty one: How
do you pack for a political convention?
</P>
<P>
   Whether they were boarding a train for Philadelphia or making a
cross-country flight to Los Angeles, Massachusetts delegates faced
the same prospects this year. Delegates had to be comfortable
enough to last through lengthy days, and stylish enough to honor
the constituents back home. So their suitcases had to be ready for
all varieties of weather and social occasions.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it was just a matter of whether to dress liberally
or conservatively.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the party differences came in. Democratic delegates
didn't just have to pack for the event. They had to buy new
wardrobes.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the issue of competing with trendy Angelenos
and movie stars. Then there was the issue of having an outfit that
would carry you through a day on the convention floor and straight
to a chic party at, say, Paramount Studios. And then, there was the
issue of contrasting temperatures inside and outside the
exuberantly air-conditioned Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult to figure out what you'd be comfortable in
because it's 90 degrees outside and it's freezing in here,'' said
Kristen Morris, a 29-year-old state party worker from Charlestown,
Mass. ``I packed way too much. But some of the outfits are quite
extravagant. Elegant suits. High heels. They look great.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Morris, in a purple tank top, black stylish sandals and
black capri pants, with a sweater, for temperature control.
</P>
<P>
   The women were almost always fashionable. Few wore stockings.
Heels were high. Occasionally, some women were so well-dressed,
well-coifed and lathered up with makeup that you thought they must
be stars, but couldn't be sure because chunky black sunglasses
covered their eyes, even inside the convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Massachusetts contingent at a party one night, there
were stylish, three-quarter-length suit jackets with matching
pants, bias-cut gauzy sundresses in vibrant colors, and funky
harlequin-print cropped pants.
</P>
<P>
   The men also made a show of looking good _ including the few who
accessorized by wearing yarmulkes. Even US Representative J. Joseph
Moakley of South Boston, the dean of the Massachusetts
congressional delegation, had a new suit in a distinctive maize
color, with a silk handkerchief in his jacket pocket.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, Massachusetts delegates for the Republican
National Convention packed heavy too, but the reason was somewhat
different. Many of them, McCain supporters who were new to
politics, had never been to a convention before. So they didn't
know the rules: How dressy do you need to be on the convention
floor? When might you need the flowing sundress or the trendy tank?
</P>
<P>
   But toting the casual clothes turned out to be a wise move.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Republican delegates from across the nation wore
fewer tailored suits and more open-toed shoes than one might have
expected from self-avowed conservatives. Which doesn't mean they
weren't conservative, in the fashion sense. The woman who wore a
sheer jacket with sequins over an irridescent dress one night
looked decidedly out of place, as did the woman in a loud
polka-dotted pantsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with one notable exception _ a man in a tall felt Uncle
Sam hat and matching red-white-and-blue suit _ Massachusetts
delegates gravitated toward the safety of dressy-casual. Republican
delegation chairwoman Jean Inman, a veteran of these kinds of
events, seemed to have the routine down. She wore sleeveless
flowered dresses some of the time, but donned a dark pink tailored
suit for her moment in the spotlight, when she announced
Massachusetts' votes in the roll call of states.
</P>
<P>
   Most men in the GOP delegation, too, opted for ``business
casual'' clothes _ except on the final night of the convention,
when many turned up in suits. Were they paying homage to nominee
George W. Bush? No, delegate Jonathan Freiman admitted. He had run
out of casual clothing, and the suit was the only clean thing in
his suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the differences reflected regional variations. The
Massachusetts Republican crowd looked different from, say, the
Alabamans sitting behind them on the convention floor. Among the
younger Alabama women, the look was decidedly Southern Belle: heavy
makeup, long tresses, spaghetti straps.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, there were delegational differences, as well,
with men from the Florida delegation wearing tropical print shirts
and members of the Louisiana delegation decked with Mardis Gras
beads.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest sartorial showings turned up at the parties.
Fetes around trendy issues, such as handgun control, were filled
with skimpy outfits and fashionable food. This is, after all,
California.
</P>

 &HT;    GORE, LIEBERMAN EMBARK ON CAMPAIGN DOWN MISSISSIPPI TARGETING
MIDWEST
 &HT;    (775&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    Moving in both (w) Washington and (p) Politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER _ Democratic presidential nominee Al
Gore, and running mate Joseph Lieberman embarked on a four-day trip
down the majestic Mississippi River on Friday, trying to catch a
wave of political momentum in the wake of the Democratic Party's
national convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Their voyage, on a 120-foot boat named after legendary author
and humorist Mark Twain, coincided with the first sign that Gore's
issue-filled acceptance speech may have given the vice president an
important boost in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   NBC-TV's overnight poll of 500 likely voters showed Gore with 46
percent, Republican presidential nominee George Bush with 43
percent and Green Party nominee Ralph Nader with 7 percent. The
margin of error was +/- 4.4 percent. NBC's overnight poll after
Bush's acceptance speech at the GOP convention two weeks ago had
Bush at 44 percent and Gore at 41 percent, with the same margin of
error.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane was elated by the latest
poll, but cautioned against reading too much into it. ``The polls
are going to bounce around a lot over the next two weeks,'' he
said, underscoring the importance of the presidential nominee's
decision to quickly begin campaigning in these Midwest swing
states. Although President Clinton carried the crucial Midwest in
both 1992 and 1996, Gore has consistently trailed Bush in polls
here.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic ticket boarded the triple-decker Mark Twain in La
Crosse, Wis., Friday morning, having raced from Los Angeles on Air
Force Two to arrive on the banks of the Mississippi River around
dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Just 12 hours earlier, Gore had accepted his party's
presidential nomination with a 50-minute speech in which he not
only contrasted himself with Bush on a variety of issues but vowed
to usher in a ``new time'' of opportunity for American families.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of La Cross residents gave Gore, Lieberman and their
wives a spirited send-off at sun-drenched Riverside Park with a
rally of music, balloons, confetti, barbershop-style acapella
singers and a white-suited Mark Twain impersonator.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, his voice showing slight signs of wear after an intense
two weeks of campaigning, said special interests have erected a
``mighty wall of resistance'' to the changes he has promised if
elected president.
</P>
<P>
   But with Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin sharing the stage
with him, Gore reiterated the importance of one change _ campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here knows that our democracy must be reclaimed from
special interests,'' he said. ``We want to give it back to the
people. And we have to get all of the special interest money out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Feingold is the Democratic co-sponsor of the campaign finance
reform measure introduced by Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who gave
Bush a tougher-than-expected contest for the GOP presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, fresh from a four-day convention that tried to rekindle
the ``New Frontier'' spirit of John F. Kennedy, also struck a
Kennedyesque tone in his riverside remarks, summoning younger
voters to ``allow yourself to believe'' in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of where you stand, get involved and allow yourself
to participate fully with your heart,'' he said. ``We have always,
in every generation, had enough men and women and young people who
have been willing to come forward and say: 'This is our country, it
is the best in the world: the hope of human kind.'''
</P>
<P>
   Before boarding the riverboat, Gore shook hands with hundreds of
supporters, often reaching four-people deep into the crowd to grab
hands as a U.S. Secret Service agent held him by the belt to
prevent him from toppling forward.
</P>
<P>
   He hugged Denise Hedrick Mulvaney, a 31-year-old nurse from
nearby Sparta. ``I'm pregnant, and my baby book is going to say: Al
Gore was president when you were born,'' she told Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mark Twain pulled away from the dock at La Cross, Tipper
Gore snapped photos while Gore, Lieberman and Hadassah Lieberman
clapped and pumped their arms in the air to the beat of a rock
classic, ``Proud Mary,'' with its well-known refrain of ``rollin'
on the river.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore declined an invitation from photographers to pose at the
bow of the ship with arms spread, like Leonardo DeCaprio's
character in the Academy Award winning movie, ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong metaphor,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The trip down the Mississippi, which ends Monday night with an
arrival in Twain's boyhood home of Hannibal, Mo., will take the two
politicians through media markets in five Midwestern states that
could swing either for the Gore or Bush tickets this fals.)
</P>
<P>
   But the churning waters of the Mississippi, its lush green banks
and the gleaming white Mark Twain, outfitted with a red faux paddle
wheel and patriotic red, white and blue bunting, provided the Gore
campaign _ and news organizations _ with spectacular images of the
vice president and his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't all imagery.
</P>
<P>
   On board the boat's sunny deck, Gore and Lieberman led a
floating town hall meeting with local citizens, discussing the vice
president's proposal to use $250 billion of projected budget
surpluses over the next 10 years to provide prescription drug
benefits under the Medicare program.

   At one point during the discussion, Gore noted that he got less

BAY STATE UNEMPLOYMENT RISES DESPITE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' jobless rate inched up to 2.9 percent in
July, staying below 3 percent for the fifth straight month, despite
creeping evidence that the nation's economy is slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment, recorded at 2.6 percent in June, remained well
below the US rate of 4.0 percent in July, the state reported
Friday. During these boom times for job growth, the Commonwealth
has fared better than the nation as a whole for more than five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economy remains strong and our companies are creating a
record number of jobs,'' Governor Paul Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts added 7,400 new jobs last month, led by the
service sector, which saw its biggest gain since December 1994.
Resident employment stood at nearly 3.2 million _ as it did in
January _ while total jobs rose to a record high of nearly 3.3
million, up 1.7 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the July gains were attributed to the Sail Boston 2000
festivities, which boosted jobs in recreation services.
</P>
<P>
   Job gains also were logged in the finance, insurance, and real
estate sector, as 1,500 new positions followed a two-month
contraction. Manufacturing counted 2,600 fewer jobs in July,
largely due to traditional summer vacation shutdowns in the
southeastern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Construction added 500 jobs in July, despite a slowdown in the
white-hot housing market regionally and across the country. The
sector had lost 1,500 jobs in June.
</P>
<P>
   Home building has slowed down as a result of higher interest
rates, said Larry Horowitz, senior US economist at Primark Decision
Economics. But mortgage rates are back below 8 percent, he said,
concluding, ``The floor is not going to drop out of the housing
market any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists are still trying to assess the impact more modest
growth will have on the economy. Purchases of appliances and other
large items have slowed somewhat with the decrease in home buying,
but recent government data show that consumers have hardly zipped
up their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Department data showed the June trade grap widening to
a record $30.6 billion, as Americans lapped up imports, from South
African diamonds and Japanese cars to Asian TVs and VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending growth did slow down in the second quarter, to
3 percent from 7.5 percent, Horowitz said. But he expects that to
rise to 3.5 percent this quarter. Retail sales picked up 0.7
percent last month, for the fastest pace in five months.
</P>
<P>
   Factors affecting spending _ and ultimately jobs _ include high
gas prices, Horowitz said, as well as a less euphoric stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's much less of the so-called wealth effect,'' he
observed, ``because markets have been volatile, and people have
wondered a lot more about what they're really worth.''
</P>
<P>
   The mounting signs of a slower economic pace, plus recent
evidence that productivity is still on the rise, are expected to
prevent the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates at next
week's policy meeting.

FIRM HASTENS TO COMPETE IN VOICE-ACCESSED E-MAIL MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With a new deal in hand to provide voice-powered access
to the popular Lycos Web portal, the Chestnut Hill company formerly
known as Shoutmail is moving to branch out from its roots providing
a telephone-based electronic mail service that has quickly amassed
more than 1 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Now called Mobilee Inc., the 40-person company is gearing up to
take on emerging ``voice portal'' players such as TellMe and
Quack.com.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next several weeks Lycos will use Mobilee to roll out
a new nationwide service offering access to Lycos content, such as
stock quotes, weather reports, and movie listings over telephones
through speech-synthesis technology.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication that voice-enabled access to Internet content
has gone from a novelty to an intensely competitive field,
privately held Mobilee, working with California-based speech
technology provider Nuance, is replacing Quack as the voice-access
partner for Lycos, the fourth most-visited Web portal.
</P>
<P>
   Mobilee, which was founded in 1998, last autumn launched a way
to get voice mail without necessarily owning a computer, by
offering accounts where subscribers dial in to hear their e-mails
read to them by a speech robot and can respond by dictating ``wave
files'' sent back to the e-mail sender.
</P>
<P>
   Mobilee president Jacob Guedalia said the company now reports
over 1 million subcribers for the free e-mail service. It has begun
branching into what it calls ``phonecasting,'' or development of
news and information people hear by calling in from a wireless or
landline phone, and both services are supported by advertising
revenues from short ad spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've developed an infrastructure for our own applications,
but now we've built it to a scale where we can directly offer it to
partners,'' Guedalia said.
</P>
<P>
   A Quack spokesman characterized the divorce from Lycos as a
situation where ``both companies have mutually decided to work
separately'' and said Quack ``remains the early leader in
voice-to-Web solutions for businesses'' and will have new
partnerships to announce soon.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos spokesman Brian Payea said the company would make no
comment on why it was dumping Quack. ``All we're saying is that the
contract was terminated, but we can say Mobilee had some very
compelling technological advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   Those include a wide-ranging nationwide network of over 500
local phone numbers initially set up for Shoutmail where people can
call to hear Lycos content read aloud, which is far less expensive
than the toll-free 800 numbers used by some voice portals. Guedalia
said using local numbers can cost 1/10th as much as 800 numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Payea also cited the existing base of 1 million Shoutmail
customers as a crucial springboard for attracting an audience for
Lycos content delivered by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers will be able to use the Lycos portal to create a
personalized list of information sources they want to be able to
hear by calling over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Sege, Lycos executive vice president, said that ``Mobilee's
technology platform is the best available anywhere, and we're
excited to be working together with them to make the Web more
accessible than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, of Waltham, Mass., had planned to roll out the voice
portal in the autumn quarter through its Quack contract. ``We have
not lost any time'' by replacing Quack with Mobilee, Payea said.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos shares closed at $60.0625, down 25 cents, in trading on
the Nasdaq Stock Market.

CRITICAL MOMENT FOR CHALLENGER SANCHEZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASHANTUCKET, Conn. _ For years, Augie Sanchez has been known as
the guy who suffered a narrow defeat to Floyd Mayweather in the
finals of the 1996 US Olympic boxing trials.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, of Las Vegas, could vault into the mainstream Saturday
night should he defeat unbeaten WBO featherweight champion Prince
Naseem Hamed (34-0, 30 knockouts) at Foxwoods Casino.
</P>
<P>
   Question is, what kind of entrance will Sanchez make.
</P>
<P>
   He showed up 20 minutes late for a press conference Thursday,
angering Hamed, who is known for his lavish prefight entrances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who am I waiting for? Why am I waiting?'' yelled Hamed.
``Where's Augie Sanchez?''
</P>
<P>
   Word has it the 21-year-old Sanchez (26-1, 24 KOs) was late in
part because he and his wife were carded at the casino entrance
because they looked so young and were forced to take a back
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed, whose ring entrances often take up to 10 minutes, vowed
Friday to cut back on some of the routine in an effort to get into
the ring faster. Friday, he expected the same punctuality from his
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey man, how you doing, you OK?'' Hamed asked Sanchez after he
finally arrived. Then, while shaking his hand, Hamed asked, ``How
come you're so late?''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez spent the remainder of the press conference absorbing
barbs from the extroverted champ. But at one point, he turned to
Hamed and said, ``Shut your mouth. Know your role.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamed's handlers are already talking about upcoming bouts,
particuarly eagerly awaited fights against Marco Antonio Barrera
and Eric Morales, two of the top super bantamweights.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez might play a big role in altering Hamed's plans. His
most-noted victory came May 8, 1999, when he scored a seventh-round
knockout of former featherweight champion Jorge Paez.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a name change on Saturday,'' said Fred
Sterburg, Sanchez's manager. ``Prince will be formerly known as the
champ.''
</P>
<P>
   The telecast begins at 9:30 p.m. with the main event expected to
begin by 10:45. The undercard includes Lowell's Micky Ward (35-9,
26 KOs) against Antonio Diaz (32-2, 22 KOs).

   BUSH (Undated) _ After four days of silence and a ceding of the
spotlight to the Democrats and Al Gore, George W. Bush finally
responds _ and on Al Gore's home turf, no less. The event was in
Memphis, Tenn. And the tit-for-tat of Gore's speech and Bush's
response will show how the battle lines are drawn right now,
heading into the fall. In his speech, Bush took pointed jabs at
Gore. He accused him of fomenting ``class warfare'' in aligning
himself with the people vs. the powerful. He ridiculed Gore's list
of promises as a list of all the things that he and Clinton never
got done. He said Gore was not a credible person on the issue of
campaign finance reform, and said that his first priority in office
would be education, not campaign finance. By Frank Bruni.

   GORE-ASSESS (Washington) _ When he accepted the Republican
presidential nomination in Philadelphia two weeks ago, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas skipped lightly over a few issues _ taxes, Social
Security, education, nuclear weapons _ and then got to his topic
sentence: ``We must usher in an era of responsibility.'' In Los
Angeles on Thursday night, Vice President Al Gore took the opposite
approach. Declaring that ``the presidency is more than a popularity
contest,'' he said, ``I am here to talk seriously about the
issues.'' And that he did, one issue after another, as if he were
delivering a State of the Union Message and not speaking to a
political convention, so that by the time he finished, there could
be no doubt where he stood on virtually every important matter
before the federal government. A news analysis by David E.

   YUGO-IMMIG (Zagreb, Croatia) _ The Yugoslav government of

China, Belgrade has become the latest gateway to Europe for human
trafficking. The accounts of detainees here appear to confirm the

 &HT;    The Case of The Nancy Drew Fans
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ She is pluck. She is guts. She is
cleverness personified.
</P>
<P>
   She is a speedy but safe driver, an immaculate dresser, an
All-American beauty and a Jill of all trades.
</P>
<P>
   She is Nancy Drew, the ``girl detective'' who represents so much
to so many, and this year she turns 70.
</P>
<P>
   A triple threat, Nancy Drew possesses the deductive reasoning of
Jessica Fletcher, the track record of Miss Marple and the physical
daring of V.I. Warshawski. Along with loyal chums Bess and George,
Nancy formed an early prototype of Charlie's Angels _ without the
jiggle, but with just as much fashion sense.
</P>
<P>
   We recently invited readers to dish about Nancy Drew, and almost
75 fans, ages 8 to 78, responded. What made Nancy everyone's
favorite strawberry-blond sleuth? No mystery here.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was like Barbie with brains,'' writes Sabra Ingeman of
Tequesta.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy lived the dream-house life, all right, says Allyson
Samiljan.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't drive a regular car, she `motored' in a `roadster';
she never just had lunch, but ate `luncheon' . . . and instead of
wearing ordinary dresses or shorts, like we did in South Florida,
Nancy sported beautiful `frocks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What some truly envied, however, was Nancy's independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had the freedom of roving around, which most of us in the
1940s and late 1930s did not have,'' recalls Fran Leppowitz.
``Nancy Drew was the person I wanted to be like when I grew up.''
</P>
<P>
   COPYCAT DETECTIVES
</P>
<P>
   Some little girls did grow up to be like Nancy Drew.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Betty Preble.
</P>
<P>
   After reading, say, ``The Mystery at Lilac Inn'' or ``The Secret
of Red Gate Farm,'' any pedestrian or vehicle was fair game for
Preble's active imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would ask myself, `Is that a burglar casing out the
neighborhood _ or a pervert lurking for children?' I would write
down the license numbers and the descriptions of the `suspect' and
watch them in case anything unusual ever happened. Much to my
disappointment, it never did.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward. Preble becomes a sheriff's deputy in Texas while
earning degrees in law enforcement and criminal justice. Returns to
home state of Florida, opens a private detective agency in Port St.
Lucie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still write down license-plate numbers of suspicious
vehicles in my neighborhood,'' she says. ``But now, I can run them
to find out who the vehicle is registered to, their address, if
they have any criminal history record and/or are a sexual predator
_ and I'm absolutely thrilled if no crime ever takes place.''
</P>
<P>
   INFLUENCED CAREERS
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hetzel also earned a bachelor's degree in criminal
justice, but one night when she was 16, she pretended she was on
the wrong side of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was driving around with my girlfriends and a police car
started following us,'' remembers Hetzel. ``I did what Nancy Drew
did. I made a couple of quick turns, pulled into a driveway, cut
the lights, and we all ducked down. It worked! The police car drove
right past.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy inspired career choices, too, among girls who did not
enter law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Blake has been a Nancy fan since the mid-'60s. ``When we
visited friends with older homes, I used to tap on walls and
inspect the woodwork, looking for secret compartments and sliding
doors,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Now Blake is a critical care nurse. ``Trying to figure out why a
patient has certain symptoms or what those lab results mean
definitely requires detective work.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Claire Alfano Hill had been fascinated by ``the
plucky, clever, brave Nancy, who seemed to have unlimited
independence in an age when Italian-American teenaged girls like me
were barely allowed out of the sight of our parents.''
</P>
<P>
   As a graduate student in Boston, Hill was drawn to a summer job
at a detective agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent the summer typing the reports of the `operatives' and
begging to be sent out on a case. It was the `Summer of Love' in
Boston, runaways and hippie types on every corner, and as it turned
out, totally by accident, I did finally end up solving a mystery,
`The Case of My Runaway Cousin.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I became my idol.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SOME OF NANCY'S YOUNG FANS SAY ABOUT HER TODAY
</P>
<P>
   _ Autumn Perdue, 9: ``Nancy teaches you to stop and think things
through. She tests your mind and lets you help her in the cases,
and right when you think you know who it is . . . it isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Katie Johnson, 9: ``Nancy Drew Notebooks are better for kids 7
years old through 10 because in the books Nancy's 8 years old. I
like Nancy Drew Notebooks because . . . I picture myself in Nancy's
place.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Faith Peak, 14: ``Nancy is creative, smart, funny and can get
herself and her friends out of a jam because she is so clever. I
think many girls like her because the story can take them places,
in their minds, they can't go otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   INSPIRED LOVE OF READING
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1934, little Irene Parent was confined to a
sanatorium after she was diagnosed with bone tuberculosis. She
seldom saw her family during her 8-year stay.
</P>
<P>
   The antidote to her loneliness? A towering metal cabinet filled
with donated books, including Nancy Drew mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``How amazed and delighted I was over the gift of a roadster to
her by her father! What richness! How cleverly Nancy discovered
``The Secret of the Old Clock'' and continued her sleuthing by
unsealing ``The Hidden Staircase,'' remembers Parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was she who first inspired my love of reading, a love which
helped me through my years away from home; a love which endures
still, into my 74th year.''
</P>
<P>
   When bed rest was ordered, many young girls reached for Nancy
Drew.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, 9-year-old Carol Robertson was confined to bed for six
months with rheumatic fever. An older cousin introduced her to
Nancy Drew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first book was a hand-me-down, and she had no others, so I
begged my mother for another Nancy Drew book. Soon everyone was
buying them for me, and I was reading them faster and faster,''
says Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could read one a day _ I had nothing else to do _ and at
last my mother begged me to read slower or reread some as it was
costing too much.''
</P>
<P>
   A TREASURED PRIZE
</P>
<P>
   During the Great Depression, books were a decided luxury for
some families.
</P>
<P>
   Ethel Cohen was entering the sixth grade at P.S. 67 in New York
City, and on thar's end. Doc Savage for the boy, Nancy Drew for the
girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, how I wanted to win!'' Cohen remembers. ``As the term
progressed, the competition became keener and keener and finally
narrowed down to Zella and I.'' With each test, they compared
marks. ``We both tried our hardest to be the best, most helpful
citizen in the class.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the last day of school. ``When my name was called as
the best girl, I was ecstatic. The applause resounded in my ears. I
stood up, knees shaking, made my way to the front of the class on
Cloud Nine and accepted the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book had a blue cover with orange letters spelling out the
title, ``The Secret of the Old Clock.'' I read that book over and
over, treasured it for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zella probably went on to earn a Ph.D. somewhere, winning many
more honors,'' Cohen figures. ``But I had my Nancy Drew.''
</P>
<P>
   SELF-AFFIRMING RESPITE
</P>
<P>
   Bayla Singer did go on to earn a Ph.D. in History of Technology,
and as a young girl, she found Nancy Drew to be an invaluable
literary companion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nancy Drew was a normal girl who happened to be clever,
analytical, independent and responsible, and who was treated with
respect by the adults who knew her,'' says Singer. ``That such a
character could actually appear in a book meant that my parents and
their circle weren't the only adults ready to admit that those
qualities in a girl were both conceivable and admirable.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Nancy Drew actually had friends her own age, too! What a
comfort to a girl in her pre-teens whose schoolmates teased her
unmercifully for being `smart' and `teacher's pet.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Nancy Drew's existence reassured me that I wasn't a freak, and
that it wasn't `unfeminine' to have brains.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Lavins learned a similar lesson from Miss Drew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the only girl in a family with four boys. This was an
atmosphere of noise, confusion and raging testosterone that at
times seemed overwhelming. Naturally, this made me feel somewhat
isolated since I had no interest in the physical games they played
nor did I understand the `no girls allowed' camaraderie that they
and their friends enjoyed and promoted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curling up with the latest adventure was my own private
retreat away from the chaos that surrounded me. I savored the
luxury of being in my own room and living vicariously with the
adventures of my heroine. These stories were my first indication
that I could do anything that I wanted and that I was not some
inferior type of human being.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that I did not have the brawn of my brothers, but over
time I came to accept that I had the brains of my fictional
counterpart,'' Lavins says.
</P>
<P>
   HOW NANCY ENCOURAGED RISKY BEHAVIOR AMONG SOME READERS . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I am a 78-year-old woman who read and loved all the Nancy
Drew books beginning on her 8th birthday. My favorite ploy was when
invited to a friend's birthday party, I would purchase a couple of
said books for 50 cents each and before wrapping them I would
avidly read them from cover to cover.'' _ Beth Reifman
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I am both ashamed and pleased that Nancy Drew was the reason
I, as a pre-teen in the mid-'50s, cut school. I did this when I
managed to get my hands on a new book because I wanted to prop up
in bed, chomp on a delicious apple and absorb every word of this
compelling detective that was about my same age. I would read the
book start to finish in one sitting, then quickly recover to attend
school the next day.'' _ Joella Cain
</P>
<P>
   _ ``In bed at night, I would hide under the blanket with a
flashlight and read the night away. When inevitably caught, my
mother's lecture included telling me that I would ruin my eyes.
Sure enough, I needed glasses at an early age _ could Mother have
been right? If so, it's all Nancy's fault.'' _ Caroline Parrish
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I lived in the country so I had to be imaginative. I would
sneak around my home and my grandparents'. I would quietly come in
the back door and eventually surprise whoever was around. They
would ask what I was doing. `Oh, just doing a little
investigating,' I would say. `Oh, you have been reading Nancy Drew
again!' `Yes, I have!' Oh, those were the years!'' _ Debi Brenner
</P>
<P>
   _ ``My best friend and I have been avid Nancy Drew fans ever
since the third grade in 1950. We would follow anyone we didn't
know or who looked suspicious. We would call the phone number we
found written on phone booth walls to find out who they were. When
we found any paper with anything written on it we would try to
`track it down.' We would accost and interrogate and even try to
bribe 'witnesses' to save the world. I'm really very surprised we
didn't get into real trouble with our sleuthing.'' _ Nancy Zane
</P>
<P>
   AMATEUR SLEUTHS
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Straas Pollak and her friends also played amateur sleuth,
in a tiny Mississippi town.
</P>
<P>
   They were fascinated by a condemned, turn-of-the-century jail,
behind the courthouse on Main Street. ``I decided that someone was
being held hostage in the old jail, so I recruited my friends to
shadow Percy Shaw, the caretaker of the courthouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Percy wore a khaki uniform, Pollak dubbed him ``The
Khaki Pants Man'' and even dreamed up a special whistle and tune,
``Here comes the Khaki Pants Man,'' so that the young detectives
could signal one another when Percy made a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several times we gained entry into the old jail, and we would
go up the winding stairs, hearts beating so fast we could barely
breathe, as we knew we were going to find the hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Pollak's uncle was mayor of the town, and when an
informant tipped him off that Pollak and company were spending most
of their days hidden behind a bush, he put an end to the shadowing
of Percy Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mystery of the old jail,'' Pollak says, ``would remain
unsolved.''
</P>
<P>
   A PRIZED GIFT
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than inspiring me to `detect,' Nancy inspired me to
read _ a cherished gift,'' writes Maureen Boyle.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the gift of a Nancy Drew book was undeniably the best
present of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my 10th birthday, and I had just unwrapped a beautiful
gold charm bracelet from my grandparents. I glanced at it,'' writes
Ann Romer. ``The next gift was the latest Nancy Drew mystery from
Aunt Arlene and Uncle Eddie. I dove immediately into the book, and
wandered off to my room reading as I climbed the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I traipsed off with my new book, I never even heard my
mother call out, `Ann, thank Papa and Betty for that beautiful
bracelet! Ann? Ann!' ''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of excitement still exists today for 40-year-old
Alicia Ortiz, whose sister gives her five or six Nancy Drews each
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new covers are all slick and new, but I would still love
to find an old complete collection,'' Ortiz says. ``There is just
something about an old worn book that makes you want to curl up and
get lost in it!
</P>
<P>
   ``And there is nothing better than Nancy Drew!''

   When people think of online auctions, they probably envision
retirees selling bean bags from their basements and collectors
trading baseball cards or limited-edition lunch boxes. After all,
the founder of eBay, Pierre M. Omidyar, and its chief executive,
Meg Whitman, are considered ingenious precisely because they
created the first efficient global marketplace where consumers
could sell directly to one another.
</P>
<P>
   But occasional sellers are hardly what have made eBay, with more
than $87.9 million in online revenue in the second quarter, one of
the most successful Internet businesses to date. Log on to eBay and
you can easily find brand-new air-conditioners, boxes of unused
printer cartridges and cases of 7-inch zippers, all nylon, all
black. Rather than just items destined for garage sales, plenty of
new merchandise is available. ``This is not just mom and pop
cleaning out their attics,'' said Evie Black Dykema, a senior
analyst at Forrester Research. ``There is this whole subeconomy of
small businesses who use eBay.''
</P>
<P>
   The real powers behind eBay's success are those small operators
_ the liquidators, wholesalers, small retail shops and stay-at-home
entrepreneurs _ that offer the bulk of goods for sale on eBay,
underpinning its entire business.
</P>
<P>
   Call them power sellers _ eBay does. By putting dozens of new
items up for sale every day, these sellers keep buyers coming back
to bid and bid again. Of the 4 million items listed on the site on
any given day, the top 20 sellers are responsible for 72,000
listings, and the top 38,000 sellers account for 2.7 million items,
according to AuctionWatch.com, an online auction services company.
At last count, eBay had 15.8 million registered users, or Internet
names for people who use the site to buy or sell or both.
</P>
<P>
   And because power sellers, like all other sellers, pay eBay
listing fees and commissions ranging from 1.25 to 5 percent of the
value of each item sold, they contribute a huge proportion of the
company's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Some sellers list goods on other auction sites, either as an
alternative or supplement to eBay. Yahoo Auctions, the biggest of
those rivals, has 2.5 million listings. But as the first company to
exploit the online auction model, eBay dominates, holding nearly 90
percent of the online auction market, measured by sales. That sheer
volume, said Steven Johnson, director of the e-commerce program at
Andersen Consulting, drives more buyers to eBay, which in turn
attracts even more high-volume sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Who are these overachievers? A power seller, by eBay's
definition, has met at least one of three levels of standards in
volume and customer service _ designated as bronze, silver and
gold. To earn the bronze label, a seller must have minimum monthly
sales of $2,000; for silver, $10,000 a month; for gold, at least
$25,000 a month _ more than many small businesses ever achieve,
online or off. Would-be power sellers must also have received at
least 100 comments from buyers in the feedback forum, where buyers
and sellers rate each others' performance, and 98 percent of their
ratings must be positive.
</P>
<P>
   EBay says it has 20,000 to 25,000 power sellers, though it will
not disclose how many have hit any particular level. But those
numbers do not include people who may be meeting the power-seller
standards but have not had the time or the inclination to join
eBay's program, which offers them perks like full-time customer
service support and permission to display an official power-seller
logo.
</P>
<P>
   EBay declined to disclose financial details about the sellers
who make its business hum. But Andale Inc., an auction management
company in Mountain View, Calif., that provides e-mail tools and
database services to online sellers, has pored over eBay's listings
and determined that 10 percent of eBay's sellers are responsible
for 80 percent of its sales. That 10 percent thus sold about $1
billion of the $1.3 billion worth of toys, jewelry, computers,
sporting goods, real estate and other merchandise that changed
hands on eBay in the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And they may be making hefty profits. Again, eBay would not give
details of its users' businesses, but a survey conducted by Andale
in March found that sellers made a 40 percent profit margin, on
average. By contrast, many online retailers are not yet in the
black, according to Forrester. According to a report that Forrester
released in April, and based in part on interviews with 50
companies, less than 40 percent of the e-tailers expected to make
money before 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online auctions are a seriously lucrative way to sell,'' said
Munjal Shah, chief executive of Andale. ``There are a whole troop
of merchants that have grown up around that realization.''
</P>
<P>
   For these sellers, there are obvious advantages, mainly that
they can attract buyers without spending money on marketing and
that commissions are low. By contrast, Amazon.com spent about 25
percent of its sales on marketing last year _ and that proportion
is ``significantly lower than everyone else's online,'' according
to Mike May, a senior analyst for Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   EBay's role as an inexpensive marketing channel, however, may
also make it a breeding ground for fraud. The company does not
attempt to police transactions, enabling it to keep its own costs
low. But that raises the possibility that sellers may be hawking
stolen, counterfeit, damaged or fake merchandise on its site. One
dissatisfied buyer is trying to organize a class action suit by
customers who believe they were defrauded by big sellers.
</P>
<P>
   And while some buyers, in comments left on feedback forums, rave
about individual power sellers, others complain that eBay coddles
its power sellers at the expense of buyers.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as eBay thrives, power sellers appear to be here to
stay, and their numbers will probably grow. In recent months, a new
category of businesses has emerged that is dedicated to helping
them. These companies, like Andale, AuctionWorks and
AuctionWatch.com, provide billing and shipping services and
software to track and respond to hundreds of auction listings
simultaneously. ``This has become a real business,'' said Dykema of
Forrester, ``and there are now real tools to manage it.''
</P>
<P>
   So exactly who are these small businesses that use eBay as a
staging ground for e-commerce? Here are four whose revenues meet
power-seller standards.

RESCUE CAPSULE CAN'T LOCK ONTO STRICKEN SUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Desperate efforts to save any survivors from a sunken
Russian nuclear submarine met with a new setback Friday when a
rescue capsule reached one of the escape hatches but found it too
damaged to open, rescuers said.
</P>
<P>
   The heartbreaking revelation brought a grim ending to what had
been the most successful attempt at reaching the stricken submarine
Kursk after days of frustration. It all but extinguished hopes that
any of the 118 men on board will be found alive if rescuers finally
manage to get inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to go down until there is no hope left,'' a
visibly weary rescuer told a Russian Television correspondent
aboard the vessel Mikhail Rudnitsky, which is leading the rescue
operation at the site where the Kursk sank in 354 feet of water
during major naval exercises last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Two rescuers said that after numerous attempts, a small
submersible finally managed to reach one of the Kursk's two escape
hatches. But it was unable to establish an airtight connection
because the hatch was ``badly damaged,'' one of them told Russian
Television.
</P>
<P>
   The failure cast doubt on hopes that British and Norwegian
rescue teams, expected to arrive late Saturday after Russia at
first declined Western offers of assistance, would fare any better.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Russian officials had said any survivors on the
Kursk would run out of oxygen Friday. But both the commander of
Russia's navy, Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, and the senior cabinet
official in charge of the rescue, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya
Klebanov, have now extended by a week their assessments of how long
anyone alive on board could hold out.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov further dampened hopes of a happy ending when he
described a ``terrifying hole'' on the starboard side of the
forward part of the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rather big part of the crew was in the part of the boat that
was hit by a catastrophe that developed at lightning speed,''
Klebanov told reporters in Murmansk, home of the Russian Northern
Fleet where the Kursk was based.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been no sounds for quite a long time'' from within
the Kursk, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of docking with the Kursk is complicated by
currents of up to 1.8 knots, naval officials said, as well as the
vessel's 20-degree tilt. This angle is much less than the 60 degree
tilt the Russians had described until Friday, but still enough to
cause rescue capsules to slide off the hull.
</P>
<P>
   Just how difficult the docking procedure has been became clear
when Russian Television filmed a crew lowering one of the rescue
submersibles onto its berth on the Mikhail Rudnitsky. The process
is similar to what the pilot has to do to latch onto the Kursk:
guide his submersible so that a specially designed hatch on its
bottom lands squarely onto the escape hatch of the sunken
submarine. On board the Mikhail Rudnitsky, the process required a
crane, a half dozen men, and several tries to guide the submersible
into place. Under water, the pilot of the submersible has to guide
his vessel by sight, taking account of the current and the
visibility of less than five feet.
</P>
<P>
   A demonstration for television of how a Russian minisub works
turned into another painful reminder of the decrepit state of
Russia's navy, and nearly turned into another disaster, when the
small orange and white vessel began to leak, forcing its crew to
sail it slowly back to the Mikhail Rudnitsky.
</P>
<P>
   The British LR5 rescue minisub on its way to the site has never
been involved in a real rescue operation. But its captain, Alan
Hopkins, said Thursday it can operate comfortably in currents of up
to 2 knots.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's late decision to accept the British offer of help has
led to growing criticism of President Vladimir Putin's handling of
the crisis. He also came under fire for not breaking off his
vacation on the Black Sea while his country was glued to television
screens, waiting from news from the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   In his first extensive comments to reporters, Putin Friday said
he decided not to go to the site, or to Murmansk, because ``the
arrival of non-specialists and high-ranking officials to the scene
of disaster does not help, but usually interferes.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin acknowledged that Russian officials knew about the
accident ``four hours'' after it occurred, which he said was at 11
p.m. last Saturday. He said the decision not to inform the rest of
the world until Monday was dictated by the need to get ``objective
information'' about what happened.
</P>
<P>
   However, the information released for the first day or so was
often contradictory and played down the scope of the tragedy,
describing what happened on the Kursk as a ``malfunction.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin denied reports that he had not been given objective
information about the disaster by subordinates, saying that at the
outset he was told ``the chances are extremely low _ but they
exist'' of finding survivors. He also brushed off criticism that in
refusing international assistance, Russia may have put geopolitics
above the lives of the crew, saying the navy had done everything it
could to save the crew from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov, who only arrived in Murmansk on Thursday, had said
Tuesday that Russia did not need outside help because its rescue
equipment was ``no worse'' than anything Western countries had.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the Northern Fleet also responded to the
criticism that the navy reacted slowly to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a clear conscience that we have not wasted one minute,
one hour,'' said Admiral Vyacheslav Popov from his flagship, the
Pyotr Veliky missile cruiser. ``We have been doing one thing,
saving the people, saving the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials have offered various explanations of what might have
happened to the Kursk, including a collision with another vessel,
an internal explosion, or a freak encounter with a World War II
mine. Klebanov suggested the submarine hit an unspecified ``huge,
heavy object'' about 65 feet below the surface and plunged to the
sea bottom in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Two US submarines in the area and a Norwegian seismic center
have reported two explosions, the second larger than the first. One
theory is that a torpedo exploded, leading to the second explosion
as other munitions detonated.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible explanation is that the 480-foot-long submarine
performed a maneuver known as a ``whale jump,'' surfacing so
rapidly it lunged partly out of the water _ an ill-advised stunt in
waters shallower than the vessel is long. As the submarine
reentered the water, this theory goes, its momentum caused it to
plow into the sea floor the way a diver in shallow water might hit
the bottom and break his neck.
</P>
<P>
   As in any unexplained disaster, theories about the cause of the
sinking have multiplied as time goes on. Friday, two Moscow dailies
reported that the Kursk collided with an American submarine, which
the US and Russian militaries have denied.
</P>
<P>
   But with little official information available, journalists have
been hard-pressed to come up with any information at all.
</P>
<P>
   In a searing condemnation of the official secrecy surrounding
the Kursk accident, the Moscow daily Komsomolskaya Pravda Friday
printed a list of what it said were the names of the 118 crew, and
where they were stationed on board. The paper said it had paid a
naval officer $650 for the list.
</P>
<P>
   The navy has refused to release the names of the crew, much to
the consternation of relatives who are not sure if their loved ones
were on board. The Kursk, like many large Russian submarines,
rotates three crews, and since many men were on vacation, it
borrowed from the crews of two other submarines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of hearsay about what's going on,'' Irina
Lyachina, wife of the Kursk's commander, told reporters in
Murmansk. ``I hope they will tell me the truth when the time
comes.''

</P>
<P>
   A Small Business Triples Its Volume
</P>
<P>
   On a Sunday night a year and a half ago, Nang Nguyen was sitting
at his computer, looking at jewelry listings on eBay. He had
decided to bid on a diamond ring in a platinum setting; it would be
a present for his wife, Kim. The ring was listed by a store he had
never heard of _ Sun Jewelry, a tiny shop in a Los Angeles shopping
mall, thousands of miles from his home in Hershey, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   When he won the bidding, he and his wife were thrilled. ``The
price was incredible,'' remembered Nguyen (pronounced ``win''). He
immediately called Los Angeles to talk with the shop's owner, Abit
Uygan. They hit it off.
</P>
<P>
   Uygan said he was a new seller on eBay. Nguyen responded that he
was a rookie buyer. Uygan described the bad luck he had experienced
with other forms of online sales, including several failed attempts
to run a Web site. Nguyen, who was working in his father's shoe
store in Hershey, offered to help Uygan sell other pieces of
jewelry on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Their partnership, Nguyen said, has thrived. Since last year,
the two men have owned Sun Jewelry together. While Uygan continues
to oversee the production of the jewelry, which he and a few
employees make by hand in the back room of the Los Angeles shop,
Nguyen runs the administrative side, including the eBay listings,
from an office next door to his father's shoe store in Hershey.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's sales have tripled in the last year and a half, Nguyen
said. They sell up to 800 pieces of jewelry a month, about 90
percent online. The two men are now considering taking the company
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the online auction, I don't think it would be possible
to be where we are today, thinking about an IPO,'' Nguyen said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the beginning, he was not sure that eBay was the answer.
Sun Jewelry already had its own Web site (www.sunjewelry.com) and
Nguyen had decided to try several Internet marketing avenues at
once. Those included banner and classified advertising, links with
other Web sites and requests for listing on search engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listing your Web site _ trust me, it doesn't work,'' he said.
Selling items through eBay was the only thing that did. ``It has
put us in an area where everyone can see us,'' he added. ``Before,
we were just a small store, tucked away.'' Now Nguyen does not even
try to advertise the Sun Jewelry Web site, although it still
attracts customers who remember seeing it on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen has also started using eBay as a test bed for pricing. He
will list a ring on eBay and watch how many bids it gets, and how
many people click through to see the photograph and the closing
price. If the ring sells well, he may offer a few more of a similar
design on eBay or decide to showcase it on his Web site at a set
price.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the surge in business has brought trials. During the
holiday season last year, the company had a three-week backup in
orders. And maintaining friendly and accessible customer service
has been a challenge. Nguyen said he calls almost every one of his
customers himself. His phone bill, he said, runs from $800 to
$1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, he has bought services from Andale, the
auction-management company that automates his listings, allows for
different forms of payment and reminds him to send feedback to each
buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the activity, in fact, he still has not yet visited the
Sun Jewelry store in Los Angeles, or even met his partner face to
face. ``I have no idea what he looks like,'' Nguyen said. ``But I'm
going out to his wedding next year, so I'll finally see him
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Home Business
</P>
<P>
   Clearing Out Closets and Making Money
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Kimberly Crockett was working for a regional
investment company, selling mutual funds from her home in Panama
City Beach, Fla. Still in her 20s, she had already built a fine
life, with a three-bedroom house within walking distance of the
beach on the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, Crockett does not have much time to get to the
beach, and her fund work is on the back burner. Since the spring of
1998, she has built a booming business from her home, selling
collectible toys on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Always enchanted by ``The Wizard of Oz,'' Crockett had secretly
hoped she might be able to make money by collecting television and
movie memorabilia. In 1989, she decided on a whim to buy two
shopping carts full of Pee Wee Herman toys that were on sale in a
store for a few dollars apiece. It was a smart gamble: Several
pieces now sell for more than $200 each.
</P>
<P>
   But until the Web came along, she never imagined being able to
make a good living from her hobby. Today, she sells 1,000 to 2,000
toys a month on eBay, and has just hired her first employee. She
declined to divulge details of her profits, but said she was having
no trouble making money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always double my money,'' Crockett said in a phone interview
from her home, barely distracted by her light-brown cat, Panama,
which sat beside her crouched on a Three Stooges mouse pad.
</P>
<P>
   Crockett, who goes by the name SillyOzibul on eBay, started
collecting toys with a fervor about three years ago, after helping
a ``Star Wars'' fan find a rare Princess Leia figurine. After a few
months of scouring toy shows, garage sales and collectors'
conventions, she realized that she had developed a sizable
collection without any plan for what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I opened one of the bedroom doors, and there were just
bags and bags of stuff,'' she said. ``I couldn't even walk in. And
I said: `What are you doing, Kim? You just can't horde this
stuff.'''
</P>
<P>
   Crockett decided to try eBay. The first item, one of those Pee
Wee Herman dolls, sold for $18, and within a few months she had
built a company called Oz Wars Toys, a title that blends ``Wizard
of Oz'' and ``Star Wars.'' Two of the three bedrooms in her house
are now storage areas, and the living room is a packaging site,
strewn with boxes and bubble wrap. The kitchen is the only area
that is devoid of collectibles _ except for the Oz plates that hang
above the cabinets.

 UNDATED: the cabinets. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her house is so full of toys, Crockett said, that she is looking
to rent about 1,000 square feet of space in a nearby building,
where she can operate the online business and sell a few items to
local residents who stop by.
</P>
<P>
   As the business grows, it is becoming more professional. She has
bought services from AuctionWorks to help manage the business; the
move saved her the 30 hours a week she had spent writing e-mail
messages to customers and filling out feedback forms rating her
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of how much her business grows, Crockett said,
she is not ready to part with all of her collectibles, especially
those related to Dorothy and the Yellow Brick Road. ``I've just
sold a bunch of `Wizard of Oz' flags for $50 apiece,'' she said.
``They are really nice ruby-slippers flags, with slippers that
sparkle and a sign that says, `No Place Like Home.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Several bidders fought over them on eBay,'' she said, ``but
I've got to keep one for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liquidator
</P>
<P>
   A Hot Market for Unsold Clothes
</P>
<P>
   Andrew J. Waites, a tall, tan, well-dressed man with a thick
Southern accent, jumped into e-commerce last year. But he has no
intention of moving his liquidating business to Silicon Valley from
West Front Street in Hattiesburg, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, he would not fit in, he declared in a recent
interview. ``In south Mississippi,'' he said with a playful smile,
``we're not smart enough to figure out how to make money by selling
merchandise and losing money on each item.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has turned to eBay, which he will use as the
infrastructure for a new site, eValueville.com. His company,
Inventory Procurement Services, specializes in selling the shirts,
coats, jeans and dresses that retail shops want to get rid of,
usually because they want to make room for new styles and more
seasonable clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, he distributed those goods to small retail shops
that have closeouts. Then, last summer, he received a box of
Kenneth Cole leather coats of different shapes and sizes. ``We
said, `How are we going to sell these in the summer in Hattiesburg,
Mississippi?''' he recalled. ``We put them on eBay, and we were
amazed at the final sales price.'' As a result, something that
would have been almost impossible to sell at $69 in his hometown
became a hot $200 item.
</P>
<P>
   But one real advantage of the online auction sites, he said, is
the ability to reduce expenses, especially for marketing.
Sometimes, he said, he does not bother paying eBay's $2 fee for
putting a listing in bold type, yet he has sold 100 percent of the
clothing that he has tried to sell and has made a profit on each
item.
</P>
<P>
   Waites also uses eBay as a hook. He sometimes starts items at $1
each, regardless of what they must sell for to recover costs, to
draw just-lookers _ in hopes that they will go to the Evalueville
site. By mid-September, he added, he will be listing 5,000 items a
week on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been visiting department stores and manufacturers,
trying to sell them on his new business plan. He is betting that he
will be able to get them better prices than they might through
conventional liquidation channels. ``I think we can improve their
recovery by 2 to 3 percentage points,'' he said. ``We think eBay
will be for us the biggest outlet mall in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wholesaler
</P>
<P>
   Giving the Consumer Economies of Scale
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, Larry Bence has been supplying retail
stores with collectible cards and coins. And he has been using
computers for 15 years _ he was part of a proprietary network of
dealers who were sending messages back and forth in the very early
days of the Internet. So in the mid-1990s, when everyone started
talking about expanding commerce on the Web, he was all for it.
</P>
<P>
   But after setting up a Web site, he found that the effort was
not worth it. He and his staff, including his daughter, Julie,
would spend hours listing the prices of sports cards, posters, toy
cars and dinnerware with football logos. Then something in the news
would bump the prices up or down, and the site would have to be
updated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just impossible to maintain that many different pricing
ranges,'' said Bence, whose company is called Abon Cards and Coins
Ltd. After trying six times with different Web site designs, he
gave up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people that I've seen who make money on Web sites,''
he said, ``are the people who design them.'' Bence still has a Web
site, but it is just a few pages.
</P>
<P>
   As a wholesaler with more than 100,000 square feet of warehouse
space in Ohio, Bence did not have to worry about finding a place
for inventory to feed his online business. And he could have
settled for a continuation of his conventional business, selling
pallets of cards and memorabilia to retailers. But he wanted to tap
into the consumer market, too, without doing any advertising.
</P>
<P>
   That is why he turned to eBay, he said. He now assigns about a
dozen of his 22 staff members to manage his eBay listings of cards,
coins and related items. His eBay business is now large enough that
he has chosen to become an eBay gold power seller. He has developed
software to help his company manage all of the accounts; one of his
homemade software packages runs checks on credit card numbers and
addresses to make sure that a buyer is not using a stolen card.
``It's hairy,'' he said. ``We are gritting our teeth. That's the
one area that is very vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The venture has turned his business into a blend of wholesale
and retail, a mix that he said is becoming increasingly common on
the Internet. Ultimately, he is able to sell small quantities of
goods to consumers at wholesale prices, while still selling pallets
of merchandise to retailers.

   Bence said his presence on eBay had also built his contact base,
enabling him find more items to sell: ``There are people who see us
on eBay who contact us and say, `I wonder if he'll want to buy
stuff,''' he added. ``I just bought a bunch of collegiate
dinnerware _ Michigan State dinnerware. In Ohio, not many people
may want Michigan State dinnerware. But on the Internet, there are
probably plenty of Michigan State fans who will have no problem
paying up.''

EXHAUSTED GORE VOWS FIGHT AGAINST `SPECIAL INTERESTS' 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PRAIRIE DU CHIEN, Wis. _ Al Gore Friday took his newly energized
campaign to the middle of the country both geographically and
ideologically, hoping his populist message would play well with the
moderate middle of the American electorate that will decide the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Physically exhausted but brimming with enthusiasm for his
post-convention campaign, Gore pledged to fight the ``special
interests'' he said are keeping Americans from getting the health
care they need.
</P>
<P>
   Senior citizens have to ``count the pills and count the
pennies'' to decide whether they must sacrifice food for medicine,
Gore, flanked by his running mate Joseph I. Lieberman and their
wives, told a boisterous crowd of nearly 5,000 in La Crosse, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of the United States of America have had enough,''
Gore said, his voice raspy from lack of sleep. ``We're going to
stand up for working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his campaign aides apparently were pleased with the
vice president's performance Thursday night at the Democratic
National Convention, saying their private focus groups were ``off
the charts'' with praise for Gore's nomination acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   An overnight ``snap'' poll by NBC News, which is less reliable
than the customary three-day surveys, found that Gore had jumped
ahead of the Republican nominee, George W. Bush, 46 percent to 43
percent. The same poll has shown Bush with a three-point lead
before the Democratic convention. But the poll had a margin of
error of 4.4 percentage points, and analysts warned that it will
take several days to determine the real effect of Gore's
post-convention ``bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic convention went reasonably well, but I don't
think it is going to change things all that much,'' political
analyst Stu Rothenberg said Friday. ``The Democrats had problems
that the Republicans didn't. The Republican message was diversity
and compassionate conservatism. I think the Democrats are still
fighting between the two wings, and clearly Gore's speech was
tilted to the traditional wing.''
</P>
<P>
   A day-to-day tracking poll by Voter.com found Bush's lead over
Gore had narrowed to 5 points, with Bush leading 47 percent to
Gore's 42 percent in a two-way race. At the start of the week of
the Democratic convention in Los Angeles, Bush was ahead by 17
points, according to the daily poll, conducted by the bipartisan
team of Celinda Lake and Ed Goeas.
</P>
<P>
   More disturbing for the Democrats were the numbers from the
industrial Midwest, where Lake and Goeas said Bush leads 52 percent
to 37 percent. The region is critical territory for Gore,
particularly since he is trailing in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this election is going to be decided, more than any
other place in the country, in the upper Midwest,'' said Senator
Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin. Gore ``needs to go up there
and stress his commitment to that area, given the fact that neither
he nor his vice presidential nomninee is from that region.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, Gore and Lieberman did just that, taking their
wives, Tipper Gore and Hadassah Lieberman, on a four-day campaign
cruise along the Mississippi River. The quartet, accompanied by
Karenna Gore Schiff, one of the vice president's daughters, greeted
crowds at locks along the way and conducted issue seminars on
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we believe the Midwest is going to play a deciding
role in this election,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane. He said
he was heartened by the polls showing, at the least, a narrowing of
Bush's lead. But he cautioned, ``You're going to see a lot of
bouncing around in the polls'' before November.
</P>
<P>
   Gore needs to win over the political middle, but he also must
galvanize the traditional liberal wing of the party that feels
disaffected from the centrist Democratic ticket, analysts and
lobbyists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat up on (Gore) for eight years for not doing everything
we wanted him to do,'' admitted Brett Hulsey, senior Midwest
representative for the Sierra Club, which has endorsed Gore. ``And
now it's time to come together and look at what he has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the major question following the convention is whether
Gore and his running mate have presented themselves to the country
as representatives of the ``New Democrat'' moderates or the party's
core liberals. Gore and Lieberman at times have been leaders of the
New Democrats, but both men spent much of the convention assuring
the party's core supporters that they were on their side.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech Thursday was aimed at tapping into voter anger
against an array of powerful interests, but it will be days before
it is clear whether it resonated with moderate voters who are
reasonably satisfied with the state of the union. ``The speech was
Al Gore's Declaration of Independence from Bill Clinton,'' said
Darrell M. West, the Brown University political science professor.
``He staked out his own views and indicated he wasn't just going to
campaign based on the past record.''
</P>
<P>
   But West said the speech seemed designed to please liberals
instead of the middle bloc of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speech will play better with his base than the middle,''
West said. ``It will help him close the gap. Whether it will help
him win the election is still up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore had arrived in Los Angeles with an enormous media
opportunity, a four-day infomercial of adulation designed to build
the case for his candidacy. From Gore's point of view, the week
went mostly as planned.
</P>
<P>
   But that may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   The cracks in the party machinery and message were evident,
confirming Will Rogers's famous saying that he didn't belong to any
organized party _ he was a Democrat. When Lieberman arrived at the
convention, he was immediately engulfed in controversy over whether
he was too moderate and whether he supported affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who was picked by Gore partly to send a message that
the ticket is moderate, spent several days assuring liberals that
he was on their side. Lieberman's convention speech contained few
of his known moderate or conservative views. The result was the
Democratic Party left town with a more liberal tone than perhaps
was intended.
</P>
<P>
   And yet some liberals still aren't satisfied and may be
considering supporting Green Party nominee Ralph Nader. While
Democrats dismiss Nader as a fringe candidate, he represents a
serious threat to Gore in states such as California, where the
consumer advocate is running in the high single digits in the
polls, potentially enough to help Bush win this crucial state.
</P>
<P>
   The convention was also distracted by the many ways President
Clinton dominated the convention: Could Gore separate himself from
Clinton? Could Clinton speak without reminding viewers of his
impeachment?
</P>
<P>
   Gore's convention speech, Democrats say, was a strong start for
Gore's mission to define himself and energize both the liberal and
centrist wings of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleasantly surprised'' by the strength of Gore's
performance, said former Senator Howard Metzenbaum, Democrat of
Ohio. ``I think it is fair to say that up until then, he had not
had the verve, the sense of excitement about himself that causes
the American people to get turned on.''

GORE SPEECH DEFINES ELECTION AS ONE OF ISSUES RATHER THAN
PERSONALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When he accepted the Republican presidential
nomination in Philadelphia two weeks ago, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas skipped lightly over a few issues _ taxes, Social Security,
education, nuclear weapons _ and then got to his topic sentence:
``We must usher in an era of responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles on Thursday night, Vice President Al Gore took
the opposite approach. Declaring that ``the presidency is more than
a popularity contest,'' he said, ``I am here to talk seriously
about the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   And that he did, one issue after another, as if he were
delivering a State of the Union message and not speaking to a
political convention, so that by the time he finished, there could
be no doubt where he stood on virtually every important matter
before the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   He favors abortion rights, affirmative action, gun control, a
higher minimum wage and restrictions on marketing tobacco products.
He opposes discrimination against homosexuals, tuition vouchers for
private school students and diverting Social Security taxes into
private retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   On each of these issues, Gore and Bush are on opposite sides.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Gore pointed out, there is also a stark contrast in what
may be the most important issue decided by this year's presidential
election: how the government will use the budget surplus, projected
by the Congressional Budget Office to be about $4.5 trillion over
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have agreed to earmark the $2.4 trillion in the
surplus that will come from Social Security taxes to bolster the
Social Security system. But they would do this in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would use all this money to pay down the national debt, the
theory being that this would improve the economy and make it easier
to pay Social Security benefits after the baby boomers retire. Bush
would use a big chunk of the Social Security surplus to cover the
cost of creating private retirement accounts that would be invested
in the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest of the surplus, Gore would spend most of it, and
he described how in his acceptance speech: for universal health
insurance for children, for prescription drug coverage under
Medicare, for medical research, for hiring and training teachers
and for environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   He would also use a relatively small bit for specific tax cuts,
mostly to make college tuition tax deductible, to modify the estate
tax and to eliminate the tax penalty paid by some married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, would use most of the money not set aside for
Social Security for across the board tax cuts: lower tax rates for
taxpayers at every income level, tax breaks for all married couples
regardless of whether they now owe a penalty and a complete
elimination of the estate tax, which is only owed on estates worth
more than $675,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he also favors prescription drug coverage for those on
Medicare. But he has set no money aside for this initiative, which
could cost $250 billion or more between now and 2010, depending on
how generous the benefit is.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gore derided the Bush tax plan. ``For every $10
that goes to the wealthiest 1 percent,'' the vice president
asserted, ``middle class families would get one dime, and
lower-income families would get one penny.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' Gore went on, ``if you add it up, the average
family would get about enough money to buy one extra Diet Coke a
day, about 62 cents and change.''
</P>
<P>
   Those figures were developed by Citizens for Tax Justice, a
labor-backed research organization. In 1999, the richest 1 percent
comprised taxpayers with incomes over $319,000. The average income
was $915,000, and the average tax cut under the Bush plan would be
$46,072.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers with incomes in the middle 20 percent of all taxpayers
(40 percent had higher incomes and 40 percent lower) had an average
income of $31,100, and their average tax cut would be $453 (less
than 10 cents for every $10 saved by the wealthy). By this
reckoning, the daily tax cut would be $1.24 _ twice what Gore
suggested, perhaps enough for a bag of chips with the Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   The poorest 20 percent of the population, those with incomes
below $13,600 would get an average annual tax cut of $42.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign accused Gore of missing the point. Under the
tax plan, a campaign spokesman, Dan Bartlett, said, a family of
four making $35,000 would have its entire $1,500 tax bill wiped
out. A family of four making $50,000 would have a tax bill of about
$4,000 cut to about $2,000. And a family of four with an income of
$75,000 would have a 25 percent cut, to about $7,500 from about
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore and Bush calculations are both accurate. The reason for
the different emphases is that the Gore figures counted all
taxpayers at particular income levels, single people as well as
families. At middle-income levels, families would fare better under
the Bush plan than individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no dispute that the giant share of the tax cuts
under the Republican proposal would go to the wealthy. The question
is whether that is fair. Republicans say it is, since the wealthy
are the ones who pay most of the taxes to start with. Democrats say
it is not, since people that rich can afford what they are paying.
</P>
<P>
   For people who plan to vote for president in November on the
basis of where the candidates stand on the issues, the choice will
be a clear one. That is true not just on issues like abortion and
gun control but also on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Those who believe the government should spend most of the
surplus to provide better health and education programs will vote
for Gore. And those who want to give the money back in tax cuts
will vote for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last eight years, Democrats have succeeded when they
have been able to reduce the political debate to this binary choice
between tax cuts and spending for popular programs. That is exactly
what Gore was trying to do in his acceptance speech, and what Bush
was trying to avoid in his.

 &HT;    Eating kosher can be a challenge for busy politicians
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Along with the never-ending chicken
dinners and dawn-o'clock fund-raising breakfasts, pig roasts and
barbecues are part of campaign trail dining.
</P>
<P>
   For most candidates, they're not a problem: a vote's a vote,
whether it's country music and ribs at $15 a plate or chamber music
and lobster at $500.
</P>
<P>
   If you keep kosher, however, as Sen. Joseph Lieberman does, a
candidate could go hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Kashrut, the dietary laws of Orthodox Jews, say no pork, no
shellfish and no mixing dairy and meat in the same meal. So the
poor guy can't even run out for a cheeseburger.
</P>
<P>
   The strictest of the Orthodox also will not eat vegetables in a
non-kosher restaurant because meat and dairy may have been served
on the plate at some time.
</P>
<P>
   Two local politicos who keep kosher know just what the
Democratic vice presidential candidate is up against.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Krischer, Palm Beach County's state attorney, was the
first observant Orthodox Jew elected countywide. His 1992 campaign
produced some interesting moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ate a lot of salad and bread, of course,'' he said. ``And
there were many times I just didn't eat at all. There were many
chicken luncheons, and pig roasts in Belle Glade, where there was
nothing I could eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not a problem usually. I just avoided eating when
there were meats served, which is just about every time.''
</P>
<P>
   He eats vegetarian meals where possible, but says the chances of
finding kosher foods locally is greater today than in his campaign
days. ``In Palm Beach County, it's gotten much better now,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Rob Wexler, D-Boca Raton, agrees. Wexler, who also
keeps kosher at home, isn't as strict as some of his political
friends from New York. ``They won't eat in non-kosher restaurants,
for instance. I won't eat hamburgers or cheeseburgers or chicken,
and certainly no shellfish, but I eat dairy off plates that I've
got to assume meat was served on. It's just where you want to draw
the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosher foods are much more available in South Florida than even
in Washington, D.C., he said, so campaigning in his home district
isn't a problem. ``They've got a great kosher pizza place and meat
place down there (in Boca Raton) now, and even Disney World can do
kosher. We just went to an Orthodox wedding there.''
</P>
<P>
   All his fund-raisers feature kosher dining. ``The Boca Hotel has
a contract with a kosher caterer and is able to do a completely
kosher function. It's no problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Krischer says different regions present different problems. He
has a particularly hard time in Tallahassee, a frequent
destination. ``It's a lot of Southern food, collard greens and
what's that stuff called _ pork back or fat back?'' Definitely not
kosher.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, even people who mean well get it wrong. ``There
were the black beans at Jimbo's, in Tallahassee. Delicious. I had
asked if they were vegetarian, and was assured they were indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   But after he scarfed them down, the truth stared back at him
from the bottom of the dish. It was a large chunk of. . . what's
that stuff called? Fatback!

CHINESE POLICE DETAIN EDITOR'S BROTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The police have detained the younger brother of a
Boston-based poet who was arrested in Beijing last week, apparently
for his involvement in a literary journal that has sometimes
published work by Chinese dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   The poet, Bei Ling, a Chinese citizen with a U.S. green card,
was taken into custody last Saturday during a visit to Beijing. His
younger brother, Huang Feng, 32, also a writer, who lives in
Beijing, was detained Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what charges are being brought against the two
men, although Bei, 40, is being held in criminal detention, which
suggests that the charges may be serious.
</P>
<P>
   It is at least the second time in little over a year that a
Chinese intellectual with permanent residence status in the United
States has been arrested in Beijing. Last summer, Song Yongyi, a
researcher and librarian at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania was
arrested in connection with his studies of the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution, a disastrous and embarrassing period in modern Chinese
history.
</P>
<P>
   An aggressive campaign by U.S. politicians and academics helped
secure his release after six months in detention. Similar forces
seem to be gathering in Bei's defense.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Thursday to promote a major cultural
exchange between China and the United States, the U.S. ambassador,
Joseph Prueher, said of Bei: ``We have officially expressed our
concern to the Chinese government about him. Obviously the issue of
freedom of expression is a core point for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Others noted that if Bei's case is not resolved quickly, it
could prove to be a public relations nightmare for China. Within
the next three weeks both President Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, the
head of China's parliament, will be in New York for a U.N. summit
conference. At the same time, as part of the announced exchange
with the United States, a Chinese cultural exhibit aimed at
enhancing China's image will be touring U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will cause a great deal of embarrassment to a useful
cultural effort if they continue to hold him this way,'' said
Jerome Cohen, a New York lawyer specializing in China law, who
helped secure Song's release. ``They will not want to have
demonstrators protesting outside the Javits Center,'' he said,
referring to the convention center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Bei's arrest, Beijing police confiscated hundreds
of copies of Tendency, the quarterly journal that he edits, which
had apparently been shipped into the country. Tendency, which is
published in the United States, is not legally available in China.
</P>
<P>
   All magazines in China must have a government sponsor that
formally takes responsibility for their content. Foreign magazines
must have permits for import, although many circulate in
intellectual circles, and essays published overseas are often
easily available on the Chinese Internet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bei's journal combines work by both Western and Chinese authors.
The latest issue contains a poem by a Chinese political dissident,
a photograph of the exiled student leader Wang Dan and an essay by
the Irish Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what level of the Chinese bureaucracy was
responsible for Bei's _ or his brother's _ arrest and whether it
was intended to send a larger signal. In high-profile cases,
arrests may be ordered by top officials. But local public security
forces can also act on their own, sometimes to the chagrin of other
government departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when we look into cases, it's not a government plan
but the action of a small entity,'' Prueher said at Thursday's news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at the same press event, Zhao Qizheng _ the information
minister for China's State Council, or Cabinet _ said he was not
aware of the Bei Ling case.

   NEW YORK _ The broad stock market indexes have pretty much
fizzled this year. So why are many investors smiling?
</P>
<P>
   Because, at long last, a greater number of stocks are rising,
rewarding more of their owners. The battle between the haves _
stocks that are gaining _ and the have-nots is finally beginning to
even out.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, despite the paltry performance of the indexes, the
stock market is a much more promising place to invest now than it
has been in some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since March, the stock market has become more egalitarian,
with an increasing number of stocks rising rather than falling,''
said A. Marshall Acuff Jr., a market strategist at Salomon Smith
Barney. ``We're seeing a rational rebalancing of the excesses in
the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Acuff is referring to the phenomenon of the last two years in
which strong performances in the broad indexes were fueled by a
small group of stocks, mostly big-name technology companies. Last
year, for example, only 31 stocks accounted for the entire 21
percent gain in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. In 1995, by contrast,
341 stocks were responsible for the index's 37.6 percent climb.
</P>
<P>
   As the indexes ascended in recent years, they masked a fairly
sick stock market over all. Now this has begun to reverse. Even
though the indexes look weak, the internals of the market are
strengthening. In Wall Street parlance, the market's breadth has
improved significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still going to have some high-priced stocks,'' Acuff
said. ``But there is improving momentum in the value sector.''
</P>
<P>
   This turnabout owes something to investors' optimism that the
Federal Reserve will not be raising interest rates again anytime
soon. But Acuff said there were other powerful catalysts for the
democratization of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation is one driver. Public companies continue to make
acquisitions, hoping to capture the value hidden in
underappreciated shares. And big private equity buyers are also
increasingly active. Last Friday, for example, Carl Icahn, the
financier, announced his intent to buy more than $15 million in
shares of General Motors, a company whose stock has fallen 27
percent from its April high. GM rose 5.4 percent on the news but
its shares still trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of less than 8
while the Standard &AMP; Poor's index has a P/E of almost 30. Icahn
clearly sees GM as undervalued.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason that investors seem to be broadening their stock
search is that a number of richly valued companies have recently
announced shortfalls in anticipated earnings growth. To avoid being
flattened by the inevitable stampede out of a stock whose
executives have to release such news, investors are likely shopping
among companies with already diminished growth expectations.
Pleasant surprises are always easier to take than the unpleasant
kind.
</P>
<P>
   The broadening of the market's rise is most evident in New York
Stock Exchange shares. Unfortunately, breadth in the Nasdaq
composite has not yet improved. This may be because the NYSE
includes more rate-sensitive stocks, like real estate investment
trusts and preferred shares, which have responded favorably to the
view that the Fed is finished. And the small stocks on the Nasdaq
may remain in the doldrums because they are too liquid for big
investors to buy without jolting share prices.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the rising tide that is now lifting more stocks
looks to Acuff as if it has staying power, unlike the shift to
value stocks in 1998 that was all too fleeting. He points out that
many of the top-performing market sectors so far this year consist
of formerly depressed industries. ``That improvement offers hope,''
he said, ``that maybe other areas will catch on as well.''

TOWN IS BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO VERSIONS
</HEADLINE>
  TNT tries its hand at a beloved Western with an all-star lineup 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients. Program airs originally
on Sun., Aug. 20, 2000.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hadleyville is an isolated Western town. Its most respected
citizen is worn down by the demands of his job and the imminent
arrival of his nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Along comes the squinty-eyed bad guy in the black hat. He's on a
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Calgary location of TBS's version of ``High
Noon.''
</P>
<P>
   The remake of the 1952 classic Western premieres Sunday with Tom
Skerritt in the Gary Cooper role of Sheriff Will Kane, who retires
on his wedding day and then returns to the job to protect his town
and himself from Frank Miller (Michael Madsen), a vengeful criminal
who has just been released from prison and is expected on the noon
train.
</P>
<P>
   Skerritt and the rest of the company _ including Susanna
Thompson of ``Once and Again'' in Grace Kelly's role of Amy and
Maria Conchita Alonso as Will's former flame Helen Ramirez _ had
been putting in long hours in the very tight 19-day shoot when
Madsen arrived toward the end of the production schedule for his
brief part.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran Tom pretty hard and it was pretty evident when I got
there that he was pretty beat up, pretty tired and he wanted to go
home,'' Madsen said. ``I kind of thought that was good that he was
tired because I thought maybe Will Kane would have been tired by
the time Frank showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the mood that Tom was in and the fact that I just got to
Canada and I was feeling pretty good _ I think sometimes
subconsciously actors find themselves in psychological situations
that are similar to their characters, and that was a perfect
example.''
</P>
<P>
   While the cameras rolled there was tension between Kane, the
hero all but foresaken by his bride and the rest of the town, and
Miller, whose reputation and vow to kill Kane have everyone but the
sheriff cowering.
</P>
<P>
   But between scenes there was another kind of tension between
Skerritt, one of Hollywood's most respected actors and a notorious
prankster, and Madsen, who lives and breathes by the Stanislavsky
Method.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom tried real hard to lighten everybody up when the bad guys
showed up,'' Madsen said. ``He wanted to do a little dance sequence
off camera. He thought that was going to be really funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I just said, `Tom, you know what? I'm really not here to
dance. I'm here to kill you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He just kind of walked away real slow,'' said Madsen, adding
that he apologized to Skerritt for it at the wrap party. ``He's a
sweet man, he's a nice man. I certainly didn't want to upset the
guy. I just had a job to do and I was there to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Movie purists are sure to cry foul over the very nerve of
Skerritt, Thompson, Madsen, director Ron Hardy and executive
producer David Rosemont remaking such a beloved film. Each of them
considered his and her own concerns with that issue and decided to
go ahead with it.
</P>
<P>
   Skerritt says he was undaunted by the idea of stepping into
Cooper's boots in probably his most memorable character, a
performance that earned him an Oscar. ``All I could do is pay
respects,'' he said. ``That's all any of us could do, pay respects
to the original and to Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly and look at a
script that was very beautiful in terms of economy, very
minimalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we remaking this movie? No, I think we're remaking the
script,'' Skerritt said. ``There's a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never our intention, certainly not mine, to try and
make a better version because the best version of 'High Noon' has
been made by other people,'' said Hardy, effusively grateful for
the endorsements his project received from 1952 ``High Noon''
producer Stanley Kramer and the son of Carl Foreman, whose original
script was used with a few alterations by T.S. Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starved of good material and when there's a good script
like 'High Noon,' it seems like such a shame not to give it another
chance,'' Hardy said. He said stage plays are given many different
treatments in assorted theaters by diverse directors, and great
movie scripts are entitled to the same _ as long as they are
treated with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not against being criticized for bad filmmaking. I'll be
open to that until the cows come home,'' the director said. ``And I
have sensed the criticism of 'how can you dare go and make this
again.' I just say to those people, 'Please sit down, watch and
make your own judgments. Don't be coerced into not seeing the film
because somebody has said that it's wrong to do so.'''
</P>
<P>
   Among the differences between the Skerritt/Thompson movie and
the Cooper/Kelly version directed by Fred Zinnemann: The old one
was in black and white, a bold choice when Technicolor was the
norm, while the new one is in subdued color; the old one used
bright, nearly shadowless lighting typical of the '50s, while the
new version has more of a natural-light look; the relationship
between Amy and Helen has been expanded somewhat, and Miller,
speechless in the original, has been given a few terse lines; and
the theme music of the original (``Do not foresake me, oh my
darlin', on this our wedding day ... '') was burned into the
American pop culture consciousness but is not used in the remake.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers who enjoyed Coop's version but believe it's worthy of
another treatment can watch the new ``High Noon'' on Sunday and
again on Aug. 26 and Sept. 2. For those who hold the 1952 version
sacred, it's being shown _ not coincidentally _ on TBS' sister
network, Turner Classic Movies, where ``Noon'' strikes at 11 a.m.
(PDT) Sunday and again on Aug. 26.---The show: ``High Noon.'' &QL; 
What: Remake of the 1952 Western in which a sheriff faces a
vengeful outlaw without any help from his bride or the townfolk. &QL; 
The stars: Tom Skerritt, Susanna Thompson, Maria Conchita Alonso,
Michael Madsen. &QL;

   The second annual Winfemme Film Festival, under way in Beverly
Hills, focuses attention on features, documentaries and shorts with
women in leading roles, but it's not a women's film festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its films simply feature female protagonists,'' said Phyllis
Stuart, president of Women's Image Network. ``These are not chick
flicks. They are great flicks that will appeal to people who love
movies _ or those who love women.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's lineup includes a block of three humorous shorts playing
at 4:45 p.m. _ `'A Friend Comes to Visit,'' ``Anal'' and ``Ladies
Room L.A.'' _ all bathroom-themed movies.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's highlights include ``Kathryn &AMP; Her Daughters,'' a
documentary about a 75-year-old widow whose outlook is shaped by
her farm life in the '50s and '60s; a short, ``A Feeling Called
Glory,'' about a summer friendship between two odd characters; and
``The Georgia Peach Boy,'' a short about a Georgia woman who dreams
of having a baby and finds an infant in the pit of a giant peach.
</P>
<P>
   The closing celebration, 7 p.m. Sunday at the Beverly Hills
Civic Plaza, will honor actress Lauren Bacall and director Jane
Campion. Bacall will be on hand to accept her WIN Award and see a
screening of ``The Mirror Has Two Faces,'' for which she received
an Oscar nomination. Campion is filming on location and will be
represented by actor Sam Neill, one of the stars of Campion's ``The
Piano.'' Tickets for that event cost $50.
</P>
<P>
   Film screenings at the Laemmle Music Hall, 9036 Wilshire Blvd.,
are sold in blocks of titles for $7 per block. For more
information, call WIN at (310) 996-0267 or go to

BABBITT INDICATES WEST'S RAGING FIRES MAY BE OUT OF CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST YELLOWSTONE, Mont. _ Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said
Friday that the wildfires raging across the West are likely to get
worse and warned that, with resources already stretched to the
limit, little can be done to slow their progress.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million acres were burning Friday in 11 Western
states, the most land on fire at any one time in the United States
since 1910. Federal officials said Friday that they were growing
increasingly concerned that the situation in Montana, the
hardest-hit state, might turn more catastrophic, with separate
fires beginning to merge.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt, who spent the day traversing the smoky skies and
walking the soot-covered soil, said the scope of the fires and the
limited availability of trained firefighting supervisors meant that
the intensity of the fires in the weeks ahead would depend more on
weather than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Additional bodies will not help in this fire season,'' Babbitt
said on a stop here, where he met with some of the 25,000 people
battling the fires from Montana to California to New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt seemed to be trying in part to head off public calls for
the deployment of more firefighters, a step that he warned might be
counterproductive. But his comments Friday seemed also to
underscore a sense of powerlessness in a fire season that some
federal officials say appears on track to be the most devastating
in 90 years.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Clinton administration say it has been slow to
respond to the fires, and even contributed to the problem through
its conservation policies. Representatives of the timber industry
have said that the priority given to environmental concerns within
the administration had prevented officials from confronting the
fire threat as might have been most appropriate, through emergency
logging measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be an alarmist, and I'm not saying it will
become catastrophic,'' Babbitt said. ``But the probability that it
will become worse is very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Of most immediate concern, said a top federal fire official with
Babbitt, is what could happen over the next few days, when high
winds are predicted across Montana and Idaho, the locations of the
worst fires. The official, Larry E. Hamilton, director of the
National Office of Fire and Aviation in Boise, Idaho, said the fear
is that scattered fires could consolidate, posing new dangers to
communities like those in Montana's Bitterroot Valley, south of
Missoula in western Montana, whose residents have already been
evacuated twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you could have in some places is a 20- to 40-mile wall of
flame, and that would be just unstoppable,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So far this year, wildfires in the West have consumed 4.7
million acres, including the more than 1 million acres still
burning. Hamilton said there is a significant chance that the total
by the end of the fire season could top the more than 8 million
acres that burned in 1910, regarded as the worst year on record.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 85 major fires burning across the region, 27 are in
Montana, with more than 470,000 acres listed as burned or burning.
</P>
<P>
   To reinforce the hundreds of fire crews battling the blazes, the
federal government has turned to the military, which has deployed
four battalions, and to other countries, including Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, which have sent some 600 firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   But Babbitt said Friday that a shortage of firefighting
supervisors meant that to deploy any additional firefighters now
risks overloading the system and could put untrained volunteers in
harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a point of diminishing returns, and actually,
diminishing loss of effectiveness when you start piling people in
without trained leadership to manage them,'' Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the fires, Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana imposed a
state of emergency on Wednesday and called up the National Guard to
assist in firefighting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said he believed that such reinforcements would be best
used to assist in evacuations, if necessary, rather than on the
fire lines.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 percent of those people battling this summer's fires
are college students, and with a new semester about to begin,
Babbitt said he was concerned that large numbers of firefighters
might feel obliged to head back to school before the worst of the
danger passes.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of preventing such a drain, Babbitt said he had spent
much of the last few days pressing Western governors to defer
registration deadlines in public universities until at least Sept.
15, so firefighters could stay on the job. Montana and Idaho have
already announced such plans, and Babbitt said he hoped that
universities would offer remedial teaching to students who decided
to begin their studies late because of the fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who are already trained up and on the ground,
and we don't want to lose them,'' Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   On a day that began with a briefing at the interagency fire
center, Babbitt flew on to Montana and then Wyoming on a route that
passed through some of the worst of the fire zone. For much of the
journey, the view of the ground was obscured by thick smoke, but
some fires could be readily identified, including one that broke
out late Thursday in the small town of Atlanta, Idaho, northeast of
Boise, and forced the evacuation of about 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   A trained firefighter himself, with many summers' experience on
the lines, Babbitt pointed out the line of the fire's advance,
driven by winds that had tossed burning embers long distances on
the rugged hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   In West Yellowstone, Babbitt met with crews who are battling the
Beaver Creek fire, a 4,500-acre blaze that began a week ago and has
made for considerable uneasiness in the nearby town of Big Sky,
where 300 residents turned out for a meeting on Thursday night to
discuss possible evacuation plans.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Duke of the U.S. Forest Service, the local incident
commander, told Babbitt that he had been unable to secure the
manpower and helicopter support necessary to fight the fire in
earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said he could promise only to do what we can with what
we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   By federal policy, top priority in all firefighting operations
is given to protecting lives and property. This summer, that
obligation alone has been so considerable that, in more isolated
areas, fire commanders have had no choice but to allow blazes to
burn.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, the federal fire official, said the agency's concerns
about the spread of the fires intensified in the last week, in part
because of analysis from experts at a Forest Service research
station in Missoula.
</P>
<P>
   A computer model that assesses such factors as drought,
lightning strikes and fuel loads has concluded that there was at
least a 10 percent chance that the fires could turn catastrophic in
a way that could force large-scale evacuation.

BUSH, IN TENNESSEE, ATTACKS GORE'S SINCERITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It was planned as a terrific irony: George W. Bush
campaigning in Tennessee, challenging the vice president for votes
in his own home state.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a slogan for Friday's campaign stop in a Memphis
suburb: ``Listen to people who know them best.'' But in a short
visit _ which was cut even shorter when Bush decided to return to
Texas early to go jogging _ the Republican candidate mostly told
voters what to think of his opponent, using some of his strongest
language thus far in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At a midday rally that drew thousands, Bush tore into the speech
Gore gave at the Democratic Convention the previous night,
attacking the vice president's style of politics and questioning
his sincerity. Accusing Gore of being divisive, Bush said his
speech was essentially empty, designed purely to cover up past
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night we heard a laundry list of new promises which I
thought was an attempt to cover up old failures _ a list of of
promises without purpose or vision,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventions are over and the battle lines are clearly
drawn,'' he continued. ``On the one hand, they have four more years
of finger-pointing, politicizing and blaming, a candidate who wants
to pit one group of people against another, a candidate who wants
to wage class warfare to get ahead. I've got a different vision of
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks came as the campaign entered a new phase, following
the end of both parties' nominating conventions. Both candidates
had predicted a sea change starting Friday, as the election cycle
drew closer to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who a day earlier announced he would participate in three
presidential debates, reiterated his commitment to facing Gore in
the final months of the election, saying he would meet the vice
president ``in a format that people will listen to and pay
attention to.'' He left open questions about whether he would
participate in a series of debates planned by the official
Commission on Presidential Debates.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore kept up a hectic pace Friday, making a red-eye flight
aboard Air Force Two to the Midwest to embark on an 11-hour day of
campaigning along the Mississippi River, Bush kept a more limited
schedule. After holding the Tennessee rally, he and running mate
Dick Cheney flew to Dallas, where they spoke to reporters at the
airport before disappearing from public view.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, the Bush communications director, said the Texas
governor cut short the visit because he prefers going running in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters on board his campaign plane, Bush gave his
take on the race, and on Gore's speech in particular. He even
offered Gore some praise for his Democratic convention performance,
saying he thought the vice president had achieved his goal of
presenting himself as independent from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well he convinced me. . . . What he convinced me of is that,
sure. Yes. I mean, he's standing on his own two feet,'' Bush said,
stammering a bit when asked whether Gore's claim that he is his
``own man'' was convincing. ``Having done that myself, I know what
it's like to stand up in front of the convention and say, `Here's
my view, here's my plan, here's how I intend to lead.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush took issue with Gore's attempts to cast the Democratic
ticket as a populist force that contrasts with an elitist
Republican ticket. Accusing Gore of being divisive, Bush said that
he did not believe the tactic would work, suggesting the voters
would be turned off by Gore's rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to lead a nation by dividing, by pitting people
against each other,'' he said. ``That's the rhetoric of the past,
where you kind of group warfare or class warfare, and I don't think
Americans are going to buy that style of leadership. But what the
heck do I know?''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush said Gore's speech was intrinsically
flawed, raising more questions about the accomplishments of the
Clinton-Gore adminisration than it answered. ``His speech last
night, obviously, I thought, was a tacit admission that they
haven't done a lot in terms of Medicare and Social Security,'' he
said. Asked to elaborate, he continued: ``Because why would you
need to be saying that we need to do something on Social Security
after seven years unless nothing had been done?''

if the Japanese model can be transplanted to North America and

AT REUNION'S END, 50 YEARS OF SEPARATION RESUMES FOR KOREAN
FAMILIES 
</HEADLINE>
  By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Four days after they had begun to mend the
shattered fragments of their pasts, 200 North and South Koreans
were separated from their families again on Friday, as the reunions
authorized by the leaders of both countries came to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother, try not to think about me, and take good care
yourself,'' said Rim Jae Hyok, 69, bowing to his mother as she sat
in her wheelchair. Buses waited to take him and the other North
Korean visitors to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Gyu Sol, 66, spoke to his brother over a cellular phone
handed to him by his family members in South Korea. ``Take good
care of our parents, and you must fill in for the role that I
cannot play,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes took place outside the Sheraton Walker Hill Hotel in
Seoul, where the 100 visitors from the North stayed during their
four-day reunions. An equal number of South Koreans made a
simultaneous trip north. Both groups returned to their homes on
Friday after celebratory, but bittersweet, visits.
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, as eight buses of relatives headed out of the parking
lot and toward the airport, several North Koreans _ their hands on
the windows _ could be seen trying to catch a last glimpse of
family members.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 South Koreans, who were chosen through a lottery from
among 76,000 applicants, returned to Seoul at about 2 p.m. on a
chartered Korean Air jet. Earlier in the day, the same plane
carried the 100 North Koreans back home.
</P>
<P>
   The South Koreans described Pyongyang, the North Korean capital,
as a drab yet orderly city, with tall buildings and crowded
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Pyongyang appeared to be a lot freer than I had
thought, but their expressions seemed rigid,'' said Han Jae-il, 82,
who went north to meet his wife, who is 75. ``But all of the bad
feelings I had toward North Korea are all gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Television footage of Pyongyang showed a spacious and manicured
city, with long rows of 30-story buildings, mostly in drab grays or
tans. Accentuating the somber buildings were red signs bearing
revolutionary slogans like ``Self-Reliance, Powerful Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot more high-rise buildings and apartments than
I had expected,'' said Kang Ki-joo, 90, who met with his son in
Pyongyang. It is a city with ``no fat people,'' another visitor
said.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, politics intruded on the family reunions. Lee
Jong-sung, 84, while visiting two sons in the north, said he heard
more praise of the North's leader, Kim Jong Il, than he could
stand. ``I finally told them to get some common sense,'' Lee said,
according to an Associated Press report. ``When they gave me that
political nonsense, they didn't feel like my own sons.''
</P>
<P>
   While more exchanges between the two countries are planned, the
visits will involve few of the families separated since the Korean
War solidified the division of the nation into a communist north
and a capitalist south. Some 10 million people have been separated
from their family members since 1950, according to South Korean
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The reunions are part of an accord reached the by North Korean
leader, Kim Jong Il, and the South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung,
during their historic meeting in June, when they agreed to start a
process toward reunifying the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has already agreed to re-establish rail links, and
last week it signed an agreement with one of South Korea's
conglomerates to develop a permanent meeting place for separated
families at Kaesong, just north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the North Korean visitors were given a heavily
guarded tour of a royal Korean palace built hundreds of years ago.
But unlike the upbeat atmosphere during an earlier tour of a giant
shopping mall, the North Koreans appeared somber and reluctant to
speak, even to each other.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the hourlong tour, a reporter asked a North
Korean visitor if he had been to the palace before.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long time ago,'' the North Korean man said. After a few more
steps, he added, ``I think it was 60 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But the short conversation came to a halt when a North Korean
cameraman swerved by, pointed to the old man and said: ``Look how
red his face is. He's tired. Leave him alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, rapprochement efforts continued between the two
Koreas. Soon after the plane carrying the visitors left for
Pyongyang, North Korea's State Symphony Orchestra arrived in Seoul
to hold the first joint concert with the Korean Broadcasting System
Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   The two Koreas have held joint performances of traditional arts
and pop concerts but never before combined their symphony
orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Byoung Hwa, lead conductor of the North Korean orchestra,
described the opportunity for a cultural union. ``We will show you
the soul of Korean music,'' he said.

MARKET INSIGHT: PUZZLEMENT IN A LAND WHERE RATES SELDOM RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, Aug. 20.)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pushing on a string must get tiring. Or maybe just tiresome.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, these are probably not the best attempts to explain
why the Bank of Japan decided on Aug. 11 to lift short-term
interest rates for the first time in a decade. But they may not be
the worst explanations either, since the central bank's loose money
approach _ a zero-interest policy had been in effect since February
1999 _ seems to have done little to lift the Japanese economy out
of recession.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank, however, asserts that the economy is showing
``clearer signs of recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese stock market, which should be a leading economic
indicator, does not reflect those signs. The Topix index, which hit
a 52-week low Aug. 4, is down more than 14 percent this year in
local currency terms.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Elizabeth Allan, a senior vice president at Scudder
Kemper Investments and an analyst for the Japan Fund, talked about
the Bank of Japan and the outlook for Japanese equities. Following
are excerpts from the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. The decision by the Bank of Japan has perplexed a lot of
smart folks. Why do you think it raised rates? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A. Nothing in Japan is ever made explicit, and people are
scratching their heads to understand this. But there are a number
of interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   One is that the bank wanted to assert its independence. Masaru
Hayami, the governor, had been saying it was abnormal to have
zero-interest rates. The subagenda there was the fact the
government has been piling up too much debt. In that context, I
suspect his thinking was that some cost for that borrowing is
different from essentially no cost.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor to bear in mind is that Japan is an aging country
with a lot of people on fixed incomes. They want there to be some
kind of return on savings.
</P>
<P>
   A third explanation is that Hayami is on a personal mission to
force a restructuring of the Japanese corporate and financial
structure. The thinking here is that if companies have free cash,
they will postpone making hard decisions. By putting a price tag on
the cost of money, you are pushing companies to restructure. If you
are a company on the edge of bankruptcy, an increase in interest
rates of 25 basis points could make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. The bank seems to think the economy is gaining strength. Do
you agree? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A. It is not clear if the economy is actually recovering. And I
don't think anybody expects the rate increase we saw will lead to a
series of tightenings. Politically, it would be very difficult for
the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates a second time without
much more concrete signs of recovery than we have had. That said,
the export sector has been extremely strong, as has investment
spending in technology by Japanese companies. But private demand
remains weak.
</P>
<P>
   However, as equity investors we are not completely wedded to how
the economy does on a macro basis. We see a lot of good things
going on at the micro level. A lot of companies are restructuring
and are doing things like providing employees with incentive-based
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   And this economy has been in a slump for over 10 years. That
means the potential for improvement is large.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. If demand is still slack, how can companies improve the
bottom line?  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A. Companies that have a lot of fat are getting rid of it. That
means if the economy stays in the doldrums and revenue growth
remains stagnant, the bottom line is expanding.
</P>
<P>
   The Shinko Research Institute did a survey of companies listed
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for the fiscal year ended March 31 that
illustrates this point. The companies surveyed showed a 1 percent
decline in sales, but a 28.6 percent increase in profits.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if the survey is representative or not. But the
magnitude of the numbers is impressive.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. Japan was hit hard by the energy crisis in the 1970s. Has
the run &LR; - &UR; up in oil prices this year done much damage? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A. The rise in oil prices has not had much of an impact. The
Japanese used to be very dependent on imported oil, and the 1970s

JUVENILE TRIAL FOR SKAKEL MAY BRING DISMISSAL OF CHARGE, DA SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lead prosecutor in the Martha Moxley murder case said Friday
that the state of Connecticut may drop its effort to convict
Michael Skakel if the new trial ordered this week is assigned to
Juvenile Court.
</P>
<P>
   State's Attorney Jonathan C. Benedict said such a ruling would
leave ``the state, at this point, with no remedy that I can see''
to prosecute and incarcerate Skakel, 39, for the 1975 murder of his
teenage neighbor in exclusive Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Although Benedict expressed ``extreme confidence'' that Juvenile
Judge Maureen Dennis will order Skakel to stand trial in Superior
Court, he said that keeping the case in Juvenile Court would reduce
the charge against Skakel from murder to juvenile delinquency, and
that the statute of limitations probably would bar prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Michael (Mickey) Sherman said Friday he is
prepared to argue Skakel's innocence in either adult or juvenile
court. However, he agreed that any trial before a juvenile judge
could result in Skakel's freedom, even if he were convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis ruled Thursday that sufficient evidence exists to try
Skakel for Moxley's murder, and that she now will determine where
such a trial will occur. Under 1975 law in Connecticut, a transfer
hearing was required before a juvenile could be tried in Superior
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, Connecticut teenagers are routinely tried in
Superior Court for murder and other serious crimes. Skakel, the
nephew of Ethel Kennedy and cousin to former US Rep. Joseph P.
Kennedy III, was 15 at the time of Moxley's slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Before Dennis makes her decision, however, a juvenile probation
officer must determine whether Connecticut has juvenile facilities
to house an adult offender, as well as investigate Skakel's family
background, schooling, and mental health.
</P>
<P>
   Such a review is consistent with 1975 state law, when Moxley's
bludgeoned body was found under a tree on her family's Greenwich
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict considers this review only a formality before Dennis
transfers Skakel's trial to Superior Court. No juvenile correction
facility in Connecticut, he said, ``has the ability to deal in any
way with a 39- or 40-year-old man.''
</P>
<P>
   But another factor that Dennis could weigh, by statute, is
whether the ``safety of the community'' requires Skakel's
appearance in adult court and its possibility of lengthy prison
time.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Sherman sees his best hope for Juvenile Court.
Sherman has said, over and over to reporters, that Skakel has lived
``an exemplary life'' as an adult. And if one goal of juvenile
incarceration is rehabilitation, Sherman argues, that need no
longer exists in Skakel's case.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict, predictably, takes the opposite stand. Anyone
convicted of murder, even 25 years after the crime, remains a
danger to society, he contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most serious crime in any jurisdiction, the crime of
murder. That's why there's no statute of limitations,'' Benedict
said. ``We're expected to prosecute these acts whenever they come
to our attention. And a person, having murdered somebody, should
always be considered some threat to the community, no matter how
wonderful he has been for the last 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   David Rosen, a Yale Law School lecturer who has a private
practice in New Haven, predicted that the trial will be sent to
Superior Court, thus avoiding the ``almost comical anomaly of
prosecuting a nearly 40-year-old person in Juvenile court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side of that,'' Rosen added, ``is that the adult
court was not designed to prosecute crimes committed by children.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Boston defense lawyer Albert Johnson said that trying
Skakel in Superior Court would be ``morally wrong and legally
indefensible.'' Skakel would be deprived of the legal protections
available to him in 1975, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of juvenile law at the time of Moxley's death,
Johnson said, was to rehabilitate minors. ``It would be legally
wrong to subject (Skakel) to any different test,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Boston defense lawyer, Robert Sheketoff, used this
description of the differences that time has made in juvenile law:
``When I first started, you could get away with murder _ if you
were young enough at the time of the crime, and you were old enough
when they caught you.''

A TEST FOR HEALTHCARE CREDIT ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Aug. 20) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although still under the shadows of a government investigation
into its billing practices, HCA-The Healthcare Corp., the nation's
largest hospital chain, made a successful foray into the debt
markets on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Strong investor demand allowed HCA, formerly called the
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., to increase the size of its issue by
50 percent to $750 million.
</P>
<P>
   The debt offering was a key test of whether HCA had regained the
trust of investors, and apparently it had: they placed more than $2
billion in orders for the 10-year notes. It was also a test of
whether the for-profit health care industry was recovering after
years in critical care.
</P>
<P>
   The reception investors gave the HCA issue added to evidence
from the stock market that it is. Shares of publicly traded
hospital companies have soared this year, even as the overall stock
market has stumbled on concerns about rising interest rates and
slowing corporate growth.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen F. Lamb, a high-yield health care analyst at Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, called the market hot for hospital credit
issues. ``Issuers not taking advantage of this are asleep at the
wheel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Through underwriters led by Chase Securities and Goldman, Sachs
&AMP; Co., Nashville-based HCA priced 10-year senior unsecured notes at
99.53 to yield 8.821 percent, or about 305 basis points _ a basis
point is one-hundredth of a percentage point _ more than a 10-year
Treasury note with a comparable maturity. Price talk ahead of the
sale was of a spread over Treasuries of 312.5 to 325 basis points.
The notes, which were given an 8.75 percent coupon, have a maturity
date of Sept. 1, 2010.
</P>
<P>
   HCA is considered a bellwether in the hospital industry. It
initially planned to issue two maturities but settled on one.
Moody's Investors Services rated the 10-year note Ba-2, its
second-highest junk grade. The Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. gave it a
low investment grade, BB+.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Carter, senior market analyst at MCM CorporateWatch, a
research firm, said the deal included a make-whole call provision.
``In effect what this means is that the issue is essentially
noncallable because the price is so high and will only be called if
Treasury yields move significantly lower and it makes economic
sense to do so,'' he said. ``This is a regular feature on many
investment grade and upper-level-rated high-yield bond issues.''
</P>
<P>
   HCA said the proceeds from the financing would be used for
general corporate purposes including repayment of bank debt. In May
the company agreed to pay $745 million in civil penalties to settle
part of a broad government inquiry into whether its success was
achieved in part by cheating federal health programs. If approved,
it would be largest health care fraud settlement ever obtained by
the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Still, criminal and other civil investigations that have long
been at the heart of the case remain unresolved. They concern
whether the company's hospitals fraudulently overstated expenses to
increase reimbursement from Medicare and other federal health
programs and engaged in illegal financial relationships with
doctors. Under the terms of the partial settlement, both Columbia
and the government are under pressure to resolve the entire case
before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's debt sale represented the company's first trip to
the bond market since 1997, when government agents raided the
company's offices and hospitals in seven states, seizing documents.
Last year under the old corporate name HCA tried to sell $250
million of shorter maturity securities, but withdrew before they
could sell, citing market conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the government's investigation, the hospital chain has
changed its name and installed a strong new management team to the
delight of some portfolio managers. It has also improved its
balance sheet by shedding 140 hospitals from a peak of 340 in 1997
and reduced its debt by about $2.4 billion, to just a little less
than $7 billion, trimmed costs and bargained for better terms with
private insurers who pay patient bills.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to HCA, a large number of other companies issued
debt last week, selling over $12 billion in investment grade
securities, according to MCM CorporateWatch.

RUDE BILLBOARD COPY IS SATIRICAL, DOT.COM FIRM SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As ads go, they may be memorable for all the wrong reasons, and
they may be spotted soon nationwide, despite complaints about
irreverent content and possible legal issues.
</P>
<P>
   On billboards around Los Angeles for the last six weeks,
motorists have seen an image of George W. Bush on the phone. The ad
isn't touting Bush's presidential candidacy but the services of a
long-distance phone company called Bigredwire.com.
</P>
<P>
   The ad copy reads: ``Pay for long distance? Fuhgdat!''
</P>
<P>
   A vulgar wordplay on popular ``Whassup?'' ads from Budweiser?
Maybe, maybe not. A second Bigredwire.com ad features Queen
Elizabeth II, and plans call for a version of the ad to run soon in
Boston with an image of US Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a problem with people seeing us as a little bit
rude,'' said Bigredwire.com general manager Frank Jiang, explaining
the advertising strategy of the California-based company. ``People
who are rebellious are our market.''
</P>
<P>
   The company did not seek permission from Bush, Queen Elizabeth,
or Kennedy to use their images in ads, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling home from the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles
Friday, Kennedy had no comment, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In other cities, Bigredwire.com plans to use different local
figures such as Hillary Rodham Clinton in New York, Elian Gonzalez
in Miami, and Al Gore in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Satirizing public figures'' is ``fair game,'' Jiang said of a
campaign that could run through Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   But these ads might not meet a court's definition of parody and
satire, said M. Robert Dushman, an attorney with Brown Rudnick
Freed &AMP; Gesmer of Boston who specializes in First Amendment rights
and free speech issues.
</P>
<P>
   While satires and parodies may qualify as protected speech, the
unauthorized appropriation of the likeness of a public figure in a
commercial ad campaign may not. Otherwise, a fast-food chain could
use images of Michael Jordan to promote their hamburgers and not
bother to pay him an endoresement fee.
</P>
<P>
   Courts can distinguish between ``pure speech'' and ``commercial
speech,'' and some courts might be willing to award monetary
damages to the public figure or order the advertiser to ``cease and
desist'' from running ads that use the public figure's likeness,
said Natasha C. Lisman, a partner at Sugarman Rogers Barshak &AMP;
Cohen, a Boston law firm.
</P>
<P>
   But just because public figures have the right to sue a
commmercial venture that attempts to profit from their image
doesn't mean they will; public figures might conclude that a legal
battle would bring them even more unwanted publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The likelihood of Queen Elizabeth being a plaintiff in an
American lawsuit is pretty small,'' Dushman said.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the queen or Bush were to sue, the suit might raise
Bigredwire.com's public awareness _ just what the company wants,
said Judy Warner, a former editor of Adweek New England.
</P>
<P>
   Bigredwire.com could simply take down the billboards and say,
```OK, sorry, we quit,''' and that could end the lawsuit, said
Warner, who just launched ComAve, a Melrose, Mass. firm that
advises clients on how to manage content on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it might possible for Bigredwire.com to reap a
lot of publicity without suffering major consequences, and just
because the queen won a battle against the company, it wouldn't
necessarily mean it would have to stop running ads of other public
figures. Each might have to bring a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang said Bigredwire.com hasn't heard anything from the Bush
campaign or the British consul's office, though he's heard plenty
from local politicians complaining about the proximity of the
billboards to churches and residential neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In running the ads, Bigredwire.com wants to get out the message
that it offers free long-distance calling to consumers who agree to
view ads on the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how its business plan is supposed to work. Consumers
register at Bigredwire.com. Then they make long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   A record of calls appears at the company's Web site. Next the
consumer visits the Web site. If a call is checked off within a
specified time, charges can be forgiven. If consumers fails to
visit the Web site, they're billed for the call.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the appeal of free calls could make Bigredwire.com
one of the busiest sites on the Web, and the company hopes to make
money by selling advertising on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the billboards in LA and the media attention it's gotten
for the ads have attracted many new customers to the company, Jiang
said. Closely held Bigredwire.com does not disclose financial
information. It hopes to go public next year.
</P>
<P>
   One cheap way a for tiny unknown to stand out in a space
occupied by giants such as AT&AMP;T is to stir up ``controversy for
controversy's sake,'' said former Adweek editor Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telecommunications is very competitive,'' she said. ``An
upstart needs to make noise. Otherwise, it's dot-com who?''
</P>
<P>
   Combining celebrity with an ``in-your-face message'' is a
surefire way to get attention, said Stephen A. Greyser, a professor
of consumer marketing at Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   And Bigredwire.com is probably delighted when reporters call.
</P>
<P>
   Said Greyser, ``From the company's perspective, media coverage
is free public relations.''

DAY-AFTER SYNDROME HAUNTS WINNERS IN GERMANY'S MOBILE PHONE LICENSE
AUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Hours after they clinked Champagne glasses
on Thursday evening, winners in Germany's $46 billion auction for
wireless licenses began feeling the hangover on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the most vivid case of winner's remorse, Hutchison Whampoa of
Hong Kong immediately announced that it was pulling out of one of
the six groups that won a license because the prices were simply
too high. Hutchison, which is loaded with cash as a result of
selling its stake in the British mobile phone company Orange PLC,
had been partners with the Dutch telephone company KPN and NTT
DoCoMo of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison was supposed to contribute 22.5 percent of the group's
license fee, and that money will probably be made up by KPN and
BellSouth Corp., which owns 50 percent of KPN's mobile telephone
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's, meanwhile, confirmed that it would reduce the
credit ratings for most of the big telephone companies involved in
the bidding: Deutsche Telekom of Germany; France Telecom, which is
investing through the German company Mobilcom AG; British
Telecommunications PLC, which is investing through Viag Interkom;
and KPN.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also continued to sell stocks in the winning
companies. Mobilcom's stock plunged 7 percent Friday in Frankfurt,
from 117 to 110 euros. Telefonica SA of Spain and Sonera Oy of
Finland, which lead a group called Group 3G, saw their shares
decline by similar amounts on their exchanges. Shares of Deutsche
Telekom, the German telephone giant that is determined to build a
pan-European network, had already lost half their value since the
company paid $6 billion for a similar wireless license in Britain
in April; on Friday, Telekom nudged down another 3.89 percent
Friday after pledging to pay $7.6 billion for its German license.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the frenzied bidding, analysts and company
executives generally agreed that the auction's outcome was about
the worst one possible. Beyond the dizzying level of the prices
offered, the real surprise was that the auction produced six rivals
rather than five. Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone Airtouch PLC, the
two biggest wireless players in Europe, had been determined to
outbid seemingly weaker bidders like Group 3G and acquire enough
licenses to reduce the field.
</P>
<P>
   But even though only seven groups joined the bidding originally,
one of which dropped out last Friday, neither Telekom nor Vodafone
was able to force out any of the other six. What they did manage to
do was push up the total price of licenses by nearly $15 billion
between Monday morning and Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Sommer, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, complained on
Thursday night that the auction had been distorted because some of
the rival telephone companies came from countries that awarded
licenses to them for little or no money. Telekom officials were
particularly incensed by Telefonica of Spain, part of the
victorious Group 3G, because the Spanish government had awarded it
a Spanish wireless license at very low cost while rejecting
Telekom's application.
</P>
<P>
   The deeper question is when _ or even whether _ the huge bets on
third-generation wireless licenses will pay off. Using a
technological standard called United Mobile Telecommunications
Service, or UMTS, the telephone companies hope to offer high-speed
data transmission that will give people wireless access to the
Internet and a host of new mobile commercial and information
services.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies must first build the new networks and then
market an entire generation of new services, most of which are
still unknown to consumers. Industry executives say the networks
will not be ready until at least 2002 or 2003, though all operators
will be under heavy pressure to have their networks running as soon
as possible. Gerhard Schmid, the chief executive of Mobilcom,
predicted that his company could break even on its investment by
2005. Most other companies have been reluctant to divulge their
time-frames for turning a profit.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Although he calls himself a religious man, there
is something mildly unholy about the way Pablo Salazar delights in
the prospect of killing the Institutional Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   As he campaigns to be governor of Chiapas, the 45-year-old
senator and father of three projects himself as a kind of political
dragon-slayer, struggling against a government that has wreaked
havoc on the lives of poor and defenseless Mexicans for more than
seven decades. The long-governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party, known to all as the PRI but which he calls a fire-breather,
was severely wounded on July 2, when it lost the presidency for the
first time since 1929. But, Salazar warns, the party still gasps
with life.
</P>
<P>
   So with the help of his supporters at the polls, the candidate
promises to deliver the coup de grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI has entered intensive care,'' he called out to some
400 supporters in a rally outside the city of San Cristobal de las
Casas. ``It is gasping for breath. And on August 20, we are going
to disconnect its oxygen tank and give a Christian burial to a
party that no longer has a place in Chiapas.''
</P>
<P>
   In the dawning months of what may be a new era of democracy in
Mexico, the people of Chiapas will be the first to test the depths
of this country's political reforms when they go to the polls on
Sunday to elect a new governor.
</P>
<P>
   The election _ in a state racked by generations of poverty,
layers of social divisions and sporadic violence between the
government and the Zapatista rebels _ will be the first major state
contest since the fall of the PRI on July 2. It offers a look at
how local politics have begun to evolve in Mexico. And for the PRI,
this election is widely seen as a test of the party's ability to
survive among the scrappy forces of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar, a former member of the PRI who served as a mediator
between the government and the Zapatistas, says a fair, transparent
election will mean the difference between war and peace.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, he says, he would urge the president to drastically
reduce the military presence in Chiapas, estimated at up to 50,000
troops. And he says he would create political openings that would
allow leaders of the rebel Zapatista army to stop their fight and
join the government in resolving the social crises in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   He offers his campaign as a testament to his ability to forge
agreements. Eight opposition parties with otherwise divergent
agendas _ including the conservative National Action Party of the
president-elect and the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party _
have united behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past governors have been obsessed with defeating the
Zapatistas,'' Salazar said in an interview. ``That is not in my
agenda. I am not a Zapatista, but I have learned to understand
them, and I believe that we must try to get them involved in
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the PRI carried about 45 percent of the vote in Chiapas
during last month's presidential elections, opinion polls and most
political analysts predict that Salazar will win by a comfortable
margin.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, Sami David, 50, the PRI's candidate, has found
more than the polls to be ominous. At the start of a campaign visit
to his opponent's hometown, Soyalo, David was greeted by a
belligerent mob that pelted his entourage with rocks and sticks,
and he was forced to scramble for safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that I have not come at the best time to the
party,'' said an exasperated David, referring to his run for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, among people in a village called Corazon de Maria,
the people seem likely to cast their votes more as an act of
protest against the PRI than as a show of support for the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Radishes in this village grow as big as apples, while the people
languish from illiteracy and poverty. Although the village sits in
the shadow of a brand new airport and less than 10 miles from one
of Chiapas' largest cities, the people of Corazon de Maria still do
not have paved roads and clean drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   On good days, farmers said, they sell their radishes at a local
market for about $5 per crate. But most days are bad, and the
farmers are stuck giving away their produce for pennies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decided that we will not vote for the PRI,'' said
Javier Gomez Diaz, 19, taking a break from bundling his radishes
for market. ``Even if they come here and make promises, they will
not deceive us anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this discontent echoes across most of the state, some
communities continue to support the PRI. But that support hardly
sounds enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   In Amentenango del Valle, a community supported mostly by the
work of women artisans who mold clay pots, Petrona Gomez Hernandez,
34, described voting for the PRI more as a habit than an act of
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our custom to vote for the PRI,'' she said. ``We have
always given them our vote.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the PRI had improved the lives of people in her
community, she shook her head no. ``Our lives never change,'' she
said. ``We are poor and that is how we will continue; poor until we
die.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At a rally there, David presented his candidacy as a force for
reform across Chiapas and within his own party. He told voters he
would increase government spending on social programs; that he
would make the government more accessible to their pleas for
assistance in selling their clay pots across the country; that he
would work to build peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must work so that there are more doves of peace than there
are guns in Chiapas,'' he said, holding up the clay doves made by
the young girls in training to become pot makers. ``There must be
more doves of peace than expressions of impugnity; more doves of
peace than injustice and insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   Election monitors said that they have received hundreds of
reports about PRI campaign officials trying to coerce voters by
telling them that their social benefits would be cut if the
opposition wins. But recent incidents among Zapatista supporters
and right-wing paramilitary groups have raised concerns about the
possibility of violence on election day.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, 90 people accused of supporting the Zapatista
rebels were burned out of their homes by a masked group of men
carrying rifles and semiautomatic weapons. The group, which called
itself ``Peace and Justice,'' refused to let the rightful residents
return to their land for several days until they were chased away
by military troops.
</P>
<P>
   Such attacks, observers worry, might frighten voters from going
to the polls on Sunday. In last month's election, more than 50
percent of voters in Chiapas did not cast ballots, the highest
abstention rate in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   A high turnout is crucial to Pablo Salazar. But when he winds up
his speeches _ often full of plans to increase higher education,
reform the state justice system and improve health care _ he asks
more of his supporters than just their votes. He enlists them for
duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI is preparing more of the dirty election tricks that
have kept it in power for 71 years,'' he says. ``And the only way
to stop them is by doing whatever it takes to defend people's
votes.'' He asks them to stay at the polls all day to monitor the
voting, and then to form caravans of cars to escort the ballot
boxes to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Then with a sly smile spreading across his face, Salazar warns
there will be trouble for anyone who stands in their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think the PRI would try to steal the ballots if they
see a group as big as this one watching over the polls?'' he said
to a crowd that filled the plaza. ``And if they do, we will beat
them. If anyone dares, we will tie them up.''

NEW TECHNOLOGY EASES EFFECTS OF VERIZON STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mabel Graham learned last week that the repair of her
sister's telephone line had been delayed by a strike at Verizon
Communications, she loaned her sister and brother-in-law a cellular
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't affected by the strike, not at all,'' said the
71-year-old Boston woman. ``I let my sister and brother-in-law use
my cell phone so they could reach their children and their doctor.
Sometimes, it's better to have one of these cellular phones than
having a regular telephone in the house,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two weeks after 85,000 telephone workers walked off jobs
at Verizon Communications, the company created by the merger of
Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE, cellular telephones and a host of
other alternatives offering everything from directory assistance to
nationwide call completion have reduced one portion of the strike's
roar to a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the company's 25 million clients on the East Coast have
had Internet access and basic telephone service since telephone
operators, customer-service representatives, and technicians struck
shortly after 12 a.m. Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of choices available for some services that were
once the sole province of the phone company are staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS offers a nationwide directory, and it will connect
your call. Internet service providers such as 555.1212.com,
switchboard.com, and AT&AMP;T's online directory anywho.com are also
filling the directory-assistance void.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the strike has not impacted the company,
however. A backlog of repair orders increased this week to 100,000
from 80,000 last week. And, residential and business customers
seeking installation of new wireline data or telephone services are
being told that services will not resume until the strike is
settled. This may be particularly difficult for Verizon since the
summer is its busiest period for new residential and business
installations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unions know that the company cannot tolerate for very long
a large backup of installations and repairs,'' said Robert Ross, a
labor expert at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. ``One hundred
thousand backlogged repair orders is, when you look at it closely,
gigantic, especially if many of them are business orders. So the
real weapon, the incentive to bargain, is the impact a strike will
have on installations and repairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the tactic has worked. Days after union negotiators
for 72,000 members of the Communications Workers of America
demanded the right to use a card check neutrality agreement to
organize an estimated 32,500 Verizon Wireless employees, the
company agreed to a significant portion of the union's demands.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have resolved a dispute over the CWA's push for
access to work involving the installation of high-speed digital
subscriber lines _ jobs that are critical to the growth of the CWA
and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which
represents 13,000 striking telephone technicians.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the creation of so many alternatives to
directory assistance and customer service underscores the impact
automation and deregulation have had on the telecommunications
industry and, ultimately, on consumers.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of choices increase, from major suppliers such as
Verizon to new nimble start-ups, some analysts maintain that
consumers will be less tolerant of inconveniences and more likely
to switch to providers that can guarantee optimal service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are no longer a captive audience,'' noted Keffrey
Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in history, telephone customers are
starting to have choice,'' he added. ``In three or four years, they
will be much more comfortable with making a switch. Soon, they will
be looking for other avenues and they will switch quickly. Churn
will have a big impact on local phone service, especially when
unions roar. . . . Five years ago, there was no competition and no
place to go. Now, that's changing. People are not necessarily
stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago the loss of a telephone operator would have been
enough to shut the old Bell Telephone Co. down. ``Today, directory
assistance is more of a convenience and eventually it will probably
be consolidated,'' said David Mahan, executive vice president of
CTC Communications in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   He envisions a future dominated by broadband, high speed lines
that offer efficient and instantaneous connections 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``To install and deliver this system to customers will be less
labor-intensive, and consumers will be offered a market basket
approach to products,'' noted Mahan. ``These will be web-based
services. That is the infrastructure for the way people will
communicate in the next 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahon should know. His company, CTC, offers voice and data
services to 13,000 customers. CTC, which has deployed a Cisco
Systems-powered high-speed broadband network across more than 30
states, is also one of Verizon's largest wholesale customers.
</P>
<P>
   When new customers sign up with Verizon, CTC offers billing
audits, calling plans, and technology evaluations. The firm then
bids directly for Verizon customers, offering to move them from
Verizon's network to its own.
</P>
<P>
   Because CTC customers place their orders through computers, it
has not been hampered by the loss of directory assistance or other
customer services.
</P>
<P>
   However, company requests for new installations have backed up
because of the strike. The company has a backlog of about 50
orders; its customers are typically big businesses.

   BUSH (Undated) _ After four days of silence and a ceding of the
spotlight to the Democrats and Al Gore, George W. Bush finally
responds _ and on Al Gore's home turf, no less. The event was in
Memphis, Tenn. And the tit-for-tat of Gore's speech and Bush's
response will show how the battle lines are drawn right now,
heading into the fall. In his speech, Bush took pointed jabs at
Gore. He accused him of fomenting ``class warfare'' in aligning
himself with the people vs. the powerful. He ridiculed Gore's list
of promises as a list of all the things that he and Clinton never
got done. He said Gore was not a credible person on the issue of
campaign finance reform, and said that his first priority in office
would be education, not campaign finance. By Frank Bruni.

   GORE-ASSESS (Washington) _ When he accepted the Republican
presidential nomination in Philadelphia two weeks ago, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas skipped lightly over a few issues _ taxes, Social
Security, education, nuclear weapons _ and then got to his topic
sentence: ``We must usher in an era of responsibility.'' In Los
Angeles on Thursday night, Vice President Al Gore took the opposite
approach. Declaring that ``the presidency is more than a popularity
contest,'' he said, ``I am here to talk seriously about the
issues.'' And that he did, one issue after another, as if he were
delivering a State of the Union Message and not speaking to a
political convention, so that by the time he finished, there could
be no doubt where he stood on virtually every important matter
before the federal government. A news analysis by David E.

IN FLORIDA, DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION HAS IMPACT ON SOME, BUT NOT
OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ The speech, confident and powerful, rang
through the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles and, far
across the country in South Florida, made Darren Gentry reconsider
his vote for George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But it was President Clinton's address Monday night, three days
before Vice President Al Gore took the microphone, that swayed
Gentry, a registered independent and fitness manager from Coral
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   He was leaning toward Bush when Clinton took that podium. As
Clinton spoke of the prosperity the nation enjoyed during his
presidency, Gentry, watching on television, began to doubt the
wisdom of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it turned me around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gore's vote to lose, as he took his turn on stage
Thursday. He did not lose it. He did not win it, either. His speech
lacked real passion, Gentry said, repeating the criticism that has
long dogged Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of words,'' he said, as he watched. ``It doesn't seem
like he's conveying his emotions.'' And, he said, Gore had made
promises without saying how he would deliver, in a speech lacking
style and substance.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gentry, he is back where he started, in the middle. At
least for Gore's sake, he no longer is leaning the other way.
</P>
<P>
   In vote-rich Florida, which has elected Bush's brother, Jeb
Bush, as its governor, the vast majority of Republicans have
refused to even think about jumping across the party line and
joining Gore. This convention seemed his best opportunity to cement
his base with unexcited Democrats and, maybe, to sway independent
voters here.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry, 25, liked what he saw in Bush's campaign coming out of
the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what he's doing with Social Security,'' allowing people
to invest a percentage of it, Gentry said. ``I believe he's
building a strong nucleus of people who support him, people like
John McCain and Colin Powell.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, going into his own convention, just seemed bland, Gentry
said. But Gentry began to waver as he listened to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton made a great speech,'' he said. ``He nailed it. I
think it was the best speech of his entire presidency. Why change
things? When was the economy this good? And the Republican Party
keeps saying that we need this massive change? Obviously that's not
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Gentry said he would have listened to more campaigning
before he firmly made up his mind, Gore had a chance at the
convention to at least continue his advantage going into the
speech. But Gentry said he did not do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is saying, `I will, I will,' but he is not saying how,''
Gentry said of Gore's speech. ``I'd like him to tell me how he
plans to implement his ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   He did find some reasons for preferring the Democratic platform,
after watching both conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Several voters interviewed this week have said that the two
conventions seemed programmed, almost too smooth, but Gentry was
pricked by one thing about the Republican convention. The
Republicans spoke a lot about their diversity but did not back up
their claims with real proof, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Clinton kept saying about diversity is true,'' he said.
``Look at the people in his administration. That's diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's speech inspired traditional Democrats, Gore's
speech seemed to comfort them. Adele Yuckman, 82, of Key Biscayne,
missed Clinton's speech. ``I fell asleep,'' said Yuckman, a
lifelong Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   She watched Gore from bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course he's dull,'' she said, watching his speech, propped
up on pillows, a book close by. ``But he isn't as dull as he
usually is.''
</P>
<P>
   She will vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personality isn't everything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Torres, a psychologist in Miami, only listened to the
convention. He is blind.
</P>
<P>
   What he heard in Clinton's voice, early in the convention, was
the great orator, more style than substance. What he heard from
Gore, he said, was ``pragmatic, sincere, specific.''
</P>
<P>
   He also heard a candidate ever edging toward the political
center, toward survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they need to win,'' he said, adding that he had
heard the same thing in Bush's voice. He will listen harder, to
decide who gets his vote.
</P>
<P>
   Among Miami's Cuban-Americans, there seemed little Gore could
say to win over a voting bloc that lands solidly, election after
election, on the Republican side.
</P>
<P>
   The Elian Gonzalez case turned many here even more solidly
against the Clinton administration. Gore's split with his party _
he said that family court should decide the custody _ has been
dismissed by many voters here as a weak gesture, politically
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   But in the slivers of that community where people have voted
Democrat _ or at least considered it _ it was Clinton's speech,
again, that made voters consider Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Serrano, 58, a mortgage broker, watched the convention with
his brother, Ruben Serrano, 56. They are both registered
Republicans. ``The speech,'' Raul Serrano said of Clinton,
``reminded me of the good things the Democrats have done. I don't
think it will be that bad with Gore, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   His brother, a real estate agent, said he would have a hard time
voting for Gore, but was also undecided. ``These conventions are
just all-night parties that are not helping me at all,'' he
grumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech, to Ruben Serrano, was more of the same. ``A big
show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Raul Serrano warmed to Gore during his speech. ``I think the
guy needs to be given a chance,'' he said. ``I think he
strengthened his position.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``he seems to be loosening up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as his running
mate did not seem to resonate here with Gentry, who is Jewish, or
others. It was not a big issue, before or after Lieberman's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice presidents play a minor role for me,'' said Michael
Shapiro, a vice president for Smith Barney Investments in Boca
Raton, as he watched the convention earlier this week. ``I believe
Gore needed to do something to untarnish his party's image.
Lieberman was it.'' He, too, said he would make up his mind later,
after the presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   The convention was far from a fixation for many people here in
South Florida. But, because the Florida Marlins were off Thursday
night, the patrons at Nippers Bar in Boca Raton tuned a television
to Gore's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' said Geoff Klein, a
25-year-old stockbroker from Boca Raton who has made up his mind to
vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A few tables away, a group of men stared at another television
with excitement. They seemed impressed by what they saw.
</P>
<P>
   But they were watching wrestling.

U.S.-MADE GRAIN ALCOHOL IS FINDING IT'S WAY ILLEGALLY TO RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over the last two years, a federal investigation into
Russian and Italian organized crime in the ports of Newark and
Elizabeth, N.J., turned up the expected mix of mundane mob staples:
extortion, cigarette smuggling, money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   But federal agents said they also came across a bit of criminal
enterprise that for pure creative corruption struck them as
remarkable: a loose-knit web of companies was smuggling tens of
millions of gallons of American-made grain alcohol _ including some
from one of the country's oldest distilleries _ to Eastern Europe
to slake a seemingly boundless thirst for that most Russian of
spirits, vodka.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling genius, such as it was, lay in the fact that the
192-proof alcohol from America's heartland was disguised with dye
and shipped in giant containers marked as windshield-wiper fluid,
cologne, mouthwash and cleaning solvent.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Russia, the smugglers, using a chemical formula provided
in some cases by an American distiller, removed the coloring,
diluted the grain alcohol with water, and sometimes added what the
federal authorities said was vodka flavoring. The product, which
was then distributed by groups controlled by the Russian mob, thus
evaded millions of dollars in import taxes and tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstituted mouthwash and cleaning solvents _
investigators said that when the dye was effectively removed, it
was, all things Russian considered, not half bad _ found a welcome
and lucrative place in the black market.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the case, agents from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are
investigating as many as six distillers around the United States,
and nearly a dozen brokers and freight forwarders, several law
enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators suspect that the shippers have ties to some of the
most powerful mob clans in Russia, and that the organizations,
including the Solintsevskaya and Ismailovskaya groups, control the
distribution of the alcohol in Russia and in some countries in
Eastern Europe, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of organization to get millions of gallons from
the distilleries in the U.S. to the streets of Moscow,'' said Edgar
Domenech, the special agent in charge of the ATF's New York office.
The agency, which in addition to investigating firearms and
explosives trafficking, regulates the alcohol industry and is
supervising that part of the joint investigation, while the FBI is
overseeing other aspects of the case, including those involving
Russian organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Since the days of the czars, when half of Russia's state
revenues came from government-controlled vodka sales, the drink has
played an significant role in the nation's life and politics.
</P>
<P>
   It accounted for 35 percent of the Soviet Union's income until
oil and gas became big money makers in the 1980s. But that number
plunged to roughly 4 percent in Russia after President Boris
Yeltsin liquidated the state monopoly in 1992. And with the
collapse of the economy, many local producers failed and foreign
distillers began to export quantities of grain alcohol to Russia
and neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Russian government slapped heavier tariffs on
imported alcohol in the mid-1990s, the black market exploded,
opening up more opportunities in the trade for the ubiquitous
Russian mob. Now, untaxed, smuggled and home-brewed vodkas _ known
as samogon _ are believed to account for more than half of the
estimated 568 million gallons consumed in Russia annually.
</P>
<P>
   The economics of the smuggling scheme are straightforward: The
alcohol can be bought in the United States and shipped to Russia
and neighboring countries for far less than it would cost to
produce it legally or illegally in Russia, law enforcement
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Organized crime realized you can buy grain alcohol for dirt
cheap in the United States and export it for free,'' said Bruce
Gourlie, an FBI special agent in Newark who has traveled to Eastern
Europe to work the case. ``By smuggling, you can make a tremendous
amount of money, because the tariffs are so high because they're
trying to protect the domestic alcohol industry.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, in the last few years a new class of bootleggers
has developed, riding shotgun on convoys of huge tanker trucks
hauling illegal alcohol across the borders of Georgia and other
countries into Russia. Enormous seizures became commonplace, and in
at least one case, according to government news agency reports,
smugglers with guided antitank missiles clashed with the border
police, who halted their convoy of 550 tanker trucks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, another class of lower-level bootlegger was
shipping grain alcohol to Russia and Ukraine by sea, disguising it
as cleaning products. Now, a federal grand jury in Newark is
hearing evidence in the case, several officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents show that one Russian immigrant involved in the
scheme pleaded guilty in April to a single count of conspiracy and
is cooperating with federal prosecutors in Newark. Also cooperating
in the case, according to the court papers, is a Missouri
distillery founded in 1856 that made its name selling rye whiskey
in America's frontier saloons, and which was caught recently
disguising its grain alcohol for shipment to the East.
</P>
<P>
   The company, McCormick Distilling of Weston, Mo., north of
Kansas City, provided nearly 5 million gallons of disguised grain
alcohol to a freight forwarder operated by the Russian immigrant,
the papers said. The freight forwarder shipped the alcohol to
Russia and Ukraine from 1996 to 1999, according to the papers,
filed in U.S. District Court in Newark by Mark Rufolo, the
assistant U.S. attorney who is overseeing the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick, which boasts on its Web site that it is listed on the
National Register of Historic Sites because it is the oldest
distillery in the United States operating at its original site,
dyed the alcohol and provided the shipper with a chemical formula
to later remove the coloring, other court papers said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, McCormick pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor
count of making a false entry in regulatory documents, in which it
identified the alcohol as nonpotable products including Rainbow
Cleaning Solution and Cleansol. The company agreed in June to pay
$2 million in penalties, with $1 million in reparations going to
the government of Ukraine, and accepted a one-week suspension of
its license, documents show. It was one of the largest such
settlements in the history of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement released by McCormick's lawyer,
Christopher Lee Milner, McCormick said that no one at the company
``knowingly conspired with organized crime elements to smuggle
alcohol into Eastern Europe.'' The statement also said that no one
at McCormick profited individually from the alcohol deals, that the
company was never fully paid for the alcohol and that it was
continuing to cooperate with federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian immigrant who is cooperating with prosecutors _
officials asked that his name not be used because they feared his
life was in danger _ admitted that his company shipped the alcohol
in seagoing containers that each held 148 55-gallon drums,
according to the court papers.
</P>
<P>
   He said his company shipped 600 such containers _ about 4.9
million gallons _ from May 1996 to January 1999, generating $40
million, according to a document detailing the charges to which he
pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The millions of gallons shipped is not a huge amount in the
domestic distillery business. In 1996 alone, companies in the
United States legitimately exported more than 100 million gallons
of distilled spirits, much of it in the form of pure grain alcohol.
And Americans consume about 350 million gallons of distilled
spirits a year, according to industry estimates. In 1999, about 700
million gallons of grain alcohol was produced in the United States
and reported to the ATF, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they believe that the illegal shipments were
just part of a broader pattern of smuggling and other crimes by
Russian mob groups.
</P>
<P>
   And while federal authorities here pursue their investigation,
the government in Russia has begun an effort to stanch the
hemorrhage in tax income there caused by vodka smuggling, which
some estimates put at more than $400 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   To consolidate state control over the industry, Russia's
president, Vladimir Putin, has created a state-owned conglomerate
to act as a holding company for the distilleries in which the
Russian government has a stake.

RIP FOR CONCORDE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Britain's decision on Tuesday to ground the Concorde following
the first fatal crash of the supersonic transport plane probably
marks the end of the line for what was almost certainly the
loftiest niche in commercial aviation history. If so, it will be a
long time before elite travelers will again be able to hop across
the Atlantic in a mere three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Concorde was never a significant factor in aviation except for
those willing to pay up to $11,000 for a round-trip ticket between
New York and London or Paris. Only 20 of the planes were ever
built, and just 13 of those were still in service, seven with
British Air and six with Air France, which grounded its planes
immediately after the accident. Each Concorde has 100 seats,
compared with more than 400 on the largest conventional jetliners,
and the planes averaged only 800 revenue hours in the air a year,
about a third of a conventional plane's time at work.
</P>
<P>
   Concorde's conversion to museum status will be as much a matter
of economics as safety. Preliminary investigation of the crash,
which cost 113 lives, indicates that a tire was punctured by a
piece of scrap metal on the Charles de Gaulle Airport runway.
Chunks of the tire ruptured a fuel tank next to two engines, which
ignited escaping fuel. Reconfiguring the plane to prevent such
ruptures, by thickening the outer skin, would probably be more
expensive than even such enormous fares could justify.
</P>
<P>
   Flying at more than 1,300 miles an hour, Concorde was largely
restricted to over-the-ocean routes to avoid inflicting its sonic
boom on earthlings. But at subsonic speeds, especially during
takeoffs, the roar of its jet engines and after-burners made
conventional jets sound like purrs. Noise-sensitive airports like
Logan banned the craft except for occasional emergency visits.
</P>
<P>
   Speed has always been the driving force in commercial travel.
Concorde's retirement may be unique in transportation annals for
lowering maximum speeds. Supersonic speed has remained a formidable
barrier for most airlines, and no successor to Concorde is within
sight. So millions of air travelers will have to be content with
moving around the world at a pokey 600 miles an hour. Poor turtles.

UNHEALTHY ATTITUDES FOR MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Men's Health magazine is doing its readers no favor with its
survey listing the nation's most ``anti-male'' college campuses.
Listen up, freshmen: If you buy half the chauvinistic claptrap in
this magazine, you'll never get a date.
</P>
<P>
   The September issue of Men's Health (``Sex Olympics!'' ``Fat to
Flat!'') features a report on the best and worst colleges for men,
based on a series of criteria including how many fraternities are
on campus (more is better), the quality of the athletic facilities,
and _ the real determinant _ whether men feel ``welcome.'' A school
betraying an interest in women being protected from rape gets a bad
mark. Ditto a school with an abundance of women's studies programs.
And check out how well the college complies with Title IX, the
federal law requiring equal access to school sports. More for gals
can mean less for guys.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, four of the 10 worst colleges in this backlash
bonanza are in New England: Brown, Dartmouth, UMass at Amherst, and
Bates College in Maine. All are tarred with having ``frigid sex
policies'' or promoting the attitude that ``Every guy's a rapist
here'' because women are told they have a right to refuse sex, even
from a BMOC.
</P>
<P>
   Oberlin College in Ohio is listed in the top 10 worst schools
for men because the students ``protest everything from human rights
violations in Latin America to the use of rats in the neuroscience
lab.'' Human rights: how very antimale!
</P>
<P>
   One matter of higher math seems to confuse the men, however. The
influx of women into college over the last decade, especially in
the Ivy League, has tipped the balance against men's dominance on
campus, a bad thing. But a ratio of two babes for every guy, hey,
that's a good thing, isn't it? Back to the calculator.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another math lesson for the folks at Men's Health: Gender
equity is not a zero-sum game. Giving women _ or blacks or gays or
the disabled _ more rights doesn't take anything away from the
straight, white, privileged, or pumped-up men cruising America's
campuses. Assuming otherwise is a definite turn-off.

GORE THE POPULIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 20, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore told the nation on Thursday, ``I want you
to know me for who I truly am.'' He then described a populist
leader in a self-portrait that was not only rhetorical but
substantive, inviting debate on specific proposals.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Gore accomplished without question: America, we have
separation. After years in which Republicans complained that
President Clinton was co-opting their positions, and after a GOP
Philadelphia convention in which Democrats said the Republicans
were moving their way, Gore staked out an agenda that will assure a
healthy campaign debate.
</P>
<P>
   It has been many years since a major-party presidential nominee
has made bashing the special interests his central campaign theme.
But Gore identified problems that need to be addressed, and he put
forward sound proposals that are ambitious without being
unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Gore had given a basketful of goodies to
Democratic constituencies _ his own special-interest groups _ and
in some cases there is evidence to support that charge. His vow
that free trade ``must be fair trade'' was a nod to big labor; his
embrace of affirmative action was a signal to minorities; and his
opposition to school vouchers aligned him with public school
administrators and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But each of these positions also is beneficial to society as a
whole. And what is the special interest served by better early
childhood education, by increased medical research, by widened
health care coverage, by restrictions on tobacco marketing, by
campaign finance reform, and by tax cuts that primarily help
middle-class families rather than the rich? Only one interest is
served by all these _ the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   If the message was in many respects sound and even welcome, a
question can be raised as to the messenger. How do we know the
populist speaking Thursday _ to the big donors in the Staples
Center luxury boxes as well as to the delegates on the floor _ is
the true Gore?
</P>
<P>
   The stories he told of his teacher father and his waitress
mother dependent on 25-cent tips were genuinely affecting, but for
Gore personally they can be little more than snapshots from the
family scrapbook. Albert Gore Sr. was already a Washington fixture,
having served in Congress for nearly a decade, when his son was
born, and he moved to the Senate when Albert Jr. was 4.
</P>
<P>
   Still, populism is the path Gore has chosen. ``They're for the
powerful, and we're for the people,'' he said succinctly. And he
clearly means to travel that path on his own. Prior to his speech,
many had questioned how he would distance himself from President
Clinton's moral lapses while continuing to ride the
administration's policy successes, especially on the economy. Gore
responded boldly, saying he expected no ``award for past
performance,'' but a judgment in November based on the candidates'
visions of the future.
</P>
<P>
   If he sidetracked Clinton politely but quickly, Gore also gave a
surprisingly small role to Bush. Apart from a couple of one-liners,
Gore let his issue agenda speak to his opponent. Indeed, there was
a concerted effort to make the convention focus on Gore rather than
Bush. Jesse Jackson, responding to Bush's challenge, ``don't mess
with Texas,'' replied that Bush shouldn't mess with America. But
others were cautioned to lay off. US Representative Martin Meehan
blasted Congress for letting special interest money stop good
bills, but at the Gore campaign's request deleted a line pointing
out that Bush would veto the McCain-Feingold campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Jackson, the last national candidate to run as an
unabashed populist was Democratic Senator Fred Harris of Oklahoma,
whose crusade proclaiming ``the issue is privilege'' lost to Jimmy
Carter in 1976. Harris was in Los Angeles last week, but at the
Shadow Convention, where he quoted Senator Russell Long as telling
a contributor: ``For $2,500 you can have good government; for
$5,000 you can have any kind of government you want.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the greatest weakness in the Gore approach. He has
nearly a lifelong experience dealing with special interests and has
not only lived with but exploited aggressively the campaign finance
system he acknowledges is so corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the primary goals of the next administration must include
not only keeping the economy healthy, but spreading its benefits
much more equitably _ the essence of populism. Gore has credentials
in this regard, and now he has a message.

SOCIAL SECURITY'S DURABILITY

<P>
   Senator Joseph Lieberman changed his mind about privatizating
Social Security, and Governor George W. Bush should do the same. As
the governor acknowledged in a campaign position paper, ``Social
Security is a defining American promise that must be kept.'' With
modest changes, the program can be made fiscally sound for the
retirement of the baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . Privatization would likely make our most important
social safety net less safe, while doing little if anything to
actually benefit beneficiaries,'' Lieberman wrote in an unpublished
article. Lieberman prepared the article in June when he knew he was
under consideration to be Al Gore's running mate, but there is no
reason to doubt his sincerity. He flirted with the notion of
privatization a few years ago, but as he looked closer at the
proposal he saw, correctly, that it comes with hidden costs.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest is the amount of money required to pay for a
transition from the present system. Social Security is a
pay-as-you-go program, with current tax revenues paying the
pensions of current retirees. If some of its revenue is diverted to
private investment accounts, the government must eventually either
cut benefits or find the money elsewhere. Bush has promised not to
lower benefits for current recipients and those near retirement. He
would have to dip into general revenues to keep his word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personal accounts will allow everyone to build assets and
independence,'' Bush says. His statement assumes a stock market in
which there are no losers. He pledges that there will be safeguards
on investments, but the only iron-clad investments are government
bonds, and Social Security already invests in these. Bush is
disingenuous if he does not acknowledge the possibility that some
people will invest unwisely. Either he insures the investment,
which encourages investors to speculate, or he is willing to allow
people to accept losses in what ought to be their bedrock
retirement account.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security trustees are bound by law to keep the program
solvent, and they have made projections 75 years into the future.
According to the middle of three scenarios, the system will begin
to run a deficit in 2015 and run out of money by 2037.
</P>
<P>
   But the strong economy has pushed the insolvency back from 2030
in the 1995 projection. And the most optimistic scenario, which
assumes a very strong economy, would have the system survive the
onslaught of the baby boomers with little difficulty. The most
pessimistic projection has the system going bankrupt by 2026, but
based on recent economic performance, this is extremely unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Bush employs the middle-range projection as if it were pure
fact. However, when it comes to his own plan, he avoids the
specificity of the Social Security scenarios. He does not reveal
estimates of future stock market growth, the range of investments
he contemplates for the private accounts, or the fees that
investment managers would charge for administering them. His is a
showy program tailored for campaign consumption, not a fully
realized plan.
</P>
<P>
   Using the middle-range projection, it is possible to keep the
system solvent by several limited changes, including moving
government workers into the system and raising the cap on the
amount of salary subject to the Social Security tax. The government
could also invest some portion of the tax revenue in the stock
market, where, as Bush says, the rate of return historically is
better than that of government bonds. However, the government would
still be responsible for paying benefits if the market had a bad
stretch sometime over the next 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, it would have been impossible to predict the advent of
antibiotics, let alone the treatments for heart disease and other
ailments that have lengthened life so considerably. And few could
have been so prescient as to foresee the great boom of the 1950s
and 1960s, then the slough of the 1970s and early '80s. Most people
could not even look four years ahead to the onset of the Great
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   That economic catastrophe reminded Americans in the 1930s of the
need to buffer old age against the vicissitudes of life. Back then,
Americans lived to an average age of 61; now their average lifespan
exceeds 76 years. They still need a guaranteed pension for their
final years. It would be unfair to future retirees to tamper with
what Lieberman rightly describes as ``the greatest social insurance
program ever created.''

LABELING ENGINEERED FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, August 21, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So far, genetic engineering of crops has been used mostly to
produce corn with a built-in pesticide and soybeans that are
resistant to an herbicide, letting farmers kill weeds without
harming the soybeans. About a third of US corn is grown this way
and more than half of all soybeans, with no apparent ill effects.
Now, with plans in the offing to produce genetically engineered
wheat, it is time for Washington and the genetics industry to stop
treating consumers like children and agree to mandatory labeling of
gene-altered foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration took a step closer to this in
the spring when it unveiled a plan to set voluntary labeling
standards for producers who want to tout the fact that their goods
have no genetically modified ingredients. But it is more logical to
require companies to explain what is in their products. In poll
after poll, 70 to 90 percent of Americans say they want this
information.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has balked at this because it fears any label will
become a skull and crossbones and scare consumers off. This is
extremely unlikely, since by some estimates more than half of all
grocery items would carry the label. Also, food regulation has a
better reputation in this country than in others, where there has
been hysteria about ``Frankenfoods,'' as the British press likes to
say.
</P>
<P>
   That reputation will hold up better over time if the FDA
distances itself from industry and simply states that consumers
have a right to know what's in their corn flakes. A mandatory
labeling bill introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer of California
would also allot $5 million for studies by the secretary of Health
and Human Services on the health and environmental questions raised
by genetically modified crops.
</P>
<P>
   Such questions exist, as a panel of the National Academy of
Sciences noted this spring. At the same time, the panel said that
at least the crops it looked at appear to be safe. Genetically
altered foods have great potential to help mankind, but they are
more likely to be supported if consumers know two things: what's in
their food and what Washington is doing to study the long-term
effects of these new organisms in the human body and the
environment.

SUFFRAGE FOR SUMMER FOLK? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 20, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A tax revolt of second-home owners is bubbling up in vacation
resorts from the Hamptons to Cape Cod. ``Taxation without
representation!'' the summer residents cry, as their property taxes
rise to fund the schools or land banks or other issues where they
have no vote. Although it may seem logical at first to give a
franchise to people paying large property tax bills, offering
voting rights to summer residents who want to be able to vote in
their year-round communities too is not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Voting rights should not accrue to anyone based on the number of
pickets in their fences. The 24th Amendment to the Constitution,
which permanently banned poll taxes in 1964, crystalized the
country's evolving policy on suffrage. Beginning at the state level
and eventually at the US Supreme Court (in Harper v. the Virginia
Board of Elections) America has been steadily separating property
ownership from voting rights. In the Harper decision, the court
established that ``voter qualifications have no relation to
wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, thanks to the large number of transient
students, establishing residence for the purpose of voting is a
simple matter. A court case in 1972 brought by three Clark
University students resulted in the state dropping a six-month
residency requirement and opened voter registration to anyone who
establishes ``actual domicile and intention'' to stay, but not for
any fixed period. Summer residents who want to register and vote on
a proposed tax assessment in Truro can do so, but they can't also
vote for mayor or Congress back home.
</P>
<P>
   Summer folk obviously contribute to the economies of resort
communities, ideally in a rough balance with the costs they exact
on land, water, and other resources. But people who rent also
contribute through meals and sales taxes, and no one is claiming
they should be able to cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is not the only arrow in democracy's quiver. Summer
residents still have ample means to participate in local affairs:
attending town meetings, writing letters to the editor,
volunteering, forming residents' associations. Direct community
involvement is still the best way to increase their stake.

 McCAIN TO UNDERGO SURGERY SATURDAY TO REMOVE MALIGNANT MELANOMAS  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Sen. John McCain of Arizona said Friday he would have
surgery on Saturday morning to remove two malignant melanomas that
were discovered after a routine skin examination earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The operations will require him to receive general anesthesia
and stay overnight at the Mayo Clinic Hospital in north Phoenix
where doctors Friday told McCain that treating the melanoma at his
left temple will also require a biopsy of his lymph nodes to
determine whether the cancer has spread to any internal organs. If
that becomes the case, McCain's condition would be regarded as far
more serious.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors said the other melanoma, on his left arm, had been
detected early enough to remove it easily with no anticipated
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But in both cases, doctors told him, the malignant spots were
unrelated and separate from any he had treated in the past _ which
medical experts consider a positive sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very confident; the doctors are very confident that we
will have this thing done very quickly,'' McCain said, smiling and
sounding upbeat as he and his wife, Cindy, met with reporters
outside the couple's adobe-style house in the north-central section
of Phoenix, a short distance from the hospital. ``I've been in a
number of fights in my life. This is just another one. I'm sure we
will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McCain, 63, who abandoned his recent run for president in March,
conceded that there was a chance doctors might find something more
serious to treat after tests were conducted on the biopsy. But he
played down any concerns, joking with reporters and predicting that
he would return to the campaign trail on behalf of his party's
presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and other
Republican candidates by Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a short time, I'll be back on the Straight Talk Express,''
he said, referring to the bus rides he commandeered during his
campaigning for president, and after he withdrew, for other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, he cautioned, ``The doctors are confident, but you never
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Melanomas, can be the deadliest and most aggressive forms of
skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts say people with light skin are much more
susceptible to skin cancer than others, and McCain has been dealing
with the condition for years. In 1993, he had a malignant melanoma
removed from his shoulder, and ever since he has undergone periodic
medical examinations to monitor any additional or recurring
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks the curse of the Irish is alcohol,'' McCain
said. ``It's their fair-skin.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during a routine examination on Aug. 3 that doctors at
the Bethesda Naval Medical Center just outside Washington found the
two melanomas. They recommended further testing, and on Thursday at
the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, a suburb of Phoenix, McCain was
administered a battery of tests, including blood work, chest X-rays
and an electrocardiogram.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, McCain and his wife returned to the clinic to meet
with doctors, who discussed the results of his tests and their
recommended course of action. McCain said his doctors would meet
with reporters on Saturday after the operation to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking to reporters Friday, McCain apologized for news
leaks on Wednesday of his latest round of tests. He said he had not
intended to say anything until the tests were complete and that he
did not know who was responsible for the leaks. He said he was
especially sorry for the timing because the leaks came on the same
day Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut was accepting the
nomination to be the Democratic choice for vice president, making
him the first Jewish candidate for so high an office.
</P>
<P>
   Describing Lieberman as ``a dear friend,'' McCain said, ``I
don't think anything should have detracted from his moment.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also dispelled one erroneous theory, that his disposition
to skin cancer might have been caused by the five years he spent in
a Vietnamese prison camp. He said he was mostly indoors at the
time, adding, ``The one thing I wanted to do as a prisoner of war
was to see the sun. I went years without seeing the sun.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite potential problems that further medical tests might
suggest, both McCains tried to keep the situation light. As they
approached reporters who had been waiting more than an hour in a
broiling midday sun, McCain carried a basket of sunscreen bottles,
and an aide pushed along a wheelbarrow filled with ice and bottles
of water.
</P>
<P>
   McCain used the basket to make a case for constant use of sun
screen and that early detection of skin problems alleviates many
more serious problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before he and his wife returned to the house, a reporter asked
him to clarify a report that the couple had gone to the movies this
week. Yes, he said, they saw ``What Lies Beneath.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly realizing the allusion to his medical condition, he
laughed and said, ``I should have gone to see `The Gladiator.'''

A `SPOILED BRAT' TRANSFORMED INTO HER FATHER'S DEFENDER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ By her own admission, Alberta Lee was a
contentious handful as a teen-ager and a willful, self-absorbed
young woman whose lack of direction concerned her conservative
immigrant parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the spoiled brat of the family,'' Lee, 26, stated
bluntly. ``I had a hard time getting on my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   She finds it easy sharing such reflections because in the past
18 months she has left that needy girl light-years behind. She
speaks proudly of the sense of purpose that has transformed her
into a confident woman, then notes bitterly that the man whose own
life-changing experiences forced her to grow has not been able to
share the experience. That is because the man, her father, is being
held in a federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is the daughter of Wen Ho Lee, the scientist formerly with
Los Alamos National Laboratory who is charged with mishandling some
of the country's most sensitive nuclear weapons secrets. A small,
reed-thin man tucked into a plain gray suit, Dr. Lee has sat in a
federal courtroom here much of this past week seeking, for the
third time since his arrest in December, to be released on bail. He
is represented by a team of lawyers and one lioness who now gives
speeches, raises funds for her father's defense, exhorts his
lawyers, meets with civil rights groups and cajoles or browbeats
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Alberta Lee, who says she still cannot hold back the tears when
she visits her father, says she is determined to do more than just
see him exonerated. Because she and his supporters believe he has
been singled out by the government because he is Chinese-American,
she wants to use his case to fight against discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Her determination has astounded those who know her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a positive side to all this, how my sister sort of
matured,'' said her brother, Chung Lee, 27, a soft-spoken medical
student. ``I never would have imagined she could have done this.
It's amazing really.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Hwang, the managing attorney of the Asian Law Caucus in
San Francisco, a civil rights group that filed a brief supporting
Dr. Lee's assertion that he is a victim of racial discrimination,
said Alberta Lee has ``been one of the most interesting people to
work with. She's the first person I've seen who has had this kind
of growth. She's still in shock and denial, like, `How can this
happen?' But then she goes back and works very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee described herself as a somewhat rebellious, emotional young
woman while growing up in Los Alamos, sometimes more than her
conservative father could handle. She recalled how once, when a
friend showed up with torn jeans, her father was aghast and offered
to patch them up right then and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how conservative he is,'' Lee said. ``It also shows
how, you know, clueless he is.''
</P>
<P>
   But while her father was in many ways a man of tradition, who
spoke Mandarin at home, Alberta Lee never had strong feelings about
her Chinese heritage. She attended the University of California at
Los Angeles, where she took a few courses on Asian-American
history, but said they made little impression. ``I just felt that
the problems with discrimination didn't apply to me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when her father became entangled in the criminal
investigation that she began to see her ethnicity in a different
way.
</P>
<P>
   She was working as a technical writer with a computer company in
North Carolina, in late 1998, living with her boyfriend, now her
fiance, when she started getting worried phone calls from her
father and brother. Her father was being investigated, she was
told. Suddenly she felt herself once again in the uncomfortably
familiar role of family drama queen. She urged her father to get a
lawyer, but was ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad and I told her, `Just chill out,''' said her brother,
Chung. ``I'd just be telling her she was overreacting.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee found the experience doubly painful. ``Maybe that's the
theme of this whole story, that I had to fight my whole life for
someone to listen to me in my family, even on this,'' she said. ``I
don't mean to sound super bitter, but I feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Once her father's name surfaced, after officials said they
suspected that he had given nuclear secrets to China, she found
that not only were people listening, but that they eagerly sought
her out. She gave her first speech on her father's birthday, last
December, just a few weeks after he was arrested. Her real coming
of age, she said, dates from a few months later, when she was asked
to address a group of Asian-Americans at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really when I realized you could make an impression
on a crowd,'' she recalled. ``I really felt like, `Now, I have a
voice, I have a purpose.' I realized I wasn't just speaking for my
father. I was speaking for Asian-Americans, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So now she is booked for speaking engagements through October,
while still holding a job as a technical writer in San Francisco,
and helping support some family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't think she was viewed within the family as
someone they would really listen to before this,'' said Brian Sun,
the family's lawyer. ``But Wen Ho tells me now how proud he is. He
just asks me to make sure she doesn't overdo her involvement. He
wants her to have her own life.''
</P>
<P>
   As ever, Alberta Lee has her own ideas and is talking about
becoming a civil rights lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really believes her father's fate rests with her,'' Hwang
said. ``She feels tremendous pressure. The main flaw I find in her
is she hasn't developed much selectivity in who she will deal with.
She won't let any opportunity go by without making the effort. I'm
afraid she's going to burn herself out.''

ONLINE CONVENTIONS DON'T LIVE UP TO THE HYPE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   If any group was hoping for a ``bounce'' from the Democratic and
Republican national conventions, it was the scores of political Web
sites that made their online debuts in Los Angeles and Philadelphia
with lots of gizmos and hype.
</P>
<P>
   But while some said the coming of the Internet to the
conventions would be as momentous as the advent of television 52
years ago, the reality has been somewhat less impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Technological problems have plagued many Web sites, causing them
to crash or to abandon many promised features. Some Internet sites
found expenses so high and visitors so low during the Republican
convention two weeks ago in Philadelphia that they drastically
scaled back operations during the Democratic convention in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Even traffic to political Web sites with brand names and long
track records was disappointingly low for the Republicans'
gathering, and some critics complained that the level of political
discourse in online chat rooms was lower than expected, too.
Detailed data on Web sites during the Democratic convention will
not be available until next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bridge hasn't yet been made between politics and the
Internet,'' said James Carey, a spokesman for PC Data OnLine, which
tracks Web use. ``There's not a lot of traffic to these sites. It
just isn't working yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Visits to political Web sites _ ranging from such mainstream
sites as MSNBC.com and CNN.com to more cutting-edge sites like
Pseudo.com or SpeakOut.com _ actually fell during the Republican
convention. MSNBC.com, for instance, saw a 27 percent drop it its
visitors to 2.4 million during the week of the convention. And
CNN.com saw an 18 percent drop to 1.9 million viewers, only to see
viewership rebound by 13.6 percent following the convention week.
</P>
<P>
   Newer Web sites like Speakout.com and Voter.com failed to pull
more than 150,000 visitors during the Republican convention,
according to Media Metrix Inc., a company that tracks this data.
SpeakOut.com, which has on online poll that records instantaneous
reactions to podium speeches, keep a daily posting of how different
politicians fared on the stump. The Gore speech received a
favorable rating among 79 percent of Democrats, 50 percent of
independent and swing voters, and 26 percent of Republicans, with
women rating Gore's speech higher than men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first online convention failed to live up to the hype that
preceded it,'' Michael Cornfield, director of the Democracy Online
Project at George Washington University, said about Philadelphia.
``This is not so surprising because the convention was not an
exciting news event.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for low traffic was the product: Despite
claims by many Internet Web sites that they could jazz up
convention coverage with offbeat stories, chat rooms and nifty
camera shots, the online coverage proved to be no more exciting
than the coverage of regular television, which itself was often
greeted with yawns. Some of the promises _ streaming video,
instantaneous polling and ``behind-the-scenes'' footage _ failed to
materialize, or did so in fuzzy and unattractive formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of sites couldn't get their act together,'' said Marion
Just, a researcher at the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press,
Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. ``Many wanted to
have the fanciest gadgets and gimmicks, and some sites crashed and
burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Pseudo.com, which bought a sky box at both conventions, cut its
convention staff in half after the Republican convention and did
not bring its 360-degree camera to Los Angeles after the camera
produced only small, grainy online pictures, in the opinion of some
viewers, and those came at high costs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The two political parties failed, as well, to live up to their
promises of plugged-in conventions. The Dems.2000 Web site promised
to have online chats with convention speakers immediately after
their presentations. That did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a live chat, anyone signing on with questions was
given an automated response thanking them for participating in the
``online event,'' saying the party was ``doing its best'' to answer
them and urging them to continue participating in Democratic events
online.
</P>
<P>
   And the Republican's highly touted dot-com delegate Web site,
which promised ``exclusive'' online access to top Republican
officials, also failed to deliver. A promised live chat room never
came about, information given to dot-com delegates was dated and
generic and online polls asked questions not related to the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the features lived up to the hype,'' said Chris
Hunter, an analyst with NetElection.Org. ``Chat rooms were vapid
and off-topic. It was all very disappointing. I think lots of the
dot.coms weren't there to promote democracy, but to get another
round of venture capital.''

GORE'S SPEECH SATISFIES HIS SUPPORTERS IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also DEM-VOICES I, III, IV, V) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPLEWOOD, N.J. _ As the confetti fell and the delegates
thundered in Los Angeles Thursday night, there was a far more
modest eruption of glee at the Fabrizio home here, where three
generations of women were watching Al Gore's long-awaited televised
pitch to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore promised that his administration would serve the
people, not the powerful, Lois Corcoran, 39, just home from her
nursing job, whooped along with the ecstatic throng at the Staples
Center. Her daughter, Amanda Orem, 18, who will vote for the first
time this year, cheered, as well.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of doubting Gore and his ability to wow a crowd,
Orem and her mother said they were pleased by his speech _ and
relieved. ``I was kind of worried he'd be a dud, but he came off
great,'' said Orem, a sophomore at the College of New Jersey who is
a registered independent. ``His words seemed heartfelt. As a
struggling middle-class family, we felt like he was talking to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's presidential coming out Thursday night may not have won
over any rock-ribbed Republicans, but interviews with New Jersey
voters found that he had carried enough zest to turn them, at
least, from tepid supporters into veritable stalwarts.
</P>
<P>
   Until Gore mounted the stage, many Democrats and independents
spoke of the vice president as if he were a kindly, if somewhat
insufferable, uncle. ``I wish he wasn't so stiff and didn't seem so
distant,'' said Jo Allen Henry, 44, a fourth-grade teacher from
Plainfield, voicing a common refrain. ``He needs to be more
lively.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Davis did not look entirely mesmerized as he sat in his
living room watching Gore jab the air with his hands. Still, at
least he did not join his wife, who dozed through the entire
52-minute speech. ``Obviously Gore doesn't compare to Clinton, but
he was much more dynamic than I expected,'' said Davis, 36, a
medical recruiter from Bloomfield. ``There were a couple of times
where he threw in some fake laughter, but everyone does it. Except
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Gore is succeeding in crafting an
identity separate from that of his charismatic boss. After watching
him speak, Georgiana Walsh, 55, an elementary school teacher from
Montville, said she was satisfied that he would be his own man. But
most of all, she thought he had shown Americans that he would spare
them from the indignities of the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said that unlike the president, whom she called a
disappointment, Gore seemed ``wholesome and honest.'' ``We've been
through enough,'' she said. ``You can't imagine what it's like to
have a bunch of fifth-graders asking you about the cigar and the
blue dress.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Walsh has been sold, her husband, Mike, has not. A
construction worker, union loyalist and National Rifle Association
member, Mike Walsh, 55, is a registered Democrat who usually
hopscotches his way through a ballot without regard to party
affiliations. He voted for Ronald Reagan and George Bush, but he
also voted for Clinton the second time around.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what he termed a decent performance by the vice
president, Walsh said he had not been entirely impressed by Gore.
``I still might pick Bush or even Ralph Nader,'' he said. ``We'll
see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many voters seemed swept up by the news media's endless
dissection of Gore's public persona and his lack of razzle-dazzle,
others were more focused on his politics and his positions. Orem,
who opposes the death penalty and supports gay marriage and
abortion rights, said there was no way she could vote for Gov.
George W. Bush. She is not thrilled by Gore's support for capital
punishment, but she said she appreciated his defiant words on Roe
v. Wade; his reference to Matthew Shepard, the young gay man who
died after being beaten in Wyoming in 1998; and his promise to make
college tuition tax- deductible.
</P>
<P>
   In a swing state like New Jersey, where half the voters are
independents and recent polls show the two candidates to be neck
and neck, pulling in voters like Orem will be critical. But in his
effort to play to the middle and the left, Gore runs the risk of
turning off voters like Mike Walsh, who sees Gore as too liberal.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, die-hard progressives like Steven Cherry, 44, of
Wayne, said that Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman, were too conservative. Despite the vice president's
populist proposals for working-class America and Lieberman's
efforts to recast his positions on affirmative action, Cherry was
not swayed. ``Lieberman is too moralistic and Gore doesn't have any
moral fiber,'' said Cherry, who edits engineering publications on
the Internet. ``I'll vote for them, but I'll be holding my nose.''
</P>
<P>
   Jo Allen Henry, who is black, complained that the Democrats were
not doing enough to ease racism, joblessness and the despair in her
community. ``Everyone keeps talking about this great era of
prosperity, but in the black community, you just don't see it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, any thoughts Henry had of voting for Bush were vanquished
as she watched the Republican National Convention, with its
strategic splashes of minority color. ``I found their convention
scary,'' she said. ``But on the other hand, I feel like the
Democratic Party takes the black vote for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, she will swallow her cynicism, vote for
Gore and hope for the best. ``I liked a lot of what he said,
especially on education and campaign finance reform,'' she said,
``but I've seen too many candidates make promises they don't
keep.''

IN SEATTLE, YOUNG LIBERALS WEIGH GORE VS. NADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also DEM-VOICES I, II, IV, V) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In one obvious sense, it would be hard to consider
Martine Dedek or John Roderick ``swing voters'' in the coming
presidential election. Young, unabashedly liberal, both proud
participants in last fall's demonstrations here against the World
Trade Organization, they both roll their eyes and offer a vigorous
``no way'' when asked if they would consider voting for the
Republican candidate, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, they will definitely go to the polls in November, they
are still undecided, and they could be part of a hugely influential
group in this election, especially in West Coast states where some
polls suggest that as many as 10 percent of voters express a
preference for Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate and Green Party
nominee. They are among the voters who are still making up their
mind between Al Gore and Nader.
</P>
<P>
   So as they followed the Democratic convention this week,
gathering at a friend's house Thursday night to watch Gore accept
the party nomination, they were willing to listen intently to the
vice president's speech. They came away ambivalent _ suggesting
that while Gore failed to dazzle or even much impress them with his
speech in Los Angeles, he may have drawn enough of a distinction
between himself and Bush to get their vote if the election seems
close in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore speech left all the friends grumbling that only Nader
was still bringing up the issues they considered central in this
election: corporate power, the forces of globalization, the
widening divide between the rich and the poor, here in this country
and around the world. They scoffed at many parts, and Dedek, 28,
who has worked as an advocate for battered women and for welfare
recipients, at one point pronounced the whole speech ``so
orchestrated, so predictable, so scripted.''
</P>
<P>
   She nearly rose out of her chair at one point when Gore pledged
to bring down the rising cost of prescription drugs. ``I mean, he's
still not getting at any of the larger issues here,'' Dedek said.
``Why are prescription drugs so expensive?''
</P>
<P>
   Roderick, a singer-songwriter and the piano player in a Seattle
rock band by the name of Harvey Danger, nodded in agreement, and
worried aloud that a Gore victory might bring four more years of
complacency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not horrified about the idea of Bush winning this
election,'' said Roderick, 31, who is about to graduate from the
University of Washington with a degree in the comparative history
of ideas. ``It could be the thing that reunites liberals around a
common enemy, I guess, for lack of a better word. It could force
liberals to see what their principles are.''
</P>
<P>
   Another friend, Phil Campbell, a reporter for The Stranger, an
alternative weekly newspaper in Seattle, said Gore still left him
feeling uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this obsession he has with his imperfections,'' said
Campbell, 27, who covers criminal-justice issues, breaking into an
imitation of Gore's voice as he watched the speech. ``I'm not
popular; I'm not at ease with myself,''' he intoned, as his friends
laughed. ``It's weird. A little self-deprecation's fine, but this
is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   If the election looks like a rout for either candidate of the
two main parties, there was general agreement that a vote for Nader
would be in order. But if the election looks like a close one, the
friends said, it could be a very different matter _ and here, their
words may offer some salve to the Gore campaign, which has always
insisted that in the end, many people will not want to ``throw
away'' their vote on Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it looks like Gore is clearly winning on Election Day, then
you can send a vote for Nader, especially with the time
difference'' on the West Coast, Campbell explained. ``If you know
Gore's going to win, you can vote for Nader and contribute to that
message being sent.'' But if it looks like a tight contest, he
said, he will probably vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Dedek, who currently has a job in public relations, reluctantly
agreed, explaining that on one core issue raised by Gore, she
thought there was a critical difference between him and Bush _
abortion rights.

GORE'S SPEECH HELPED TO OPEN MINDS, DELEGATES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Calif., Mass., Ill.)  (See also DEM-VOICES I, II, III, V) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As they packed their placards and headed home to
where the hard work waits, Democratic delegates and elected
officials said Friday they were confident that Vice President Al
Gore had opened the minds of undecided voters with his convention
speech on Thursday night, even if he might not have closed the
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's address had two purposes: to mollify and energize party
loyalists who had expressed concern about the centrist cast of the
Democratic ticket, while also grabbing the attention of independent
voters at home. In dozens of interviews, those who watched Gore
from the floor said that he had clearly accomplished the first and
had put himself in a position to compete with Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas for swing votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited,'' said David Giese, a 58-year-old delegate
and small-business owner from Vermilion, Ohio. ``I can't wait to
get home and spread the word. He energized the Democrats and
brought in the independents. We know we can win this thing now.''
</P>
<P>
   While the speech may have been short on memorable lines, many
said that Gore had succeeded in establishing his own persona, in
subtly reassuring voters that he would not repeat President
Clinton's mistakes, and in turning his focus on policy into an
asset. Frustrated for months by the perception that Bush was simply
more likable than Gore, they responded particularly well to Gore's
assertion that ``the presidency is more than a popularity
contest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been this nervousness among delegates,'' said Richard
L. Brodsky, an assemblyman from suburban New York, ``because we've
got the Republicans on the dead run on every single issue. Ask the
American people who they agree with and they agree with us. Yet the
campaign had the trappings of a race for president of the senior
class.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky maintained that Gore's speech would help reposition the
race as less about personality and more about policy. ``It was up
to Al to insist on his agenda, and not let them back him off of
health care, the environment and the economy,'' he said. ``And I
think he did that.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of those interviewed also said that Gore seemed
authentic and completely in control of his message. They said his
image was softened by the lingering kiss he shared with his wife,
Tipper, and they applauded his simple declaration of independence
from Clinton: ``I stand here tonight as my own man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The world now knows he is not Bill Clinton,'' said Peter
Zachos, 60, an airline mechanic from San Mateo, Calif. ``It was an
emancipation proclamation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gus P. Bickford, a 37-year-old delegate from Westford, Mass.,
said that Gore had established himself by laying out his agenda in
such detail. ``I was into it,'' he said, ``because he was saying,
`These are my priorities, this is my candidacy.' And in a subtle
way he was saying: `I'm going to take you on, George Bush. You can
run against the previous administration, but we're talking about
the future here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the convention hall said that Gore seemed looser than
usual, and that he had disarmed the critics of his sometimes
robotic style by acknowledging, ``Sometimes people say I'm too
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning he was way too fast,'' said Bob Woodworth, a
Democratic ward leader from Cleveland, Ohio. ``But he didn't have
his usual quirks, the jerkiness of his body. He was very
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Several delegates commended Gore for speaking calmly and evenly,
without the volume he sometimes uses to inject passion into his
speeches. That device, said Cynthia Contreras-Rodriguez, a
29-year-old aide to an assemblyman from Santa Ana, Calif., has made
Gore seem insincere. ``He seemed really relaxed,'' she said. ``It
made me finally connect with him. When he wasn't calm, it made me
tune him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there were those who, accustomed to Clinton's gift for
connecting with his audience, felt Gore still needed to show more
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people can work a crowd,'' said Michael A. Schafer, the
husband of a delegate from Mansfield, Ohio. ``He's not really that
kind of guy. I just think he needed to space his wording and take
in the applause and show a little fire with the subjects he touched
on. He sounded like a good wholesome man, though, and I think the
country needs a good wholesome man.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Members of the party's liberal base _ minorities, trade
unionists, women, teachers _ were pleased that Gore took strong
stands for affirmative action, abortion rights, and hate-crimes
legislation, and against school vouchers and Bush's proposed
income-tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a concerted appeal to his base, and he did it in very,
very specific terms,'' said Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Chicago, who
had expressed concern this week about the ticket's centrist
leanings.
</P>
<P>
   As for the undecided voters, the delegates here were convinced
that Gore had started the process of reeling them in. His vows to
protect Social Security, add a Medicare prescription-drug benefit,
take medical decisions away from health-maintenance organizations,
provide tax credits for college tuition, and reduce crime rates
should all score with that part of the electorate, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the speech was to open minds,'' Brodsky said.
``What he had to do here was begin the campaign, not clinch it.''

 &HT;    Powered parachutes dot the skies
 &HT;    By Carolyn Banks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHVILLE, Texas _ From a powered parachute, wafting along 600
feet up at sunrise, ``top of the morning'' takes on a new
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The endless horizon, breathtaking. Look down, though, and it's
heart-stopping: like flying in an airplane with the windows wide
open and nothing underfoot.
</P>
<P>
   At Smithville Municipal Airport, which operator Les Hentschel
calls ``a little old country airport,'' pilots of conventional
private planes increasingly find themselves surrounded by new-age
interlopers: powered parachutes, three-wheeled vehicles with a
large propeller behind the pilot's seat. They look like go-carts
until the chutes behind them fill and they go up, up and away.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Williams offers introductory flights and instruction in
his specially outfitted rig with two seats and two throttles.
</P>
<P>
   The craft have been around since the 1980s and can be registered
as experimental aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration.
The Smithville airport, far away from regular air traffic but close
to plenty of open land, has become something of a haven for powered
parachuting. Cars along Texas 71 sometimes swerve when drivers spot
one of the colorful aircraft flying over a field alongside the
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, powered parachute enthusiasts fly at sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when you have the stillest air,'' Williams said, adding
that an aircraft can fly until 11 a.m. if the wind is light.
</P>
<P>
   ``After than it gets very bumpy,'' he said, ``very thermally,
and it isn't as much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusk is also a good time to fly.
</P>
<P>
   A powered parachute can go as high as 16,000 feet, an unofficial
record held by a pilot in Missouri. Williams has been up to 3,000
feet. ``Between 500 and 1,000 feet is pretty standard around
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The machines can also fly very low, especially near an airport
with as much open land around it as Smithville's.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we're not flying over people or scaring livestock,
we can fly as low as we want,'' Williams said. ``There are these
huge hayfields out here where we'll get down to maybe 10 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   It's something like levitating.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said a powered parachute can fly 25 to 30 mph, but the
speed depends on the wind. One of the machines heading into a stiff
wind can stand still.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekend, Williams and some buddies went to a fly-in
at nearby Giddings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind is usually out of the south this time of year,''
Williams explained, ``so we can get there in no time.'' ``No time''
amounted to about 35 minutes to cover 20 miles.
</P>
<P>
   On such trips the powered parachutes rely on ground support.
Friends or family members drive pickups to the landing site so that
the flying machines can be brought home if need be.
</P>
<P>
   Portability and cost help make the sport more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need a hangar for a powered parachute,'' Williams
said. ``You can keep them in your garage.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some people don't bother with an airport, he said. They
just unfurl their chutes on the ground in their front yard and take
off.
</P>
<P>
   Powered parachutes are relatively inexpensive compared with
other types of small aircraft: $8,000 to $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has been flying powered parachutes since 1992. He had
received his private pilot's license a year before and tried
skydiving. He discovered that he liked flying with the parachute
more than the free fall.
</P>
<P>
   Tex West is Williams' oldest student. He's 67 and has 11 flights
and eight hours of training under his belt. He had seen the craft
before, ``but I always thought that was stuff they do in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long about November of last year I saw one flying around here
and found out they were flying out of a field about a quarter of a
mile from my house.'' He located Williams and signed on for
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Last month West bought his own powered parachute. ``It's the one
I'm going to solo in when my instructor says I'm ready to solo.''
He keeps it on his porch.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Tucker is another Williams student. Tucker used to
sky-dive, ``but my legs got so beat up, I couldn't take landing
anymore.'' Before he found Williams, Tucker had tried flying a
powered parachute on his own and flipped during takeoff. ``I got up
and was fine, but I was very embarrassed,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board said
the agency does not keep statistics on deaths or injuries resulting
from powered parachute crashes.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a pilot's license to fly a powered parachute.
Williams, who is certified to teach by Aero Sports Connection, one
of three national organizations committed to ultra-light aircraft
safety, said that has its drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   On any powered parachute Web site you'll find people talking
about how easy it is. ``And in good weather, if everything's going
right, it is,'' Williams said. ``They don't cover all of the
situations that someone can encounter, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Those might include a sudden gust of wind, a tangled line or an
uninflated end cell on the chute.
</P>
<P>
   Takeoff is the most critical moment. ``You have to make sure
your chute inflates all the way, and you have to make sure that
it's right overhead and it isn't oscillating,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Oscillation can overturn the machine, though the frame that
surrounds the propeller serves as a roll bar. Pilots wear safety
helmets and are strapped in, so they are rarely hurt in a takeoff
rollover, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Most pilots keep a practised eye on the chute as they taxi, and
then whoosh _ the chute is full and the craft makes its ascent,
which is surprisingly steep. Once aloft, the pilot steers with his
feet on a long bar, his hand on the throttle stick.
</P>
<P>
   Landing is said to be easy. ``Just head into the wind and power
down,'' Williams said. There's a slight tip forward when the front
wheel hits the ground, but the jarring is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason they're so safe,'' Williams said, ``is that there
isn't much to do, and they're moving so slowly that you have a lot
of time to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans offer plenty of stories about powered parachutes that have
come down safely even when the engine has quit. Williams practices
landing with no engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a parachute,'' he pointed out. ``It's always up
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the brightly colored rectangular chutes arc overhead
like the pilots' private rainbows.
</P>
<P>
   The powered parachutes at Smithville Municipal Airport have
attracted the attention of conventional pilots. Peggy Walicek, a
former judge and a member of airport's advisory board, says she's
dying to go up in one. ``I'm fascinated by them,'' said Walicek, a
former Cessna pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Even airport operator Les Hentschel, who owns a retired
crop-duster biplane, said he's considered trying a flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time I've been around these things,'' he
hedged. ``One of these days I'm going to go up.''

<P>
   MOGADISHU, Somalia _ The warlords of Mogadishu are a courteous
bunch. They smile. They reason in soft tones. They even serve
visitors cardamom tea and something sweet and orange resembling
Tang. But it is not their good manners that you notice first.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is,'' Osman Atto, one warlord, said with some
understatement, ``an assortment of armaments in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside his house here, Atto's militia was decked out with
countless automatic weapons, including a spiffy submachine-gun that
would fit nicely under a jacket. Many militiamen drive around town
in pickups mounted with antiaircraft guns. That might seem
excessive, but it was apparently useful when gunmen allied with
Atto recently blasted down a steel gate and kidnapped two foreign
aid workers for ransom money.
</P>
<P>
   The warlords _ who prefer to be called faction leaders _ look as
scary as ever. But there is a question in the hopeful air of
Somalia these days: How much power do the warlords really wield
nowadays? Not as much as they once did, many Somalis say, but
enough to make trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The question will be put to the test if, as expected, the first
Somali government since 1991 is formed and actually tries to govern
the chaos here. For the last several months, thousands of Somalis
have gathered in the neighboring country of Djibouti for political
planning. They have already set up an assembly aimed at guiding
Somalia through to a permanent government.
</P>
<P>
   But four of the five major warlords in Mogadishu have refused to
attend the conference, which makes any government's success a major
uncertainty. No one has forgotten that the warlords were the major
obstacle to the U.N. operation here in the early 1990s. And in
interviews here, three of them hinted at violence if any government
comes into Somalia from Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the consent of the population and the leaders of the
factional organizations, this would lead to civil war,'' said
Hussein Aidid, 38, who took power of one major faction after his
father, Gen. Mohamed Farah Aidid, was killed in 1996. ``Nobody can
impose on us a government.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another warlord, Muse Sudi Yalahow, said, ``We are going to
defend our town from these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Atto, who speaks a rough, idiomatic American English, said: ``I
would ignore it. And if anybody tries to tell me, `I am your
government,' I would tell them: `You go to hell.'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the harsh words, there is a growing sense in Somalia
that the warlords _ who divided power into clan fiefdoms after the
dictatorship of Siad Barre fell in 1991 _ may not be the deciding
factor any more. Courts and police set up by local Islamic groups
have siphoned off some of their authority. So have businessmen, who
not only hire their own militias but provide jobs and money to
people who are not thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most of all, Somalis seem plain weary of the warlords _
responsible for much of the factional fighting and failing in 12
previous peace conferences over the last decade to settle their
differences. ``Nobody listens to them,'' said one man, Ali Mohamed
Osman, 38, working in the Bakara market, in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
   Another man in the market, Farhan Mohamed Hersi, 18, suggested
that the warlords were out of step with most Somalis, who seem to
support the work in Djibouti overwhelmingly. ``We are against
anyone who is against peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell whether the warlords would oppose any
government, on the theory that order might mean less power for
them. But there is little doubt why they hate what is happening now
in Djibouti: The conference was organized explicitly to exclude
them as leaders. They were invited to Djibouti, but only as
ordinary citizens or members of their clans.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Djibouti is a reconciliation conference,'' Yalahow said. ``But
with whom are we reconciling in Djibouti? All the faction leaders
are here.''
</P>
<P>
   All except one, Ali Madhi, who served briefly as president in
1991 after Barre fell and who is taking active part in the talks in
Djibouti. He seems to be betting his own political future on a new
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the faction leaders who will decide what will
happen,'' he said in a recent interview in Djibouti. ``It's the
people who have the right to decide for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are not here,'' he added, ``they don't care
about their country.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the warlords' objections to the Djibouti conference have
been echoed by other Somalis. First among those is the number of
high officials from the collapsed Barre regime, including his
former ministers for interior, finance and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Second is that two politicians with more respect and influence
than the warlords have also refused to take part in the conference.
One is Abdullahi Yussef Ahmed, a former faction leader who set up a
stable, regional government in northeast Somalia called Puntland.
The other is Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, a former prime minister of
Somalia who is the leader of another pocket of stability,
Somaliland, in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Aidid, who served in the U.S. Marines, said the conference in
Djibouti is rushing ahead without Ahmed or Egal _ and may turn them
further away from the rest of Somalia, perhaps violently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a fear,'' he said. ``There is no quick solution to the
problems of Somalia.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts say they believe that Somaliland and Puntland
present political problems for the longer term. But the warlords,
they say, present the real threat of violence as soon any
government tries to assert its authority. To lessen that worry, the
delegates in Djibouti decided to seat any new government in the
inland city of Baidoa, at least temporarily, rather than the still
fractious historical capital, Mogadishu. But that issue is still
not settled.
</P>
<P>
   As with so many problems in places of the world with very
little, the final issue may be one of money. Many Somalis say that
the best way for a new government to succeed is to have money
donated from rich governments that would make it popular among
ordinary people and provide jobs for the warlords' gunmen. It may
even have something for the warlords themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they are going to do: kill them, put them
behind bars or give them contracts,'' said one businessman in
Mogadishu, whose name is being omitted here just to be on the safe
side.
</P>
<P>
   That last option is not so far-fetched: The three warlords
interviewed here are in business, and Atto was once a successful
construction contractor. He made a point of showing off to a
visitor his huge outdoor garage, filled with millions of dollars of
bulldozers, backhoes and other heavy machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't he make more money, he was asked, reconstructing the
nation's roads and buildings in peace?
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not a problem _ being rich,'' he insisted. ``The
problem is achieving what you would call stability.''

UTOPIAN DREAM SAID TO HAVE FAILED IN EAST AND WEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
 (Eds: Inserts title and publisher of Susan Buck-Morss' book in 2nd
graf.)  
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1988, Susan Buck-Morss, a professor of government at Cornell
University and an authority on Marxist thought, visited Moscow to
meet with a group of Soviet philosophers. She had written a knotty
but keen book about Theodor Adorno and the Frankfurt School of
philosophy (``The Origin of Negative Dialectics'') and admired the
philosopher Walter Benjamin, who himself went on a pilgrimage to
Moscow in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that I had been schooled in Western Marxism had
everything to do with my desire to enter into a collaboration,''
she writes in ``Dreamworld and Catastrophe'' (M.I.T. Press). ``Yet
this Marxist orientation,'' she adds with some chagrin, ``was of
very little interest to my Moscow counterparts.'' In fact, when she
began a lecture by citing Marx, the audience laughed; they thought
she was mocking standard ritualistic invocations of Marx and Lenin.
</P>
<P>
   But Buck-Morss wasn't intending satire. In fact, one of her
worries in her new, and eccentric, book is that with the fall of
the Soviet Union, the great dream of a ``mass utopia'' that marked
the 20th century in both East and West _ a dream in which Marx
played an important role _ is near extinction. There was nothing
wrong with the dream, Buck-Morss argues, but its execution went
awry, and despite most assumptions it failed in the West as well as
in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Her argument, which sometimes glints with insights but is almost
always clouded by distortion, deserves some close attention, for it
is exactly the kind of argument that is bound to be heard more
often as problems facing the formerly communist countries mount, as
the memories of the Soviet past recede, and as the very notion that
totalitarianism even existed comes under increasing challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Buck-Morss suggests, there is a ``hegemonic
discourse'' _ a dominant interpretation _ that affirms the moral
superiority of the West after the collapse of the Soviet Union and
the fall of the Berlin Wall: Totalitarianism was evil and democracy
virtuous, and virtue emerged victorious.
</P>
<P>
   But, Buck-Morss argues, this is all wrong. The Cold War, far
from being a battle between radically different societies, was
actually a ``story of similarities.'' East and West saw each other
as evil and ``refused to face their own failures as democracies.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck-Morss' similarities are actually symmetries. When she talks
about the 1920s for example, she outlines the various failures in
American ``democracy'' (the ironic quotation marks are hers): the
``red scare'' that brought all protesters under suspicion, the
Espionage Act of 1918 making criticism of the military punishable
by 20 years' imprisonment, attacks on aliens, labor unrest. ``The
record in the Soviet Union,'' she continues, ``is hardly more
heartening.'' There was the violence of the civil war, the quashing
of protests and, in the late '20s, Stalin's ``ruthless
destruction'' of peasants.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledges that the ``body count was incomparably higher''
than in similar repressive events in the West, but even this is an
understatement that tries to preserve a symmetry where there is
none. Flaws in a democratic nation that could be and generally were
corrected by legislative and constitutional process are being
compared with the murder and starvation of tens of millions of
people in a social engineering experiment that created one of the
century's worst horrors.
</P>
<P>
   This is the pattern of most of Buck-Morss' symmetries. There are
sins of misplaced blame on both sides: After World War II, the
Soviets interpreted fascism as a capitalist phenomenon, exonerating
East German communists, while in the West, socialists were slurred
by being ``lumped together'' with fascists as totalitarian.
</P>
<P>
   There are also sins of violent excess: In the East, the class
war led to ``the danger of suffocation'' of liberties; in the West,
aggressive territorial ambitions led to ``grotesque'' weapons and
``orgies of annihilation.'' But all these symmetries are weighted
to give what Buck-Morss elsewhere calls ``the benefit of the
doubt'' to the East.
</P>
<P>
   When Buck-Morss turns her attention to cultural symmetries, it
comes as a bit of relief _ even though she tends to view art in the
Marxist manner, asserting that the aesthetic experience should
teach a political lesson.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible not to be intrigued by the similarities she
points out between the 1933 image of King Kong on the Empire State
Building and the 1933 plans for a gargantuan Palace of the Soviets
topped by a colossal statue of Lenin, or to be reminded of the
strange cultural interplay that moved the designers of Radio City
Music Hall to visit the Soviet Union for ideas, or Soviet planners
to seek out the factory designs of Henry Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Such detail (and some fascinating illustrations) are far more
concrete than Buck-Morss' political arguments. Still, in her world,
abstractions rule. And historical judgments have less to do with
life as it is lived than with the wish for what it could have been
or should still be.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no wonder that Buck-Morss caused some dismay among her
Soviet colleagues when she kept focusing on the commonalities
between East and West. They kept insisting, instead, that there
were ``modern horrors'' that were unique to them and that were not
being comprehended.
</P>
<P>
   The critic Frederic Jameson, who joined Buck-Morss in a Soviet
conference in 1990, even pointed out that the Cold War roles now
seemed reversed, with Western Marxists criticizing ``capitalist
commodity culture,'' while the Soviet philosophers used the
vocabulary of ``Cold War anti-communism.''
</P>
<P>
   This was, of course, because these Western intellectuals knew
all the flaws that scar the democratic state, all the weaknesses of
democratic culture, all the unkept promises and unmet ideals. They
dreamed of a more perfect world. But the Eastern intellectuals may
have known something more profound: that in the midst of a world of
imperfections and injustices, some distinctions are still worth
making.

   MANCHEVSKI-FILM (Stavica, Macedonia) _ Hemmed in by Kosovo to
the north, Greece to the south, Albania to the west and Bulgaria to
the east, and lacking any outlet to the sea, Macedonia swelters in
the sun. It is late July, a few miles from the Greek border;
nothing moves; tobacco crops wilt in the fields. Behind a Byzantine
church, men, their shirts caked in blood, are draped on the bald
mountainside. Shots ring out. Milcho Manchevski, the Macedonian
director of the acclaimed, Oscar-nominated film, ``Before the
Rain,'' is at it again, putting the tortured history of his
homeland on the screen in his second film. By Joan Dupont.
</P>
<P>
   ABBIE-HOFFMAN-FILM (Undated) _ ``The whole world is watching!''
was chanted during the Republican Convention this month. Many of
those chanting had not yet been born in 1968, when that cry first
sounded on the streets of Chicago, as the police clubbed protesters
in town for the tumultuous Democratic convention. The scene was yet
another tribute to the enduring power of the '60s in the national
imagination. So is ``Steal This Movie,'' which opens Aug. 18,
Robert Greenwald's biographical movie about Abbie Hoffman,
charismatic exemplar of '60s cultural radicalism, a defendant in
the conspiracy trial of the Chicago Seven, the leaders of the
Chicago protest, and the author of ``Steal This Book,'' among other
provocations. By Ellen Willis.

<P>
   JANSSEN-FILM (Undated) _ Famke Janssen, like a rollercoaster,
tall and steeply curved, is having herself a thrill ride of a
summer. As Jean Grey, the telepathic, telekinetic protege of
Professor X, Janssen was part of the team that not only arrested
the vengeful Magneto's quest for world domination in ``X-Men'' but
has also raked in a superheroic $144 million at the box office in
five weeks of release. Now, opening on August 25, comes Valerie
Breiman's romantic comedy ``Love and Sex,'' a crowd pleaser at the

   SHAKESPEARE-BERKSHIRES (Lenox, Mass.) _ In ``Henry V,''
Shakespeare asked the patrons to use their imaginations and
``Suppose within the girdle of these walls/Are now confin'd two
mighty monarchies.'' Tina Packer, the ebullient director of
Shakespeare &AMP; Company, is making an equally audacious request of
her audiences here in Western Massachusetts: to envision an exact
replica of an Elizabethan playhouse nestled among the rolling
Berkshire hills at the company's new home. Soon, after its wrangles
over use of the nearby Edith Wharton estate _ Shakespeare &AMP; Company
will be ensconced on 63 acres in Lenox, near Tanglewood. Given
Packer's drive and the plans already in motion, a replica of the
Rose Theater, which once stood in London in Shakespeare's time, is
likely to be the core of what Packer hopes will be a major center
for Shakespearean performance, teaching and scholarship in this
country. By Iris Fanger.

   OLDER-DANCERS (Undated) _ In recent years, Americans have become
more accepting of older dancers. Whether this attitude is a result
of aging baby-boomers or has been imposed by political correctness,
it is expanding the concept of dancing. The United States now has
several organizations that present performances by older dancers,

Calder and O'Keeffe, Norman Rockwell and Robert Rauschenberg, to
more than 600 towns and cities in 44 states. It has gone to big
cities like Baltimore, Detroit, Pittsburgh and Washington, but more
often its destination isn't even a whistle stop anymore _ places
like Zeeland, Mich.; Plant City, Fla., and Parkers Prairie, Minn.

   OKAMOTO-ART-MUSEUM (Tokyo) _ On the Japanese art scene, the
baburu (economic bubble) burst long ago. Today, the friends and
contacts a Western visitor encounters here are sure to recollect,
with incredulity and undisguised embarrassment, the heady days of
the 1980s, when Japanese corporations spent tens of millions of
dollars on Impressionist paintings at overseas auctions, and when
new museums seemed to pop up every month. Nevertheless, against a
backdrop of lingering art-world doldrums, the Taro Okamoto Museum
opened late last year in Kawasaki, not far to the southwest of
central Tokyo. And with some 100,000 visitors already to its
credit, it has quickly become something of a hit. By Edward M.

   MORAL-MUSIC (Undated) _ What's an election year without a moral
panic? Popular music, and pop culture in general, are set up to be
prime targets this year, stuck in the crossfire of a battle for the
righteous high ground. Republicans and Democrats are both
positioning themselves as guardians of what George W. Bush, in his
speech accepting the Republican nomination, called ``essential
values.'' When the moral-panic soundbites start to fly, artistic
subtlety is the first casualty. By Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   MESSIAEN-MUSIC (Undated) _ This is very much Messiaen's year _
as most years now tend to be. Barely was there time to draw breath
after the Brooklyn Philharmonic's presentation of three scenes from
``St. Francois d'Assise'' than the Lincoln Center Festival offered
four big pieces in quick succession. And now comes a thoroughly
spectacular recording of his greatest solo piano work, the ``Vingt
Regards sur l'Enfant-Jesus,'' played by Pierre-Laurent Aimard

it. He has crisscrossed the country by horse-drawn wagon in an

butler training last week, I was no longer amused. Maybe it was
having to wear the white tie and tails in 80-degree heat. Or maybe
it was the new Manhattan phone books that needed to be carried into
the rooms and the old ones carried out. Or maybe it was that the
butlers training me had a quality _ a stillness, a patience, an
obedience of sorts _ that I will never have in this lifetime. If I

LASER PROJECT FACES COSTS OVERRUNS AND DELAYS, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A giant laser being built at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory will cost nearly $2 billion more than the laboratory
originally announced that it would, and will be delayed by at least
six years, according to a report released on Thursday by the
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Called the National Ignition Facility, or NIF, the project was
originally expected to cost $2.1 billion and be finished by 2003 or
2004. By heating and compressing pellets of nuclear fuel with 192
converging lasers, NIF would aim to study the physics of nuclear
weapons without exploding them.
</P>
<P>
   So many technical questions surround the ambitious project, the
report found, that ``the cost of NIF could grow even higher and
completion of the project could take even longer'' than the revised
estimates suggest. The report also found that the former director
of the project withheld information about the problems from the
laboratory and from the Energy Department, which runs it.
</P>
<P>
   The project forms part of the nation's program to ensure the
safety and reliability of its nuclear stockpile. Because other
parts of this ``stockpile stewardship'' program may have to absorb
cost overruns at NIF, its political support has eroded.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the energy
subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which
recommends funding levels for the troubled project, said that the
GAO numbers were ``not out of the estimating ballpark from what we
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   But Domenici said that despite its importance as an element of
stockpile stewardship, ``NIF is a very controversial one now
because of these very excessive, these huge overruns.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has pledged to cover the
overruns largely using money from Livermore's part of the stockpile
stewardship budget. On June 1, he sent a letter to Domenici asking
that the project's construction allocation for fiscal year 2001 be
increased by $95 million, more than doubling the Clinton
administration's original request. The funds ``will come from other
Stockpile Stewardship Program activities,'' Richardson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is likely to meet with resistance, partly because
some of the money would probably come from other laboratories'
stewardship budgets. Domenici said he did not favor the change and
predicted the effort would fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own assessment would be that that GAO report will haunt
it,'' Domenici said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he would press the Energy Department to study
alternative versions of the project that would use a smaller number
of laser beams and cost less to build.
</P>
<P>
   Madelyn Creedon, deputy administrator for defense programs at
the Energy Department, said in an interview that money for the
overruns could be found within the stewardship program without
damaging it.
</P>
<P>
   The department ``is in the business of maintaining the
stockpile,'' she said. ``It's not in our best interests to skew the
balance of the program.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report also found that the NIF's director until last
year, E. Michael Campbell, failed to report the problems to senior
management at Livermore and at the Energy Department. That decision
led to a major embarrassment for Richardson, who in June of last
year, shortly before learning of the problems, gave a speech
hailing the project as on time and within its budget.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell left the laboratory in August of last year when it was
disclosed that he had never completed a Ph.D. from Princeton
University, as he had allowed the laboratory to believe he had. The
overruns and delays became public at about the same time. Campbell,
now a vice president at General Atomics, a government contractor,
was traveling and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever things were going through his mind, he convinced
himself and his senior people that everything was okay,'' said Gary
Boss, the GAO assistant director who oversaw the report.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions on Campbell's responsibility jibed with findings
released earlier this year by a panel appointed by Richardson. But
in a sharp difference with those findings, the GAO report largely
exonerated Dr. Victor H. Reis, a former assistant secretary of
energy who was the principal architect of the stockpile stewardship
program.
</P>
<P>
   Reis had been insulated from the problems by lower-level Energy
Department officials who ``should have been more aggressive in
acting on their suspicions,'' Boss said.

U.S. ENVOY TRIES TO REVIVE MIDEAST PEACE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The State Department's special peace envoy, Dennis
Ross, opened new talks in Jerusalem on Friday with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak in an effort to break an impasse in the
negotiations for an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But the early signs were that neither side sees much prospect of
breaking the impasse on the issue of Jerusalem and other
differences that developed at last month's summit meeting at Camp
David. After Ross' meeting with Barak, and his separate encounter
with Saeb Erekat and Muhammed Dahlan, top aides to Yasser Arafat,
the Palestinian leader, the Israelis and the Palestinians accused
each other of intransigence and said the prospects for a new summit
meeting were dim.
</P>
<P>
   Before the meetings, Israeli officials said they had been told
that if Ross succeeded in narrowing the differences, President
Clinton would be ready to meet separately in New York next month
with Barak and Arafat, who plan to attend a gathering of
international leaders at the United Nations in early September.
</P>
<P>
   If the New York meetings prove to be successful, the Israeli
officials said, Clinton would then call a new summit meeting,
possibly even before the self-imposed deadline of Sept. 13 that
both sides set for reaching an accord. Arafat had also cited that
date _ before he began to hedge on the issue earlier this week _ as
his own deadline for unilaterally declaring the establishment of a
Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   But after Friday's meetings, the Israelis and the Palestinians
both said there would be little point in a new summit as long as
the other side remained fixed to the positions that led to the
impasse at Camp David: the control of Jerusalem and the return of 3
million Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Ross was making no predictions about the likely outcome of his
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My focus right now is to meet with each side, spend time with
them, see what kind of conclusions they have drawn about the
insights that were developed at Camp David, and then see if there
are ways to overcome the differences,'' he said. ``There is work to
be done. I am out here to try and help the negotiations along and
we will see how best to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Barak said he saw ``no point'' in a new
summit meeting unless Arafat showed signs of flexibility that were
not now evident, Israel radio reported.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The main impasse continues to be the issue of Jerusalem.
Essentially, Israel has said it is prepared to grant the
Palestinians a limited foothold in Jerusalem, with control of
Muslim holy sites in the walled city, the adjoining Muslim and
Christian quarters, and Arab villages on the east of the city that
lie within its enlarged municipal boundaries. These concessions
have caused criticism from right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties,
which have insisted that all of Jerusalem be kept as Israel's
``eternal and undivided'' capital.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Arafat has toured more than 20 capitals in the
Arab world, Europe and Asia since the Camp David talks, seeking
backing for his position that Israel must accept United Nations
resolutions passed after the six-day war in 1967 and hand over all
of east Jerusalem, including the Jewish quarter, to a future
Palestinian state. Arafat has said that Palestinians will ``never''
agree to Israel controlling all of the city's eastern districts,
even if it takes generations to recover them.
</P>
<P>
   Barak made news on Thursday when he referred explicitly, for the
first time in public, to the establishment of a Palestinian state.

BUSH, IN TENNESSEE, SAYS GORE'S POLICIES WOULD DIVIDE

   MEMPHIS &UR; ,  &LR; Tenn. _ Roaring into Vice President Al Gore's home

politicizing and blaming, a candidate who pits one group of people
against another, a candidate who wants to wage class warfare to get
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a different vision of leadership,'' the Texas
governor added, ``a leaders is somebody who brings people
together.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, speaking in La Crosse, Wisc., Friday morning before he
shoved off on a carefully orchestrated boat trip through the
Midwest, said that some people were striving harder and less
successfully than others, and that he wanted to be their champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole struggle is about the future of this country and
what happens for working families,'' the vice president said,
referring to his bid for the presidency. ``Don't ever lose sight of
the fact that this (ital) is (ital) a struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   With their competing statements and viewpoints, Bush and Gore
were delineating what will undoubtedly be some of the sharpest
battle lines between them this fall. There were distinct echoes of
presidential elections past, in which Democrats tried, sometimes
successfully and sometimes not, to tag Republicans as the
protectors of privilege.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush and Gore were also vying dramatically for the precious,
fickle attention of voters as the conventions faded into memory and
the candidates headed into the final 11 weeks of a presidential
race that many political analysts say will be extraordinarily
close.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate sought to make a bold statement with his
itinerary Friday. Bush pointedly traveled to Gore's political
doorstep, and the banner behind him on the stage at his rally said,
``Listen to the People Who Know Them Best.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a reference to the fact, mentioned repeatedly throughout
the day by Bush's advisers, that several polls show Bush in a tight
race against Gore in Tennessee, while Gore trails Bush by what is
likely to be an insurmountable double-digit margin in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers pulled out all the stops for his rally here in
an enormous warehouse that was packed with somewhere between 5,000
and 10,000 wildly enthusiastic supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The singer Travis Tritt performed several songs before Bush took
the stage, and Bush was flanked by his running mate, Dick Cheney,
and by Tennessee's two Republican senators, Bill Frist and Fred
Thompson. The end of Bush's remarks, which lasted only about 15
minutes, was punctuated with a dense, dizzy blizzard of confetti.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, for his part, hopped aboard an old-fashioned boat to head
down the Mississippi, indulging in a bit of political theater that
wrapped his journey in a populist aura and evoked the sturdy,
timeless values of the American heartland.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was determined to sustain whatever momentum
he had wrung from his party's four-day jubilee in Los Angeles and
from his political coronation on Thursday night. Bush was equally
determined to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was singling out a cluster of swing states
that could prove decisive in the fall election. Bush was asserting,
as he had with his campaign schedule over the previous four weeks,
that his potent appeal to voters would enable him to compete in,
and possibly win, states where the odds should be against him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments at the rally in Bartlett and aboard his campaign
plane as he flew to Memphis from Austin, Texas, represented his
first public response to the Democrats' convention and his opening
salvo against Gore in the wake of the event. It was aggressive and
relatively unhampered by one of his campaign's central slogans, to
``change the tone'' in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed skepticism, for example, about Gore's vow on
Thursday night to make an overhaul of campaign finance laws the
first of legislation he would tackle if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's got any credibility on the issue,'' Bush
told reporters on his plane, explicitly reminding them of ``the
Buddhist temple event'' that symbolized the ethical questions
raised in the aftermath of Gore's aggressive fund raising for the
Democratic Party in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said that the array of resolutions in Gore's
convention speech, including pledges to shore up Social Security
and expand Medicare to include a prescription-drug benefit for
elderly Americans, was really a litany of unaccomplished goals
during the seven and a half years that Gore has been vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night we heard a laundry list of new promises, which I
thought was an attempt to cover up old failures,'' Bush told the
audience at his rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as he tried to separate himself from the squandered
opportunities of his own administration, the vice president's
speech reminded us of the fundamental choice in this election: Will
we prolong four more years of Clinton-Gore, or will we give America
a fresh start?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush plans to spend most of the next two weeks on the campaign
trail talking about education, the issue on which he has long
depended most heavily to reach out to independent and swing voters
in the political center.
</P>
<P>
   It is also one of the issues with which he will seek to
inoculate himself from charges by Gore that Bush cares too little
about those Americans struggling to build a better life for
themselves.

GLOBAL-WARMING EXPERT REVISES VIEW OF CARBON DIOXIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The number ``2'' in ``CO2'' in the final graf should be set
as subscript.) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An influential expert on global warming who for nearly 20 years
has pressed countries to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other
heat-trapping greenhouse gases now says the emphasis on carbon
dioxide may be misplaced. Instead, he and a team of scientists have
concluded that the quickest way to slow warming is to cut other
heat-trapping greenhouse gases first.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy could help policy-makers overcome a fundamental
conflict in the debate over global warming: Carbon dioxide, the
main heat-trapping gas in the air, is an unavoidable byproduct of
the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil _ and combustion of
fossil fuels is the foundation of industrial societies.
</P>
<P>
   The expert, Dr. James E. Hansen, and his colleagues conclude in
a new analysis that the warming seen in recent decades was caused
mainly by other heat-trapping emissions _ methane,
chlorofluorocarbons, black particles of diesel and coal soot, and
compounds that create the ozone in smog. These are far easier to
control than carbon dioxide, and some of them are already on the
decline.
</P>
<P>
   The team, which reported its findings this week in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that the
burning of fossil fuels, although substantially raising carbon
dioxide levels in the atmosphere, also produces a pall of particle
haze that reflects as much of the sun's energy back into space as
the release of carbon dioxide has trapped in the air, Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   The haze from combustion is likely to be cleaned up in coming
years, removing its cooling, sun-blocking effect, said Hansen, who
is director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. And over the course
of the century, he added, carbon dioxide levels will still have to
be reduced to prevent further warming. Meanwhile, emissions of
carbon dioxide from human activities may be decreasing; he said
they shrank slightly in 1998 and 1999, even as the global economy
grew.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, the world may find it easier and less
costly to slow climate change than he and other scientists had
thought, at least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospects for having a modest climate impact instead of a
disastrous one are quite good, I think,'' Hansen said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Some climatologists greeted Hansen's new paper with dismay,
saying they feared it would be misused by those who are skeptical
about global warming or by critics of a proposed treaty, the Kyoto
Protocol, which would commit industrialized nations to big cuts in
greenhouse-gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of industries most vulnerable to restrictions on
carbon dioxide welcomed the findings, saying they raised
provocative questions about the need for vigorous action on the
climate.
</P>
<P>
   The strong reaction is largely a function of the major role that
Hansen has played in propelling the greenhouse debate onto the
public stage. In 1981, he was a principal author of one of the
first papers spelling out the links between rising atmospheric
levels of carbon dioxide and rising global temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1988, when a scorching American heat wave was
at its peak and fires were consuming the Amazon, he testified
before a Senate committee that human activities were changing the
climate. He was the first mainstream scientist to make the claim in
a major public forum.
</P>
<P>
   In the new analysis, Hansen and his colleagues culled data and
scientific papers on everything from rice production, which
releases methane, to urban pollution _ a source of ozone and sooty
particles _ to obtain detailed estimates of the rate of change in
different greenhouse emissions.
</P>
<P>
   He then used established formulas for calculating how different
amounts of the gases in the future would affect the inflow of
energy from the sun and escape of heat from the earth _ the balance
that determines whether the planet warms or cools.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's co-authors were Makiko Sato, from Columbia University
and Goddard; Reto Ruedy and Andrew Lacis from Goddard; and Valdar
Oinas from Goddard and Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon dioxide is by far the most abundant greenhouse gas in the
atmosphere. But the other gases that Hansen and his team cite are
more prodigious trappers of heat. Moreover, Hansen said, in
contrast to the difficulties of controlling carbon dioxide,
technologies already exist for capturing or eliminating many of the
other kinds of emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are much more tractable,'' Hansen said, citing as an
example existing systems for capturing methane produced by
decomposing organic material in landfills.
</P>
<P>
   Also, because many of these gases cause serious, costly health
problems or can harm agriculture, there are ``strong economic
reasons for wanting to eliminate them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By cleaning up such emissions, countries can solve two problems
at once, he noted, describing how black carbon particles from
diesel engines and coal-burning power plants can be caught with
filters, eliminating something that both harms people's health and
traps heat in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kevin E. Trenberth, the head of the climate analysis section
at the National Centers for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.,
criticized aspects of the new study, saying that the data could
also be read to make carbon dioxide seem just as important as the
other gases.
</P>
<P>
   But he and several other climate scientists said they agreed
that an initial focus on the other greenhouse gases could achieve
significant slowing of climate warming, as long as carbon dioxide
cuts were also made.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John P. Holdren, a professor of environmental science and
public policy at Harvard University, said any focus on cutting just
one set of gases now would be a mistake. ``This is not an either-or
problem,'' Holdren said. ``It's a both-and problem. We're going to
need all the cuts we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hansen paper has prompted a significant amount of scrambling
on the part of scientists and lobbyists trying to shape the
response to global warming. Several hundred scientists in dozens of
countries are working on final revisions to the latest installment
of a U.N. assessment of climate change.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes as the presidential candidates are being pressed
by private environmental groups to add more detail to their
positions on global warming.
</P>
<P>
   As a senator in the 1980s, Al Gore frequently cited Hansen's
work in calling for global efforts to stave off harmful warming.
Gore played a major role in negotiations in Kyoto, Japan, on the
proposed treaty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the White House said the Kyoto plan was still the best
approach to slowing the warming, adding that it placed equal
emphasis on reducing all the greenhouse gases, largely because of
insistence by U.S. negotiators, including Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Vice President Gore who insisted at Kyoto that the full
basket of greenhouse gases, not just carbon dioxide, be included in
the protocol,'' a White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has said
that the Kyoto proposals were ``inadequate and unfair to the United
States.'' On Friday a spokesman for the Bush campaign, Ray
Sullivan, called the new Hansen paper intriguing, saying, ``This
report seems to indicate that there are still questions to be
answered'' about the causes of and solutions for global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert T. Watson, the chairman of the U.N. Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, said he had received a flurry of phone
calls from other scientists in the last few days expressing concern
that Hansen's study could be misportrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said this could easily be interpreted as the guy who got
Vice President Gore all excited about global warming now saying
everything's fine,'' Watson said, adding: ``If this paper is viewed
that way, it'd be a horrible distortion. If anything, our
projections for warming are higher than they used to be, and we're
seeing discernible changes in ecosystems that we can link back to
climate.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of industries that have sought to limit
restrictions on fossil fuels said the paper poked provocative holes
in the science behind the Kyoto plan and other proposals to stem
warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly seems to be in line with a lot of the people who
say there are a lot of uncertainties out there,'' said Frank
Maisano, a spokesman for the Global Climate Coalition, an
industry-funded group that opposes the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hansen stressed that he still is convinced that
global warming is under way, that people are a significant cause of
it, and that work should be done to cut the rate of change _
perhaps not quite as much work as had been thought.
</P>
<P>
   And there is nothing wrong with a little optimism, he said,
pointing to the global drop in carbon dioxide emissions in the last
two years despite rising prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A key question has been: Can you decouple CO2 emissions and
economic growth?'' he said. ``It's looking like you can.''

DEMOCRATS' AUDIENCE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN GOP'S 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Democrats appeared to be a slightly bigger draw on
television in prime time during their convention this week than
were the Republicans during their convention two weeks earlier. But
the audiences for both events were down overall compared with 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And the Democrats' ratings may have been helped along by the
simple fact that their convention received more minutes of network
coverage in prime time than the Republican event did.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night through Thursday night, the coverage of the
Democratic convention provided by both the cable and broadcast news
outlets in prime time was watched in a combined average of 15.4
million homes, according to data compiled by Nielsen Media
Research. That represented 28 percent of the homes watching
television in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   The television coverage of the four nights of the Republican
convention two weeks earlier was watched in an approximate average
of 14 million homes, or 26 percent of the homes watching television
in prime time that week, according to Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   According to a tally by the research department of NBC News, the
Republican convention received 756 minutes of coverage on the
broadcast networks during prime time. The Democratic convention
received 902 minutes of coverage in prime time, the network said.
Both political parties saw fewer minutes of network attention in
prime time than they did in 1996, when the Democrats were covered
for 991 minutes and the Republicans were covered for 904.
</P>
<P>
   Before the conventions began this year, there was an overall
perception that the television audience would be less interested
than it was in 1996. That, combined with a general sense that the
conventions were staged to the point of becoming less interesting
and newsworthy than in the past, had led news executives to debate
heavily how much coverage they deserved.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Nielsen figures, the difference in convention
viewership between the two years was not at all stark. The
Democratic convention was watched by about 5 percent fewer people
in 2000 than it was 1996. The Republican convention was watched by
about 2 percent fewer people in 2000 than it was in 1996, according
to the Nielsen data.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Friedman, the executive vice president of ABC News, said he
believed that the conventions probably got about the amount of
coverage, and the level of audience, that they deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the way to look at it is that millions of Americans made
the entirely logical conclusion that there is nothing to be decided
and they have several months to make up their minds,'' he said.
``They didn't feel it was necessary to invest time in watching
well-packaged events when they have other ways of making up their
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC's coverage of the 2000 Democratic convention was watched by
four percent more people than was its coverage of the 1996
convention, a clear indication of the strength of its hit game
show, ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire,'' which has raised the
network's overall ratings this year.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the major broadcast and cable outlets covering this
year's Democratic convention, the biggest draw was Al Gore on
Thursday night. The prime-time coverage of his speech accepting the
Democratic nomination for president was watched by about 21.8
million people. According to preliminary statistics, another 3.1
million people watched the prime-time coverage of Gore's speech on
PBS.

SETTING ASIDE FRIENDLY FACE, DEMOCRATS PLOT ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After four days of showing a national television
audience a generally positive look at itself and its candidates,
the Democratic Party turned Friday to how to attack the Republicans
and Gov. George W. Bush on a variety of issues, with a heavy
emphasis on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   At a raucously enthusiastic meeting of the Democratic National
Committee, the party's general chairman, Edward G. Rendell, said,
``This was a nice, upbeat convention, and it was the right thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Rendell denounced Republicans for the ``fraud'' of saying
they were ``inclusive'' and ``compassionate.''
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, he said Bush would replace retiring Supreme Court
justices who supported abortion rights with jurists hostile to
abortion and, ``Very soon, Roe vs. Wade will be voted out.'' Then,
he said, ``Dozens of state legislatures will pass laws prohibiting
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   That warning was seconded by Carol Browner, administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, who got an ovation for telling the
committee, ``As a woman, I don't want anyone telling me what I can
do with my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Dennis Archer of Detroit said a victory by Vice President
Al Gore was necessary to ``preserve a woman's right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other lines of attack suggested, too.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Brazile, Gore's campaign manager, said Bush had nothing to
offer to the ``poor in America without health insurance.'' The Rev.
Jesse Jackson ridiculed Republican efforts to make it appear that
African-Americans were a significant part of their party by using
``workers from concession stands sitting in delegates' seats at the
GOP convention in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said Democrats had to remind voters that while Gore
wanted a prescription drug entitlement under Medicare and available
to all elderly Americans, Bush had a plan that would only cover a
third of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should carry Pennsylvania and Florida on this issue
alone,'' Rendell said.
</P>
<P>
   Browner also hit the prescription drug issue and then attacked
Bush over the environment. She said Houston had become ``the most
polluted city in the country'' because Bush had chosen not to spend
money on the environment, with Texas ranking 49th in environmental
spending per capital.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, calling for efforts to elect Democrats to the House and
Senate, accused Republicans of blocking confirmation of black
judges and for general opposition to affirmative action. He
recalled what he said was the hostility to civil rights of the
Reagan administration's assistant attorney general for civil
rights, William Bradford Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those memories, he said, ``it scares me when people
like George W. Bush and Dick Cheney have every opportunity to
become president and vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   The messages on how to attack the Republicans were interspersed
with instructions to work hard and unite. Jackson said the time was
past for Democrats to fight each other. He said two congressmen who
held a press conference to complain they had not been seen on
television when their state cast its votes on a roll call were
forgetting it was ``Super Bowl time,'' when only Republicans should
be blocked and tackled. He also said Republicans and reporters were
seeking to drive a wedge between Jews and blacks in the party.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that a few blacks may have criticized Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, the vice presidential nominee, and that they had to be
answered, but that they amounted to ``a tree leaf, not a tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, Jackson said, had not kept Jews off national tickets or
out of country clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument about the black-Jewish thing is a diversion,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And every speaker called for all-out efforts. Joe Andrew, the
party's national chairman, urged the committee members to always
``lick an extra envelope, make an extra phone call, pick an extra
pocket.'' Browner urged efforts to get women to vote.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rev. William Smart, a former committee staff member who
now serves as an African Methodist Episcopal minister, offered an
invocation that concluded, ``Lord God, let the Democrats be
elected.''

 &HT;    200 lost individual suit rights, Coke says
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nearly 10 percent of the 2,100 current and former
employees covered by the tentative settlement in the Coca-Cola
racial discrimination case may not be able to file individual
lawsuits if they don't like the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Both Coca-Cola and attorneys for the class of 2,100 said Friday
that 200 former employees essentially forfeited their right to sue
the company in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But an attorney representing four of the eight plaintiffs in the
case said Coke's legal opinion, as well as the opinion of the
attorneys for the class, ``could be suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   And Larry Jones, one of the 200 former employees, said he is
holding a meeting next Thursday with class members to discuss this
``major issue,'' as well as others surrounding the agreement in
principle settling the case.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the settlement in principle, reached two months ago,
are not expected to be announced until late October or early
November, after a final agreement has been reached. The suit
alleges that the company has discriminated against
African-Americans in pay, promotions and performance evaluations.
The company has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Once the agreement is consummated, about 90 percent of the class
will have one of three options:
</P>
<P>
   _ They can accept the settlement;
</P>
<P>
   _ They can ``opt out'' of it and file individual suits for
monetary damages;
</P>
<P>
   _ Or they can challenge the settlement as being unfair.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly 10 percent of the class may not have the right to opt
out, and attorneys say here's why.
</P>
<P>
   The 200 former workers were among the 5,200 employees whose jobs
were eliminated earlier this year when Coke went through a major
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, those 200 had to choose between participating in the
lawsuit or receiving enhanced severance benefits when they left the
company. But Jones and others protested to the company, saying that
was unfair. Also, the legal team representing the class was trying
to overturn the company's policy in court, although the company
prevailed at the lower court level.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola eventually relented and made an exception for this
specific case. The company allowed the 200 workers to get what
amounts to double the normal severance benefits and still
participate in the suit. To accomplish that, the company revised
its waiver form, which the laid-off workers then signed.
</P>
<P>
   The waiver form allows these 200 former employees to receive the
same monetary benefits the other 1,900 class members will.
</P>
<P>
   But both Coke and attorneys for the class said Friday the waiver
essentially prevents the 200 former workers from filing a new
individual suit if they don't like the monetary terms of the
class-action settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We modified the waiver in March to specifically address the
confusion that occurred as a result of the unique circumstances
surrounding the concurrent events of the company's realignment and
the discrimination lawsuit,'' said Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Deutsch.
``As a result, these individuals have already been given the double
benefit of receiving an enhanced severance payment, as well as
participating in the monetary settlement of the lawsuit. They
agreed to the modified waiver, knowingly and with a clear
understanding that they could not sue the company through a
separate lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Class attorney Cyrus Mehri said these individuals face a
``monumental'' uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who took the enhanced severance package last spring is
going to have a very difficult time claiming they still can bring
an individual action,'' Mehri said. ``As we pointed out at the
time, under the terms of the waiver, an individual who accepted
enhanced benefits may be barred entirely from bringing an
individual discrimination claim. On the other hand, as a result of
the modification of the waiver achieved in early March, we
preserved the right of those individuals to reap the monetary
benefits from this class action.''
</P>
<P>
   But attorney Tricia C. K. Hoffler had a different view. She is a
partner in the Florida law firm of Willie Gary, who represents four
plaintiffs in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither Cyrus Mehri or any of the other attorneys for the
class, nor Coca-Cola, should be advising any potential class
members as to whether or not they can opt in or opt out of the
class, according to the judge's order in this case,'' Hoffler said.
``Therefore, they are all in strict violation of the court's orders
and any opinion that they would give could be suspect, as they do
not have authority to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffler's firm does not represent the class, although she said
it has been contacted by numerous individuals ``who hope that the
Gary firm will represent them in the future.''

CHINESE POLICE DETAIN EDITOR'S BROTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (Changes ``Pennsylvania'' to ``Carlisle, Pa.,'' in 4th graf.)  
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The police have detained the younger brother of a
Boston-based poet who was arrested in Beijing last week, apparently
for his involvement in a literary journal that has sometimes
published work by Chinese dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   The poet, Bei Ling, a Chinese citizen with a U.S. green card,
was taken into custody last Saturday during a visit to Beijing. His
younger brother, Huang Feng, 32, also a writer, who lives in
Beijing, was detained Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what charges are being brought against the two
men, although Bei, 40, is being held in criminal detention, which
suggests that the charges may be serious.
</P>
<P>
   It is at least the second time in little over a year that a
Chinese intellectual with permanent residence status in the United
States has been arrested in Beijing. Last summer, Song Yongyi, a
researcher and librarian at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., was
arrested in connection with his studies of the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution, a disastrous and embarrassing period in modern Chinese
history.
</P>
<P>
   An aggressive campaign by U.S. politicians and academics helped
secure his release after six months in detention. Similar forces
seem to be gathering in Bei's defense.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Thursday to promote a major cultural
exchange between China and the United States, the U.S. ambassador,
Joseph Prueher, said of Bei: ``We have officially expressed our
concern to the Chinese government about him. Obviously the issue of
freedom of expression is a core point for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Others noted that if Bei's case is not resolved quickly, it
could prove to be a public relations nightmare for China. Within
the next three weeks both President Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, the
head of China's parliament, will be in New York for a U.N. summit
conference. At the same time, as part of the announced exchange
with the United States, a Chinese cultural exhibit aimed at
enhancing China's image will be touring U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will cause a great deal of embarrassment to a useful
cultural effort if they continue to hold him this way,'' said
Jerome Cohen, a New York lawyer specializing in China law, who
helped secure Song's release. ``They will not want to have
demonstrators protesting outside the Javits Center,'' he said,
referring to the convention center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Bei's arrest, Beijing police confiscated hundreds
of copies of Tendency, the quarterly journal that he edits, which
had apparently been shipped into the country. Tendency, which is
published in the United States, is not legally available in China.
</P>
<P>
   All magazines in China must have a government sponsor that
formally takes responsibility for their content. Foreign magazines
must have permits for import, although many circulate in
intellectual circles, and essays published overseas are often
easily available on the Chinese Internet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bei's journal combines work by both Western and Chinese authors.
The latest issue contains a poem by a Chinese political dissident,
a photograph of the exiled student leader Wang Dan and an essay by
the Irish Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what level of the Chinese bureaucracy was
responsible for Bei's _ or his brother's _ arrest and whether it
was intended to send a larger signal. In high-profile cases,
arrests may be ordered by top officials. But local public security
forces can also act on their own, sometimes to the chagrin of other
government departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when we look into cases, it's not a government plan
but the action of a small entity,'' Prueher said at Thursday's news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at the same press event, Zhao Qizheng _ the information
minister for China's State Council, or Cabinet _ said he was not
aware of the Bei Ling case.

A FAST COUPE THAT GIVES RIVALS A RUN FOR THE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Release for Sunday, August 20) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sporty coupes come and go, but BMW's 3-Series reigns supreme,
deftly deflecting all challengers to its throne. Now Acura has
stepped up, drawn a bull's-eye on the Bimmer and taken aim.
</P>
<P>
   Acura's 3.2 CL, once a slightly fancier, more eccentrically
styled version of the Honda Accord coupe, has been redone for 2001
with more style, size and substance. More important, it now has
enough of a sporty edge, especially the Type S version, to make a
direct challenge to two-door models in BMW's 3-Series.
</P>
<P>
   My Type S test car had a 3.2-liter V-6 specially tuned to
deliver 260 horsepower _ 67 more than the 2000-model BMW 328Ci and
35 more than its 2001-model replacement, the 330Ci. Peak torque of
the front-drive Acura is 232 foot-pounds, compared with 214
foot-pounds for the 2001 BMW. (The regular 3.2 CL, with a milder
version of the same engine, has 225 horsepower.)
</P>
<P>
   The second-generation CL is longer, wider, taller and heavier
than the 328Ci. Compared with the BMW, it has 5 more cubic feet in
the cabin, plus 4 more cubic feet in the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   At the racetrack, the two cars run about even, at just under 7
seconds in 0-to-60 acceleration tests by enthusiast magazine's. But
the 328Ci _ with rear-wheel drive and a perfect front-to-rear
balance of weight _ performed better in handling tests.
</P>
<P>
   But in the battle of the window stickers, Acura has the edge.
The '02 330Ci starts at $35,560, including the delivery charge and
standard features like antilock brakes, traction and stability
control, four air bags and an inflatable head-protection pillow.
But that is just the beginning. A premium package includes leather
upholstery, power sunroof and other items, for $2,900. Add $1,275
for an automatic transmission; $475 for metallic paint, $500 for
heated front seats; $500 for Xenon headlamps; and $675 for an
upgraded Harman-Kardon stereo. Cars at dealerships often wear
prices of $40,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that with the simplified pricing of the 3.2 CL: $28,455
for the regular model and $32,785 for the Type S. There is only one
option, a $2,000 navigation system. Everything else is standard:
the traction and stability systems, a five-speed automatic that can
be manually shifted; heated power seats with leather trim; xenon
headlamps; power sunroof; high-performance tires, even an an air
bag system on the passenger side that detects the size and position
of the occupant.
</P>
<P>
   Acura's navigation system, already one of the best, now comes
with a six-inch color touch-screen and a DVD data base that maps
the entire country on one disk, including more than 3.7 million
suggestions for restaurants, service stations and points of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers tell only part of the story, of course. No matter
how quickly the Acura accelerates or how sporty it feels, purists
will object to its front-drive design and lack of a stick shift.
</P>
<P>
   While the CL does not outshine the BMW on a racetrack, it
handles curves on real roads swiftly and confidently. It moves
quickly but smoothly away from stoplights and excels at high-speed
cruising. Gear changes are nearly imperceptible. The steering is
quick _ so quick that it reminded me of the lightning-fast reflexes
of Honda's S2000 sports car.
</P>
<P>
   While the CL's rigid chassis keeps interior noise low, the growl
of the engine can still be heard. With its firm suspension
settings, the Type S may ride too harshly for Americans accustomed
to luxury cars; my companion wanted to feel more isolated from the
road. But I found the ride comfortable, and I liked the messages I
got through the wheel from the pavement. The CL strikes a nice
balance between luxury ride and high-performance handling.
</P>
<P>
   The CL's styling evolved from a sharply creased design study,
though the look has been toned down for the production car. The
test model, in a shade of orange that Acura calls Sundance gold,
certainly stood out.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the Type S was dressed in tasteful black and gray with
elegant gathered leather upholstery on the seats and doors. The
interior had its quirks, too; instead of wood, the test car had
black and gray plastic trim that looked like slate. I'm still not
sure if I liked it.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of nice touches. The front seats automatically
move forward for easy entry to the rear, which is roomier than most
coupes'. The controls are logically laid out, as they always are in
cars from the Honda family. The gauges have black letters on
off-white faces that have a metallic sheen.
</P>
<P>
   I found the seats to be extremely comfortable, by far the best
ever from Honda. Thick side bolsters hold you in place on hard
turns.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio-built 3.2 CL is not a Bimmer, and it won't win over
BMW's hard-core loyalists. But it is a far better car, in every
respect, than the first-generation CL. And judged on its own
merits, it is an impressive package at a fair price, a Japanese
David with a powerful slingshot and a pretty good bead on Goliath.

<P>
   Faye Landes had some bad news for investors in Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 9, Landes, a research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP;
Co., told shareholders in Amazon, the online retailer, that a
Bernstein-run focus group had found that most Amazon customers
believed that the company sold only books and music. The findings
called into question Amazon's plans to sell big-profit items like
consumer electronics, Landes argued.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she issued Bernstein's first report on Amazon,
saying it would ``underperform'' the market; its stock fell 6
percent. (Amazon disputes Landes' conclusions, saying that sales in
its new product lines will reach $500 million this year.)
</P>
<P>
   But for experienced investors, the way Landes reached her
judgment about Amazon was at least as interesting as the call
itself.
</P>
<P>
   A focus group? Convened by Bernstein? An analyst conducting
original research on a company she covers?
</P>
<P>
   Glory be, glory be.
</P>
<P>
   It is a truth universally acknowledged on Wall Street that
original research is on life support. Serious research can be bad
for business, as well as expensive. The biggest profit center for
investment banks is the hefty fees they charge for underwriting
stock offerings and giving financial advice, and analysts put those
profits at risk if they publish negative conclusions about the
companies that pay the fees.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, many analysts choose to work hand-in-glove with the
companies they cover, designing projections that closely track
internal corporate forecasts. At the same time, they rely on
executives for tidbits of information about sales and new products,
a practice that the Securities and Exchange Commission tried to
limit earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Bernstein. Founded in 1967, the firm, with 1,400
employees, is not a true investment bank. It does not advise on
mergers or serve as a lead underwriter on offerings. Instead,
Bernstein, based in Midtown Manhattan, focuses on managing money _
and offering research to institutional investors, the fund managers
who pay for the reports by sending stock trades and commissions to
Bernstein's trading desk.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bernstein and its fans say, the company does not
face the potential conflicts of interest confronted by analysts at
investment banks like Merrill Lynch and PaineWebber. Its analysts
can spend their time on research, not pitching potential investment
banking clients. And they can report what they find to portfolio
managers without fear of angering those potential banking clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want to do is do research all day long, and that's all
they do here,'' said Landes, who has previously worked for Salomon
Smith Barney and Thomas Weisel Partners. ``Things change when
you're answering to more than one master. Here we only do one
thing. That's the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Berghoef, co-manager of the $1.7 billion Oakmark Select
mutual fund, said that Bernstein's research is usually ``much more
detailed than the typical sell-side research'' and that ``their
work has somewhat more credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Landes' bold call left one question unanswered: What did
Bernstein think of Amazon earlier this year, as the stock lost more
than half its value? Or last year, as Amazon became one of the most
heavily traded and closely watched stocks in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   What did Bernstein think about Amazon? Absolutely nothing,
because Bernstein did not cover the company, or any other Internet
retailer, until Landes started working for the firm in May. And
Internet retailing is not the only market sector where Bernstein
has been absent. With biotechnology companies routinely reporting
scientific breakthroughs, Bernstein has no biotechnology analyst.
Perhaps most surprising, a combination of turnover and slow hiring
has left Bernstein with only three analysts publishing reports on
the high-technology sector, which accounts for one-third of the
market value of all stocks in the United States. Other firms have
dozens of analysts following high technology.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bernstein is at a crossroads as it prepares for life under
Alliance Capital Management, a fund manager based in New York that
agreed in June to buy it for $3.5 billion. Institutional investors
are crying out for good fundamental research on the technology
stocks that drive American stock markets. Bernstein must either
find a way to give it to them _ or watch its prestige and
importance, which has waned as the technology sector has grown,
continue to dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein's research has won acclaim over the years, both for
its willingness to buck convention on the outlook for individual
stocks and for its broad, deep analysis of industry trends.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known stock picks include Gary Black's 1993 prediction
that cigarette pricing would come under pressure. It came months
before Philip Morris slashed prices on Marlboro, its flagship
brand, in a move that caught nearly everyone else by surprise and
caused the company's stock to fall by 22 percent in a day. More
recently, Bernstein analysts have offered contrarian and correct
views on energy stocks and on Qualcomm, which makes software that
runs cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, Bernstein research focuses on important trends
rather than on the day-to-day minutiae of new product announcements
or weekly sales figures. In addition to using secondhand data from
companies, the firm regularly conducts its own focus groups and
surveys to gain exclusive insights on where industries are heading.
Information seekers find the firm's distinctive black-covered
reports pure joy, filled with enough charts to turn anyone who
bothers to read them into experts.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Evans, Bernstein's drug company analyst, surveyed more
than 100 physicians for a March report that predicted that a
crucial new drug from Bristol Myers-Squibb would initially be
prescribed less than expected. In May, Bernstein released its
annual consumer personal computer survey, a 76-page report complete
with 104 charts and graphs, including data on ``PC Extended Service
Plan Attachment Rates by Retailer'' and ``Frequency of Cartridge
Replacement'' for printers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to do pure Wall Street research, Sanford Bernstein
is the only place on Wall Street to work,'' said Steve Galbraith, a
Bernstein veteran who left in June to join Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter as a strategist. ``It's sort of `Revenge of the Nerds' _
incredibly bright people who won through analytical excellence.''

 &HT;    Online grocers gaining customers, but aren't yet packing a
profit
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lynda Reis, who spends more than $180 a week on
groceries for her family, is convinced she saves money using
Webvan.com.
</P>
<P>
   That's because she avoids impulse purchases at the local grocery
store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend less money per week,'' Reis said while inspecting an
order delivered to her home by the online grocer. ``I would have
bought what I didn't need if I went to the store.''
</P>
<P>
   The economics of buying groceries online and having them
delivered to the home may make sense for Reis. The question is
whether they will work for Webvan. While the company has generated
a lot of positive buzz and impressed many customers, it is a long
way from making money.
</P>
<P>
   Like most dot-coms, Webvan has posted a string of losses in the
early going. It is burning through cash and its stock has been
hammered. Shares have fallen 88 percent since their November 1999
high of $34, closing Friday at $4.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Foster City, Calif.-based company is convinced its
model for profitability will work, and it notes that revenue and
customer volume is building fast.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan's profitability model assumes that 120,000 active
customers will order two times a month, with orders averaging $103,
said Bob Okunski, director of investor relations.
</P>
<P>
   The company won't say how close it is to achieving that, but
reported that its average order was $91 for the quarter ended June
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that (average order size) can go higher,'' said
analyst Shawn Milne, with E Offering, an online investment bank in
San Francisco. ``But they're getting closer to where they need to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Those figures include metro Atlanta, San Francisco and
Sacramento, the markets where Webvan operated in June. The Atlanta
service started May 1, and this month the company launched in
Chicago. Other markets will be added this year, including Baltimore
and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Each Webvan division is expected to reach profitability by the
end of its fifth quarter of operation, said Mark San Fratello, a
company spokesman in Suwanee, Ga., where the Atlanta operation is
based.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan's first operating market _ San Francisco _ is in its
fifth quarter. But the company doesn't break out results by
division.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan hopes to turn a profit in Atlanta in November, 2001. So
far, the area's performance is ``ahead'' of where San Francisco had
been during its first three months of operation, San Fratello said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orders per day are more than 1,000,'' he said, without
releasing exact figures.
</P>
<P>
   Milne attributes Webvan's progress in metro Atlanta to the
company ``stepping down the learning curve.'' The company learned
from mistakes made in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were certainly plenty of crushed tomatoes, and
too-little-too-late stories over the first few months of operation
last summer (in San Francisco), but the company claims to have
ironed them out,'' said Evie Black Dykema, an analyst with
Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   One way Milne thinks Webvan can boost its average order size is
by adding more non-grocery products and services. It already stocks
music CDs and recently started offering Harry Potter books.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan's Atlanta division, which employs about 700 people, is
built around a $35 million distribution center in Suwanee. It can
handle 8,000 orders per day, seven days a week at full capacity.
There are eight smaller delivery substations, most in the northern
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The company promises delivery within a half-hour window. To
build volume, it isn't charging for delivery but plans to add a
delivery fee of $4.95 for orders less than $50 starting Sept. 15.
Webvan's grocery prices are about the same as those at big chains.
</P>
<P>
   In the warehouse _ the size of about seven Krogers, or 350,000
square feet _ orders via Webvan.com come in and are picked and
packed into brightly colored totes. Totes make their way around 4
miles of conveyor belts and are packed along the way. Blue totes
hold frozen items, green holds chilled, and yellow holds dry goods.
When orders are completed, the totes are trucked to substations.
</P>
<P>
   The substations store the goods for delivery during two work
shifts: 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. Once loaded, Webvan
trucks make about two deliveries per hour.
</P>
<P>
   While the distribution chain is complex, the company argues it
is far leaner than that of a traditional grocery store. For
instance, one Webvan distribution center can handle product volumes
equivalent to about 18 supermarkets, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do that with almost one-third the labor,'' said
Webvan's Okunski. ``That's where the efficiencies come in.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 8.6 percent of metro Atlanta's population has gone
to the Webvan.com site, according to the latest figures by Media
Metrix, a New York-based research firm that tracks Web site
traffic. The company did not track figures for Webvan.com in San
Francisco or Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Performance is likely better in metro Atlanta because Webvan
agreed to buy HomeGrocer.com for $1.2 billion in stock. Kirkland,
Wash.-based HomeGrocer.com was days from launching in Atlanta when
Webvan gobbled up its would-be competitor. That transaction is
scheduled to close in September.
</P>
<P>
   HomeGrocer.com's sales were $22 million last year, compared with
Webvan's $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan's latest quarterly results beat analysts' expectations,
although the company reported a widened loss of $82 million, for
the three months ended June 30, compared with $23.4 million in the
same period a year earlier. Revenues were $28.3 million, compared
with $383,000 in 1999, not long after Webvan began operations.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Webvan is burning through cash at about $30
million a month as it opens new markets. The company has about $400
million in cash left from its estimated $805 million raised during
its initial public offering last November.
</P>
<P>
   George Shaheen, chief executive officer of Webvan, has told Wall
Street the online grocer has enough money to last through next
June, and plans to raise more money.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe the future for online grocers could lie in
partnerships with established supermarket chains. The big chains
could supply needed capital for the home delivery services, which
in turn would give them access to a burgeoning online grocery
market. Internet research firm Jupiter Communications estimates
online grocery sales will balloon from $200 million last year to
$7.5 billion in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Dutch grocer Royal Ahold NV, which operates the Bi-Lo
chain among others, has taken a $73 million controlling stake in
Skokie, Ill.-based Peapod Inc., which doesn't serve Atlanta.
Safeway Inc. agreed to invest $30 million for half of closely held
GroceryWorks.com, a Texas-based online grocery delivery service.
</P>
<P>
   And Kroger, Winn-Dixie, and Bi-Lo are linked with Priceline.com
for name-your-price groceries that shoppers pay for online but pick
out themselves at selected locations.
</P>
<P>
   Kroger used to be linked in several markets with Peapod, but
that relationship ended with the Ahold investment. Locally, Kroger
worked with OnCart for less than a year until the California-based
company folded in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a model making money,'' said Susie Brower, a
spokeswoman in the Kroger's Atlanta division. ``Being publicly
held, our shareholders want us to be making money. Kroger's
strategy is to stay abreast of developments and see what others are
doing before getting involved.''

 UNDATED: analytical excellence.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bernstein has always prided itself on being different from
larger Wall Street companies. ``Get a copy of our reports and then
look at copies of others, and then see where you've learned
something,'' said Bernstein's president, Roger Hertog.
</P>
<P>
   The firm looks for ``people for whom the pursuit of truth is
important,'' said Marc Mayer, the senior vice president who
oversees Bernstein's research department, at an interview at
Bernstein's headquarters last week.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We want a certain type of personal integrity,
iconoclastic nature, comfort with controversy. Sometimes, he said,
the firm takes itself too seriously. ``At the end of day,'' he
said, ``we're trying to forecast earnings for companies,'' not cure
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Sallie Krawcheck, Bernstein's research director, said, ``The
goal is to think deeply, to be creative, to be thought-provoking.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, those goals mean that Bernstein rarely hires from
other Wall Street firms, preferring to find its analysts in the
industries they will be covering. It is usually slow to hire,
requiring many rounds of interviews. After hiring, it gives new
analysts as long as a year to deepen their knowledge about the
industries before they publish ratings on specific companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bernstein's research department is relatively small
and tightknit. The firm has about 30 analysts covering both
domestic and international stocks, compared with hundreds of
analysts at firms like Goldman, Sachs. That reduces the risk of
turf battles, Krawcheck said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to hire the very best and give them a lot of room,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jaine Mehring, a former Bernstein analyst who now covers the
food industry for Salomon Smith Barney, half-jokingly calls
Bernstein a cult. ``It was a great place to learn to be an analyst,
because you're very protected from other constituencies,'' Mehring
said. ``But it was very enclosed, cloistered in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the firm's strengths, its franchise is under strain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Bernstein's 19 analysts occupied 24 of 529 places in
Institutional Investor magazine's All-America Research Team survey,
an important gauge of sentiment among the money managers who are
the audience for the company's research. While larger investment
banks had more ranked analysts than Bernstein, the firm's ratio of
rankings to analysts _ better than one to one _ was the best on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1999, Bernstein's 18 analysts won only 12 of 429 places
in the magazine's survey, half as many as five years earlier. Four
other firms had a higher percentage.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bernstein has suffered a notable loss of
talent, with several of the firm's best-known analysts leaving for
potentially bigger paydays at other financial firms. Weston Hicks,
a first-teamer for six consecutive years, headed to J.P. Morgan. So
did third-teamer Tod Jacobs, Bernstein's only ranked analyst in
telecommunications or technology. Other recent departure include an
auto analyst, Gary Lapidus; a bank analyst, Moshe Orenbuch, and
Galbraith, who covered consumer companies.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of that much talent would crimp even the largest
research departments on Wall Street. For Bernstein, the departures
have punched noticeable holes in its coverage. Many of the analysts
who remain at the firm focus on staid industries like metals or
savings institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Schutte, who parlayed a stint at Bernstein into a career as
a computer industry analyst at PaineWebber and Goldman, Sachs
before leaving Goldman earlier this year to become a money manager,
said he deeply respects the research that Bernstein produces. But
he does not read it, because it does not focus on the industries he
cares about. ``If they had some more tech analysts, I would
definitely read their stuff,'' Schutte said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein is hardly down for the count. The report by Landes
last week won widespread attention. But at best, Bernstein has
missed an opportunity to meet a growing demand for technology
research. At worst, the firm faces a slow death of its unique
culture, as its best remaining analysts leave for other Wall Street
firms more quickly than Bernstein can train replacements.
</P>
<P>
   To fill holes in its coverage of technology, communications and
health care, Bernstein recently hired four analysts _ one each for
software, computer services, medical-device makers and
international drug companies. It is actively seeking a
biotechnology analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``More tech and more telecom is on the way,'' Krawcheck said.
</P>
<P>
   But hiring analysts will not solve Bernstein's problem, unless
the firm can keep its employees _ old and new _ from jumping to
larger investment banks. Until a couple of years ago, that was not
a problem. Bernstein paid competitively, and its culture appealed
to many analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have half the responsibilities of my colleagues, but I get
paid the same amount,'' said Lisa Shallet, a Bernstein analyst who
covers capital goods companies like Caterpillar. ``I'm never here
at midnight working on the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But in technology and telecommunications, where the fees for
investment banking and underwriting are flooding firms like
Goldman, Sachs, Bernstein is having an increasingly difficult time
paying competitively.
</P>
<P>
   One person who recently left Bernstein for another firm said he
doubled his pay at the new job. In addition, Bernstein has been
stingy in distributing equity to employees. Before the sale to
Alliance Capital, employees said, most of the company was owned by
the chief executive, Lewis Sanders; Hertog; and the estate of the
founder, Zalman Chaim Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly was not and is not an egalitarian partnership a
la Goldman Sachs,'' Shallet said.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance deal might alleviate those complaints. Although
Alliance is controlled by AXA, a diversified French financial
services company, Alliance shares are publicly traded. So the new
Alliance Bernstein would be able to offer Bernstein employees stock
options comparable to those of other publicly traded companies _ if
it chose to do so. An AXA spokesman declined to comment on his
company's plans for Bernstein, noting that the takeover would not
be completed until the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bernstein can pay its analysts competitively, it may
face a more subtle problem in analyzing biotechnology and other
fast-changing sectors. In those industries, investment bankers
often see companies before analysts do, because the young companies
come to them to raise money. That gives analysts at full-service
investment banks a source of information that Bernstein researchers
do not have, said Jacobs, the former Bernstein telecommunications
analyst who is now J.P. Morgan's telecommunications strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein analysts do not cover small new companies, which are
important in fast-growing industries. ``In an area like telecom,
you miss too much of what's going on if you just cover large-cap
companies,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Vadim Zlotnikov, Bernstein's top technology analyst, said his
firm keeps smaller technology companies on its radar screen. But he
added that Bernstein's priority is covering large firms, both
because many small companies do not survive and because big
institutional investors are much more interested in coverage of
large companies where they can make big bets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get paid to follow the smallest of the small guys,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein must also adapt to the fact that Wall Street's
attention span is shorter than ever. Each day, newspapers report
mutual fund prices, giving investors an instant score card on their
funds' performance. And a year or two of bad performance can
destroy even hedge-fund managers with decades of success, like
Julian H. Robertson Jr. of Tiger Management. The resulting
short-term attitude of managers plays to the strengths of analysts
who follow every tick of a company's sales, rather than to
Bernstein's traditional focus on the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent defections and Bernstein's slippage in
Institutional Investor, Krawcheck says the firm's future is
brighter than ever. Bernstein's new analysts will bring the firm's
intellectual rigor to technology, where analysis independent of
investment banking relationships is at a premium, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A new SEC rule that requires companies to disclose sensitive
information more freely would also help Bernstein, by preventing
companies from offering extra information to favored analysts,
Krawcheck said. In that environment, she added, Bernstein's
proprietary studies and research would stand out even more.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she said, Bernstein plans to increase its use of focus
groups, surveys and other proprietary research, and the firm is
well aware that it must offer investors insights into both
long-term trends and short-term trading opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of doing the stuff that we do has just increased,''
Krawcheck said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LA CROSSE, Wis. _ Vice President Al Gore and Sen. Joe Lieberman
took to the Mississippi Friday, weaving the river's epic symbolism
into a populist challenge against the political influence of oil
corporations, health maintenance organizations and drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   Before boarding the Mark Twain riverboat for a four-day,
390-mile journey down the Mississippi, Gore stood at the riverbank
here and promised, as he had done Thursday night in accepting the
Democratic presidential nomination in Los Angeles, to make campaign
finance reform his first legislative priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reform measure is important because now the wealthy and
powerful special interests have too much of an ability to stop good
things,'' he told a crowd of roughly 5,000 people. Why, he asked,
hasn't Congress increased the minimum wage, or passed legislation
to provide free prescription drugs to the elderly? Why, he asked,
are ``bean counters'' at health insurance companies allowed to
``play God'' and overrule the judgments of doctors? In each case,
he argued, action was blocked by corporate influence bought with
huge campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just morally wrong,'' he said, speaking of elderly
people who cut back on groceries to pay for drugs ``when the drug
companies have the highest profits of any industry.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate that this is a ticket of mainstream values _ and
perhaps to erase images of this week's Hollywood hobnobbing _ the
campaign is traveling down the Mississippi on a quaint 120-foot
paddle boat draped with red, white and blue bunting. At Friday's
kickoff event in La Crosse, a Mark Twain look-alike actor took the
stage to impart some homespun Twainisms. The La Crosse Coulee
Chordsmen sang barbershop harmonies, and a high school marching
band, the Onalaska Hilltoppers, played ``God Bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman, along with their wives and several family
members, boarded the Mark Twain to a blast from the boat's air horn
and a final spray of confetti. As the riverboat pushed off, Gore
and Lieberman stood at the stern, positioned just under an American
flag for the photographers, and waved to the crowds on the banks.
``We love you!'' Lieberman yelled, and many in the crowd hollered
their encouragement right back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give 'em hell, Al!'' one man called out, and all along the
roads that connect the small river towns on this part of the
Mississippi, hundreds of people stopped their cars to wave and gawk
and snap pictures. At one point Friday afternoon, as Gore and
Lieberman led a somewhat stilted group discussion about Medicare on
the riverboat's top deck, faint voices could be heard calling out
from the distant riverbank. ``Hi!'' Lieberman called back. ``Are
there real people out there?''
</P>
<P>
   And Gore, mindful of the beating sun, said that he and Lieberman
had been admonished by their wives to wear sunscreen. ``If any of
you did not put sunscreen on, we have some available,'' he offered,
adding that Sen. John McCain, undergoing treatment for malignant
melanoma, was in his prayers.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Gore returned to his aggressive criticism of the drug
industry and health insurers, accusing them of reaping profits and
hurting ``working families'' by erecting ``a mighty wall of
resistance'' to prescription drug benefits and a patients' bill of
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was joined in La Crosse by Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis.,
who as a sponsor of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform
bill is one of the Senate's loudest advocates for eliminating
unlimited, unregulated donations from corporations and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the populist fire, neither Gore nor Lieberman
mentioned the millions of dollars the Democratic Party raised in
Los Angeles this week, much of that from major corporations. Nor
did Gore mention his own prodigious fund-raising in the 1996
campaign, when he made dozens of telephone calls to corporate
executives to solicit five-figure donations.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally Friday in Memphis, Tenn., the Republican nominee,
George W. Bush, charged that Gore is ``a little short on
credibility'' when it comes to campaign finance reform, and he
accused Gore of conducting ``class warfare'' for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore largely avoided direct criticism of Bush on Friday. He
called Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, ``honorable men,''
but then went on to suggest that their campaign was more about show
than substance. ``I hope in the next 2 1/2 months we can shift the
focus away from sound bites and images,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Lieberman showed the effects of an exhausting week
in Los Angeles. When the riverboat came upon a high school marching
band waiting on the banks, Gore called over the public address
system for them to play ``On Wisconsin,'' not realizing he was
addressing Lansing, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates were having trouble with their voices, which
were noticeably hoarse from speechmaking and lack of sleep. Gore
sucked on lozenges, and Lieberman planned to get some extra rest
after disembarking from the riverboat Friday evening to observe the
Sabbath. He is expected to rejoin Gore on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore joked that he had taken extra rations of Diet Coke, and he
was clearly determined to build from the momentum generated this
week in Los Angeles. The candidates and their families flew out of
Los Angeles long after midnight and landed here shortly after
sunrise. They had time only to shower and change clothes before
setting out for the river.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gore is a fan of using metaphors to communicate big ideas, and
so naturally he and his aides missed no opportunity Friday to turn
his river excursion into a traveling parable of broad campaign
themes.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman evoked the river as an age-old symbol of journey. ``It
has been a great thrill to be here on the banks of the Mississippi
as we begin a journey across America, down this great American
river which has inspired the American imagination and American
dreams,'' Lieberman said. ``And that's what this ticket is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, of course, old-fashioned political calculation behind
the trip. The itinerary began in Wisconsin, a state long a hotbed
of populist politics, and will take Gore and Lieberman through
several important battleground states. Riverbank rallies are
planned in Dubuque, Iowa, and Moline, Ill., as well as Hannibal,
Mo., the birthplace of Mark Twain. Lieberman will not be at the
Dubuque rally.
</P>
<P>
   `We're going to touch a lot of important communities in key
states that often end up deciding presidential elections, and we're
going to have a good time in the process,'' Gore said. And as if to
prove the point, he and his wife, Tipper, took turns Friday
steering the riverboat.
</P>
<P>
   Told by reporters Friday that some postconvention polls now
showed him holding a slight edge over Bush, Gore played it cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put much stock in the polls, although they seem to be
gaining in relevancy,'' he said, tongue in cheek. He nonetheless
pronounced himself pleased with his speech Thursday night _ ``I had
a good time'' _ and Lieberman offered the opinion that Gore had
delivered the finest convention speech he had ever heard.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's daughter Karenna Gore Schiff spoke proudly of the long,
lingering kiss her father planted on her mother moments before his
address.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like that,'' Schiff told reporters on the riverboat.
``There it is. It's out there. Some people my think it's a bit
racy, but I'm used to it.''

U.S. DELAYS ASYLUM HEARING FOR CHINESE SECT LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Immigration officials have delayed until next month
a decision on whether to grant asylum to the leader of a Chinese
spiritual movement after Chinese officials appealed for his return
and submitted detailed charges that he raped followers, people
involved in the case say.
</P>
<P>
   The movement's leader, Zhang Hongbao, has been held in detention
in Guam since January after arriving in the U.S. territory carrying
a false passport, the people said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Beijing outlawed Zhong Gong, the quasi-religious
group that Zhang founded in 1987, along with several other groups
that practice the Chinese meditation and exercise regimen known as
qigong.
</P>
<P>
   While human rights groups say that Zhang has a strong claim to
asylum, U.S. officials now have the delicate task of assessing the
credibility of the Chinese charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese authorities recently provided U.S. officials with a
list of alleged crimes, specifying dates and places and including
testimony from followers who say that Zhang sexually assaulted
them, people who were told of the charges said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States recently has tried to elevate cooperation with
the Chinese police to fight international drug trafficking, making
it difficult to dismiss Beijing's allegations without investigating
them. Zhang's group has attracted little international attention
and does not fit common definitions of a political or religious
movement.
</P>
<P>
   China in the past has brought charges of rape against people
whom it considers seditious, and U.S. officials and human rights
groups say the charges have in some cases proved unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials requested that an asylum hearing that had
been scheduled for Friday be postponed until U.S. officials weigh
the validity of the rape charges. A new hearing is set for early
September.
</P>
<P>
   The delay came shortly after Yan Qingxin, who says she is the
No. 2 leader of Zhong Gong, was granted asylum. Yan, who is now in
Washington seeking to generate support for Zhang, said she and
Zhang arrived in Guam early this year to escape a Chinese dragnet
and were thrown into detention with suspected smugglers. They
waited six months to have their case heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to America because we thought that this country
protects human rights,'' Yan said in an interview. ``But we are
deeply disappointed to find that American courts do not treat such
cases with urgency. I also fear that American officials are subject
to pressure from the Chinese government.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and State Department officials said they do not
comment on individual asylum cases. People involved in the case
said the State Department was preparing an advisory opinion
criticizing Beijing's suppression of Zhong Gong as politically
motivated and noting the risk to Zhang if he returns to China.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   China began a crackdown on spiritual groups a year ago after
followers of Falun Gong, another qigong group, organized a
demonstration outside the Chinese leadership compound in Beijing.
The authorities then banned Falun Gong and Zhong Gong, which are
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Falun Gong, which operates through autonomous cells with
no clear hierarchy, Zhong Gong established an extensive
organization with schools, healing centers, factories and printing
houses.
</P>
<P>
   People who have studied the movement say it raised millions of
dollars from school fees and the sale of medical goods, books and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang tailored his teachings to the needs of China's poorest
people. He said those who practiced Zhong Gong could fight cancer
and heart disease more effectively than they could by taking drugs
or undergoing surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Zhong Gong also says its leading practitioners have paranormal
powers, including a ``thousand-mile eye'' that works like an X-ray
and a telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang first went into hiding in 1994 after criticism of his
group grew. Yan said Zhang decided to seek asylum in the United
States late last year after the Chinese authorities shut down Zhong
Gong's schools and healing centers and detained staff members. She
called the charges against Zhang ``sheer fabrication.''

AN ANTIDOTE FOR KITTY'S BAD ENERGY
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Are you doing enough for your cat?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chances are you are not. At least according to your cat. To say
that cats are a little demanding is like saying Charlton Heston is
a little bit pro-gun.
</P>
<P>
   If your cat is acting aloof, indifferent or standoffish, it
could be because you have not maximized its energy streams. (More
likely it is acting that way because it is a cat, but for the sake
of argument, let's go with the energy streams.)
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there is a book to help you. Actually, three books.
(Some of you may wonder why it takes only one book to lay out the
framework of Judeo-Christian thought and three books to explain why
a cat is most content sitting on your head. I cannot answer this,
other than to suggest that there were not as many publishing
companies in Moses' day as there are now.)
</P>
<P>
   They are: ``Feng Shui for You and Your Cat'' by Alison Daniels;
``Feng Shui for Cats: By Cats, for Cats'' by Roni Jay and, simply,
``Feng Shui for Cats'' by Chris Riddell.
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui is defined as a way of manipulating your environment
in order to enhance the health, happiness and wealth of people who
write feng shui books. A cat is defined as something that doesn't
give a fig one way or the other. (The same could be said of voters
in this year's presidential election, which just goes to show how
powerful misaligned cat feng-shui can be. Instead of holding
conventions, the candidates might be better off giving each voter a
rubber mouse with a bell in it or a scratching post.)
</P>
<P>
   Daniels says her book shows ``how to maximize the strengths and
minimize the weaknesses of a house's space so that the cat and
owner never again need fight for that favorite patch of sofa.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how many cat owners fight with their cat over
control of the sofa. My guess is that the first fight is the last
fight and that it is a brief but exceedingly bloody affair at the
end of which the cat curls up for a nap on its favorite patch of
sofa while the owner, with his one good eye, frantically searches
the medicine cabinet for gauze pads and iodine.
</P>
<P>
   Even more ominously, Jay says her book shows ``how to manipulate
your human into maximizing the chi energy in your environment.''
</P>
<P>
   This conjures a chilling ``Village of the Damned''-type scenario
in which the cats, who were conceived by aliens, shoot hypnotic
beams of light from their eyes, compelling the humans, against
their will, to let the cats sit on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   If I were a cat owner, I would be afraid to alter my home
environment in the slightest, up to and including vacuuming and
dusting _ especially vacuuming and dusting _ lest my cat become so
charged with positive chi that I couldn't touch it without getting
shocked.
</P>
<P>
   (While it might be nice, for awhile, to own a cat that doubles
as a bug zapper, you've got to think the advantages of an
insect-free home would be outweighed by the constant, irritating
glare.)
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that cats acquire precisely as much positive chi as
they want, when they want, with or without the assistance or
consent of humans, especially human authors. Any attempt to funnel
more positive chi in the cat's direction is simply asking for
trouble of the sort one normally associates with sofa disputes,
with the added threat of electrocution.
</P>
<P>
   Cats barely tolerate humans as it is. Let's not push our luck.

CUBA'S OBJECTIONS STING DEFECTORS PLANNING TO COMPETE FOR OTHER
COUNTRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Spain)   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Angel Perez sneaked away with two friends from an altitude
training center in Mexico City seven years ago, catching a bus to
the Texas border, swimming across the Rio Grande and taking a
waiting car to Miami, he thought he was free forever of the control
of Cuban sports officials.
</P>
<P>
   Competing for Cuba, Perez was a gold medalist in kayaking at the
1991 Pan American Games in Havana. He also represented Cuba in the
1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. But, dispirited about his
personal future after athletics, he defected to the United States a
year later, arriving in Miami with $60 in savings and no immediate
hope of continuing his kayaking career. Instead, he took a job
installing security alarms.
</P>
<P>
   After several years away from serious competition, Perez
returned to his sport and rose through the U.S. ranks. He became a
U.S. citizen on Sept. 25, 1999, shortly after qualifying in a
four-man kayak for the 2000 Summer Games next month in Sydney,
Australia. He hoped his boat would contend for a medal.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, however, Cuba still has a strong and unyielding
grip on his athletic career.
</P>
<P>
   Having suffered the defection or departure of an estimated 100
athletes in recent years, outraged Cuban sports officials are
reacting against what they consider to be the theft of runners,
jumpers and boxers they have trained. The Cuban Olympic Committee
has refused to let Perez compete for the United States in Sydney
and has similarly refused to allow the world-champion long jumper
Niurka Montalvo to compete in the Summer Games for Spain, her
adopted country.
</P>
<P>
   This week the contentiousness reached a new level when Cuba
removed a group of 30 of its athletes who were training under a
reciprocal agreement in Spain. Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of
the International Olympic Committee, said that only diplomats, not
sportsmen, could resolve the heated matter between the two
countries. The U.S. Olympic Committee said Friday that it would
petition the IOC for relief from its eligibility rules so that
Perez could compete in Sydney, even over Cuba's objections.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's refusal in the two high-profile cases falls within the
rules governing the IOC, whose charter states that an athlete who
switches nationalities must wait three years to compete for the new
country. Neither Perez nor Montalvo, who became a Spanish citizen
last year, meet that requirement. The rule is meant to prevent
athletes from changing nationalities for convenience. Frequently,
waivers are granted in the spirit of international cooperation.
Last week China waived the rule so that Yueling Chen, a former
Olympic champion race-walker, could compete in Sydney for the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba, however, remains adamant in its refusal. ``It is
absolutely unfair that the rich countries _ based on their economic
capacity, offers of scholarships or gifts, conditions of life and
other elements _ take away the sporting talents of the poor
nations, just as they rob the scientific brains,'' Jose Ramon
Fernandez, the president of the Cuban Olympic Committee, said in
remarks carried last week in the state-controlled newspaper Granma.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent last March to the USOC declining Perez's
request to compete for the United States, Fernandez wrote, ``Taking
into consideration the rejection of our athletics, and also the
fact that the people of Cuba generate the funds and other resources
for the preparation of our athletes and provide training
facilities, education, medical services and meals at no charge, it
was unseemly for Perez to have abandoned our delegation in the
surreptitious manner in which he did, after having reached a high
level of ability in his sport.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday in Madrid, Alberto Juantorena, the
head of Cuba's track and field federation, accused Montalvo of
``abandoning'' her homeland to marry a Spaniard. Montalvo competed
in the long jump for Cuba in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, but has
lived in Spain the last three years. She won the 1999 world
championship for Spain. Her absence in Sydney could remove a hurdle
from Marion Jones' attempt to win five gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are the Cuban people supposed to feel?'' said Juantorena,
who won the 400- and 800-meter races at the 1976 Summer Olympics in
Montreal. ``They have supported her training for 16 years so she
can compete under another flag.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Cuba develops talent. It doesn't rob talent. This is
a trafficking of people. Of skin, of muscle, of bone.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month Bill Hybl, the president of the USOC, traveled to
Havana to plead Perez's case. The Cubans were cordial, Hybl said,
but they declined to grant the kayaker a waiver. On Aug. 28, Hybl
said Friday, the USOC will petition the IOC's executive board,
arguing that Perez's self-determination should prevail. The case
could also be brought before the International Court of Arbitration
for Sport in Sydney, Hybl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't recruit him,'' Hybl said of Perez. ``He came to this
country on his own volition, trained on his own, married on his
own, had a child on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has been reluctant to intervene in such cases. Unless
the USOC can show that the rule does not apply to Perez, ``the IOC
will not get involved,'' said Franklin Servan-Schreiber, an IOC
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Perez, who is 29, continues to train with his
teammates in Mammoth, Calif., hoping that somehow his participation
in Sydney will be approved. In a telephone interview, Perez said
the Cubans were using Montalvo and himself for propaganda purposes,
trying to send a threatening signal to those who might be
considering defection. He also said that U.S. kayaking officials
never alerted him to the Olympic eligibility rules until Cuba
denied him in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are playing a political game,'' Perez said of the Cubans.
``They like to be in the news of the world. It makes them feel they
are in control of something. They are trying to make an example of
me. It's amazing. Seven years I have been out of Cuba, but they
still have control of me.''

ICAHN BUILDING STAKE IN GM, WHICH FEELS PRESSURE TO DIVEST HUGHES 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ One of the most famous corporate raiders of the 1980s
and '90s, Carl Icahn, has begun accumulating a stake in General
Motors, the world's largest company, in a move that will increase
pressure on the automaker to spin off its most valuable asset,
Hughes Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn sent GM a short letter on Wednesday describing his
intention to buy at least $15 million of the automaker's stock and
up to 15 percent of the company's outstanding shares, GM said in a
statement Friday morning. Federal antitrust laws require people who
want to be active investors in publicly traded companies to provide
notification if they begin acquiring stakes in this range.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn has considerable resources for his latest foray: He led a
group of investors earlier this year that forced the sale of
Nabisco Group Holdings, pocketing a $600 million profit on an
investment of roughly $400 million. While GM may be immense _ its
sales of $176.6 billion last year exceeded those of any other
company _ the total value of its outstanding shares was just $36
billion at the close of trading on Thursday, a reflection of the
company's many troubles in the North American auto market.
</P>
<P>
   GM's shares leaped $3 Friday after disclosure of Icahn's stake,
raising the value of the company's stock to $39.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Toni Simonetti, a GM spokeswoman, said that the company's board
had been convened for a briefing on Icahn's interest. Simonetti
declined to identify the executive who spoke to Icahn or provide
any details on the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Harry Pearce, GM's powerful vice chairman and former general
counsel, spoke with Icahn briefly on Thursday. Pearce oversees GM's
stake in Hughes and typically handles big issues involving the
company's financial strategy. Pearce declined to comment, while
Icahn did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   GM owns all of Hughes Electronics' assets and owns 43 percent of
a tracking stock, the H Class of GM shares. Holders of the tracking
stock share in the earnings of Hughes without owning the underlying
assets. There have been repeated rumors this year that a big
investor might try to buy GM to take control of Hughes, which owns
DirecTV, the nation's most successful provider of satellite
television.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Smith Jr., the chairman of GM, pointed out in January
that any hostile bidder for the automaker who really wanted to
acquire Hughes would find this tough to achieve, because GM could
always spin off Hughes if a takeover seemed imminent. Pearce, also
a board member, said last December that, ``I seriously doubt the
board is seriously worried that someone is going to acquire General
Motors.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said in the GM statement Friday that the company would
continue its previously announced, $1.4 billion share buyback
program and would continue to review what to do with the company's
stake in Hughes. GM repurchased 14 percent of its own shares by
paying stockholders in Hughes tracking stock, the latest in a
series of GM disposals of the tracking stock.
</P>
<P>
   GM executives have been reluctant to surrender control of Hughes
because they see the automaker's future lying increasingly in the
provision of high-profit services to people in cars and light
trucks. The GM Onstar system for vehicles, which provides
everything from navigational assistance to the location of hotels
and restaurants, is already the leader in the auto industry,
prompting Japanese rivals to consider adopting it. Ford Motor Co.
recently announced plans to create a rival system with Qualcomm,
the high-technology company based in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   GM's problem is that Wall Street has been skeptical that
high-technology services can ever play much of a role in a company
as gigantic as GM.
</P>
<P>
   G. Richard Wagoner Jr., GM's chief executive, told reporters at
a conference two weeks ago in Traverse City that GM would like such
services to account for as much as a quarter of the company's
revenue someday, but said that this would be difficult because the
company sells so many cars and trucks. A high-technology division
accounting for a quarter of GM's revenue would need twice the
annual sales of Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors have been wary of holding an auto stock
and impatient for GM to spin off its stake in Hughes to them
instead. ``They all have their eyes on this,'' said Seth
Glickenhaus, a senior partner at Glickenhaus &AMP; Co., a New York
money management firm that holds a small stake in GM.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   GM is buying back stock now in part to offset the recent
issuance of 5 percent of its stock to Fiat, in exchange for 20
percent of the Italian company's carmaking unit. Fiat is widely
expected to vote the GM stock to support current management in any
disputes because Fiat and GM are developing small cars together.
</P>
<P>
   Any hostile bid for GM would also be likely to encounter strong
resistance from the politically influential United Automobile
Workers union, which had no comment Friday. Although the UAW signed
a four-year contract with GM last year and the Canadian Auto
Workers union signed a three-year contract with GM last year,
either union could go on strike if a hostile takeover looked as if
it might hurt their workers.
</P>
<P>
   While Canadian labor laws bar work stoppages during a labor
contract, Basil Hargrove, the president of the Canadian union, said
in an interview that he would not let this stop him from calling a
strike, particularly if it looked like Icahn were going to buy GM
and sell any Canadian factories to help pay for the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn is best known as a former chairman of Trans World
Airlines. GM once owned indirectly a large stake in TWA but sold it
in 1935.

NORTH POLAR ICE HAS MELTED, SAY RECENT VISITORS

<TEXT>
<P>
   The North Pole is melting.
</P>
<P>
   The thick ice that has for ages covered the Arctic Ocean at the
pole has turned to water, recent visitors there reported Friday. At
least for the time being, an ice-free patch of ocean about a mile
wide has opened at the very top of the world, something that has
presumably never before been seen by human beings and is more
evidence that global warming may be real and already affecting
climate.
</P>
<P>
   The last time scientists can be certain the pole was awash in
water was more than 50 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally unexpected,'' said Dr. James J. McCarthy, an
oceanographer, director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at
Harvard University and the co-leader of a group working for the
United Nations-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The panel is studying the potential environmental and economic
consequences of marked climate change.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy was a lecturer on a tourist cruise in the Arctic aboard
a Russian icebreaker earlier this month. On a similar Arctic cruise
six years ago, he recalled, the icebreaker plowed through an icecap
6 to 9 feet thick at the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   This time, ice was generally so thin that sunlight could
penetrate and support concentrations of plankton growing under the
ice. McCarthy said the Russian captain of the icebreaker, who has
made the voyage 10 times in recent years, said he had never before
encountered open water at the pole.
</P>
<P>
   Another lecturer, Dr. Malcolm C. McKenna, a paleontologist at
the American Museum of Natural History in New York, said the ship,
the Yamal, crunched through miles of unusually thin ice and
intermittent open water on the approach from Spitsbergen, Norway,
to the pole. When the ship reached the pole _ which McKenna and his
wife, Priscilla, confirmed with a hand-held Global Positioning
System navigation device _ water lapped its bow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anybody in history ever got to 90 degrees
north to be greeted by water, not ice,'' McKenna said in an
interview. He instantly snapped pictures to document the phenomenon
in photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yamal eventually had to steam six miles away to find ice
thick enough for the 100 passengers to get out and be able to say
they had stood on the North Pole, or close to it. They saw ivory
gulls flying overhead, the first time ornithologists said they had
ever been sighted at the pole.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last century, the average surface temperature of the
globe has risen by about 1 degree Fahrenheit, and the rate of
warming has accelerated in the last quarter century. (That's a
significant amount, considering that the world is only 5 to 9
degrees warmer now than it was in the last ice age, 18,000 to
20,000 years ago.) Scientists and policy makers are still arguing
about whether this is a natural fluctuation or an effect of
industrial society's releasing heat-trapping gasses into the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some folks who pooh-pooh global warming might wake up if shown
that even the pole is beginning to melt at least sometimes, as in
the Eocene,'' McKenna added.
</P>
<P>
   The Eocene was the geological period when the world's climate
grew significantly warmer. Around 55 million years ago, according
to sedimentary and fossil evidence, tropical vegetation spread
inside the Arctic and Antarctic circles. Water and jungles
dominated the polar environments, and in the generally warm world,
mammals for the first time grew in number, size and diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies of satellite and submarine observations have
seemed to establish a warming trend in the northern polar region
and raise the possibility of a melting icecap.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Goddard Space Science Institute, a NASA
research center in New York, compared data collected by submarines
in the 1950s and '60s with '90s observations, demonstrating that
the ice cover over the entire Arctic basin has thinned by 45
percent. Satellite images have revealed that the extent of ice
coverage has significantly shrunk in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said that he would report the Yamal's encounter with
open polar water to environmental scientists and consult other
scientists to see if new satellite remote-sensing data have
detected the extent of the melting ice.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the reaction of passengers when they saw an iceless
North Pole, McCarthy said: ``There was a sense of alarm. Global
warming was real, and we were seeing its effects for the first time
that far north.''
</P>
<P>
   In their models of climate patterns, scientists have long
suggested that the northern polar region would be affected earlier
and more seriously than the southern region.
</P>
<P>
   They said the greater expanse of land in the northern hemisphere
should respond more rapidly to temperature change, presumably
leading to marked climate change.

 &HT;    Tigers' Leard has high hopes
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ ``That which doesn't kill us makes us stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Leard has heard the expression. He doesn't know who wrote
it, but he figures it must have been a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough,'' said Leard. ``But everything I've gone
through has made me a better football player. And I know it's made
me a better person.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, life could not be better for the Auburn quarterback.
Last week, he donned a cap and gown and marched down the aisle to
receive his degree in mass communications. This fall, he will be
the first Tigers quarterback to play as a graduate student. He will
also be able to take a light academic load, freeing most of his
time to concentrate on his final college football season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to live in the film room,'' he laughed. ``Just move
me a cot in there.''
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER TRIUMPH IN ATHENS
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, Leard got engaged to Melanie King, his high school
sweetheart, who is a student at Georgia. It was his second big
triumph in Athens. In November, Leard played the game of his life
and torched the Bulldogs for 416 yards passing in a 38-21 win in
Sanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, and she agreed to marry me anyway,'' Leard said.
</P>
<P>
   He laughs because football is fun again. In his four years at
Auburn he has been beaten, battered, taunted, ridiculed, ignored
and, finally, given up for lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm still here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After serving a two-year apprenticeship under Dameyune Craig,
Leard became the starter as a sophomore in 1998. He struggled
early. By the fifth game, he had lost his starting job to freshman
Gabe Gross and did not play in the final five games. After the
season, he had surgery to correct a bulging disk in his back.
</P>
<P>
   In the the first game of the 1999 season against Appalachian
State, Leard came off the bench to throw a 33-yard touchdown pass
with 38 seconds left to win the game. Leard reclaimed the starting
job, and by the fourth game he was playing so well that Gross quit
to concentrate on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn was 3-0 when Ole Miss came to town on Sept. 25. Leard was
picking the Rebels' defense apart, completing 14 of his first 17
passes when he was hit and suffered a separated shoulder. Auburn
lost in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   He sat out the next three games, all Auburn losses, and tried to
come back in the eighth game against Arkansas. He completed five of
his first eight passes, but then was knocked unconscious. It was
the fourth concussion of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Leard missed the next game against Central Florida. Then, on
Nov. 13, before more than 40 friends and family members, he
completed 24 of 32 passes against a thoroughly confused Georgia
defense. Auburn won 38-21. ``Along with the Appalachian State game,
it was the best football moment of my life,'' said Leard.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Leard is the elder statesman of the Auburn football team.
He is comfortable in the offensive system of coordinator Noel
Mazzone and has more weapons to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that Ben's the leader of this offense,''
Mazzone said. ``He's proven he can get it done at this level. The
other guys listen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   PIQUING NFL INTEREST
</P>
<P>
   Given his poise and clear-headedness under fire, the NFL is
starting to take a second look. One Internet site has him projected
as a pick in the first round of next year's NFL Draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben's a big guy (6-4, 225 pounds), and he makes the right
decisions because he is so well-prepared,'' Auburn head coach Tommy
Tuberville said. ``Because he's so smart, I see him as a guy who
could be in the league for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk about pro football is heady stuff for a guy who was
once ``all dried up,'' according to a letter he received from one
fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love that opportunity, but right now I just want to
concentrate on my last college season,'' he said. ``If this is
going to be it for me, I want to give it everything I've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn might not win the SEC West, but Leard is convinced that
this collection of players is capable of going to a bowl, which
would be the Tigers' first since 1997. Auburn must find a running
game, which was nonexistent last season. Running back Rudi Johnson,
a junior-college transfer, will help. Leard has a great collection
of receivers, led by sophomore Ronney Daniels and freshman Deandre
Green. If a couple of junior-college transfers come through at
tackle, the defense should be stout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may not be a BCS team, but we want to lay the groundwork
for the future,'' Leard said. ``Someday, when Auburn is back in the
national spotlight, people will say that those guys in 2000 were
the ones who got it started.

IN DENVER, FOUR INDEPENDENTS SIZE UP GORE 
</HEADLINE>

   DENVER _ Roy Rosa watched television images of Democratic
conventioneers whirling like dervishes after Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., finished his speech on Tuesday night, and asked, ``Don't
these people realize they're going to lose?''
</P>
<P>
   Rosa, a college student, joined three other independent voters
in a hotel room here earlier this week to view the convention,
cracking jokes at the proceedings and matching notes on what did or
did not work about the carefully orchestrated series of speeches
presented by the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the convention's rhetoric, they agreed, seemed intended
to attract independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa is perhaps a typical independent voter. A member of both
the National Rifle Association and the board of the national Gay
and Lesbian Task Force, he supported Sen. John McCain's
presidential bid. Like the three others watching the convention in
the hotel room, he viewed it with an open, if skeptical, mind.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four had supported President Clinton when he first
ran for the White House in 1992; two had even done volunteer work
in his campaign. But none of them voted for Clinton in 1996, and
not one would support him if he were running today, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the lying and duplicity just bugged me with Clinton,''
said Sarah Edgell, a 42-year old graphic designer who voted for
Ross Perot in 1996 as a protest against the president. ``He is such
a complex man. He can seem so honest and then be such a liar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't trust him then and I don't trust him now,'' said
Jeanne Smith, 29, an administrator for the University of Colorado's
Health Science Center.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Keith, a senior officer with the American Indian
College Fund, said that after feeling initial enthusiasm for the
Clinton administration, he had become progressively disenchanted
with the Democrats over their handling of Indian issues.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not mean he was willing to leap to the Republicans.
``George Bush doesn't understand Indian affairs,'' said Smith, a
Navajo. ``You can't believe the ignorance of the man on Indian
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into the convention, he had been leaning toward Vice
President Al Gore, as was Edgell; Smith hadn't made up her mind yet
and Rosa, 22, planned to vote for Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   The dishing started almost immediately as Hillary Rodham Clinton
took the convention stage Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's petty, but look, she's wearing Barbara Bush's
pearls,'' Edgell told the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd forgotten just how nauseating she can be,'' said Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was more forgiving: ``She's put up with a lot,'' he noted.
``By the time this is over, Gore may be riding on her coat tails.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's lineup of party liberals and Kennedy family
members sparked a discussion between Rosa and Edgell about the role
of family values and the booming economy in the upcoming election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boom economy means the bosses make more money out of your
menial labor, but you're not getting paid any more,'' Rosa said.
</P>
<P>
   The election, Edgell said, should be about providing homes,
education, food and health care for everybody. ``There are so many
people out there working for the minimum wage, not getting
anywhere,'' she said. ``I don't want someone as president who's
just a mouthpiece for big business.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosa, a former Reserve Officer Training Corps member, said:
```Don't ask don't tell' in the military was a big mistake. The
Democrats give gays a seat at the table, then bind us to the chair.
They don't want to hear us speak. In my main issue, gay rights,
both parties get an F.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman's speech on Wednesday night that
seemed to heighten the viewers' interest in the Democratic ticket
the most.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly important, said Smith, 31, was Lieberman's emphasis
on his religion. ``Respect for faith is part of the Navajo being,''
he said. ``A lot of our relationships with other people and other
tribes are grounded in our respect for others' beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely want to know more about Lieberman,'' said Smith.
``He was genuine in what he had to say. He was so natural and
honest, he didn't sound like a politician.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Gore finally took the podium Thursday night, Smith
was even more inclined to vote for him, as were his wife and
Edgell; Rosa was still wavering between Gore and Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``His speech started off slowly, basically rehashing all the
stuff we'd heard before,'' said Smith. ``He picked up in the
middle, but overall, I was disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgell and Rosa thought Gore's speech was an unqualified
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved that he talked about traditional Democratic values and
working- family issues,'' Edgell said. She was so impressed, she
said, that she was going to volunteer to work in his campaign.
``This election is important and I need to get involved in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But of the four voters, the one most affected by Gore's speech
was Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it was banal and boring at the beginning, but when he
got warmed up it was awesome,'' said Rosa. ``He covered the whole
plight of the working class and he didn't do it in a patronizing
way.''
</P>
<P>
   And if one of the Democratic Party's goals for the convention
was to solidify its base, Rosa thought the speech accomplished
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really energized the activists by talking about Roe versus
Wade, and hate crimes, and racial profiling. Gore did it very well,
and I was really impressed. He sold himself to me at the same
time,'' Rosa said. ``Yeah, I'm going vote for him.''

RELIGION: EVANGELISTS ISSUE STATEMENT AT AMSTERDAM CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Rev. Billy Graham's organization convened a conference
of more than 10,000 evangelists from around the world in Amsterdam
on July 29, the event was described as notable for its size and its
extraordinary international composition, with people from more than
200 nations and territories represented.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the fact that the event, Amsterdam 2000, was
intended primarily as a series of teaching and training sessions,
its organizers also produced a document as the conference ended
last week. It is intended to be a broad statement of purpose for
evangelists in proclaiming the Christian gospel in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   The Amsterdam Declaration, as it is called, includes 14 points
and runs to nine single-spaced pages. But it may be particularly
interesting on several counts, not least in saying that women and
young people should be encouraged to be gospel teachers, in urging
that evangelists be sensitive to the societies in which they work
(not equating Christianity itself with any particular culture) and
in its embrace of social responsibility, like fighting poverty and
racism.
</P>
<P>
   The document is firm in rejecting a post-modern belief that
there is no absolute truth and also in declaring that evangelists
are obliged to present the Christian gospel as authoritative, even
while treating people of other religions with respect.
</P>
<P>
   It also calls for evangelists to be prayerful and to be
accountable for their lives, avoiding scandal _ it cites ``money,
sex, pride, power, neglect of family and lack of integrity,''
temptations that so spectacularly afflicted some prominent
television preachers in the United States a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the document calls for all evangelists to ``stand
in solidarity'' with Christians persecuted for their beliefs. In
that sense, it reflects a concern emerging in the United States and
elsewhere that some of the places in the world where Christianity
is growing fastest are also among the most difficult for believers.
</P>
<P>
   BISHOPS' MISSION TO AFRICA
</P>
<P>
   An unusual event began on Friday, when three American bishops
departed for Central and East Africa's ``great lakes'' region, on a
two-week journey to learn about the problems facing refugees and
displaced people, of whom there are more than 3 million in that
region alone. Among the bishops' goals, the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops says, is to discover what specific forms of
assistance the refugees need and, upon returning, to lobby for that
help from such sources as the United States government, the United
Nations and Catholic church agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The visit comes as Catholic leaders, including Pope John Paul
II, as well as other religious organizations and labor unions have
become increasingly outspoken in urging governments and
international banks to forgive the foreign debts of poor nations,
especially in Africa, so that those nations can spend more on their
own internal needs.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops' schedule calls for them to visit four nations _
Burundi, Rwanda, Congo (the former Zaire) and the Congo Republic _
all of which have been deeply affected by several years' of wars
and civil turmoil that have badly disrupted their societies. The
group will also go to Kenya, which has one of the largest refugee
encampments in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The conference said the three prelates, Bishop Philip F.
Straling of Reno, Nev., Auxiliary Bishop Thomas Wenski of Miami and
Bishop Donald Pelotte of Gallup, N.M., will visit refugee camps and
meet with officials of humanitarian aid agencies, local government
officials and Catholic leaders. Bishop Wenski serves on the
American bishops' Migration Committee, and Bishop Pelotte will
represent Catholic Relief Services.
</P>
<P>
   A NEW WAVE OF IMMIGRANTS
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of new American immigrants, a Catholic
church-related research organization in Washington recently noted
some interesting statistics about that group's religious
identities, indicating differences from the long-standing religious
situation in the United States. The statistics, taken from a
conference at Georgetown, suggest how the new wave of immigrants
may change the nation's religious makeup.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, the Center for Applied Research in the
Apostolate, reported in its summer newsletter that nearly 30
percent of recent immigrants in a 1996 survey described themselves
as something other than Protestant, Catholic or Jewish, which
together have long formed the three dominant categories in American
religious life.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 15 percent of the new immigrants said they had no
religion, more than 7 percent said they were Muslim, 4 percent
described themselves as Buddhist and more than 3 percent said they
were Hindu, the center said. (All these figures, by the way, far
exceed survey results for these categories among the general
American population.)
</P>
<P>
   The center also reported that more than 41 percent of the recent
immigrants said they were Catholics (compared with about 25 percent
of the overall American population); just 9 percent said they were
Protestants (who make up about half the overall population, when
one includes both mainline and evangelical Protestants in that
category).

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An influential expert on global warming who for nearly 20 years
has pressed countries to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other
heat-trapping greenhouse gases now says the emphasis on carbon
dioxide may be misplaced. Instead, he and a team of scientists have
concluded that the quickest way to slow warming is to cut other
heat-trapping greenhouse gases first.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy could help policy-makers overcome a fundamental
conflict in the debate over global warming: Carbon dioxide, the
main heat-trapping gas in the air, is an unavoidable byproduct of
the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil _ and combustion of
fossil fuels is the foundation of industrial societies.
</P>
<P>
   The expert, Dr. James E. Hansen, and his colleagues conclude in
a new analysis that the warming seen in recent decades was caused
mainly by other heat-trapping emissions _ methane,
chlorofluorocarbons, black particles of diesel and coal soot, and
compounds that create the ozone in smog. These are far easier to
control than carbon dioxide, and some of them are already on the
decline.
</P>
<P>
   The team, which reported its findings this week in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that the
burning of fossil fuels, although substantially raising carbon
dioxide levels in the atmosphere, also produces a pall of particle
haze that reflects as much of the sun's energy back into space as
the release of carbon dioxide has trapped in the air, Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   The haze from combustion is likely to be cleaned up in coming
years, removing its cooling, sun-blocking effect, said Hansen, who
is director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. And over the course
of the century, he added, carbon dioxide levels will still have to
be reduced to prevent further warming. Meanwhile, emissions of
carbon dioxide from human activities may be decreasing; he said
they shrank slightly in 1998 and 1999, even as the global economy
grew.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, the world may find it easier and less
costly to slow climate change than he and other scientists had
thought, at least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospects for having a modest climate impact instead of a
disastrous one are quite good, I think,'' Hansen said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Some climatologists greeted Hansen's new paper with dismay,
saying they feared it would be misused by those who are skeptical
about global warming or by critics of a proposed treaty, the Kyoto
Protocol, which would commit industrialized nations to big cuts in
greenhouse-gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of industries most vulnerable to restrictions on
carbon dioxide welcomed the findings, saying they raised
provocative questions about the need for vigorous action on the
climate.
</P>
<P>
   The strong reaction is largely a function of the major role that
Hansen has played in propelling the greenhouse debate onto the
public stage. In 1981, he was a principal author of one of the
first papers spelling out the links between rising atmospheric
levels of carbon dioxide and rising global temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1988, when a scorching American heat wave was
at its peak and fires were consuming the Amazon, he testified
before a Senate committee that human activities were changing the
climate. He was the first mainstream scientist to make the claim in
a major public forum.
</P>
<P>
   In the new analysis, Hansen and his colleagues culled data and
scientific papers on everything from rice production, which
releases methane, to urban pollution _ a source of ozone and sooty
particles _ to obtain detailed estimates of the rate of change in
different greenhouse emissions.
</P>
<P>
   He then used established formulas for calculating how different
amounts of the gases in the future would affect the inflow of
energy from the sun and escape of heat from the earth _ the balance
that determines whether the planet warms or cools.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's co-authors were Makiko Sato, from Columbia University
and Goddard; Reto Ruedy and Andrew Lacis from Goddard; and Valdar
Oinas from Goddard and Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon dioxide is by far the most abundant greenhouse gas in the
atmosphere. But the other gases that Hansen and his team cite are
more prodigious trappers of heat. Moreover, Hansen said, in
contrast to the difficulties of controlling carbon dioxide,
technologies already exist for capturing or eliminating many of the
other kinds of emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are much more tractable,'' Hansen said, citing as an
example existing systems for capturing methane produced by
decomposing organic material in landfills.
</P>
<P>
   Also, because many of these gases cause serious, costly health
problems or can harm agriculture, there are ``strong economic
reasons for wanting to eliminate them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By cleaning up such emissions, countries can solve two problems
at once, he noted, describing how black carbon particles from
diesel engines and coal-burning power plants can be caught with
filters, eliminating something that both harms people's health and
traps heat in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kevin E. Trenberth, the head of the climate analysis section
at the National Centers for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.,
criticized aspects of the new study, saying that the data could
also be read to make carbon dioxide seem just as important as the
other gases.
</P>
<P>
   But he and several other climate scientists said they agreed
that an initial focus on the other greenhouse gases could achieve
significant slowing of climate warming, as long as carbon dioxide
cuts were also made.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John P. Holdren, a professor of environmental science and
public policy at Harvard University, said any focus on cutting just
one set of gases now would be a mistake. ``This is not an either-or
problem,'' Holdren said. ``It's a both-and problem. We're going to
need all the cuts we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hansen paper has prompted a significant amount of scrambling
on the part of scientists and lobbyists trying to shape the
response to global warming. Several hundred scientists in dozens of
countries are working on final revisions to the latest installment
of a U.N. assessment of climate change.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes as the presidential candidates are being pressed
by private environmental groups to add more detail to their
positions on global warming.
</P>
<P>
   As a senator in the 1980s, Al Gore frequently cited Hansen's
work in calling for global efforts to stave off harmful warming.
Gore played a major role in negotiations in Kyoto, Japan, on the
proposed treaty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the White House said the Kyoto plan was still the best
approach to slowing the warming, adding that it placed equal
emphasis on reducing all the greenhouse gases, largely because of
insistence by U.S. negotiators, including Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Vice President Gore who insisted at Kyoto that the full
basket of greenhouse gases, not just carbon dioxide, be included in
the protocol,'' a White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has said
that the Kyoto proposals were ``inadequate and unfair to the United
States.'' On Friday a spokesman for the Bush campaign, Ray
Sullivan, called the new Hansen paper intriguing, saying, ``This
report seems to indicate that there are still questions to be
answered'' about the causes of and solutions for global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert T. Watson, the chairman of the U.N. Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, said he had received a flurry of phone
calls from other scientists in the last few days expressing concern
that Hansen's study could be misportrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said this could easily be interpreted as the guy who got
Vice President Gore all excited about global warming now saying
everything's fine,'' Watson said, adding: ``If this paper is viewed
that way, it'd be a horrible distortion. If anything, our
projections for warming are higher than they used to be, and we're
seeing discernible changes in ecosystems that we can link back to
climate.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of industries that have sought to limit
restrictions on fossil fuels said the paper poked provocative holes
in the science behind the Kyoto plan and other proposals to stem
warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly seems to be in line with a lot of the people who
say there are a lot of uncertainties out there,'' said Frank
Maisano, a spokesman for the Global Climate Coalition, an
industry-funded group that opposes the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hansen stressed that he still is convinced that
global warming is under way, that people are a significant cause of
it, and that work should be done to cut the rate of change _
perhaps not quite as much work as had been thought.
</P>
<P>
   And there is nothing wrong with a little optimism, he said,
pointing to the global drop in carbon dioxide emissions in the last
two years despite rising prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A key question has been: Can you decouple CO2 emissions and
economic growth?'' he said. ``It's looking like you can.''

 &HT;    One Earnhardt short?
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ Sunday's Earnhardt family reunion might be
canceled at Michigan Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt and his sons Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Kerry
Earnhardt were all trying to qualify Friday for the Pepsi 400. The
last time a father competed against his two sons on NASCAR's top
circuit was in 1960, when Lee Petty raced against sons Maurice and
Richard Petty.
</P>
<P>
   The good news on Friday was that Dale Jr. won the pole position
for the second time this season. ``Little E'', who has also posted
two Winston Cup wins during his rookie season, set a new record for
qualifying at the two-mile oval with a speed of 191.149 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news was that Earnhardt Sr. had engine problems and
registered the 33rd-fastest speed in the time trials. But the
seven-time Winston Cup champion is assured of making Sunday's race,
whether by running in today's second round of qualifying or taking
an owner's provisional.
</P>
<P>
   The worst news is that Kerry needs a miracle to join his family
on the track Sunday. Kerry, 30, is trying to make his first Winston
Cup start. He is driving the No. 71 Chevrolet, which is normally
operated by veteran Dave Marcis and sponsored by Columbus-based
Realtree.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry had the 40th fastest time Friday. Marcis is out of owner's
provisionals until Darlington in two weeks, so Kerry needs to
heavily improve on his speed in today's second round of time trials
to make the 43-car field.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, the morning practice we were real good,'' Kerry
said. ``To come back and qualify like that, it kind of brings you
down a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun was out and the track is a little hotter . . . the car
just doesn't stick like it did in practice. I wanted to qualify in
the first round. We didn't get close. We'll just have to come back
(today) and try it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jr. was excited to win the pole, but it was tempered by the
results of his father and brother in qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as my father, when he does poorly, it's best not to get
anywhere near him,'' Dale Jr. said. ``As far as Kerry, he came up
in the trailer and we talked a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found some things today that improved my lap times . . . and
comfort level. I filled him in on some of those things. I am going
to do whatever I can with him in my power to improve his situation
(today).''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ By her own admission, Alberta Lee was a
contentious handful as a teen-ager and a willful, self-absorbed
young woman whose lack of direction concerned her conservative
immigrant parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the spoiled brat of the family,'' Lee, 26, stated
bluntly. ``I had a hard time getting on my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   She finds it easy sharing such reflections because in the past
18 months she has left that needy girl light-years behind. She
speaks proudly of the sense of purpose that has transformed her
into a confident woman, then notes bitterly that the man whose own
life-changing experiences forced her to grow has not been able to
share the experience. That is because the man, her father, is being
held in a federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is the daughter of Wen Ho Lee, the scientist formerly with
Los Alamos National Laboratory who is charged with mishandling some
of the country's most sensitive nuclear weapons secrets. A small,
reed-thin man tucked into a plain gray suit, Dr. Lee has sat in a
federal courtroom here much of this past week seeking, for the
third time since his arrest in December, to be released on bail. He
is represented by a team of lawyers and one lioness who now gives
speeches, raises funds for her father's defense, exhorts his
lawyers, meets with civil rights groups and cajoles or browbeats
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Alberta Lee, who says she still cannot hold back the tears when
she visits her father, says she is determined to do more than just
see him exonerated. Because she and his supporters believe he has
been singled out by the government because he is Chinese-American,
she wants to use his case to fight against discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Her determination has astounded those who know her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a positive side to all this, how my sister sort of
matured,'' said her brother, Chung Lee, 27, a soft-spoken medical
student. ``I never would have imagined she could have done this.
It's amazing really.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Hwang, the managing attorney of the Asian Law Caucus in
San Francisco, a civil rights group that filed a brief supporting
Dr. Lee's assertion that he is a victim of racial discrimination,
said Alberta Lee has ``been one of the most interesting people to
work with. She's the first person I've seen who has had this kind
of growth. She's still in shock and denial, like, `How can this
happen?' But then she goes back and works very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee described herself as a somewhat rebellious, emotional young
woman while growing up in Los Alamos, sometimes more than her
conservative father could handle. She recalled how once, when a
friend showed up with torn jeans, her father was aghast and offered
to patch them up right then and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how conservative he is,'' Lee said. ``It also shows
how, you know, clueless he is.''
</P>
<P>
   But while her father was in many ways a man of tradition, who
spoke Mandarin at home, Alberta Lee never had strong feelings about
her Chinese heritage. She attended the University of California at
Los Angeles, where she took a few courses on Asian-American
history, but said they made little impression. ``I just felt that
the problems with discrimination didn't apply to me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when her father became entangled in the criminal
investigation that she began to see her ethnicity in a different
way.
</P>
<P>
   She was working as a technical writer with a computer company in
North Carolina, in late 1998, living with her boyfriend, now her
fiance, when she started getting worried phone calls from her
father and brother. Her father was being investigated, she was
told. Suddenly she felt herself once again in the uncomfortably
familiar role of family drama queen. She urged her father to get a
lawyer, but was ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad and I told her, `Just chill out,''' said her brother,
Chung. ``I'd just be telling her she was overreacting.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee found the experience doubly painful. ``Maybe that's the
theme of this whole story, that I had to fight my whole life for
someone to listen to me in my family, even on this,'' she said. ``I
don't mean to sound super bitter, but I feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Once her father's name surfaced, after officials said they
suspected that he had given nuclear secrets to China, she found
that not only were people listening, but that they eagerly sought
her out. She gave her first speech on her father's birthday, last
December, just a few weeks after he was arrested. Her real coming
of age, she said, dates from a few months later, when she was asked
to address a group of Asian-Americans at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really when I realized you could make an impression
on a crowd,'' she recalled. ``I really felt like, `Now, I have a
voice, I have a purpose.' I realized I wasn't just speaking for my
father. I was speaking for Asian-Americans, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So now she is booked for speaking engagements through October,
while still holding a job as a technical writer in San Francisco,
and helping support some family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't think she was viewed within the family as
someone they would really listen to before this,'' said Brian Sun,
the family's lawyer. ``But Wen Ho tells me now how proud he is. He
just asks me to make sure she doesn't overdo her involvement. He
wants her to have her own life.''
</P>
<P>
   As ever, Alberta Lee has her own ideas and is talking about
becoming a civil rights lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really believes her father's fate rests with her,'' Hwang
said. ``She feels tremendous pressure. The main flaw I find in her
is she hasn't developed much selectivity in who she will deal with.
She won't let any opportunity go by without making the effort. I'm
afraid she's going to burn herself out.''

EDITORIAL: MISGUIDED AID FOR COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 19:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is poised to begin sending hundreds
of millions of dollars in aid to Colombia's military. But first it
must either certify that that nation's armed forces meet certain
human rights criteria or waive those requirements in the interests
of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Washington will probably grant the waiver to get
counter-narcotics aid flowing, arguing that Colombia's armed forces
will soon begin to clean themselves up. This is dangerous, wishful
thinking. A stream of new helicopters, American training and
logistical support given without preconditions will remove any
incentive for the military to begin respecting civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will be financing, training and backing a
military with a record of killing civilians, aiding brutal
right-wing paramilitary groups and defying a well-meaning but weak
civilian government.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's record on punishing or prosecuting military personnel
for human rights abuses is poor, as the State Department
acknowledges in its annual human rights report.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence of military collusion in paramilitary
massacres of peasants. Carlos Castano, a paramilitary leader and
admitted drug trafficker, appears on television, but the military
seems unable to find and arrest him. High-ranking officers credibly
accused of helping the paramilitaries remain in their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   While Colombia's guerrillas have a reprehensible record of
killings, kidnappings and drug trafficking, the sudden escalation
in American support for the military is not the answer. It will
only strengthen the guerrilla hard-liners, intensify a conflict
that neither side can win, and wreck the peace process between the
government and the guerrillas, which offers the only possible hope
of an end to Colombia's endless civil war.

TEACHERS EARN OUR ENVY DURING LONG HOT SUMMERS
</HEADLINE>
  By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   The teachers say they smell fall,
which means they have only a few weeks left. Soon they'll head back
after being off the entire summer, sitting around their pools,
drinking iced lattes and reading all the new novels.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In your dreams they would probably say, and they're right about
that. Who doesn't think ``I should have been a teacher'' at least
once each summer?
</P>
<P>
   They are our summer envy. Our brief vacation glow quickly fades
to office drab while theirs gets more golden. They get to stay up
for Ted Koppel. They could go shoeless for three months if they
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   I see one teacher friend mornings at the gym, and torture myself
by asking her, ``So, what are you going to do today?'' Her answers
have to do with cleaning out her closets or tying up her tomatoes,
which tells me that teachers really are smarter than the rest of
us.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I know, too, that many teachers keep working through
the summer, but they get a change of venue. They drive cabs, take
tickets at the fair, sell their flowers at the farmers market. Some
of them even land exotic jobs, teaching painting in France or
leading river rafters.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I'm related to two teachers, I see their summers up
close. A new teacher, whose peers may start off their ad agency
jobs making twice as much, has to spend some of her first summers
studying for more required certificates, putting in as many hours
as an MBA but never approaching the money.
</P>
<P>
   Other teachers spend their summers in school learning to be
librarians or counselors, and I imagine many work at
sometimes-unappealing jobs just to pay car insurance and the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet teachers are lucky to have this two- to three-month escape
period when they're being something else. I've had teachers explain
that they need this time to purge themselves of their school
selves, scrub the overhead projector ink off their hands, so they
can walk back into the classroom at summer's end refreshed and
ready to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Such a time-out would be good for just about any career type, I
think. Drop out for three months and do another job. You couldn't
help be a better editor or more interesting dentist upon returning.
</P>
<P>
   Back to teachers. I went camping with three of them and learned
it is not only newspaper people who are job-obsessed. Teachers tell
tales. They go on about administrators and personalities and all
the regular shop talk, but when they speak of the kids, usually
referring to them as ``my kids,'' they are in love. Even with the
tough ones and their needy parents.
</P>
<P>
   They really can't imagine being anything but teachers. And this
is pretty amazing considering the small money, early mornings and
late days, goosey school boards, voucher threats and demands to
produce the best test scores. Plus having to look out for guns and
mysterious bruises, as well as counter the crass, idiot-making
humor on TV, make sure no one gets picked on and inspire kids to
want to read.
</P>
<P>
   What gets me, too, about teachers is that they must always be
on. Even with cold sores or a headache, bad hair, coffee spilled on
their white shirt and cat hair on their black pants, they are
stared at all day by eyes that don't miss a flaw.
</P>
<P>
   I have been around a lot of people lately who are discouraged by
corporate takeovers, ``Survivor'' shows and $389,000 median-priced
homes, but teachers keep the faith. Maybe because they look at real
value every day.
</P>
<P>
   I now know a secret about teachers and their summers. They start
sneaking back into their classrooms early, sometimes even in July,
to rearrange furniture, make the walls inviting and cut out those
neat fall leaves that show up on school windows every end of
August.
</P>
<P>
   You thought it was elves?

 &HT;    Hamms on verge of Games history
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Gymnasts Paul and Morgan Hamm are 17-year-old twins who
look so much alike that ``a lot of the guys can't tell us apart,''
Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   They are about the same size, 5 feet 6, and have the same
hairstyle, the same splatter of freckles and the same calm
demeanor. They say nearly the same things. And the Waukesha, Wis.,
high school seniors could wear the same uniform come September, as
the youngest members of the U.S. Olympic men's gymnastics team in
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our noses are a little bit different,'' Paul said,
helpfully.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Paul is right-handed, Morgan left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   And Paul Hamm _ pronounced ``Hom'' _ is ranked No. 2 entering
today's fourth and final round at the Olympic Trials, while Morgan
is sixth. The gymnasts with the four highest point totals _
currently Blaine Wilson, Paul Hamm, Sean Townsend and Stephen
McCain _ will make the team. The final two will be chosen by a
committee to shore up weak areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Hamms broke into gymnastics' old-boys club quickly. Last
year, Paul was 11th in the U.S. Championships to make his first
senior national team, while Morgan, who isn't quite as consistent,
was on the junior national team.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Paul placed third in last month's nationals and maneuvered
into second after two events Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of stress off me, getting higher,'' Paul said,
``because then I know my chances are so much better to make the
Olympic team.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Hamm is a good bet for a wild-card spot. He has had the
fourth-best scores the last two rounds and is strongest in the
three events in which the U.S. needs help: Floor exercise, rings
and vault.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the end of the world if we don't make it,'' said
Paul, figuring that they will be only 21 in 2004. ``There's more
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   And if only one Hamm makes it? ``The only thing you can be is
happy for the other person,'' Morgan said. ``It's great for your
brother to go to the Olympics; how many people can actually say
that?''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic men's gymnastics team has had only one set of
brothers, and never twins. And if the Hamms make it, they could be
younger than most, if not all, of the women's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's amazing in my mind,'' Olympic coach Peter
Kormann said, ``is not just their gymnastics, but the way they
compete. They compete like they have all the experience, and they
don't have any _ I mean very little. They don't get their cages
rattled like some guys do.''
</P>
<P>
   And they have twice as much reason to be on edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on the bubble of making it,'' Paul said, ``so I get
really nervous when he's up, just watching and saying, `Come on,
come on,' even though he can't hear me. You just do that kind of
stuff.''

SECOND ST. LOUIS AIRPORT `NO-HASSLE' AS EXPECTED: IT JUST NEEDS
FLIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JO THOMAS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASCOUTAH, Ill. _ When it was completed here two years ago to
relieve overcrowding at Lambert Field in St. Louis, MidAmerica
Airport was an airline passenger's dream: a brand new terminal with
free parking just 22 minutes from downtown. All it lacked was an
airline.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the $310 million airport, called ``the gateway to
nowhere'' by critics, got one. A reconstituted Pan Am started
service to Gary, Ind. Now, there are six flights a day.
</P>
<P>
   While major airports around the country are plagued with
increasing congestion, and passengers are facing a record number of
cancellations and delays, airport executives are frustrated that
such a new facility is sitting virtually unused. Mainly, they say,
this is because airlines are unwilling to leave the convenience and
efficiency of hubs, like TWA's at Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as a passenger is willing to get on an airplane,
airlines tend not to think of how long it takes you to get there,
the parking, the hassles, getting through the terminal,'' said Todd
Hauptli, senior vice president for policy and government affairs of
the American Association of Airport Executives. ``All they care
about is that you get in one of their seats. When it becomes such a
problem that people chose not to fly, or fly from a different
location, airlines sit up and take notice.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Southwest Airlines, Linda Rutherford, said the
discount-fare carrier had looked at MidAmerica, ``but we are
committed to Lambert, and we have a fairly substantial expansion
program going on right now. We are expanding our gates.''
</P>
<P>
   MidAmerica had not met several of Southwest's criteria,
Rutherford, said, though that is subject to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most travelers are on the west side of St. Louis, and that's
where Lambert is. MidAmerica would be more of a trek.''
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines, which has flights from Lambert, also decided
against MidAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, we don't think there are the passenger loads
that would be necessary,'' a spokesman there said.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Hargrove, MidAmerica's director, said he knows congestion
first hand. He was deputy director of Lambert Field from 1989 to
1994.
</P>
<P>
   All 3,000 acres of Lambert are ``for all practical purposes,
totally built up,'' he said. ``There is no more room for air cargo,
maintenance, repair or overhaul.''
</P>
<P>
   As the hub for Trans World Airlines, 17 million people per year
board airplanes there _ and sometimes, they don't. The delay time,
Hargrove said, is ``in excess of 20,000 hours a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Passengers learn _ to their dismay _ that the runways at
Lambert, built 1,300 feet apart, are too close for simultaneous
operation in bad weather. When the visibility is less than three
miles or the ceiling is less than 1,500 feet, one runway must
close. A third runway, to be completed in 2007, is expected to cost
more than $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Illinois cornfields east of St. Louis, where land
costs $4,000 an acre, MidAmerica sits on 8,000 acres, with room to
expand and two runways, set 7,000 feet apart. The military runway
was extended to 8,000 feet. And the new runway is 10,000 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   Roxann Reum, of Collinsville, Ill., greeted her daughter at
MidAmerica on Thursday after she spent the summer with her
grandmother in Sanford, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no traffic and no parking hassles,'' Reum said
happily, adding that the airport in Sanford, like MidAmerica, is a
satellite to a busier airport airport serving Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom hates the Orlando airport,'' she said. ``It takes her
two hours to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   MidAmerica was built next to Scott Air Force Base. Even before
the airport found a civilian airline, state officials, who put up
$60 million, felt it was worth the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan to build MidAmerica was a critical factor in keeping
Scott Air Force Base open,'' said Martha Schiebel, a spokesman for
the Illinois Department of Transportation. ``It employs more than
10,000 people and is one of the biggest employers in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   The longer runway also drew the 126th Refueling Wing of the Air
National Guard, which moved here from O'Hare Airport in Chicago,
another overcrowded airport where United Airlines needed additional
space. The guard brought 300 full-time and 1,000 part-time
employees.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the new 190-foot airport tower is being manned by
military air traffic controllers. When civilian traffic exceeds
military traffic, civilians will take over.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the Pan Am ticket agents were working without benefit
of a conveyor for luggage, but one is on the way, along with office
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a no-hassle airport,'' Hargrove said happily as he
walked through the terminal, pointing out how the baggage area
could quickly be converted to accommodate international flights,
and how the terminal, which has four gates, could be extended to
accommodate as many as 82.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowds aren't here,'' he said. ``The traffic's not here.
We have quick and easy access to the runways for takeoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   David Fink, who bought the name and logo of Pan Am from
bankruptcy and is now president of the new airline, said both the
airport and the airline hope to fill a niche at a time when air
travel is expected to double in the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes to use less congested airports in metropolitan
areas to provide low-cost flights, first to the leisure market and
then to business travelers. ``We're not looking to fill up every
plane,'' he said. ``We're hoping to bring a little civility and
make a dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Pan Am, based in Portmouth, N.H., now flies from airports in
Portmouth, Bangor, Maine, and Pittsburgh, as well as Mascoutah,
Ill., Gary, Ind., and Sanford, Fla.

   David Plavin, president of the Airports Council International, a
worldwide association of airports, said he considered MidAmerica
unusual only in the sense that ``most people don't have the
foresight and the courage to build before the demand
materializes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when it was routine to build in advance of
immediate demand: Newark, Dulles, Dallas, and even Denver were all
built before the demand actually materialized. No one considers
them white elephants.''

THE POCKETBOOK ISSUES ON THE FUTURE OF A COACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Aug. 20) 
 By KATE BERRY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors who are awaiting the initial public offering of Coach
Inc., the luxury leather goods maker, are likely to be
disappointed, analysts warn, because Coach's parent, the Sara Lee
Corp., might well do better if it sells the unit than if it takes
it public.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee reached a similar conclusion last week when it agreed
to sell its PYA/Monarch food service unit to Koninklijke Ahold
N.V., the Dutch supermarket giant, for $1.57 billion. In June,
PYA/Monarch filed with the Securities and Exchange Corp. to raise
$160 million in an initial offering to be managed by Goldman Sachs,
Bear Stearns and Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, Sara Lee intended initially to keep 80 percent of
the company and offer 20 percent to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the direct sale of PYA/Monarch to Ahold, Sara Lee obtains
cash now, eliminates market uncertainty and secures a multiyear
supply contract, creating significant value for Sara Lee
shareholders,'' said C.Steven McMillan, chief executive of Sara
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan was the architect of the company's plan to sell some
assets and focus on its core businesses. Though it is best known
for its baked goods, Sara Lee also owns brands including Ball Park
franks, L'eggs hosiery, Hanes underwear, Wonderbra, Endust
furniture cleaner and Kiwi shoe polish.
</P>
<P>
   A Sara Lee spokeswoman, Julie Ketay, said after the PYA/Monarch
deal that the $140 million Coach offering, to be managed by Goldman
Sachs, was still on track to be completed by the end of the year,
but some fund managers and analysts are not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury goods group,
is among the many names being tossed up as potential buyers of
Coach. Last year LVMH teamed up with its archrival Prada S.p.A. to
win a bidding war with the Gucci Group for another high-class
brand, Fendi, the Italian apparel and accessories group. They paid
one trillion lire, or $483.6 million, for a 51 percent stake in
Fendi.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, the market will put a higher multiple on the
same business with the same earnings if Bernard Arnault owned this
company,'' said Greg Fontana, vice president and co-manager for the
John Hancock funds in Boston, referring to the LVMH chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Bernal, an analyst at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte,
N.C., said: ``The most likely choice is for it to be sold than to
do an IPO. Just about everybody has been mentioned, so it's not a
question of who, but what price.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some fashion stocks have performed poorly, like
Donna Karan International and Tommy Hilfiger. But those with
expanded product lines like jewelry, shoes and handbags, have
proved that pricey baubles have a place on Wall Street. Coach, with
sales of $507 million in the fiscal year ended July 3, 1999,
according to its prospectus, may be aiming for a valuation akin to
that of Kenneth Cole, the shoe designer that also makes handbags
and accessories, analysts say. Kenneth Cole, which has seen its
shares jump to $45.3125, from below $10 a share in 1998, has a
market capitalization of $925.05 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kanter, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said Coach
had plenty of momentum behind it. ``It's bouncing back from a
difficult environment over the past few years where Asia reduced
their purchasing power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales grew at a compounded annual rate of 32 percent a year, to
$540.4 million in 1997, from $19 million in 1985 when Sara Lee
acquired the family-owned business, only to slide as a result of
Asia's financial crisis. Sales dipped 3.4 percent in 1998 and 2.8
percent in 1999 but are now starting to recover.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has 106 American retail stores, hopes to
rebound with an ambitious plan to open 50 new stores in the next
three years, remodel existing ones and expand its international
presence. Similar strategies helped fatten revenue for Tiffany,
Gucci, and LVMH, all of which have expanded their product lines to
attract upper middle-class shoppers _ those that have fared so well
in today's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Coach, which also sells through several catalogs and 63 factory
outlets, sees big growth opportunities in Japan, where consumers
spend substantially more for handbags than in the United States.
The company has a fashionably modern Web site and is branching into
products for the home, like leather director's chairs, and even
into pet supplies, from collars to beds. But analysts caution that
fashion trends change quickly in high-end luxury goods.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an initial offering, Coach could gain points
because, unlike many others going public, it is profitable. In the
first 39 weeks of fiscal 2000, Coach's net income jumped 67
percent, to $32.3 million, as sales rose 9.7 percent, to $427.2
million, according to its SEC filing.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the initial offering would be used to repay a
portion of debt to Sara Lee. Coach also plans to enter into a
revolving credit facility with Sara Lee under which it may borrow
up to $75 million. (It expects to borrow about $50 million in the
first quarter of fiscal 2001.)
</P>
<P>
   Within 18 months of the initial offering, Sara Lee plans to sell
its 80.1 percent stake in Coach. Sara Lee also plans to shed
Champion sportswear, with $500 million in annual sales, and its
recently acquired International Fabrics division of the British
retailer Courtaulds Textiles, with $400 million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the divestiture plans, McMillan said that the
sales would bring in at least $2.5 billion, giving the company
enough cash to buy other companies that fit better with the brands
it is keeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve McMillan will spend the peak of his career disassembling
the conglomerate that he built,'' said Fontana, at John Hancock
funds. ``I don't believe conglomerates make sense unless you're
Jack Welch.''

REUNION FAMILIES AGONIZE AS THEY SEPARATE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL _ With tear-drenched cheeks and trembling palms pressed to
bus windows, swollen lips mouthing goodbyes and kisses, shoulders
shaking with the agony of parting, 100 North Koreans began a sad
journey home Friday after a wrenching reunion with families they
had not seen since war separated them 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ending a three-day exchange that transfixed the two Koreas, they
sat mournfully as their buses headed to the airport, the joy of
rediscovery washed away by the anguish of having to leave.
</P>
<P>
   As the buses pulled away, one sobbing man traced the Korean
character for mother again and again on the glass. Another pried
open his window and reached out to grab the arm of his crying
sister. Others murmured into mobile phones that their relatives
thrust into their hands as they boarded so they could share the
last seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional outpouring of the reunions _ only the second time
in 50 years that a few families have been able to meet _ left both
halves of Korea galvanized by reunification fever. South Korea's
government called for a permanent reunion point at a border village
where families could meet regularly. Northern leader Kim Jong Il
said he would allow further restricted visits in the next two
months, and perhaps visits to hometowns next year.
</P>
<P>
   But amid memories of past broken promises and failed diplomacy,
the sorrowful farewells of 100 northerners departing Seoul and the
somber arrival of 100 southerners returning from Pyongyang
underlined the uncertainties faced by a Korea divided by the
world's last Cold War frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The reunion journeys were made possible by a landmark summit
between the two country's leaders in June.
</P>
<P>
   But the 200 who were reunited with relatives are a tiny fraction
of the 10 million living members of divided families, who amount to
10 percent of the population of the Korean penisula, according to
South Korean officials. They are not allowed telephone calls,
letters, or any contact across the sealed border. Most do not even
know if long-lost relatives are alive.
</P>
<P>
   There are 1.23 million elderly first-generation members of
separated families in the South alone, all of them longing to see
sons who were conscripted and never came home and daughters who
disappeared without a trace from their schools as war broke out. A
local newspaper calculated that, at the rate of 100 a month, it
would take more than 1,000 years for all of them to meet relatives
in the North.
</P>
<P>
   Well aware of the odds, desperate families who were not included
in this week's visits waved placards and tried to pass notes across
security lines to the departing northern visitors, begging for
information about their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors had just bid a final, agonizing farewell in 100
heartbreaking ways along a rope line guarded by hundreds of police
against any desperate outbursts in the last minutes of the 72-hour
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't go! Don't go!'' Kim Bong Ja, 86, cried from her
wheelchair, clinging to her son's neck and wetting him with flood
of tears as he tried to soothe her with a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we met, Mother, didn't we?'' 66-year-old son Ri Yong Su
choked out, bowing before her and clinging to her knees before he
was gently nudged onto the waiting bus by an escort. As Ri forced
open the bus window and reached out to wave, his sister surged
through the security cordon and leapt up to grasp his hand, trying
unsuccessfully to hug him one last time. Ri began to sing an old
anthem calling for reunification of the Koreas, and his relatives
joined in, crying as they sang.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, there is only hope freighted with sadness, after
families were forced to separate again after just starting to get
reacquainted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anything more, now that I've seen you,'' said the
mother of Ri Dong Sop, 65, who had to return to Pyongyang. ``I'd
just like reunification soon, so I can meet my daughter-in-law
before I die.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten feet away, Kim Ok-bae, 67, a professor of dance who
disappeared from her high school during the war, fell to her knees
before her 87-year-old mother, as her two sisters cried
inconsolably.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I let you go while I am still living here?'' wailed
one mother, Hong Kil Soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a heartbreaking moment,'' said Kim Yong Bae, 62, after
her sister boarded the bus. ``We wish she could have slept with us
for even one night.''
</P>
<P>
   During the reunions, the relatives were kept in separate hotels
on opposite side of the Han River and were allowed to meet only a
few times in hotel rooms and a convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   In the Seoul airport, the mood was restrained, as 100
southerners returned from the north. ``It feels like I met someone
who came back from the dead,'' said Lee Tae Hoon, 83, of seeing the
daughter who got left behind in the war. ``I'm so sad, but there's
nothing I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee and others said they were struck by the absence of cars,
pedestrians, and lights in the northern capital, but found the city
clean and its people warm and hospitable, if gaunt. Families were
allowed to meet without escorts, in contrast to the Seoul reunions,
but Southerners said they were afraid to pry about life in the
hermetically sealed North.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother said he has a house with its own yard and a
pension, and he said is happy,'' said Seonwoo Chun Shil, 72, who
had taken gifts to the little brother she lost when she fled south.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't believe it,'' she said. ``He looks so bad, not
only him, but all the people there are grey-faced, with teeth
falling out. . . . You can say 10 times over that I was lucky to
end up on this side. . . . But of course I want reunification as
soon as possible.''

 &HT;    Nicklaus reflects on his No. 1 fan
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ He's beginning to walk a little older.
Wrinkles are developing where wrinkles usually develop for
60-year-olds. The crow's feet around his eyes go into a graceful
squint when he smiles. But don't for once doubt the heart or the
passion for the game of Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   If this is, in fact, Jack Nicklaus' last round of major
tournament golf, then America said its farewell, with feeling, to
one of its treasures at this 82nd PGA Championship in the Friday
gloaming.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he moved around these 18 holes of his own design at
Valhalla, he was met with compassionate applause. You could feel
the difference in the Nicklaus cheers and the cheers for his
celebrated match companion, Tiger Woods. Cheers for Woods had a
lustiness to them, Nicklaus' a depth and lingering sadness.
</P>
<P>
   The week was for more than another PGA Championship, another
major, presumably the last in a long line of majors than began 41
years ago. This was the week his mother passed away, Helen
Nicklaus, or Mrs. Charles Nicklaus, as she probably preferred to be
addressed. As he last visited with her on Monday, she had made
certain that no matter what the case, he should play the PGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her greatest concern the last two years was that she might
pass away while I was in a major tournament, and she wanted to make
sure that I played on,'' he said, earlier this week, when he was
honored with the PGA's highest award. ``So that is why I am playing
this week.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of his multiple news conferences, he spoke of
mothers, his in particular. ``Mothers are always there to do for
you, what you need, always there when you've got problems. They are
in the background, but they are in the forefront, too. My mother
was no different.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a tough old girl, and she hung in there and I talked
to her a lot. She never missed watching golf on television and she
was a great supporter, but never in the forefront, always in the
background.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Nicklaus was 90 years old.
</P>
<P>
   So two majors in Jack Nicklaus' life went out with the sunset.
He goes home to bury his mother Monday in Columbus, Ohio, and he
walked off the 18th green at Valhalla, an aptly named location,
Friday as the sun lowered, presumably leaving behind once and for
all his life among the U.S. and British Opens, the Masters and the
PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably. I have no reason to doubt it, but I won't be
surprised if he shows up at the Masters next April.
</P>
<P>
   To estimate the meaning Jack Nicklaus has brought to golf isn't
within my realm. I do find it incongruous that for all the
championships he has won and the trophies he has collected, in this
one year alone Tiger Woods has made more money than Nicklaus in all
his years.
</P>
<P>
   The finish was as if fate had orchestrated it. The 18th hole is
a long par-5, downhill to a green divided by a bunker, designed,
you understand, by Nicklaus himself. (``I was told by Dwight Gahm,
who owned the land, to build a golf course where the PGA
Championship could be played.'')
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus' drive was straight and true and his second shot left
him about 100 yards from the green. His approach flew toward the
pin in an arc, landed, spun backward and almost into the hole for
an eagle. He finished off, appropriately, with a birdie, and while
the world of Valhalla exploded, he walked off the green arm in arm
with son Steve, his caddie.
</P>
<P>
   The old warhorse had not been sent out for show, he had gone out
to play his game and he had responded with the grim determination
of Jack Nicklaus.

 By PATRICK E. TYLER with STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The commander of Russia's Northern Fleet acknowledged
Friday that a terrible internal explosion devastated the nuclear
submarine Kursk before it went down last Saturday, confirming
Western intelligence reports of huge underwater explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The report by Adm. Vyacheslav Popov on Russian television came
as the Russian navy finally docked a rescue vehicle to the spine of
the wrecked submarine after numerous unsuccessful attempts. But
rescuers said they found the deck area around a rear escape hatch
so deformed that they were unable to make a water-tight connection
and enter the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred eighteen men were on board the Kursk when it sank.
Navy officials said they would keep trying to reach them, and there
remained the possibility that a British submersible, to arrive
Saturday night, might manage to enter the Kursk with a more
flexible docking mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Popov said the last signals from the crew were heard on Monday.
Other naval officials have said that survivors were tapping on the
hull of the vessel through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Popov also said that he was ``very worried that according to our
calculations the pressure in the submarine is higher than the
normal atmosphere,'' indicating a dangerous threat to normal
respiration. ``Our estimates of the time limit'' for the crew's
survival ``have been based on the fact that the air pressure is
normal,'' he said. He added, ``The situation is very grave.'' Most
Russian officials have said that the oxygen in the Kursk would be
depleted by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Though Popov confirmed internal explosions, he did not rule out
earlier Russian claims that the Kursk sank after a collision with
an unidentified object or vessel. He said the investigation into
what triggered the explosions centered on an outside impact, like a
collision, or something inside. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. officials in Washington said Friday that it was
conceivable that a collision preceded the large explosion detected
aboard the Kursk. Others felt that such a collision also would have
been heard by Western intelligence sensors monitoring the Russian
naval maneuvers in the Barents Sea last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   One theory circulating among U.S. defense officials Friday was
that the Kursk was in the process of firing an antisubmarine rocket
from one of its forward weapons tubes when the rocket jammed in the
tube. With its warhead outside the hull and still attached to the
rocket body and flaming engine, it triggered a fire and an
explosion, the first of the two detected by Western intelligence
sensors.
</P>
<P>
   After two minutes and 15 seconds, the officials theorized, the
missile's warhead of high-yield conventional explosive could have
detonated with the force of one to two tons of TNT, causing
extensive damage to deck structures in the forward section and near
the conning tower.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. analysts estimated that a high-yield exploding warhead
and a shock wave from the explosion could have destroyed an
estimated 40 percent of the submarine, splitting and deforming
parts of the hull. That may have given the appearance that the ship
had been pummeled by the glancing blow of another ship and opened a
gaping hole in the hull.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Polmar, an independent naval expert, said one torpedo
carried by this type of submarine is designed to be fired
underwater, shoot up through the air and then drop back into the
water to home in on another submarine.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said that the Russians had been practicing
missile and torpedo firings in a large naval exercise right before
the explosions were heard. Polmar said that in the two minutes and
15 seconds before the torpedo's warhead exploded, it is possible
that sailors in the back of the submarine could have shut a series
of watertight doors. He said those crew members could have survived
as the sub plummeted to the bottom, while most men in the front of
the submarine would have perished quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts said the submarine's batteries lay below the front
compartments and probably would have been knocked out. That would
make it unlikely that survivors would have had battery power and
would decrease the odds that any could have survived more than
three or four days.

   A Norwegian seismic institute joined with Western governments
Friday in saying that it had detected two underwater explosions in
the area where the Kursk went down. The explosions were a little
more than two minutes apart, the first one much smaller than the
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first explosion we recorded was probably the equivalent of
less than 100 kilograms of TNT,'' said Frode Ringdal, scientific
director of the institute. But the second explosion was the
equivalent of one to two tons of TNT, he added. The explosion sent
powerful shock waves through the water that could be detected by
seismic equipment on Norway's northern coast, near where U.S.
intelligence sensors aboard submarines operating in the Arctic
Ocean area also detected the powerful explosions.

   President Vladimir Putin flew back to Moscow late Friday after
attending the opening in Yalta, Ukraine, of a summit meeting of
leaders of former Soviet republics. He faced biting criticism in
the Russian press and among some leading political figures for
vacationing at a Black Sea resort while any survivors on board the
Kursk slowly asphyxiated below the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   He defended his five-day delay. ``Of course, my first wish was
to fly to the region, to the fleet base in order to study the
situation on the spot,'' Putin told reporters before leaving Yalta.
``But I decided against that, and I think I made the correct
decision,'' he said, explaining that ``the arrival in the disaster
area of high-ranking officials who are not specialists'' does not
``help rescue either people or equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, criticism was intense. The leader of Russia's liberal
Union of Right Forces Party, Boris Nemtsov, said in a statement
Friday that Putin, as commander-in-chief has ``no right to vacation
while his subordinates, Northern Fleet sailors, face this drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin defended his actions saying that the first assessment he
received of the disaster from Marshal Igor Sergeyev, the defense
minister, indicated that ``the chances the crew will survive are
few, but they exist and specialists will do their utmost.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader said he also was assured that ``Russia has
all the means for rescue work.'' When this proved not to be the
case, Putin said discussions were carried out with Western
countries as soon as help was offered.
</P>
<P>
   Though there were rumors in Murmansk that Putin would fly
straight to the northern submarine base to console the families,
Russian officials remained silent about whether Putin had reached
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government announced Friday evening that each family
of Kursk crew members would be allocated the equivalent of about
$18,000 in immediate financial assistance to cover their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, the navy
commander, said that he would remain optimistic ``until Aug. 18.''
Other navy experts have suggested that any surviving crew members
have already run out of oxygen and that most of the 86 officers, 31
enlisted men and the one civilian likely perished in the first
minutes after a catastrophic blow or explosion ruptured the hull
and allowed water to enter the ship.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The Murmansk edition of the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda on
Friday published a full list of the names of 118 people aboard the
Kursk with an editorial note stating that after repeated attempts
to obtain the list through officials navy channels, the newspaper
finally resorted to bribery and paid 16,000 rubles for the list,
the equivalent of about $650.
</P>
<P>
   Inflaming the mystery about the accident were numerous
unconfirmed reports and theories spun out in the Russian press,
several of them asserting that the Russian navy suspected that one
of the two U.S. submarines alleged to have been operating in the
area might have been involved in a collision with the Kursk and had
then sought refuge at a Norwegian port.
</P>
<P>
   Those reports were only fanned by the arrival in Moscow of
George Tenet, the U.S. Director of Central Intelligence. Tenet's
agenda was not clear, but Russian officials said that his visit had
been planned before the Kursk tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has denied that any of its submarines were
involved in the disaster.

PROSECUTORS SAY SCIENTIST'S MEETING IN BEIJING WAS SUSPICIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also LEE-TRIAL-DAUGHTER)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Prosecutors on Friday sought to bolster
their case against a former Los Alamos scientist accused of
mishandling nuclear weapons secrets by arguing that a visit to
Beijing in 1988 had transformed him into a virtual spy for China.
</P>
<P>
   The government argument was the strongest statement to date that
the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was functioning as a spy, even though he
is not charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The government's aim in making these points, which came during
testimony by an FBI agent, appeared to be to impress the judge with
the risks of releasing Lee on bail, as his lawyers are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The defense countered that Lee had done nothing to conceal the
meeting and that nothing classified had been discussed. U.S.
District Judge James A. Parker expressed exasperation about the
hearing's having lasted three days rather than the expected
half-day.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI agent, Robert Messemer, described an approved
professional visit Lee made to Beijing in 1988 as highly
suspicious. Lee has said that he was visited in his hotel room by
two senior Chinese weapons scientists, Zheng Shaotang and Hu Side,
and that he was asked about a mathematical problem related to
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer said that the meeting typified standard Chinese spying
maneuvers in a number of ways. It excluded other American
scientists, including Lee's wife, and Lee was asked a fairly narrow
technical question. In addition, the question was posed not by an
intermediary, but by the scientist who might use the information.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Lee did not disclose this meeting
at the time and only described what happened when he was
interviewed by the FBI early last year. But Mark Holscher, one of
Lee's lawyers, countered that in an official report filed after the
trip Lee mentioned he had met with Zheng and that Lee had not been
questioned about the matter until last year.
</P>
<P>
   The judge did not announce his decision and indicated that he
might not for several days so he could review the transcripts.

ONLINE BROKER MAY BUY OUT TWO BIG INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Trying to distance itself from a troubled past, Datek
Online, one of the United States' fastest-growing online brokerage
firms, has agreed to raise about $500 million to buy out the
company's two majority shareholders, according to people who have
been briefed on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The company's board and top executives are trying to end Datek's
relationship with Jeffrey A. Citron, the company's former chief
executive, and Sheldon Maschler, a former trader with a history of
regulatory problems. Together they own about 52 percent of Datek.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, who may retain a minority stake, were instrumental
in transforming what began as a small day-trading operation in
Brooklyn into what is now the nation's sixth-largest online broker,
with over $14 billion in customer assets.
</P>
<P>
   But continuing criminal and regulatory investigations into the
company's day-trading operations in the 1990s have prevented Datek
from offering shares to the public and have scared away many
potential investors in Datek and its subsidiary, Island ECN, a
popular electronic trading network.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the buyout agreement was prompted by any
of the investigations. But people close to Datek's operations say
that the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York and
the Securities and Exchange Commission are still investigating
Datek and its former day-trading unit, which was spun off in 1998
as Heartland Securities. Datek Online, the popular online trading
unit, is not the focus of the inquiry, people close to the
investigations say.
</P>
<P>
   Datek, which is based in Edison, N.J., hopes that by
substantially reducing the stakes of Maschler and Citron, who will
lose their voting power in the company, Datek can attract new
investors and prepare for an initial public offering, people close
to the deal said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Datek issued a terse statement confirming that a
buyout deal had been reached with Maschler and Citron. But a
spokesman for the company, Robert O. Bethge, declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have entered into an agreement with the principal
shareholders to seek to repurchase a substantial portion of their
shares,'' the statement read.
</P>
<P>
   People who have been briefed on the deal, however, said that for
over a month top executives at Datek and representatives of the
board had been in tense negotiations with Maschler and Citron about
buying out their stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Maschler, who was sued in 1998 by the SEC on accusations of
playing a role in a stock manipulation scheme, now lives in
Florida. Citron, who has also been fined by the SEC for trading
violations, lives in Brielle, N.J. Neither Citron nor Maschler
could be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The two men agreed a few weeks ago to sell at least 75 percent
of their shares to new investors, according to people close to the
deal. The company is expected to find private investors willing to
pay about $500 million for that stake, according to people who were
briefed on the deal. The repurchase values Datek at about $1.1
billion. The company's investment banker is Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Datek, however, does not plan to pay for the deal with an
initial public offering, people close to the deal say. But Datek
officials have said publicly in recent months that they would like
to move toward a public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the company canceled plans for an initial
offering, after the Manhattan district attorney's office said it
was investigating whether Datek had participated in a
money-laundering operation, and former Datek traders said they had
been interviewed by the SEC about questionable off-shore
transactions and illegal trading practices at Datek's day-trading
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a year ago, Vulcan Ventures, a venture capital fund
controlled by Paul G. Allen, one of the co-founders of Microsoft,
pulled out of a planned $100 million investment in Datek and Island
ECN. People close to the deal said the withdrawal was partly
because of concerns about investigations into the company. (TA
Associates, a venture capital fund in Boston, and Groupe Arnault of
Paris, proceeded with a $195 million investment.)
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, TD Waterhouse, a big online broker and a unit of
Toronto Dominion Bank, decided not to follow through on plans to
spend about $25 million for a 12 percent stake in Island ECN, which
is seeking approval from the SEC to become a full-fledged stock
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   And last October, Citron, the 29-year-old chief executive at
Datek, stepped down under pressure from other executives and
investors in the company in a move that Datek officials hoped would
end some questions about the company's past.
</P>
<P>
   Though he kept a 30 percent stake in Datek, Citron agreed to
turn over all his management and voting rights to the board. He
also agreed to have no role at the company for two years, at which
time Datek hoped investigations into its former day-trading unit
would be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Maschler has not had a role in the company since 1996, when as
chief trader at Datek he was suspended for one year for trading
infractions. But it was Maschler who went to Datek in 1987 and
started building a day-trading powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he hired Citron, who was 17, to work as a clerk in the
office. Citron later became an enormously successful day trader _
using software the company created _ and then at the age of 26
became chief executive of Datek, which in 1996 transformed itself
into an online broker.
</P>
<P>
   But Citron resigned last October after over two years of
revelations that the day-trading unit he was running had been under
the scrutiny of authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials are still scrutinizing Maschler and
Citron's relationship to Robert E. Brennan, the penny-stock
promoter who was banned from the securities industry for life, and
who two weeks ago was arrested on charges of failing to report
cashing in $500,000 of gambling chips after declaring bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Citron and Maschler, who once worked for Brennan at First Jersey
Securities, have each made financial deals with Brennan. Brennan
borrowed about $3 million from a company owned by Maschler,
according to files in Brennan's bankruptcy case. And Citron bought
Brennan's mansion in New Jersey for $3.3 million in 1996 and his
private jet for $3.8 million. Brennan recently traveled on a plane
chartered through a company owned by Citron and his wife, according
to court records.

 &HT;    2001 Audi TT a bundle of fun
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like a finely made and rather expensive Swiss watch,
Audi's 2001 TT roadster is a bit of an engineering marvel. Just how
much of a gee-whiz car it is depends on the drivetrain, which comes
in several variations.
</P>
<P>
   There's the basic front-drive 180-horsepower model that checks
in at $32,850 and an all-wheel drive, 225-hp version listing for
$38,500. Note that versions now coming to market have revised
suspensions and aerodynamic work following several high-speed
accidents in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have affected the performance and driving
characteristics of the TT, but it retains enough sports-car
qualities to satisfy all but the most aggressive drivers and should
be very satisfying on American roads.
</P>
<P>
   Although a comfortable car for driver and passenger, the TT
(stands for Tourist Trophy, an old racing classification) is small.
Its wheelbase is 95.4 inches, and overall length is 159.1 inches,
or about 13 feet long. Get stuck in expressway traffic, and it's
downright intimidating to be beside trucks and SUVs with tires that
seem larger than your vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   But put the TT in its proper habitat, a two-lane road, and push
back the folding top, which can be done from behind the steering
wheel, and it's a little bundle of fun for even placid drivers. So
what if the 180-hp TT needs about eight seconds to get to 60 mph?
This is a 3,000-pound car that feels tight and capable.
</P>
<P>
   It did finish behind the Porsche Boxster S, the Honda S2000 and
BMW M roadster in one of those car vs. car tests by the
performance-loving crowd at Road &AMP; Track. But they point out that
it's ``fun and predictable . . . If your bias is canted slightly
toward comfort, it's a small price to pay,'' the reference being to
the TT's less than razor-sharp handling.
</P>
<P>
   But one area in which the TT is sharp enough to dazzle is its
interior. Brightwork abounds, with colored leather given what Audi
calls ``baseball stitching'' and gleaming aluminum on the steering
wheel, the gauges and elsewhere. The brassy appearance may make
some uncomfortable, but the accommodations and equipment are way up
the comfort scale.
</P>
<P>
   As AutoWeek points out, the ``TT'' could easily stand for those
``Terrific Things,'' which is what Audi's roadster has in abundance
_ and not the least is its fun-in-the-sun (and wind) quotient.

EDITORIAL: REVIVING THE MIDEAST SUMMIT TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Aug. 19:
</P>
<P>
   Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. diplomats are exploring the
possibility of a new summit meeting to complete the peace
negotiations broken off at Camp David last month. Despite political
opposition in Israel, Prime Minister Ehud Barak has resolved to
push for a final-status agreement with the Palestinians before his
Parliament returns in late October. The Palestinian leader, Yasser
Arafat, hints encouragingly that he will postpone his threat to
proclaim an independent state if no agreement is reached by Sept.
13. But a new summit meeting only makes sense if there is a
realistic hope of breaking the impasse over Jerusalem that halted
the Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Israel was prepared to consider a U.S. proposal
that would have given the Palestinians control over parts of the
Old City containing Muslim holy sites, along with some outlying
Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem. But Arafat showed little
interest, and was forcefully reminded by other Arab countries,
particularly Egypt and Saudi Arabia, that anything less than full
Arab sovereignty over East Jerusalem was unacceptable to them. Both
countries warn that Islamic militants throughout the Arab world
might react violently if sovereignty over any part of East
Jerusalem is conceded to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   For any progress to be made at a new summit meeting, these U.S.
allies must take a more flexible position. Jerusalem is a highly
emotive issue for Muslims, as it is among Jews. But this is a time
for President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Crown Prince Abdullah of
Saudi Arabia to demonstrate leadership in the interest of regional
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary of State Edward Walker has just returned
from two weeks of discussions with Arab leaders in which he sought
their help in finding an acceptable compromise on Jerusalem. During
the same period Arafat has been traveling to Arab and Islamic
capitals, where he encountered little support for proceeding with
his independence declaration in September. By deferring such a
move, he can reduce the risks of new violence in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip and allow more time for negotiations. High-level talks
between Israelis and Palestinians resumed this week, assisted by
the U.S. mediator Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
   If there is to be a return to the summit, it should come within
the next month or so. The Jewish High Holy Days begin at the end of
September, quickly followed by the return of Israel's Parliament
for its fall term. If no agreement is reached by then, Barak is
sure to face renewed pressure from parties opposed to any further
compromises with the Palestinians. Meanwhile, the Clinton
administration's ability to broker an accord will fade as America's
elections approach. Now is the time for the Palestinians and
Israelis to concentrate on reaching an acceptable compromise on
Jerusalem and sealing a final peace.

SPORTS COLUMN: WARD HOPES TO STEP PAST `THE TRADE' 
</HEADLINE>
  By   WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ &UR;  &LR;  There was a day last week at New York
Jets camp when Dedric Ward, the Jets' fourth-year wide receiver,
was in a quiet, but upbeat, mood. Al Groh, the Jets' first-year
head coach, had officially named Ward as the Jets' starting wide
receiver alongside Wayne Chrebet.
</P>
<P>
   This was big news. Anything about the Jets' wide receivers is
big news ever since the organization sent Keyshawn Johnson to Tampa
Bay in the most controversial trade in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   All sorts of names had been floated around as candidates to fill
the void created by the Johnson trade. First, Carl Pickens was
coming from Cincinnati, then Sean Dawkins from Seattle. Then talk
turned to the armada of Jets rookie receivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets stuck with Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trading Keyshawn, then not bringing in another receiver,
showed a lot of faith in me,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets maintained that they were satisfied. Yes, the
5-foot-10-inch Chrebet and the 5-9 Ward were the shortest receiving
tandem in the league. But height was just a number.
</P>
<P>
   ``With receivers and running backs, they're not big or little;
they're effective,'' Groh said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, lo and behold, with the season bearing down on them, the
Jets acquired wide receiver Vincent Brisby after he was cut by New
England. Brisby's key selling point was _ guess what? _ his size.
While nobody mentioned the K-word, as in Keyshawn, Brisby, at 6-3,
gave the Jets the big target they were looking for, at least on
paper. That, anyway, is what the front office is selling to fans as
they attempt to justify the fact that they may have cut off their
noses to spite their face.
</P>
<P>
   With each practice, with each game, the Jets seem to be more
fully realizing that trading Johnson may well be one of those moves
that haunts the franchise for decades to come. It is Boston trading
Babe Ruth, the Nets trading Dr. J.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Dedric Ward could make everything right. And if he
does, the Jets' front office will no doubt take credit for having
the foresight and faith to have a soft-spoken third-round draft
pick replace the outspoken Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Ward got a vote of confidence from the man whose shoes
the Jets are desperately trying to fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty I've always liked Dedric Ward,'' Johnson said
from Tampa. ``To me, I've always thought he was a much better
player than the other guy,'' he added in a reference to Chrebet,
the receiver Johnson has often criticized as overrated and once
even described as a mascot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought he should have been the opposite receiver
from me, for a lot of different reasons,'' Johnson said of Ward.
``He fits the role of a vertical guy.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chrebet broke a bone in his foot in the 1999 preseason,
Ward became the No. 2 receiver for the first five games of the
regular season. He ended up with 15 receptions for 143 yards and 2
touchdowns. And this was with an overwhelmed Rick Mirer at
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   For the season, Ward caught 22 passes for 325 yards. Johnson had
89 receptions, and Chrebet 48. It wasn't Ward's best season; that
came in 1998, his second year, when he averaged 19.1 yards a catch
and established himself as a legitimate deep threat. Still, Ward
said he viewed his five starts a year ago as a ``steppingstone for
bigger and better things to come.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jets fans, for Bucs fans, this 2000 season has become an
intriguing drama: eyes on Groh, eyes on Johnson, eyes on Chrebet,
eyes on Ward. Perhaps, Chrebet in particular. Is he overrated, as
Johnson suggests? Can he carry the Jets' offense the way Johnson
did at times or the way Curtis Martin has done? Can he shut
Johnson's mouth?
</P>
<P>
   The defining scene of last season was a tough, but catchable,
pass bouncing off Chrebet's hands in the end zone against
Indianapolis, a pass that would have tied the score in the final
seconds of the game. This season, Chrebet will face the best
corners week in and week out. At the same time, the 25-year-old
Ward will be trying to break through to another level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll do a good job,'' Johnson said of Ward. ``But the
other guy _ I don't think he's good enough to take the heat off of
Dedric. I took the heat off of him; I don't think he's good enough
to take the heat off of Ward.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will catch those 9-to-14-yard passes in heavy traffic in
clutch situations for the Jets? Chrebet? Ward? Brisby?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, naturally, has his opinion: ``I don't know if they have
a receiver who can do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what we had last year, we really only had one guy who
could do that,'' Johnson said. ``And he's in Tampa now.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: PHANTOM ROGUES AT THE IRS 
</HEADLINE>
   -NYT   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 19:
</P>
<P>
   Congress conducted hearings in 1997 and 1998 on abuse of
taxpayers by agents of the Internal Revenue Service, inviting
self-proclaimed victims to testify how they had been harassed. The
chilling anecdotes, orchestrated by Republican leaders to buttress
their call for a less intrusive federal government, persuaded
Congress to pass new taxpayer protections. A provision of the 1998
law calls for the mandatory firing of agents who commit any one of
10 specific abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the first report card on the legislation.
Investigations by the agency and by an independent watchdog, the
Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, found that none
of the first 830 complaints of taxpayer harassment filed under the
1998 statute could be substantiated. Some were bogus attempts to
derail audits. Others were disproved or fell short of deliberate
harassment. The surprising result suggests that the problem of
rogue agents has been greatly exaggerated, with results that are
clearly harmful.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional anecdotes never amounted to more than a
handful of unsubstantiated claims of discriminatory treatment, such
as criminal investigations launched against taxpayers whom agents
deemed to be troublemakers. But studies conducted after the
hearings have documented no pattern of abuse. The nonpartisan
Government Accounting Office found the allegations made before
Congress to be generally groundless. Similarly, the watchdog report
finds no evidence of abuse after the law passed. The new law
appears to have brought any rogue agents that might have existed
into line. But there were probably not many rogues to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' assault on the agency has been needlessly damaging.
The IRS budget has been cut 30 percent since the 1980s despite the
steady rise in the number and complexity of returns. The 1998 law
threatens retaliation against overzealous agents. No surprise,
then, that enforcement efforts are shriveling. For high-income
families, audits have fallen to around 1 percent, a 90-percent drop
since 1988. Audits of large corporations have fallen by almost 40
percent since 1992. Seizures of property of delinquent taxpayers
are down 98 percent. The danger is that lax enforcement will
encourage cheating _ a problem that will not be noticed as long as
the economy booms and tax revenues soar.

 &HT;    No surrender in Dunlop
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ It's the most unlikely of final pairings in
today's third round of the PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   It's Scott Dunlap, 37, who has never won a PGA Tour event,
paired with Tiger Woods, 24, who has 21 PGA Tour victories in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   And, heck, Woods hasn't won a major championship all month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's won more majors than I've made cuts in,'' Dunlap said.
``It will be old hat for him and a new experience for me.''
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of no one, Woods rammed in an 18-foot putt for a
birdie at the 18th hole Friday to grab a one-shot lead over Dunlap
at 11-under-par 133 with a 5-under-par 67.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of practically everyone, Dunlap, the
globe-trotting veteran who plays out of the TPC at Sugarloaf, hung
tough, firing a 68 at a Valhalla course softened by a Thursday
night thunderstorm, to finish at 10-under 134.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap played with Woods once before, during the U.S. Open at
Congressional in 1997. He tied for 24th then, five spots below
Woods, who had not yet begun his sprint to world golf domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never seen so many people on a golf course in my entire
life,'' Dunlap said. ``It's not a social experience, but it will be
a nice day.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there's very little pressure on Dunlap, whose best
finish in a major was a tie for 10th at the 1999 British Open.
Woods is the one expected to rewrite history, seeking a third
straight major, to tie Ben Hogan's mark of 1953, after record routs
at the U.S. Open (15 shots) and British Open (eight).
</P>
<P>
   At least Woods, the defending PGA champion, is having to fight a
bit harder this time. He coasted by six shots through 36 holes at
Pebble Beach; by three shots at St. Andrews. Admittedly, Dunlap,
when he was a kid watching Jack Nicklaus in his prime, would have
given a newcomer to the situation little hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Done and dusted, for sure,'' Dunlap said. ``The majors are so
much more important and the better players relish those moments.
It's not that they're so much better; it's that they're so much
better in that situation. And that's why Tiger will be extremely
difficult to beat, because that's what he lives for. He actually
gets better at that time and at that moment, much like Jack did.''
</P>
<P>
   Sea Island's Davis Love III, who's four shots back at 7-under
137 after a 69, bogeyed his final two holes to lose valuable
ground. Also at 7-under are J.P. Hayes (68) and Fred Funk (68).
Five shots off the pace is Bob May, who had the day's low round, a
66.
</P>
<P>
   The cut (to the low 70 and ties) will not come until Saturday
morning, when 11 players conclude the second round, which was
halted at 8:32 p.m. by darkness. It's start was delayed an hour
Friday morning for the course to be cleaned up from a thunderstorm
that dumped three inches of rain Thursday night. The course played
longer Friday, but somewhat easlier, with more receptive greens and
kinder pins.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the grouping of Woods and Jack Nicklaus (with
Masters champion Vijay Singh barely noticed), emerged as the
featured attraction. After playing poorly on Thursday (77)
following the death of his mother Helen, the 60-year-old Nicklaus
managed a sometimes stirring 1-under 71, but missed the cut in his
37th and possibly final PGA.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup had its highlights. Nicklaus birdied the first two
holes, revving up the gallery. Woods nearly slam-dunked his second
shot at the 5th hole, after Nicklaus hit to within eight feet. At
the par-5 18th, Nicklaus nearly spun his third shot into the cup
for eagle, then made a 3-footer for birdie,
</P>
<P>
   ``You just knew he was going to birdie the last hole,'' Woods
said. ``It was kind of neat to look at the sight and take it all
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, miffed at himself for 3-putting the 17th for bogey
(missing a three-footer), got out of a tough spot at 18. His second
shot was semi-plugged in the greenside bunker, but he artfully
escaped to 18 feet, then sank the putt.

FEDERAL JUDGE ADMITS TO CLINTON INVESTIGATION LEAK 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court judge in Chicago said on
Friday that he was the source of a report on Thursday that a new
grand jury had been impaneled by the independent counsel
investigating President Clinton's relationship with a former White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The reports that a new grand jury was reviewing Clinton brought
an angry response on Thursday from Democrats and Republicans who
described the leak as an apparent effort to embarrass Vice
President Al Gore hours before he accepted the Democratic Party's
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Richard D. Cudahy of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Chicago, who was appointed to the bench by President
Carter in 1979, said he had inadvertently mentioned the new grand
jury to a reporter from The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Cudahy, one of three appellate judges who preside over
independent counsel matters, said the reaction to the report
prompted him to speak out on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel, Robert W. Ray, convened the new grand
jury in July after saying publicly that he would consider whether
Clinton should be charged after he leaves office in connection with
testimony in which he denied having a relationship with a White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Cudahy said Friday that he wanted ``to set the record
straight.'' ``I don't think it ever entered my head it had anything
to do with what was going on in the convention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he did not want prosecutors in the independent
counsel's office to be blamed for the leak. ``I didn't think Robert
Ray ought to get blamed for the whole thing as far as timing was
concerned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Sewert said Friday night that
``Wherever the information came from, even after $50 million, an
800-page report, proceedings in both houses of Congress, the
independent counsel seems to want this investigation to go on and
on and on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people have put this episode behind them and they
must be wondering why the independent counsel can't do the same,''
Sewert said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three appellate judges who preside over independent
counsel matters, Cudahy is the only Democratic appointee. The other
two judges, David B. Sentelle of the District of Columbia U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals and Peter T. Fay of the 11th U.S. Court of
Appeals in Atlanta, are Republican appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Cudahy said that he revealed the existence of the new grand jury
in response to the reporter's questions about a one-sentence order
issued late Wednesday by the three-judge panel. That order
authorized Ray to continue his investigation for another year, an
annual finding required by law.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he inadvertently mentioned the grand jury while
explaining why he had changed his position on the independent
counsel. Last year, Cudahy was the only one on the panel who voted
to terminate the independent counsel's operation.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in explaining his reason for changing his position
and voting this year to keep the inquiry open, he mentioned the new
grand jury to the reporter. The judge said Ray had told the
judicial panel earlier this year that the impanelling of the new
grand jury was one reason prosecutors should be allowed to continue
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the independent counsel's office said in a statement
that it condemned unauthorized disclosures of information.
</P>
<P>
   ``This disclosure subjected this office to unsubstantiated
accusations that this investigation intended to improperly impact
the political process,'' the office said in the statement, and
added that the timing of the disclosure ``undermines our ability to
complete this matter in a prompt, responsible and cost-effective
manner.''

U.S. SWIM COACH CALLS FOR INCREASE OF RANDOM TESTING 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The coach of the U.S. women's Olympic swimming team said Friday
that he was concerned that the sport's world governing body had not
conducted sufficient out-of-competition drug tests with the Summer
Games approaching next month in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Dara Torres, who at age 33 will be the first American to swim in
four Olympics, has been tested three times at competitions this
season, but not once out of competition, said Richard Quick, coach
of the women's Olympic team and also Torres' personal coach in Palo
Alto, Calif. Torres came out of retirement last year after a
seven-year layoff and qualified for Sydney in three individual
events.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-competition testing, which is done without notice, is
considered the most reliable way to catch cheaters. It is much
easier for athletes to avoid detection during competition, when
they know they will be tested. However, no tests exist for some
substances athletes are believed to be widely taking, so passing a
drug test is not always a reliable indication that cheating has not
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have arisen about how Torres could swim so fast after
a long layoff. She is eager to be tested, Quick said, to prove that
she does not take performance-enhancing substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are not testing someone like Dara, who was out of the
sport for seven years, then who are you testing?'' Quick said in a
telephone interview. ``I know Dara is not cheating. The rest of the
world can't, because she's not been tested. It's not fair to her or
the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Swimming's world governing body, FINA, said that its
out-of-competition tests were conducted on a random basis. Quick
said he believed the top swimmers should be tested more regularly.
Jenny Thompson, another of his top swimmers, has not been tested
out of competition since April, Quick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've run out of money for testing and they're
trying to hide behind saying the names just haven't come up on the
computer for testing,'' Quick said. ``I'm concerned about who
they're testing around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's swimming has had its credibility compromised by
widespread cheating among East German and Chinese athletes, and
also by the suspension of the Irish swimmer Michelle Smith de
Bruin, who won three gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
Quick said the U.S. swimming federation and the U.S. Olympic
Committee should also be more forceful in testing. Neither group
has tested Torres out of competition this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If FINA is not doing enough, they need to pick up the slack,''
Quick said. Speaking of Olympic officials, national and
international, he said: ``They don't put this as a priority.
They're not going to stop flying first class to put more money into
the testing program.'' &QL;

AETNA WANTS LAWSUITS IN FEDERAL COURT BROUGHT FROM MIAMI TO
PHILADELPHIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Pa., Texas, Mo.)   By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heartened by a federal court victory in Philadelphia last week,
lawyers for two health insurance companies are seeking to
consolidate a several lawsuits filed in Miami by consumers accusing
their managed care companies of misleading them.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance companies, Aetna and Humana, also hope to transfer
the suits from Miami to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. district judge who is hearing arguments in the cases in
Miami said Thursday that he would rule soon on whether to suspend
action there while requests to move the suits are decided.
</P>
<P>
   The consumers suing the insurance companies are seeking
class-action status for their suits and say the main issues in the
cases are still in contention. Their suit contends the managed care
companies violated at least two federal laws. The suit by the
consumers states that the companies are violating racketeering laws
by misleading consumers about the quality of health care those
covered are receiving, and they contend that the insurance
companies are violating their fiduciary duties under the Employee
Retirement and Income Security Act, or Erisa, the federal law that
regulates employee benefit plans.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court in Philadelphia ruled last week that the
U.S. Healthcare unit of Aetna did not violate racketeering laws
when it advertised that it was providing quality medical care even
as it was encouraging cost-cutting by doctors. The company had
defended the advertising as permissible ``puffery,'' a term used to
describe embellishment common _ and legal _ in advertising and
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides in the managed care lawsuits said that
ruling, which upheld dismissal of the racketeering charge by a
lower court last October, was a blow to arguments in suits across
the country that rely on the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt
Organization law, which can result in triple damage awards.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the consumers bringing the suits said the ruling
in Philadelphia did not apply to the types of racketeering claims
they are making in the Florida cases. And they are still seeking
court rulings on charges that managed care practices violate other
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Neuwirth, one of the consumers' lawyers, said that in a
ruling in June, the Supreme Court offered indirect support for
assertions that managed care officials had violated their fiduciary
duties to patients under Erisa. He said that the high court
suggested that managed care companies might have a fiduciary duty
to disclose information beyond the requirements of the Erisa law.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is likely to face the issue of disclosure
under Erisa again. Neuwirth, a partner with Boies Schiller &AMP;
Flexner, said appeals courts had ruled both for and against the
managed care industry on the issue: supporting the companies in a
Texas case and ruling against them in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The main thrust of the Supreme Court decision in June, however,
upheld core practices of managed care. In that case, the court
dismissed a federal lawsuit by an Illinois woman, Cynthia Herdrich.
She asserted that her health plan had violated its duty under Erisa
by placing its own financial interests ahead of its members'
well-being by offering incentives to doctors to restrict care.
</P>
<P>
   In the Herdrich ruling, Justice David Souter wrote for the court
that financial incentives were essential to managed care, and noted
that Congress had encouraged the managed care system.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawyers for the insurance companies declined to speak
for publication.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna and its Prudential Health Care unit _ both U.S. Healthcare
and Prudential Health Care are part of Aetna _ have asked a
committee of federal judges, the Multidistrict Litigation Panel, to
consolidate at least eight cases against Aetna and Prudential and
transfer them to Philadelphia. Industry lawyers said several other
managed care companies were considering making similar requests to
the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the consumers suing the insurance companies,
including some from firms that have won class-action settlements
against tobacco companies, have asked the judges panel to
consolidate the federal managed care cases in Miami. The panel is
expected to decide the issue at a Sept. 22 meeting in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Miami Thursday said that he would rule next
month on a separate request by Humana to dismiss the suits against
that company. Humana had agreed to consolidate the suits in hopes
of obtaining an early decision.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the federal suits, Aetna, Kaiser Permanente and
other managed care companies are also being sued under state
consumer protection laws.

FIRE'S ARMAS SIDELINED, TO MISS GALAXY GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A day after being named to the United States'
Olympic soccer team, midfielder Chris Armas of the Chicago Fire has
suffered a possible season-ending knee sprain.
</P>
<P>
   It came at the worst possible time for Armas, who sprained his
left medial collateral ligament in the first half of the U.S.
national team's 7-0 World Cup qualifying victory over Barbados on
Wednesday. After an MRI on Thursday, Chicago team officials said
Armas will be out three to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will Armas miss today's game with the Los Angeles
Galaxy at Soldier Field, but he will miss Wednesday's U.S. Open Cup
semifinal against the Galaxy at Cal State Fullerton, along with a
World Cup qualifier (Sept. 3 against Guatemala) and possibly the
Olympics and MLS playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Armas was one of three over-age players named to the team, which
is made up of players under 23 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to make it to the Olympics,'' said Armas, a former
Galaxy midfielder. ``It's going to be close.''
</P>
<P>
   If Armas is unavailable for the Olympics, Galaxy midfielder
Sasha Victorine, named an alternate, could be chosen to replace
Armas.
</P>
<P>
   Armas has established himself as the United States' best
defensive midfielder and man-marker. Galaxy defender Greg Vanney
said Armas is the one player Chicago can't afford to lose. The Fire
is already missing starters Lubos Kubik and Diego Gutierrez because
of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you why Chris is so important,'' said Vanney, the
hero of Wednesday's 1-0 victory over Colorado, scoring with two
minutes left in sudden-death overtime. ``He really knows (Mauricio)
Cienfuegos.''
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos is the Galaxy playmaker, but he's usually a
non-factor when paired against Armas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris is as quick as (Cienfuegos), he's similar size and he's
stronger than Cien, so he gives him fits,'' said Vanney. ``With
Armas not there, it means they have to use Jesse Marsch or someone
who is just not Chris.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the Galaxy (12-7-8, 44 points) face Chicago
(12-9-5, 41 points) twice in the next five days, but the Fire could
also be the Galaxy's first-round opponent when the playoffs start
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago trails the Galaxy by three points in the race for the
fourth playoff seed and home-field advantage in the first round of
the playoffs. If the Galaxy can push that margin to six, the Fire
doesn't have much of a chance. But if the Fire can pull even today,
Chicago has an advantage with a game in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``At full strength, we're probably the best two teams in the
league,'' Galaxy defender Paul Caligiuri said. ``Them missing Armas
is unfortunate because he's really the glue to that team,
offensively and defensively. He's the type of player you need on
your team to win championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way, we still have a lot of respect for Chicago. This
is the one team we need to face and believe we can beat. I think
winning in dramatic fashion the other night gives us a little
momentum heading into this game.''

 &HT;    Tillie Tooter talks about her 3-day ordeal
 &HT;    By Clay Lambert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Fourteen television cameras followed an
83-year-old woman Friday as a hospital attendant wheeled her toward
a mountain of microphones in a Broward General Medical Center
conference room.
</P>
<P>
   A nasty bruise stretched from the left side of the woman's
forehead to a point just below her eye. The bruising continued up
her left arm, fighting dozens of fresh bug bites for the attention
of their host.
</P>
<P>
   When the woman was in position, the attendant leaned into the
microphones and said:
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can see, Tillie Tooter is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since a little Cuban boy came ashore in Miami has one
unassuming person assumed so much attention in South Florida.
Friday, the woman who survived three days dangling between
Interstate 595 and the swamp below, put on a show for the media.
When she finished a half-hour later, a room made hot by dozens of
jaded journalists burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   Tooter's life-and-death adventure began shortly before 3 a.m.
Saturday. She walked out of her apartment that morning, beginning
what should have been a 15-minute jaunt to Fort
Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport to pick up her
granddaughter and the young woman's boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   But Tooter never made it to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Heading east on I-595, one mile west of the airport, her Toyota
Tercel was hit from behind. The force of the crash sent Tooter's
car over a 3-foot concrete barrier and into a tangle of trees 40
feet below the roadway. The hit-and-run driver left the scene.
</P>
<P>
   At least two witnesses to the collision called 911 but
responding emergency crews failed to find evidence of the crash.
When those crews left, Tooter's ordeal began.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall, Tooter unbuckled her seat belt and flipped out
of the driver's seat into the passenger side of the car, she said.
When no one answered her screams for help, Tooter began to blare
the car horn with her foot. She switched the car's headlights on,
then off. Still, no one came.
</P>
<P>
   ``I screamed, I ranted, I cursed, I pleaded and I begged,'' she
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Soon she began to take stock of the things that might keep her
alive. She found the Tercel's pantry nearly bare: A single cough
drop. A pack of gum. Some peppermints. And a button.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sucked on the button to produce moisture in my mouth,'' she
said. ``I had heard a long time ago that would help.''
</P>
<P>
   As she told her tale, Tooter surveyed the disbelieving, mostly
much younger faces of the reporters who had gathered around her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are all so young, but when you live to be 83 years old,
you learn a lot of things along the way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the crash, she caught rainwater in a steering
wheel cover. She also used socks to soak up the rain, then sucked
the moisture out of the socks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every little bit helped,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also sought ways to pass the time _ any distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sang songs,'' she said. ``Songs from the 40s and 50s, the
ones by the name bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reciting things that I had heard in my lifetime. I was
thinking of people who were here and people who are not still
here,'' Tooter said.
</P>
<P>
   But as the ordeal dragged on, Tooter said her resolve weakened.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel there is nothing left for you in the world,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tooter worried that her granddaughter, Lori Simms, would feel
guilty because of the circumstances that led her grandmother to
that stretch of roadway. So Tooter scribbled a loving note on the
back of a Publix receipt. She said she figured if rescuers couldn't
find her in time, they might at least find the note someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made my peace,'' she said. ``I thought I was dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighty hours passed between the time Tooter's car tumbled over
the embankment and the Tuesday morning when a 15-year-old road
crewman peered over the highway's edge to see what had bent back
the trees. Justin Vannelli found a woman alive and a friend for
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seen her leg,'' Vannelli told reporters at the same press
conference on Friday. ``She was trying to stick her arm out and I
told her to stay still.''
</P>
<P>
   Tooter said she yelled up to Vannelli, but the teenager said he
couldn't hear anything against the roar of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told her to hang on, that help was coming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the hospital, the hero met the rescued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I embarrassed him,'' Tooter said. ``I kissed him, not
once, but twice. I love him forever. He saved my life. I'm here
because of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Vannelli said he is just the type of person who helps others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm real happy she is all right,'' Vannelli said.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked Tooter how she felt, she responded:
``About what?''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital lists her in fair condition. There was no date set
for Tooter's release, a hospital spokeswoman said. Tooter is
receiving fluids intravenously, but not other medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm itching all over, I'm black and blue, but I'm here,''
Tooter said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Florida Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. John Bagnardi
said the department has a ``decent lead'' on the hit-and-run
driver. Investigators impounded the car of a driver who claimed to
have been in a single-car wreck that night, just east of where
Tooter was found. That driver's name was not immediately released
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Simms, Tooter's daughter, is angry that no one returned to
recheck the bridge, particularly after her family reported that
Tooter disappeared driving to the airport. I-595 was her obvious
route.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who to be upset with _ the (Florida) Highway
Patrol, the fire department, whoever,'' she said. ``I realize that
in the spot she was in she was difficult to see, but when you get
all of those cell phone calls coming in, you have to keep
looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Tooter, though, places the blame on the other driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hurt that anybody could do anything like that and
leave,'' she said. ``I hope he gets what he deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her demolished car, Tooter won't have to walk home from
the hospital. On Friday, a Toyota distributorship gave her a new
Corolla and a Boca Raton company donated something she could have
used a week earlier: A voice-activated global positioning system
that would have allowed her to call for help without a telephone.

  PROGRESS IS SEEN IN TALKS AS PHONE STRIKE CONTINUES
<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiators for more than 86,000 striking telephone workers and
Verizon Communications reached tentative agreement on several
critical issues, but an overall settlement of the 13-day walkout
remained bogged down in the details.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon agreed to move less than 1 percent of its employees each
year to other places, and it broadened an agreement to organize
employees of Verizon's wireless division, people close to the talks
said.
</P>
<P>
   CHIP STOCKS EXTEND THEIR RALLY
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor stocks extended their recent rally. The
Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.1 percent, bringing its
six-day gain to 20 percent. It is still down 10 percent since
mid-July. Still, losses elsewhere sent the Nasdaq composite index
down 10.53 points, or 0.3 percent, to 3,930.34. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index lost 4.35 points, to 1,491.72. The Dow Jones
industrial average declined 9.16 points, to 11,046.48.

<P>
   DELAY SOUGHT IN NASDAQ PLAN REVIEW
</P>
<P>
   Two members of Congress who oversee the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Sen. Phil Gramm and Rep. Thomas Bliley, have asked the
commission to delay its review of a plan that is intended to give
investors more information about the way Nasdaq stocks are traded,
and fairer prices.

   HARCOURT PLANS AN ONLINE COLLEGE
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt General will formally apply on Monday for approval to
operate an online college. The educational publisher is trying to
join a handful of private companies offering college-level courses
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH CARE COMPANIES HEARTENED
</P>
<P>
   Heartened by a federal court victory in Philadelphia last week
in the managed-care wars, lawyers for several large
health-insurance companies are seeking to consolidate a slew of
lawsuits accusing managed-care companies of misleading their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. TRADE DEFICIT CLIMBS TO RECORD
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trade deficit widened to a record $30.6 billion in June
as the appetite for foreign crude oil increased even as prices were
the highest in nearly 10 years. The deficit expanded from a revised
$30.3 billion in May, the Commerce Department reported.
</P>
<P>
   UNION PUTS FIRESTONE ON NOTICE
</P>
<P>
   The United Steelworkers of America said it had issued a strike
notice to Firestone, posing another potential burden for the tire
maker, which is already conducting a huge tire recall. The union
said contract extension agreements, covering more than 8,000
workers at nine plants, would expire in 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   BIDDING WAR SEEN FOR SEAGRAM UNIT
</P>
<P>
   Diageo of Britain, the world's leading liquor company, and
Pernod Ricard of France said they would team up to compete for the
wine and spirits business of Seagram. The move is likely to start a
bidding war with Allied Domecq, the No. 2 liquor concern, that
could push the price toward $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   INSURERS AGREE TO $1.2 BILLION DEAL
</P>
<P>
   American International Group, one of the world's largest
insurers, agreed to acquire HSB Group, parent of Hartford Steam
Boiler Inspection and Insurance Co., for about $1.2 billion in
stock. The deal will bolster AIG's range of products by adding
several specialty insurance lines.
</P>
<P>
   QXL TO BUY RIVAL FOR $256.5 MILLION
</P>
<P>
   The British Internet auctioneer QXL agreed to buy a German
rival, Ricardo.de, although it lowered its original offer by nearly
three-quarters, to 171 million pounds, or $256.5 million, after
learning that Ricardo's fourth-quarter revenue had declined
sharply.

PROGRESS IN PHONE TALKS, BUT NO OVERALL ACCORD YET 
</HEADLINE>
  By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiators for more than 86,000 striking telephone workers and
Verizon Communications reached tentative agreements on several
critical issues Friday, but an overall settlement to the 13-day
walkout remained bogged down in details.
</P>
<P>
   Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America,
and Lawrence T. Babbio Jr., Verizon's president and co-chairman,
worked through the early morning hours and into the day in a
bargaining session that left both men and their associates
weary-eyed yet satisfied, people close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues Bahr and Babbio agreed on were limits to the
movement of work resulting from the merger of Bell Atlantic and the
GTE Corp., which created Verizon, and the broadening of an
agreement to organize employees of Verizon's wireless division, the
people close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon agreed to move less than 1 percent of its employees each
year to other places using criteria based on the geographical
location of the workers and not the net total of its work force _
an important concession to one union demand, people close to the
talks said.
</P>
<P>
   And a tentative agreement reached last week that would make the
organizing of wireless workers easier in the 12-state region
affected by the strike would also potentially ease the organizing
of several hundred employees in Verizon Wireless retail stores,
according to people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while Verizon and the unions reached broad agreement on some
important issues, it seemed late Friday that the minutiae of a deal
was slowing negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of progress has been made, but there is a consensus
process that needs to be carried out for a comprehensive agreement
to be reached,'' said Jeff Miller, a spokesman for the
communications workers' union, which represents about 72,000
striking employees.
</P>
<P>
   Before the strike is settled, about 35 people on the bargaining
committee of the communications workers' union need to sign off on
high-level negotiators' progress. And the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers, which represents more than 14,000 workers,
needs to ratify its own agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Both unions could reach an agreement with Verizon at different
times, possibly prolonging the strike for some workers, although
this is unlikely, representatives from both unions said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Verizon attempted to deal with with delays in
repairing and installing telephone service and with vandalism that
has interrupted phone service for thousands of Verizon customers
since the strike began. In addition, hundreds of thousands of
consumers were inconvenienced on Friday by a technical failure at
Verizon.
</P>
<P>
   About 11:35 p.m. Thursday, a complex piece of communications
equipment that helps connect Verizon's local network to the
long-distance systems of other companies failed at a Verizon site
in Rochelle Park, N.J. Until about 12:20 p.m. on Friday, several
hundred thousand of Verizon's local phone customers in New Jersey,
mostly in Bergen County, but also in Passaic County, were unable to
make long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of AT&AMP;T's wireless phone subscribers, in New
Jersey and in parts of New York City, suffered a more severe
problem: the inability to make any calls at all. In the Northeast,
AT&AMP;T uses Verizon's land-based communications network to link the
various antennas used for wireless calls. The Rochelle Park
failure, which began in a circuit card that controls complicated
timing sequences, disrupted AT&AMP;T's wireless system.
</P>
<P>
   A Verizon spokesman said that no unionized workers were in the
Rochelle Park site at the time of the failure and that the problems
were technical.

 &HT;    Rudolph tab nears $25 million
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The 31-month search for Atlanta Olympic bombing
suspect Eric Robert Rudolph has cost the FBI an estimated $11.2
million, bringing the publicly acknowledged cost of the search to
$24.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The total includes $13.4 million in state and federal expenses
estimated previously, plus the new FBI estimate issued in response
media requests.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has spent the most money during the intense search of
the Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina, where Rudolph
grew up.
</P>
<P>
   FBI expenses include salaries, benefits, travel, transportation,
supplies, services and equipment. However, the agency's estimate
spans only from Oct. 1, 1998, through Sept. 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities began searching for Rudolph on Jan. 29, 1998. That
morning, officials charge, he detonated a nail bomb at the New
Woman All Women Health Care Clinic in Birmingham that killed an
off-duty police officer providing security at the abortion clinic
and maimed a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say Rudolph disappeared into a part of the dense
Appalachians renowned for its hiking and whitewater rafting. A
heavily armed task force pursued him to Andrews, N.C., and hunkered
down for two years. The command post, a former textile mill leased
from the town, cost $5,250 a month.
</P>
<P>
   When leads cooled earlier this year, the Southeast Bomb Task
Force retreated to a token presence and closed the command center.
Its lead agent was reassigned to Washington. The last verified
sighting of Rudolph was in July 1998 near Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, 33, is charged in three Atlanta bombings: the deadly
explosion at Centennial Olympic Park during the Atlanta Games on
July 27, 1996, and the blasts in 1997 at an abortion clinic in the
Atlanta area and The Otherside Lounge, a gay and lesbian nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   In March, task force chief Steve McCraw said there was no reason
to believe Rudolph was anywhere but in the forests of North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you put a price tag on the investigation'' of
such an important terrorism suspect, McCraw said. ``Moreover, I
think it's imperative that would-be terrorists know that if they
commit such an act, the combined resources of local, state and
federal law enforcement agencies are going to be used to bring them
to justice.''

DELAY SOUGHT IN REVIEW OF PLAN TO GIVE INVESTORS MORE NASDAQ PRICE
DATA 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr., R-Va.,
have asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to delay its
review of a plan intended to give investors more information about
Nasdaq stocks and trades at the best available prices.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the SEC on Thursday, Gramm and Bliley, who are
chairmen of committees that oversee the SEC, asked the commission
to add 30 days to a comment period now set to expire Aug. 30. At
issue is a proposal to combine price quotes for stocks from
different trading systems into one ``supermontage'' on the Nasdaq.
Under SEC rules, the commission can approve the proposal any time
after the comment period expires.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs
Nasdaq, says the new system would enable investors to make sure
they are getting the best price when they buy and sell stocks. But
electronic communications networks, like Instinet, which directly
match buyers and sellers of Nasdaq stocks, argue that the proposal
will make Nasdaq both a regulator and a competitor of electronic
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues raised by this proposal are significant and must be
considered and addressed only with the greatest of care,'' Gramm
and Bliley wrote to Arthur Levitt, the SEC chairman. ``Market
participants, investors, regulatory agencies and Congress must all
have adequate time to review these proposals, consult and evaluate
their implications.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter does not take a position on the merits of the
supermontage proposal itself. A spokesman for Bliley said he had
not yet decided whether to support or oppose the changes. Bliley is
``concerned that we not move in to implement too quickly such a new
idea that will affect our markets,'' the spokesman said. ``There's
certainly not consensus on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the supermontage proposal, electronic networks and market
makers, which are brokerage firms that buy and sell shares from
investors, would be encouraged to send their orders to buy and sell
stocks to a central server maintained by Nasdaq. (Electronic
networks make money by charging a small per-share fee to match
investors directly; market makers profit on the difference between
the bid and offer price on a trade.) Investors would be able to see
the aggregate of all buy and sell orders at both the best bid and
offer prices and two ``price levels'' above and below the best bid
and offer.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if market makers and electronic networks have
collectively offered to buy 10,000 shares of Cisco at $65 and sell
12,000 shares at $65.05, investors would be able to see the entire
pool of orders on the supermontage. Investors would also be able to
see the orders at the next-lowest offer and next-highest bid, as
well as the third-highest bid and third-lowest offer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the supermontage proposal would essentially end the
difference between limit orders and quotes, which are treated
differently under the current Nasdaq system. That means if an
investor wanted to buy 15,000 shares of Cisco with a limit of
$65.05, and 12,000 shares were available at that price, the
investor would buy the available shares and have the new highest
bid price, for 3,000 shares at $65.05.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq argues that the supermontage proposal will simplify
and improve its current system, which is a hodgepodge of quotes,
limit orders and prices that are sometimes out of date. The
proposal will also give investors a better sense of the total buy
and sell interest, or liquidity, available from all market
participants, Nasdaq says.
</P>
<P>
   But electronic networks, which account for a rapidly growing
share of the Nasdaq's volume, say that the proposal essentially
turns Nasdaq into a competitor that is biased against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Nasdaq might be positioning this otherwise,'' said
Douglas Atkins, chief executive of Instinet, the largest electronic
network, ``this fundamentally changes Nasdaq's role in the
marketplace, creates a competitor to the institutions that they
regulate and creates concerns for investors.'' Instinet is a unit
of Reuters Group PLC.

<P>
   The diamond advertised by ``mrwatch'' on eBay was precisely what
Robert and Teri La Plant wanted.
</P>
<P>
   A 1.41 carat marquise-cut diamond that was of good quality and
could be used to upgrade her old engagement ring for their 10th
wedding anniversary last September. They were told by mrwatch, a
seller of estate jewelry, that the diamond had not been
artificially enhanced and, though it had a small flaw, it was
described as not visible to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   The La Plants checked mrwatch's feedback rating, which had more
than 600 positive responses, zero neutral comments and one negative
comment. So they felt that mrwatch, who is now an eBay ``power
seller'' _ one who has achieved certain levels of sales and service
_ would be a safe bet. For reassurance, they checked eBay's
insurance and fraud policies. EBay insures an item for up to $175
($200, less a $25 deductible), but La Plant was pleased to find
that the company pledged to remove sellers involved in cases in
which insurance was paid out.
</P>
<P>
   He was soon disappointed. When his $2,950 purchase disintegrated
into finger-pointing over who was responsible for a chip in the
diamond, La Plant said, he received no support from eBay. Even
today, he added, the seller, despite an insurance payment in the
case, has never been removed or suspended.
</P>
<P>
   La Plant, who lives in the Houston area, is trying to organize a
class action suit against eBay, contending that it failed to act
against fraud, particularly when it comes to big sellers. Ebay is
currently facing a class action lawsuit in California that contends
that it failed to act against sale of fake sports memorabilia
despite years of warnings. The suit contends that designations like
``power seller'' give buyers a false sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Chesnut, associate general counsel for eBay, said the
company has several services to protect buyers. Three were in place
at the time of La Plant's purchase _ the feedback system providing
buyer comments about transactions, an escrow service to hold funds
until deals are successfully concluded and the insurance policy,
which is free.
</P>
<P>
   But, Chesnut said, eBay does not become directly involved in
trying to resolve such situations. Instead, when fraud is
suspected, he said, eBay tries to facilitate notification of law
enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Chesnut disputed La Plant's accusation that the site goes easy
on power sellers, noting that he personally had suspended dozens of
such sellers in the last year. Mrwatch was not suspended _ although
La Plant said he was told in an e-mail message that action would be
taken if a claim were paid _ because mrwatch has a high approval
rating, more than 1,800 positive responses and only 8 negatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should eBay jump in and say, `We are not going to let you do
business on our Web site because your satisfaction rate is 99
percent'?'' Chesnut asked, adding, ``We're not in a good position
to evaluate in a singular instance who's right and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   La Plant said he found a chip on the diamond immediately after
receiving it by UPS and, within an hour, took it to a jeweler for a
professional assessment.
</P>
<P>
   La Plant returned the diamond and asked for a refund. In
response, mrwatch replied that there was nothing wrong with the
diamond when it was shipped and accused him of damaging the
diamond.
</P>
<P>
   Al Bagon, who, along with his wife Judy, trades on eBay as
mrwatch, said, ``we've done nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bagons, the diamond went out with an appraisal
verifying its quality. They speculated that La Plant received the
diamond, thought he overpaid and then either tried to switch the
diamond or chipped it himself so he get a refund.
</P>
<P>
   In response, La Plant said the appraisal was a year and a half
old.
</P>
<P>
   The La Plant dispute is one of many about sales on eBay. But
most involve far less money, and the company has regularly said
that less than 1 percent of sales on its site involve fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Other disappointed customers are more philosophical. Shelley
Sangmaster, of Rodeo, Calif., said putting much faith in merchant
ratings might be misguided. She said she bought three autographed
business cards for about $430 from a highly rated site but never
received them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of consider it gambling,'' she said. ``Generally, I
stick to things that aren't more than $25. Then, if it doesn't show
up, oh well.''
</P>

 &HT;    GINGRICH, BISEK WED IN NIGHTTIME CEREMONY BEFORE FAMILY, FRIENDS

<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was married
Friday night to Calista Bisek, the congressional secretary with
whom he has been romantically involved for the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding, Gingrich's third and Bisek's first, took place in
front of 150 guests at the Morrison House, a small, expensive and
somewhat secluded hotel in Alexandria's historic Old Town district.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, in black-tie and tails, beamed broadly as soon as he
saw the blonde bride being escorted by her father to the altar
where the Rev. James Ford, the former chaplain of the U.S. House of
Representatives married them.
</P>
<P>
   Bisek admitted in a court deposition a year ago that she and
Gingrich had been having an affair since November 1993, more than a
year before he engineered the first Republican takeover of the
House since the 1950s and became speaker.
</P>
<P>
   She was deposed by lawyers for Gingrich's second wife, Marianne.
Gingrich filed for divorce from Marianne Gingrich on July 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But with the state flags of Georgia and Wisconsin, Bisek's home
state, flying over the hotel beside the U.S. flag and a string
quintet playing Pachebel's Canon in D, Gingrich and his new bride
seemed radiantly happy, making their separate ways down a curving
set of steps at the hotel's entrance and into a nearby tent.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel officials said the former speaker ``just beamed'' when
Bisek and her father, Alfonse Bisek, entered the tent.
</P>
<P>
   The bride wore a white strapless gown with a short train and
carried white roses. Her bride's maids wore black gowns and carried
bouquets of red roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those roses are red. I'm a biologist and I know,'' said Carla
Fehr, one of several Old Town residents who watched the wedding
from behind police lines, along with journalists.
</P>
<P>
   A soprano sang Ave Maria and The Lord's Prayer, and guests _
primarily family and friends _ sang Ode to Joy during the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Wanda McKeon, general manager of the Morrison House, said
Gingrich had reserved the entire hotel, which has 43 rooms and
suites that range from $180 to $500 a night, as well as the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   After the wedding, guests dined on filet mignon and Alaskan
salmon, which was grilled according to a recipe provided by Sen.
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. Then they returned to the tent for dancing.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Spurred by growing Internet use in Japan, Kazutomo Hori
in 1995 built Paradise Web, an Internet site that offered chat
lines and bulletin boards. The service thrived, but Hori could not
figure out how to get users to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talked about obtaining revenue from advertisements and
charging users with electronic money,'' said Hori, who considered
asking customers to make bank transfers or even send in stamps for
payment. ``But when will that happen? Ten years from now?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hori's anxious days are over. Early in 1999, Japanese
wireless communications carriers, including NTT DoCoMo, DDI Corp.
and Japan Telecom Co., introduced mobile-phone-based Internet
services. The wireless Web not only increased the time people could
spend on the Internet, it gave Hori, 34, and other service
providers an easy way to collect subscription fees _ through
customers' mobile phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new business model'' for information providers on the
Internet, said Toby Rodes, an analyst with Nikko Salomon Smith
Barney in Tokyo. ``With the PC, they made a mistake and put up all
the contents for free, and you can't go back and start charging
people. With mobile Internet, there will always be price for
content.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if the Japanese model can be transplanted
to North America and Europe, where markets are more fragmented and
customer tastes vary. To hedge their bets, however, foreign
companies including Yahoo and Intel have invested in some Japanese
wireless Web businesses to tap growth here or investigate the
possibility of duplicating services in the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese have been doing the same. NTT DoCoMo, Japan's
largest wireless carrier and the originator of the greatly popular
i-mode wireless Web service in this country, is in talks with
BellSouth and SBC Communications of the United States about
acquiring a minority stake in a wireless phone venture created by
the two regional Bell companies. NTT DoCoMo is also a partner of
one of the winning bidders for licenses to operate new
third-generation wireless services just auctioned in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the relative ease of collecting fees for wireless
Internet services has created an entrepreneurial boom. Dozens of
services, from restaurant guides to surf forecasts, have already
captured large numbers of users and new ones are announced almost
daily _ offering games, weather, traffic information, stock quotes,
even cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet companies in the United States struggle to
generate profits, many Japanese mobile-phone content providers are
in the black within months of going into business. They simply add
their fees, usually less than $5 a month, to their subscribers'
cellular phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of wireless Web services in Japan has mirrored the
success of mobile phones linked to the Internet. Since NTT DoCoMo
started its i-mode wireless Web service a year and a half ago,
almost 10 million subscribers have signed up. Two other cellular
groups, Japan Telecom Co. and three carriers due to merge into KDDI
Corp. in October, count 1.7 million and 3 million users,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   DoCoMo says it has more than 19,000 Web sites designed for
i-mode users. (Web sites must be formatted for Web phone use, and
each carrier adopts a different standard.)
</P>
<P>
   Cybird Co., of which Hori is president, offers 50 services to
mobile Web surfers, and has discontinued Paradise Web, its
unprofitable Internet site designed for personal computer users.
One of Cybird's most popular offerings, Nami-Densetsu, charges each
of its 85,000 subscribers 300 yen, or $2.77, a month for the wave
conditions at 147 points on Japan's coasts as well as a guide to
surf events and shops.
</P>
<P>
   Hori said most of his wireless Web projects are profitable
within several months of being introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Bandai Co., a toy maker that created the blockbuster Tamagotchi
digital pet, runs Japan's most popular mobile Internet service, a
year-old Web site called Charappa. For a monthly fee of 100 yen,
1.3 million subscribers can embellish their cell phones with
copyrighted screen-saver images of popular musicians or cartoon
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers, many of them teen-agers, are happy to pay. ``It's
cute,'' said Sei Yoshida, a 17-year-old Tokyo high school student,
who showed off the image of her favorite singer, Ringo Shiina.
</P>
<P>
   One reason people who resist paying for services on their
personal computers are willing to subscribe to wireless Web
services is convenience. Not only can they pay without giving
credit card information over the Internet, but they can also find
reliable information more easily.
</P>
<P>
   Each phone company provides subscribers with a menu of services
tailored to their interests. These menus let customers sign on to a
service with a click of a button rather than finding and typing in
a complete Web address. Service providers are also vetted by the
phone companies before being added to the menu, giving consumers
added confidence in what they are buying.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, an offer to buy a celebrity's jacket or other personal
effect on the Web might be greeted skeptically if someone came
across it while surfing the Net on a desktop computer, Hori of
Cybird said. ``Would anybody trust it?'' he asked. ``But if it's on
a carrier's official menu, most people would believe it _ and 99.9
percent of the time, the thing is real.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyers and sellers can be confident about wireless Web
transactions, he added, because both sides of each transaction are
vetted by the phone company _sellers when they seek to join the
official menu, and buyers when they sign a contract for wireless
service.
</P>
<P>
   While customers can type in any Web address, the small,
10-button keypads on mobile phones make that burdensome. The
tailored menu offered by the carrier has become the preferred
destination for most Web phone surfers and has given the carrier
the power of life and death over the content providers.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a world of difference'' whether you are on the
carrier's menu or not, said Osamu Matsueda, who edits the wireless
version of Web pages for Recruit Co., which publishes employment
ads and provides a service notifying individual job seekers of
openings in their fields.
</P>
<P>
   Recruit supplies both official and unofficial contents for NTT
DoCoMo, which has about 800 types of games and services on the menu
of its i-mode service.
</P>
<P>
   On the cellular phone, ``people don't necessarily assume that
the service would be free,'' said Tsuyoshi Kuwabara, research
director at Wit Capital Japan. ``And the fact that the carrier
collects money for the content providers is crucial. Not having a
solid way to collect money is what makes start-up firms
vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage for wireless Web services, Kuwabara said, is
that being on the menu of a popular service like i-mode obviates
the need for advertising, since users often saunter into sites
without any soliciting.
</P>
<P>
   In a boon to copyright-conscious content owners like record
companies and publishers, the wireless Web offers protection not
known on the PC-based Internet. Since the carrier controls the
hardware and adopts the specifications, users cannot easily
duplicate digital data that is distributed to cellular terminals.
</P>
<P>
   As promising as the wireless Web in Japan is for entrepreneurs
selling services, the biggest winners may be the phone companies
themselves as customers clock up hundreds of extra minutes a month
while surfing the Net. One entrepreneur estimated that NTT DoCoMo,
through air-time fees, makes 10 to 20 times what he does from his
service. DoCoMo also collects 9 percent of what service providers
charge their customers, for acting as middleman and bill collector.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneur said that at some future point, his company
hoped to negotiate terms for it to receive at least 5 percent of
the revenue from the calling fees charged to use his service.
</P>
<P>
   Others are also eager to tap this market. Bandai has received
dozens of requests from European carriers to discuss how they might
jointly offer a service similar to Charappa outside Japan, said
Toshiki Hayashi, general manager of the company's network business.
Bandai has yet to find someone offering suitable terms. ``Some have
asked for 90 percent of the fees we charge users,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may be able to benefit, too. Takeshi Tajima, Internet
analyst at Wit Capital, estimates that there are already more than
100 Japanese companies that supply digital content to cellular
phones, and many plan to sell shares on the stock market soon.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies with connections to the United States are not
waiting for initial public offerings. Yahoo Japan recently agreed
to acquire P.I.M., a Japanese startup that is developing a
personal-information management system for the cellular phone.
``When it comes to cellular-based services, Japan is advanced,''
said a Yahoo Japan spokesman, Koichi Ichikawa. ``So we are hoping
to accumulate know-how here and provide it to the rest of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel, meanwhile, has invested in Hori's Cybird, though neither
company would say what Intel paid or how much of the Japanese
company it bought. Intel was more forthcoming about its strategy:
to encourage mobile Internet use and thus stimulate demand for
microprocessors. For that reason, it invests in promising Internet
startups around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drove a tough deal with Intel and some people might think
it would be presumptuous of a startup like us to do so,'' Hori
said. ``But we convinced them that it would be a benefit to them
since, we told them, our company could become as important as them
in the future.''

HARCOURT SEEKING APPROVAL TO OPERATE ONLINE COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a bid to join a handful of private companies offering
college-level courses over the Internet, Harcourt General hopes to
receive approval on Monday to operate an online college.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt General, an educational publisher based in Chestnut
Hill, Mass., said its Higher Education unit had been working with
the staff of the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education for 18
months to meet its standards for approval as a college, granting
associate or bachelor's degrees through online classes.
</P>
<P>
   The unit's president and chief executive, Robert Antonucci, said
the company hoped to begin offering at least 80 courses in the fall
and 120 by the end of the year, selling as many as 10,000
individual 12-week courses for about $900 each. The company expects
to draw primarily adult students.
</P>
<P>
   Antonucci said that ``about 50 percent'' of the course books
would come from Harcourt. He said professors were free to chose,
but ``when it is close we would probably go with a Harcourt book.''
Students will also have access to an online library of electronic
journals and books.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt has hired 4 full-time faculty members and about 30
adjunct faculty members in four schools: health and science,
business, information technology and arts and science. ``It will be
a full-service college, except without bricks and mortar and
without professors in classrooms,'' Antonucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Students will join classes with about 10 members, each led by a
professor who posts lecture notes and assignments on the Internet.
Discussions with the professor and other students will take place
by e-mail at the students' convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Another Harcourt unit already provides college courses by mail
to about 400,000 students through a correspondence school licensed
by Pennsylvania that Harcourt acquired in 1997 when it bought the
National Education Corp. Antonucci said Harcourt had spent more
than $10 million over the last two years developing its online
curriculum. Antonucci previously served as the Massachusetts
education commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   A few other companies already offer full college degrees over
the Internet, including the University of Phoenix, Jones
International University and Capella University. The financier
Michael R. Milken is building an online higher education company
called Knowledge Universe.  &QL;

SHIP ONCE USED TO SMUGGLE CHINESE WILL NOW BECOME REEF OFF
FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Pa., N.Y.)   By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Golden Venture disgorged its human cargo _ 286 desperate
Chinese immigrants who had endured 100 harrowing days at sea _ into
the cold and pounding surf off New York City at 2 a.m. on June 6,
1993. Ten died before reaching shore, others endured years in
detention and the name of the freighter became synonymous with the
willingness to profit from human aspiration and desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on Tuesday, the ship _ since rechristened the United
Caribbean _ will return to the sea for good. Cleaned and stripped,
it will be towed about a mile off the coast of Boca Raton, Fla.,
and sunk in about 70 feet of water to create an artificial reef.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost for Palm Beach County to turn the aging freighter
into a home for marine life is $60,000, according to Janet Phipps,
an environmental analyst for the county who is overseeing the
reef's creation. That is twice the amount that each immigrant was
supposed to pay for passage to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, which has been sitting unused on the Miami River, was
bought from a company called Export Terminal. Its owner, Juan
Lopez, did not return phone calls seeking comment, but he told The
Associated Press he had inherited the ship as a custodian for a
court case involving previous owners. The ship was sold by the U.S.
Marshals Service, which seized it after it ran aground off the
Rockaway Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Phipps, who said she did not know the ship's history until
recently, added that the reef would be a living memorial of sorts
that is fitting in a state where desperate Caribbean refugees
regularly wash ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing the 147-foot-long ship on Thursday, she said: ``You sit
there and look at it and you just can't fathom that 300 people were
crammed down there. It does kind of give you the chills. The
desperation of people who would go to those extremes _ it's hard to
imagine as a person who's grown up in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese aboard the Golden Venture endured an ordeal that
began to seem almost absurdly cruel. After nearly four months in
suffocating squalor, with minimal food and water, they were ordered
to swim ashore when the ship grounded. Then they were rounded up
and detained, in some cases for more than three years. At least 170
were repatriated to China.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 people were ultimately convicted for their role in
the lucrative smuggling operation.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Lobach, a lawyer in York, Pa., where many of the
immigrants were detained for three and a half years, said those who
were not repatriated have adjusted well to American life.
</P>
<P>
   The man he represented, and whom he now considers a son, has
settled nearby, is working at two jobs, married his girlfriend in
China and is now trying to bring her to the United States. Many of
the others moved to New York, Washington or the West Coast, Lobach
said, often working at more than one job to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of them would care to preserve the Golden
Venture,'' he said. ``Their 100 days on there were something a lot
of them still have nightmares about.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lobach said, there were good things that came from the
Golden Venture's misadventure. An odd assortment of citizens in the
York area were drawn into action by the prisoners in their midst,
demonstrating for their freedom outside the York County Prison for
186 straight Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Because the federal government has detained an increasing number
of asylum seekers at the York prison in recent years, the Golden
Venture coalition established both the Pennsylvania Immigration
Resource Center, which gives free legal advice to asylum seekers,
and an international friendship house for detainees released from
the jail. The house has already given refuge to Iranians, Iraqis,
Bosnians, Liberians and others, Lobach said.
</P>
<P>
   Other good things will come as well, said Phipps, the Palm Beach
biologist. Within a few years, she said, the ship will be
surrounded by radiant tropical fish and coated with colorful
sponges and coral.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ship that had an ugly past will become something
beautiful,'' she said.

NEWS AND VIEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's sultry news-and-views edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   News: The Baltimore Orioles may be shopping for a new general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Views: OK, people, let's all get on the same page. No more
public lynchings of Dodgers G.M. Kevin Malone. From now on,
everyone agrees that the signing of Carlos Perez to a three-year
contract was a brilliant move, and we'd make the Charles
Johnson-for-Todd Hundley trade all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Heretofore, Malone is a genius who is not being provided all the
resources necessary to bring his dream of a dynasty to Los Angeles,
because the Foxies got in the way of his hiring the man he really
wanted as manager, and has since saddled him with a movie producer
as the new CEO when, naturally, it should have been Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Foxies did get in his way on the manager issue,
but only after The Sheriff sent a much-publicized posse after
Felipe Alou and failed to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Angelos and Kevin Malone. It just rolls off your tongue.
Send letters of support to Camden Yards, c/o P. Angelos.
</P>
<P>
   News: Malone says Davey Johnson is safe for the balance of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Views: That's sort of like the executioner telling the death row
prisoner that the electric chair will be fixed tomorrow. It's still
going to happen. All it means is that Johnson gets to suffer
through September like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm Bob Daly, I check the September gate receipts against
past years, because that will be a true assessment whether the fan
base is tuning out.
</P>
<P>
   News: Media experts begin making lists of replacement candidates
for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Views: The first thing everyone needs to consider is that six
other Major League Baseball teams are currently managed by an
ex-Dodger, a fact of life that ranks high on the list of things
that bother fans.
</P>
<P>
   Alphabetically, that includes Dusty Baker (Giants), Phil Garner
(Tigers), Davey Lopes (Brewers), Johnny Oates (Rangers), Mike
Scioscia (Angels) and Bobby Valentine (Mets). Charlie Manuel
(Indians) also spent a little time in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Heres's one man's handicap as things stand at the moment, with
the standings as they are and Malone in charge:
</P>
<P>
   1. Felipe Alou, 5-2. Malone still considers him family and he
would love to finish what he started two years ago. Alou isn't
likely to miss a second chance to leave the Expos, and the team
probably could better use the money they're paying him.
</P>
<P>
   2, Baker, 3-1. The popular choice. Daly is enough of a fan to
offer him everything to take the job. But I just don't see the
Giants letting Baker get away if he wins the division.
</P>
<P>
   3. Kevin Kennedy, 7-2. Malone's second choice before the Foxies
told him to hire Johnson. He's available, assuming he wants to
leave his cushy job at Fox.
</P>
<P>
   4. Valentine, 6-1. He could become a candidate if Baker says no
and Daly takes the decision out of Malone's hand. Tommy Lasorda's
support of the Mets manager could swing either way depending on who
gets to make the decision, Daly or Malone. Short of a World Series
title, Valentine isn't likely to stay with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   5. Scioscia, no line: He'd be a great choice, but he isn't
likely to return with Malone in charge, and I have a hard time
imagining Disney letting Fox talk to him when he's under contract
and underpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up another issue: Shouldn't Disney step up and
improve Scioscia's contract after what he's done in his first year
as a manager?
</P>
<P>
   News: Dog days of August begin to have their sweltering impact
on the pennant races.
</P>
<P>
   Views: It's evident everywhere. Seattle's fine but young
pitching staff has hit a wall, allowing Oakland to draw closer. The
Red Sox pitching staff is already suffering, and they haven't even
begun a series of doubleheaders causes by early season rainouts.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona may have traded for Curt Schilling, but its bullpen is a
mess, and the Cardinals have more questions than answers about
their starting pitching. A fast start and the lack of anyone else
in the N.L. Central with a winning record has kept them on top.
</P>
<P>
   Listmania continues. A.L. postseason handicap:
</P>
<P>
   1. New York, even money. Until someone better steps up, the
Yankees remain the team to beat. The fact they've separated from
Boston and Toronto despite the problems of David Cone and Orlando
Hernandez is more proof of their baseball-best depth.
</P>
<P>
   2. Seattle, 5-2. This is on the assumption that August will
eventually end and the Mariner pitchers will regroup. When in
doubt, go with pitching.
</P>
<P>
   3. Chicago, 3-1. Yes, that was former Dirtbag Rocky Biddle
winning his first major league game last week. Chicago needs to be
taken seriously, but their team defense is a negative and it's a
guess whether their young pitchers can deliver when it counts.
</P>
<P>
   4. Oakland, 9-2. One has to go with the A's in the wild card
race on the strength of better pitching and a deep lineup.
</P>
<P>
   5. Field. Boston (5-1) has Pedro Martinez and a prayer, which
could be enough. The Angels (6-1) need a healthy Troy Percival to
still be alive by September 1. The Indians and Blue Jays are off
the board and pretending.
</P>
<P>
   N.L. postseason handicap:
</P>
<P>
   1. Atlanta, 6-5. This Braves team isn't as good as past Braves
teams, but it might be good enough to deliver a world title if the
Yankees prove mortal.
</P>
<P>
   2. New York Mets, 8-5. Leading the wild card race by 4 games,
the Mets are the only team capable of challenging the Braves. Mike
Piazza is having a MVP year and there's no holes in the lineup. In
a close series, I have to believe Valentine will overmanage.
</P>
<P>
   3. San Francisco, 3-1. Quick, name a Giants starter other than
Shawn Estes. Baker's handling of a pitching staff that's neither
deep nor well-known has been terrific, and Barry Bonds is having a
MVP year. The X factor.
</P>
<P>
   4. St. Louis, 8-1. The Cards never know one day from the next
what kind of effort they'll get from their pitchers. Hitting has
taken them this far, but it's hard to imagine them beating a team
with better pitching, with or without Mark MGwire.
</P>
<P>
   5. Field. Arizona's (10-1) come unwrapped, with the vets tired
of Buck Showalter and the team already wondering what players get
gassed after the season because of a lack of money. Dodgers? They
have all the chance of Ralph Nader. &QL;

SCOOTER FEVER IN EUROPE
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM DIEM  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A Parisienne and her companion walked around a red BMW
C1 parked on a sidewalk near Trinity Church. He leaned in to view
the speedometer, with a top marking of 120 kilometers an hour, or
about 70 mph, then fiddled with the windshield wiper. She stood
back, regarded the curved roof and nodded approvingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the minivan of scooters,'' she declared, summing up the
safe appearance of the relatively large scooter, which has a
windshield, rollover bars and safety belts.
</P>
<P>
   The C1 represents a new niche in two-wheel vehicles at a time
when scooters are hot. Sales of two-wheel motorized vehicles jumped
44 percent in Europe from 1995 to 1999, and although scooters are
not tallied separately, several manufacturers said they were
gaining faster than motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   Scooters have a flat floor and an upright riding position;
motorcycles force riders to straddle the engine. In a nutshell,
riders can touch their knees together on scooters, and motorcycles
are generally more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers have not ignored scooters' new popularity. BMW
started selling the C1 in May, and Renault will introduce a line in
spring. They join Peugeot Motocycle, which has made scooters for 50
years, and Honda, which builds them in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers don't regard scooters as competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a car and a C1, or a big motorcycle for the road
and a C1 for the city,'' says Arvid Des Horts, BMW's marketing
director for the C1 in France.
</P>
<P>
   Scooters are popular, in part, because they can squirt through
traffic. ``Urban congestion is creating a great opportunity,'' said
Jacques Compagne, secretary-general of the Association des
Constructeurs Europeens de Motocycle, an industry group in
Brussels. ``It has become a market of middle managers who want to
get around.''
</P>
<P>
   Car drivers tend to choose scooters over motorcycles because of
their automatic transmissions and lower center of gravity. ``There
will always be a market of passion for the motorcycle,'' Des Horts
said. ``But the scooter is loved for its efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Renault wanted to get into the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``An important market is developing for urban mobility with
light two-wheelers,'' said Francois Rouvier, chief of commercial
projects for Renault Sport, the division handling the scooter
project. ``Our dealer network has forcefully and repeatedly asked
for our help in developing two-wheel products.''
</P>
<P>
   Benelli Spa, an Italian scooter company with about 6 percent of
the European market, will manufacture Renault's scooters. Renault
will provide new designs, suspensions and clean-engine technology.
</P>
<P>
   For carmakers, two-wheelers carry their brand names to young
people. In much of Europe, teen-agers without driver's licenses can
ride scooters of up to 50 cubic centimeters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of special series for young people,'' said
Isabelle Puzenat, a spokeswoman for Peugeot. ``The X-Team is in
red, white and blue. The Urban Black was all matte black, for them
to personalize.''
</P>
<P>
   While the youth market is relatively stable, more adults are
getting on board scooters. In many European countries, adults with
a car driver's license can drive a 125 cc scooter.
</P>
<P>
   Compagne, of the industry group, said the average age of a
two-wheel buyer was 40 last year, compared with 30 in 1990.
European sales of 50 cc scooters were down 2.3 percent last year,
Peugeot said, while sales of larger scooters were up 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   BMW is content with the 125 cc engine in the C1, which it
introduced in May after 10 years of development, because it has the
widest possible market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a marriage of the automobile and the two-wheeler,'' Des
Horts said. Riders strap themselves into the seat with a four-point
safety belt. The windshield and roof that protect them from rain
are attached to rings of extruded aluminum that protect them in
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Germany, France and several other countries have
agreed that the C1's safety features mean that its drivers don't
need helmets. ``For women, it's especially nice to drive without a
helmet,'' said Christine Bellanger, a BMW dealer in Tours, France.
</P>
<P>
   She sold six C1s in the first two months, and says the no-helmet
provision ``is the fundamental argument, the most powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   The red C1 parked near the Paris church belongs to Edouard
Martin, a consultant in Paris who lives 22 miles away, in
Elancourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The round trip in my car takes two and a half hours,'' Martin
said. ``With the C1, I save an hour. I park in front of my office,
which saves more time and 1,700 francs a month,'' or about $250.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my clients are in and around Paris, and I gain an
average of 45 minutes a day on trips to see them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the C1 was noisy and relatively expensive at 44,000
francs, about $6,500, but he said he well understands the
trade-offs between two and four wheels: His consulting firm helps
companies manage their fleets of cars.

<P>
   ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER _ Democratic presidential contender Al
Gore basked in the glow of his convention speech and wooed voters
in the nation's midsection Friday, as he embarked on a four-day
boat ride down the nation's most famous river.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, along with running mate Joseph Lieberman and their wives,
flew overnight from Los Angeles to the Midwest, where they
addressed a morning rally in La Crosse, Wis., before boarding a
Mississippi riverboat named the Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Before a sign-waving crowd of about 5,000 people, Gore repeated
many of the themes of his Thursday-night address at the Democratic
National Convention, including his vow to work for prescription
drug benefits for the elderly, managed health care reform and more
education funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of the United States have had enough,'' said the
vice president, his voice hoarse with exhaustion. ``We want these
changes, and we're going to the ballot box to get these changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Introduced by a chief proponent of campaign finance reform, Sen.
Russell Feingold, D-Wis., Gore also pledged to make cleansing the
political system of special-interest dollars a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Democracy must be saved from special interests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said that the first measure he would send to Congress
would be the campaign-finance reform legislation sponsored by
Feingold and former GOP presidential contender John McCain, a
senator from Arizona. Among other things, that bill would regulate
``soft-money'' contributions to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   However, the last stop Gore and Lieberman made before leaving
Los Angeles was a high-dollar Democratic National Committee
fund-raiser hosted by such Hollywood stars as Barbra Streisand and
Whoopi Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign was buoyed by the candidate's Thursday speech,
which received generally positive reviews and appeared to give him
at least a temporary bounce in overnight polls.
</P>
<P>
   An NBC poll of 500 likely voters had Gore picking up 5
percentage points to overtake Republican George W. Bush, 46 percent
to 43 percent. The poll had a margin of error of 4.4 percent. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; A Voter.com-Battleground tracking poll of likely voters had
Gore still behind, 45 percent to 40 percent, but narrowing the gap
with Bush by six points. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Most candidates tend to get short-lived lifts in polls after
their party conventions, however. The real question is whether
Gore, who has trailed Bush most of the year, can stay competitive
with his Republican rival by Labor Day, when the glow of the summer
conventions dies down and the fall campaign begins in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   The 400-mile boat trip down the Mississippi is intended to
generate support in four swing states and provide attractive
photographs and television images for the Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The morning rally offered a slice of Americana, with a Mark
Twain look-alike and a barbershop chorus entertaining the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   As the boat made its leisurely way down the wide river, the
Gores and Liebermans stood on the deck and waved to scattered
clumps of onlookers along the shores.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's eldest daughter, Karenna, wandered among the large pack
of journalists situated on the boat's bottom level. She was asked
about the prolonged kiss between her father and mother before his
convention speech, which provided grist for the morning talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people might think it was a bit racy, but I'm used to
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore offered nothing new in terms of policy during the day, even
though he led a discussion of health care reform on the deck of the
Mark Twain as it cruised down the river.
</P>
<P>
   The Liebermans broke away from the boat tour in the afternoon to
observe the Jewish Sabbath, which lasts from sundown Friday to
sundown Saturday. They planned to rejoin the tour this evening. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The trip is expected to end Monday in Mark Twain's birthplace
of Hannibal, Mo. The boat also will make stops in towns in Illinois
and Iowa, two other crucial states for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A number of people who came to see the candidates in La Crosse
suggested that Gore had helped himself with his performance at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked hearing his views and where he was going rather than
the rah-rah pep talk,'' said Charise Boch, an undecided voter.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hauser, a middle-school history teacher and loyal Democrat,
said that before the speech he had been concerned that Gore was
faltering.
</P>
<P>
   ``But last night he reassured me he could run a good campaign,''
Hauser said. ``I liked the specifics on the issues. He told you
exactly what he was going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   David Weinrich, a 29-year-old college math professor who had
been leaning toward Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, said he
worried that Gore had abandoned liberal causes when he picked
Lieberman, a moderate senator from Connecticut, to be his running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the speech erased those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed with the liberal themes he touched on, things
like support for the environment, emphasizing working people over
corporations, and campaign finance reform,'' Weinrich said.
</P>
<P>
   But there were plenty of people in the crowd who didn't hear the
speech, which began shortly before 9 p.m. CDT.
</P>
<P>
   Donell Kerns, who works at the local university, said she and
her husband don't watch television. So they came to the rally to
check out the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to hear him and get a sense of who he is,'' she
said.'' My sense is, he is more sincere and honest than Bush.
Midwesterners are big on sincerity.''

SPARKS' FIGGS SURVIVES ROLLER-COASTER YEAR
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; INGLEWOOD, Calif.  &UR; _ &LR;  To say that last year was difficult for
Ukari Figgs is an understatement. It was an emotional roller
coaster.
</P>
<P>
   In February she had to deal with the death of her grandmother,
who lived next door to the family home in Georgetown, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   In April she helped Purdue to the NCAA championship and was
picked by the Los Angeles Sparks in the third round of the WNBA
draft.
</P>
<P>
   In June she started 10 games before suffering an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   And in August one of her college teammates was killed in a car
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Figgs persevered through her faith and support from her family.
She dealt with the losses in her young life the only way she knew
how.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to know that God has a plan for everything,''
said Figgs, who said her grandmother took her to church every
Sunday and her teammate and friend Tiffany Young was like a sister
on the tight-knit Purdue team. ``You can't dwell on them or
question them. It's not going to change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   She is only 23 years old but has the maturity and poise of
someone much older.
</P>
<P>
   Figgs recovered from her injury and humbly accepted her role as
backup. But it became clear after Gordana Grubin was left
unprotected in the expansion draft as the top pick that Figgs would
have a bigger role to play this season on the Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an important part of our team this year and going back
to last year (of) the players that we decided to protect during the
expansion draft, she was number one on our list,'' said Michael
Cooper, who took over as head coach following last season. ``I was
looking at it coming from a defensive perspective. Ukari is an
excellent defender.''
</P>
<P>
   Figgs was chosen most valuable player of the NCAA championship
after leading the Boilermakers to their first title last year. She
had high hopes coming to the Sparks, looking to duplicate the
effort. But she sprained her ankle in a double-overtime game
against the Minnesota Lynx.
</P>
<P>
   She was elated that Cooper was planning on starting her this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boosted my confidence that he had that much faith in me,''
said Figgs, who averaged 6.7 points and 4.0 assists in the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks are in the Western Conference finals, thanks in part
to Figgs. She's had a difficult role, trying to distribute the ball
among four capable scorers in Lisa Leslie, Mwadi Mabika, DeLisha
Milton and Tamecka Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of advantages, but there's some disadvantages
because there are so many scorers,'' Figgs said. ``It's a point
guard's dream.''

COMMENTARY: THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION AND THE CHANGING FACE OF LOS
ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN R. WEISMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Democrats this week, a flood of nostalgia
evoked a bygone time in politics when Lew Wasserman, head of MCA,
Frank Sinatra and other figures in the old Hollywood establishment
hobnobbed at the 1960 convention with John F. Kennedy. Back then,
the entertainment industry supplied the glamour for a political
party trying to look hip and committed. But the real power in Los
Angeles resided elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The convention this week showed how the entertainment industry
has moved from the gilt-edged periphery of the Democratic Party to
its financial and cultural center. For Los Angeles that transition
has come with a striking geographical twist. Forty years ago the
power center was downtown. This Democratic convention, though it
took place downtown, reflected how much the center of power has
shifted to the city's west side, where the entertainment and
fashion industries are rooted.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ronald Reagan was a son of Hollywood, he had no interest
in engineering such a transition when he ran for president in 1980.
Reagan's financial backers were not from show business, but from
the other Los Angeles business establishment _ men like Justin
Dart, Holmes Tuttle, Henry Salvatori and Alfred Bloomingdale. Many
of them had earlier recruited Reagan to run for governor after
making fortunes in the oil, aerospace and real estate industries.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1960 convention the new and largely Jewish Democratic
political establishment on the west side and the San Fernando
Valley was beginning to hit its stride. But it was a time when
Jews, blacks and other minorities were still excluded from the
California Club, the Jonathan Club, the Los Angeles Country Club
and other precincts where Los Angeles' movers and shakers virtually
ran the town. Indeed the downtown and west side establishments when
I was growing up here hardly even knew each other.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``The Powers That Be,'' David Halberstam spoke of
the time in the 1960s when Dorothy Chandler, doyenne of the family
that owned The Los Angeles Times, then a conservative Republican
paper that Jews looked on with disapproval, tried to bridge the gap
between downtown and West Los Angeles. She realized that to raise
money to save the old Hollywood Bowl and build a new music center,
she had to go where the money was, to men like Wasserman of MCA and
to Paul Ziffren, the top lawyer in west Los Angeles and a stalwart
of the Democratic Party. Chandler, Halberstam wrote, ``knew what
was happening in the world of the arts, and there the changes were
taking place much faster than they did in the world of the
California Club.''
</P>
<P>
   The coming together of new and old money occurred so fast that
by the 1980s, when the Reagan team reached its zenith of power in
the nation, the old guard was becoming increasingly irrelevant in
its own home town. Mayor Tom Bradley, an African-American, had put
together his own coalition of minorities, Jews and moderate
business leaders. He barred city officials from attending meetings
in the California Club and even got an ordinance passed banning
discrimination in any private club where business is conducted.
Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican, has kept the Bradley coalition
going and tried to expand it.
</P>
<P>
   Today the old-line conservative Republican business
establishment has largely disappeared from view. Many of the old
banks and financial businesses have died or been bought by
outsiders, just as The Los Angeles Times has been. The oil and
aerospace industries are ailing, and the Mojave Desert to the north
of the city, where the stealth bomber was tested and the space
shuttle still lands, is now being torn up for residential
communities by developers like Eli Broad, the tycoon from the west
side who is a close supporter of Riordan and was instrumental in
bringing the Democrats to town this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The exciting thing about Los Angeles now is the emergence of new
elites, most notably in the Asian and Hispanic communities. Instead
of being dominated by a handful of wealthy barons, it is a city
laced with entrepreneurs striving to reinvent the city. The next
mayor could be either Assemblyman Antonio Villaraigosa or Rep.
Xavier Becerra, two rival leaders of the Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   The new concern in Los Angeles is that it has lost its cohesion
and sense of purpose provided by the old elite. Even the
entertainment industry has fragmented into dozens of power centers
outside the shadow of giants like Wasserman. Some fear the loss of
support of the city's central cultural institutions. Others worry
that without a new identity, places like the San Fernando Valley
and the harbor district to the south may secede. For anyone
fascinated by how the city has changed from 1960 to now, what it
will be like in 2020 is anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly a different city today, but you wouldn't
expect it to be the same,'' says Betsy Bloomingdale, the widow of
one of the pillars of the old Reagan inner circle. ``You've got to
go forward or you die.''

LAZIO CHALLENGES HILLARY CLINTON'S COMMITMENT TO CANCER
PREVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANANDAIGUA, N.Y. _ After a visit to the birthplace of the
women's suffrage movement, Rep. Rick Lazio challenged Hillary
Rodham Clinton on one of her core issues, women's health care,
sparking contention over which Senate candidate had done more for
breast cancer prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, the Republican candidate, has said all along that he
would court constituencies and speak on issues not normally
identified with Republicans, but his attack Friday showed an
aggressive attempt to seize an issue about which Clinton has been
vocal. It also illustrated the opportunity Lazio strategists see to
attract women voters, some of whom, according to recent polls, were
not backing Clinton as strongly as had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they have a record on education or health care, it's a
horrendous record of undermining women's health, particularly on
life-threatening diseases like breast cancer,'' Lazio told
reporters shortly after a visit to the Women's Rights National
Historic Park in Seneca Falls, where in 1848 the suffragist
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other activists met to formulate the
foundation of the women's rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, on a statewide bus tour that also brought him to this
village, said Clinton fell short on advocating mammograms for the
early detection of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton's health care reform plan of 1993-94 did not
include provisions to allow women under 50 with no health insurance
and at higher risk of contracting the disease to receive the exams.
But Clinton's staff immediately replied that Lazio had overlooked
an amendment to the plan that did include such a provision. At the
time, the recommended age was a matter of dispute among doctors,
but by 1997 the American Cancer Society suggested women begin
receiving tests at 40.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in an interview with The New York Times last week
that in 1998 she pushed for legislation that would allow Medicare
patients 40 and older to receive the exams, a response to the
American Cancer Society's recommendations. The legislation passed
and was signed into law in February of that year.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio, who said he had supported legislation for several
years advocating the exams beginning at 40 or sooner, seized on
what he considered the discrepancy between Clinton's health care
proposal and her remarks in the interview as evidence that she was
not a strong advocate for the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difference between these two camps,'' Lazio said.
``I say what I mean. I can back up my speech, my comments, with the
truth, with the facts, with a record. What they say is always
suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign called Lazio's claims a ``joke'' and noted
that the National Breast Cancer Coalition, an advocacy group on the
issue, had honored Clinton this week for her work promoting breast
cancer prevention and treatment, one of several awards it has given
the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has received two awards from the organization in the last
year, a spokeswoman for the coalition said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who will New Yorkers believe, the National Breast Cancer
Coalition or Rick Lazio?'' said Howard Wolfson, Clinton's chief
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The squabble highlighted a recurring theme for Lazio. He seeks
to emphasize his legislative record as an advantage over Clinton,
who has never held elected office, but who contends she has
functioned as a virtual senior adviser to President Clinton on
various bills.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio's legislative record has also provided Clinton and
Democrats a tool to use against him.
</P>
<P>
   When Lazio released an advertisement this week promoting his
record, Democrats, in Los Angeles for the national party
convention, held a news conference to denounce him and claim he had
taken too much credit for some bills.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio and Democrats have disputed credit for the Breast and
Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, which would provide financing for
women too poor to afford insurance but earning too much to qualify
for government health care. The bill, which passed the House, is
awaiting action in the Senate. It has bipartisan sponsors,
including Lazio, but Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., has said Lazio
speaks as if he were the sole sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Lazio called the bill one of his achievements on
women's issues.

BUSH CAMPAIGNS IN GORE'S HOME STATE 
 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARTLETT, Tenn. _ Determined to thwart a post-convention surge
by the Democrats, Gov. George W. Bush campaigned Friday in Vice
President Al Gore's home state, where he claimed that Gore's plea
for more time in office indicated that the Clinton-Gore
administration had not accomplished enough.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by running mate Dick Cheney and greeted by a noisy
throng of 10,000 people, Bush said, ``The size of this crowd tells
me this November, Texas and Tennessee are going to be in the
Bush-Cheney column.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Cheney: ``This year we're going to follow the Sam Houston
strategy. We're going to carry Texas and Tennessee.'' Houston was
governor of both states, Cheney noted. He then took some partisan
jabs at Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big changes are coming to Washington,'' he predicted.
``Starting next January, we're going to end this era of division
and distrust. We're going to change the tone in our nation's
capital, and we are going to restore honor and dignity to the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Gore ``wants four more years of fingerpointing and
politicizing and blaming.'' He painted his opponent as ``a
candidate who will pit one group of people against another, a
candidate who will wage class warfare to get ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's nomination acceptance speech amounted to ``a laundry list
of new promises, which I thought was an attempt to cover up old
failures,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Gore displayed a lack of priorities, purpose and vision,
and ``as much as he tried to separate himself from the squandered
opportunities of his own administration, the vice president
reminded us of the fundamental choice in this election: Will we
prolong four more years of Clinton-Gore, or will we give America a
fresh start?''
</P>
<P>
   En route to Tennessee, Bush told reporters that Gore's remarks
Thursday left ``a lot of unanswered business from the last seven
years, like Medicare reform, Social Security reform, strengthening
the military. His speech was a tacit admission that they haven't
done a lot in terms of Medicare or Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Gore declared campaign finance reform as his top
priority, Bush said, ``My No. 1 agenda item will be strengthening
public schools.'' He added that Gore lacks credibility on the
campaign reform issue because of the incident in which Gore
solicited contributions at a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Gore was only partially successful in distancing
himself from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he convinced me of is, sure, he's standing on his own two
feet. Having done that myself, I know what it's like to stand up in
front of the convention and say here's my view, here's my plan,
here's how I intend to lead,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush criticized the timing of news leaks indicating that there
is another investigation of Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky
under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the timing of the announcement was unfair for Al
Gore. I did. I didn't appreciate that. And I don't know who leaked
it, but it was as we say in Texas, that wasn't right,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He equated it with a pre-election leak of an independent
counsel's report in the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages scandal days
before his father sought re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody did the same thing to my dad about three days before
the election in 1992,'' he said. ``I didn't appreciate it then; I
don't appreciate it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's fair to the vice president that somebody
leak an internal memo or whatever was leaked, that would affect his
night. He needed to have his night free and clear, I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. appeals court judge said Friday he was the accidental
source of word that a new federal grand jury was probing Clinton
over his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement ``with apologies to all concerned,'' Judge
Richard Cudahy said he accidentally disclosed empanelment of the
grand jury during an interview about the work of independent
counsel Richard Ray. Cudahy is one of three judges who oversee
independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said a NBC-Wall Street Journal poll that showed Gore
leading Bush was a one-day snapshot that doesn't tell the whole
story. ``I think we better take a deep breath and let everything
settle out, and I think you're going to get a feel for what it's
like around Labor Day,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Bush said he expects to make an issue of Gore's
spending proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made a lot of spending promises, and it'll be an
interesting part of the fall campaign as we total up the amount of
money he's promised and the amount of money available,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bush will rally Dallas Republicans at Southern Methodist
University before traveling to Las Cruces, N.M., where he plans to
tout education policies.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he was campaigning in Texas, where he holds
significant leads over Gore in several polls, Bush said, ``I take
nothing for granted.'' &QL;

AS PEACE MISSION ERODES, U.N. SENDS NIGERIAN ENVOY TO CONGO 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A Nigerian general who presided over his
country's return to democracy last year is being sent to Congo by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to try to salvage what is beginning to
look like a doomed peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   The general, Abdulsalami Abubakar, who took over the government
after the death of the military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha in 1998 and
opened the way for the election of President Olusegun Obasanjo, has
been asked to go to Congo immediately to try to establish a working
relationship between the government and the U.N. mission, known by
its initials in French as MONUC.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment follows a warning from Annan to the Security
Council this week that the Congo operation may have to be
reconsidered in light of the failure of President Laurent Kabila's
government to cooperate with an advance U.N. mission and to provide
the necessary conditions for the deployment of peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,500 troops and support workers were to be sent to Congo
only when fighting had stopped, the peacekeepers' safety could be
reasonably guaranteed and Kabila had taken steps to open a
political discourse with his opponents. Kabila, who seized power
from President Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, has never held an election
or allowed political parties to operate freely.
</P>
<P>
   Annan has asked Abubakar ``to make clear once more the position
of the Security Council and the role of the U.N. organization
mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo,'' a spokesman for
the organization, Manoel De Almeida e Silva, said Friday. ``The
special envoy has also been requested to take up the issue of an
apparent propaganda campaign that has been conducted against MONUC
and its staff.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Friday, in Kinsangani, a contested diamond mining center in
eastern Congo, a British U.N. official sent as part of an advance
party was found hanged in his hotel room, the U.N. representative
in Congo, Kemal Morjane, said in Kinshasa. U.N. officials do not
know if his death was a murder or suicide. The body of the dead
man, Joseph Comerford of the U.N. Development Program, was being
flown out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Comerford arrived in Kisangani on Monday to begin to assess
damage caused by recent fighting there between Rwandan and Ugandan
troops who had fallen out after a joint invasion of Congo two years
ago. The Rwandans, Ugandans and rebels they support now say they
have withdrawn from the city, which the United Nations had hoped to
use as one of several peacekeeping bases.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda, Uganda and Congo were among the signers of a 1998 peace
accord that met in Lusaka, Zambia, early this week to try to hasten
a solution to the Congo crisis, which has drawn half a dozen
nations into Africa's biggest war. But Kabila left the meeting
early and returned to Kinshasa, leaving President Frederic Chiluba
of Zambia, the meeting's host, with no progress to show for the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   In a worsening political climate in Kinshasa, two U.S. diplomats
were asked Friday to leave the country. Denise Burgess, the public
affairs officer, and Roger Moran, a political counselor at the U.S.
Embassy, were ordered out of Congo within 48 hours. U.S. officials
said the U.S. ambassador, William Swing, had been given the order
by Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia, who is considered to be the
most anti-Western of Kabila's ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats have been told that Burgess and Moran were thought to
have made remarks at a social event that Kabila found
objectionable. A pro-government newspaper accused them of ``dining
with assassins,'' an indication that they may have been keeping in
touch with a variety of political groups.

 &HT;    Exposure to Atlanta heat and smog causing health concerns
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ 101 degrees. Cope with that.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the hottest day in Atlanta in five years, according
to the National Weather Service. The extreme heat caused the death
of a construction worker Thursday from hyperthermia and officials
are again issuing this warning: Stay indoors.
</P>
<P>
   And if the heat didn't get you, the dirty air probably did.
</P>
<P>
   As the air quality index stayed in the unhealthy ``Red Zone,''
metro Atlanta doctors reported an increase of patients complaining
of troubled breathing, red eyes and a ``catch in the throat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are acting like they have allergy symptoms but they have
no history of allergies,'' said Dr. Linnette Sells of Physicians
Immediate Med in Norcross. ``The ragweed pollen is not that bad yet
so it's probably the smog.''
</P>
<P>
   Sells says she also noticed more patients with sinus infections
and conductivities.
</P>
<P>
   Some pediatric lung and respiratory specialists reported an
increase of calls from worried parents as the bad air triggered
flare-ups of their child's asthma. Depending on the individual, an
asthmatic child could feel the effects of smoggier days within one
day to one week of the exposure.
</P>
<P>
   At Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital, Susan Thomas held her
2-year-old nephew, Tyrone Johnson, as he got a dose of fresh air
through a nebulizer.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said she tries to limit the boy's exposure to the
outdoors but some days seem worse than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep him in the house and under the AC,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At Fulton County schools, teachers were advised to ``use
caution'' during recess and physical education classes due to the
extreme heat, humidity and smog. A memorandum sent to all grades
also reminded staff to closely monitor asthmatic children, give
ample time for students to drink water and to look for signs of
heat exhaustion and heat stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Ground level ozone is the primary ingredient of Atlanta's smog
that's created when automobile exhaust and power plant pollutants
react in hot, sunny weather. Various studies are finding it affects
children more than adults because the children's lungs are still
developing.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the hotter the temperature, the worse the air
quality.
</P>
<P>
   Most summer days in Atlanta mean air that's ``unhealthy for
sensitive groups.'' But when it climbs into the ``very unhealthy''
range as it did Thursday and the ``unhealthy'' range of Friday,
doctors advise it's best for everyone to limit their time outdoors
if possible. Wednesday was the worst concentration of smog the city
has created and felt since 1995, said Michael Chang, coordinator of
Georgia Tech's Center for Urban and Regional Ecology.
</P>
<P>
   Today's level was predicted to fall into the ``orange level,''
or unhealthy for sensitive groups.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can the bad smog days burn lungs, it can stress those
with bad hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It affects people differently. Some people hardly notice it,''
said Ron Methier, chief of the state Environmental Protection
Agency's Air Protection Branch. ``We're not saying it's to the
point of being dangerous and wear a gas mask. But we do advise if
you don't actually have to go outside, don't. We shouldn't have to
say that but that's the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and city officials also stress that residents should do
their part during smog season, particularly on the worst days.
</P>
<P>
   That means cut down on driving, combine errands, gas up your car
in the morning, not during the peak ozone of the afternoon and
early evening, and forgo mowing the lawn for a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shouldn't hurt to be a child and go out and play,''
said Dr. Leroy Graham, a pediatric lung specialist with Georgia
Pediatric Pulmonology Association of Atlanta. ``This smog season is
worse than last year, which was worse than the year before. We're
now looking at air that's going into unchartered territory. The
cumulative affect over time is very frightening.''

BRITAIN AND FRANCE WILL COOPERATE TO RETURN CONCORDE TO SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Subs in correct name of European Aeronautics, Defense and
Space Co. in graf 4.)

<P>
   PARIS _ British and French aviation regulators formed a
committee Friday to examine ways to return the Concorde to service
``in safe conditions'' that would protect it against the flaws
behind last month's crash near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first indication since the crash on July 25, which
killed 113 people, that France and Britain, whose flagship carriers
alone fly the needle-nosed Concorde, were eager to return the plane
to service. British aviation authorities, following their French
counterparts, this week ordered the supersonic plane grounded,
effectively ruling it unfit to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Following a meeting of French and British aviation authorities
in London, a statement said both sides ``share the same
determination to find a solution that will put the Concorde in
service in safe conditions.'' French officials have said they
believe a tire blowout sent chunks of rubber through a fuel tank,
causing it to burst into flames as the plane sped toward takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by the French transportation ministry said French
and British experts would jointly monitor the inquiry into the
causes of the crash and cooperate in proposing modifications to
prevent ruptured tires from causing a fire. Aviation experts say
that a final decision on whether to return the Concorde to service
would probably hinge on the cost of modifications needed to make it
airworthy. The companies that built the Concorde are now part of
BAE Systems, formerly British Aerospace, and the European
Aeronautics, Defense and Space Co., a recent merger of French,
German and Spanish aerospace groups.
</P>
<P>
   Ruptured tires have been a problem for the Concorde since the
plane entered service in 1976. Though the Concordes flown by
British Airways were modified to correct the problem, those of Air
France were not. That issue could prove crucial if efforts by Air
France and its insurers to reach an amicable compensation agreement
with families of the victims fail. Most victims were German
tourists flying to New York to board a cruise ship. But they also
included an American, Christopher Behrens, a retired promotion
executive for Air France.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Samet, a French lawyer representing the family of one
German passenger, said a class action suit was being considered,
though any civil court action would have to await ``the outcome of
the inquiry and the establishment of a chain of responsibility.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jean-Michel Ricquel, a spokesman for Reunion Aerienne, a
consortium of British, French and Italian insurers that is the
Concorde's main insurer, said compensation discussions had
proceeded until now ``in an amicable fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer for other German families, Christof Wellens, said
Friday that if the talks failed, the group was preparing a class
action suit, possibly before a U.S. court. Courts in the United
States tend to make higher awards than those in Europe. Wellens
said compensation amounts of about $2.7 million had been paid out
on average in past compensation suits before U.S. courts. He said a
class action suit would be admissible in the United States because
one of the passengers was American.
</P>
<P>
   Air France has said it would pay full compensation to the
families of the passengers and of the four people who were killed
on the ground in Gonesse, the town outside Paris where the plane
crashed in a ball of fire. Ricquel of Reunion Aerienne said it was
premature to speculate on the amount of a compensation agreement.

KURDS WARILY WELCOME TURKEY'S CHANGES IN HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Turkey's decision to end a 34-year holdout
and sign two U.N. conventions this week guaranteeing the social and
political rights of minorities was greeted with tempered enthusiasm
among the country's Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   Since 15 years of conflict between the army and Kurdish
guerrillas ended last year, Kurdish leaders in southeastern Turkey
have been looking to the government for progress on granting new
rights to the region, including assurances that Kurdish can be
spoken freely and that young people can be educated in Kurdish.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing the language to be used officially remains a sensitive
issue for Turkey, and Parliament can attach restrictions to the
conventions before ratifying them. But the government is intent on
improving its human rights record in hopes of joining the European
Union, and better relations with the country's 12 million Kurds is
regarded as crucial, in part because the Kurds have vocal political
allies in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly it is a step of maximum importance for Turkey to
sign these conventions,'' said Serafettin Elci, a Kurdish political
leader and former government minister. ``However, what usually
happens here is that the implementing of the conventions doesn't
take place. If they can manage to put these conventions into
practice this time, it will help Turkey in bringing tensions down
and in solving the Kurdish question.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. covenants date to 1966, and 130 countries have signed
them. The signers agree to protect freedom of speech, adhere to
restrictions on torture and forced migration, and promote economic
and social rights of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Volkan Vural, Turkey's ambassador to the United Nations, signed
the agreements in New York and said they signified the importance
Turkey attributes to human rights. Vural returns to a new post in
Ankara next week to help oversee Turkey's effort to join the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's constitution does not recognize Kurds as a minority,
defining them instead as Turks. The government has argued that they
have the same rights as other citizens, while Kurds demand the
right to use their language and culture to maintain an ethnic
identity.
</P>
<P>
   The worst human rights abuses in recent years occurred in the
predominantly Kurdish southeastern part of the country, where the
army fought a brutal war with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party.
</P>
<P>
   Since the cease-fire last year, the state of emergency has been
lifted in most of the region and police and military checkpoints
have been relaxed. But human rights advocates said the authorities
had refused to loosen the tight rein and Kurdish activists are
still being arrested and tortured regularly.

   Stalking Tiger not for Everyman
</P>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Tiger. Tiger. Tiger. Tiger. Tiger. Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Tig-ARRRRRGH!
</P>
<P>
   Enough already, OK? Today, we shall attempt to spread the
applause around. Before the weekend, when Valhalla's hills will be
alive with the sound of Woods' music, let's pay token homage to the
chorus, the faceless Everyman PGA tourists who, despite fully
recognizing the abject futility of their mission, have adamantly
insisted upon their 15 minutes of fame.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Hayes, for example. And obviously Scott Dunlap. Bob May,
too. And good ol' Fred Funk, once the pride of the Shell Houston
Open. Bravo, fellas, for daring to tease the beast.
</P>
<P>
   Come Sunday, when there's another major tournament to be won and
Tiger Woods figures to be doing the winning, each of the
aforementioned will be relegated to forgotten-footnote status in
the files of the 82nd PGA Championship. After 36 holes, everything
appears set for the regular, business-as-usual conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els shot himself back into contention for another
second-place finish, and Woods did nothing Friday to raise the most
minuscule of concerns regarding his capacity to complete the first
U.S. Open-British Open-PGA trifecta. Save for an occasional flash
of temper _ there's a human being behind that mask _ he remains a
picture of poise and precision, so much so that it's almost boring.
</P>
<P>
   Almost. While perfection, Tiger-style, can get a tad tedious,
it's never boring.
</P>
<P>
   But John Patrick Hayes, whose father, ``Jumbo,'' was once the
Wisconsin state amateur champion, can at least tell his
grandchildren he briefly led the PGA and, more significantly, Tiger
by a whopping two swings.
</P>
<P>
   For almost an hour Friday afternoon, Hayes was alone atop the
field, although Tiger hadn't yet teed off. Be assured, however,
that J.P. was laboring under no delusions of grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect (Woods) will be ahead of me when the day is
over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Tiger was, leading the tournament by one stroke
over Dunlap, with Hayes, Funk and Davis Love III four to the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' inevitably leaving J.P. in his wake should take nothing
away from what the El Paso golfer (by way of his Appleton, Wis.,
birthplace) has had to surmount to get 7 under par _ he was minus-8
until an admittedly careless bogey on 18 _ in one of golf's four
benchmark tests of skill and courage.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger was a known commodity from roughly the age of 2, when he
beat Bob Hope in a putting contest on The Mike Douglas Show. Hayes,
rising from the opposite end of the celebrity/superstar spectrum,
had to go through Q-school four times and spend four years on the
Nike Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Before this year, in which he has finally established a toehold
with a pair of top-three finishes and more than $700,000 in
earnings, his PGA Tour rankings have been 166th, 118th, 109th and
104th. At 35, he's competing in just his sixth major and has
survived a cut in same for only the second time. Meanwhile, Woods,
at 24, is halfway to winning his fifth.
</P>
<P>
   J.P., in short, is the anti-Tiger. Ditto Dunlap, who also led
Woods by a stroke in the middle of the round, then caught him
briefly when Woods bogeyed No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   May, in contrast, was a former child prodigy himself, having
also played in the Los Angeles Open at 16, the same as Tiger. May
would best Woods on Friday, 66 to 67, but golf is a four-day war of
grinding attrition, not a five-hour, go-for-broke sprint. And
nobody has the tunnel-visioned staying power of you know who.
</P>
<P>
   What Woods has done this summer is render irrelevant everyone
else's efforts. Even when you see a player of Love's pedigree stay
in close pursuit, it's easy to give him short shrift, too.
</P>
<P>
   When Tiger is front-running, his overwhelming tendency of late,
it's worse than when he's merely lurking. The others see Woods'
name atop the leader board, and more often than not, their
shoulders sag visibly. The lesser players lose hope altogether,
while the better ones begin to press, trying to squeeze a little
extra out of their games.
</P>
<P>
   Which often leads to fatal errors. Note Love's consecutive
bogeys at 17 and 18 after he had charged to 9 under. It's a vicious
circle, stalking Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Woods pays no one else much, if any, heed. Should an
Els or a Love be chasing him, or if it's a Dunlap, a Hayes or
another of their anonymous ilk, it hardly seems to matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Tiger is too concerned about anyone else,''
Hayes admitted. ``You know, when he sits up here (on the interview
dais), nobody is asking him about the other players. It's pretty
much just Tiger. It's always just Tiger and the course.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right, you know. A goodly number of guys played some fine
golf Friday, but it's assumed only one of them played fine golf
that will still matter come Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think many bookies,'' Dunlap said, ``will be taking
bets on Scott Dunlap tonight.''

Somalis seem plain weary of the warlords who have caused much of
the factional fighting and who have failed in 12 peace conferences
over a decade to settle their differences. Some think that perhaps
the warlords would oppose any government, no matter what, seeing it
as impinging on their power. Mogadishu residents, surrounded by
ruins, are eager for a government. As one put it, ``We are against
anyone who is against peace.'' (Tyler Hicks/The New York Times)

SPORTS COLUMN: A FINAL BIRDIE FOR BEAR? 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GLF-PGA, GLF-PGA-INJURY) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Near the 18th green, the sign on the
scoreboard read, ``37 Golden Years at the PGA. Thank you, Bear.''
And now the applause was surrounding the Golden Bear, 60-year-old
Jack Nicklaus, as he walked down the fairway on what he described
later as ``maybe my last hole in a major'' tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Taking off his cap, he waved, then he put the cap back on, took
his sand wedge and surveyed the 72 uphill yards to the flagstick on
the 18th green.
</P>
<P>
   In the long sundown shadows streaking across the Valhalla Golf
Club course that he designed, a voice in the gallery yelled: ``Do
it. Do it.'' And as Nicklaus' ball soared high toward the
flagstick, several people yelled, ``Go in the hole.'' It almost
did, landing above the hole, spinning back and sliding past the cup
by about three feet for what loomed as a birdie 4 on the 542-yard
par-5 hole.
</P>
<P>
   Even louder cheers erupted now and when Nicklaus, his cap off,
walked across the front of the green, Tiger Woods slapped him five.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, a PGA official had announced the arrival of the
golfers at the 18th green, but now that official turned to the
crowd and said, ``I think Mr. Nicklaus just introduced himself,''
before introducing Woods and Vijay Singh.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, when Woods holed a 15-foot birdie putt, Nicklaus
smiled, pointed his right forefinger at the 24-year-old U.S. Open
and British Open champion, then raised his right thumb.
</P>
<P>
   After Singh putted out, Nicklaus stood over his putt in his
familiar hunch, then knocked it in for his birdie, prompting an
even louder roar. He took off his cap, embraced his son Steve, who
was caddying for him, then walked over and shook hands with Woods,
Singh and their caddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great birdie, Jack,'' several voices shouted as he moved up
the slope through the gallery to the scorer's tent. ``Great
birdie.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was. But it wasn't great enough to help him make the
36-hole cut in this 82nd Professional Golfers' Association
Championship, a title he won five times in accumulating 18 major
titles. He had shot a 1-under 71, but his two-round total of 148
apparently will miss the cut by at least one stroke when the second
round is completed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked later where that final birdie will rank among
his memories, he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ranks one short of making the cut,'' he said. ``I needed
for it to go in for an eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his accomplishments, at 60 he still disliked not having
made the cut; he still retained the embers of the competitive fire
that earned him the stature of being the best golfer in history,
the golfer who set the standard that Woods aspires to.
</P>
<P>
   But after having watched Woods shoot 66-67, Nicklaus was as
gracious in talking about his heir apparent to the ``best golfer in
history'' title as he always was when he finished second in 19
majors. Asked if he had passed the torch to Woods here, he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was handed over long before this,'' Nicklaus said.
``What Tiger is doing right now, he's a better player than I was.''

NINE KILLED IN MEXICAN POLITICAL PROTESTS   c.2000 N.Y. Times News
Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIMALHUACAN, Mexico _ At least nine people were killed and
dozens injured Friday as political protests swept across Mexico
state, shattering the euphoria from last month's elections and
dashing hopes for a peaceful political transition.
</P>
<P>
   The protests erupted on Thursday in cities like Ecatepec and
towns like Huixquilucan as local party leaders in Mexico's most
populous state clashed during ceremonies to swear in new mayors and
town councils. But the worst demonstrations occurred Friday in this
town 20 miles east of Mexico City between rival factions of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   As supporters of the PRI mayor-elect, Jesus Tolentino Roman,
gathered in the main plaza here for the ceremony, shots rang out.
The state attorney general reported that nine people were killed
and 40 others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The violence, according to reports by witnesses, was started by
armed followers of a local political boss, Guadalupe Buendia, who
has coerced politicians in Chimalhuacan for years in support of the
PRI. But last year when her choice for mayor lost in the PRI
primary, Buendia turned against her party, leading protests that
turned into riots outside the town hall.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general said a warrant had been issued for
the arrest of Buendia.

WOMEN JOIN THE PENTATHLON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NEVIN BARICH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This year's Olympic Games modern pentathlon will
have an astonishing innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Women.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the event was conceptualized in ancient
Greece in 2600 B.C. and since it was first featured in the modern
Olympics in 1912, the modern pentathlon will feature a women's
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Also for this Olympics, no nation can have more than two men and
women competing in the sport, which consists of five events:
shooting (air pistol, 10 meters, single shot), fencing (one-minute,
one-touch matchups using the epee, a dueling sword), swimming (the
200-meter freestyle), horseback riding (using an unknown horse and
competing on an obstacle course) and cross country.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Beth Larsen of Wisconsin and Emily de'Reil of Philadelphia
will represent the U.S., one of only two countries to earn the
maximum allotment of four athletes. Larsen returned to the sport in
January 1999 after a three-year absence and won a gold medal at
last year's Pan American Games. She was also the 1999 U.S. national
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very, very excited,'' Larsen said. ``Competing at the
Olympics has always been a dream of mine. In 1996, I trained really
hard for the event before it was decided not to have it. So now,
after being away so long, it's extra sweet this time around.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen may have the inside route to a medal because her husband
and coach, Vaho Iagorashvili, is among the modern pentathlon's
greatest athletes. Iagorashvili won a bronze medal for the former
Soviet Union at the 1988 Olympics and is a 20-year veteran of the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mary Beth has a big chance to win a medal,''
Iagorashvili said. ``If she does average in all of the events, she
can probably get a medal. But if she does great in one of the
sports, she may get the gold.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't think de'Reil doesn't have a chance to take the gold.
DeReil, whose specialties are swimming and running, was the
highest-ranked female pentathlete in the country earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, Chad Senior of Colorado Springs appears to be
the country's best chance for gold. Though having competed in the
sport for just three years, he entered this year's world
championships in Italy in June ranked No. 1 in the world. At the
championships, he helped the U.S. win two gold medals, including
one for the overall team competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little bit surprised by my success,'' said Senior, who
is coached by Jamusz Peciak, the 1976 Olympic modern pentathlon
champion from Poland. ``But I had done swimming and running before.
I've been swimming for 19 years and running almost as long, so it
wasn't like I was starting from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   Velizar Iliev of San Antonio is the other men's pentathlete.
Iliev came out of retirement three years ago in hopes of making the
Olympics. He was this year's U.S. national champion and won the
gold medal in the Pan Am Games last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I came back) just because of this Olympics,'' Iliev said.
``That's what drives everybody, winning the gold. I'm a person that
will go for first place. A lot of people are just happy with being
there, and I'm happy, don't get me wrong. But I came out of
retirement to do two things: make the Olympics and the win the
gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Iliev and de'Reil are coached by Viktor Svatenko, a former
Olympic champion from the Soviet Union. Earlier this year, he was
named the national modern pentathlon coach of the year by the U.S.
Olympic Committee.

DUNLAP IS ENJOYING THE MOMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Scott Dunlap is perfectly cast for the role
he's playing this weekend at the PGA Championship. His bushy
eyebrows and bulbous nose evoke a character actor.
</P>
<P>
   If the stage was Hollywood, Dunlap would get the roles that once
belonged to Karl Malden. Seeing as how the setting is Valhalla Golf
Club, he'll gladly settle for acting the part once perfected on a
stage out west by Jack Fleck.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 the lightly regarded Fleck denied Ben Hogan his fifth
U.S. Open title at San Francisco's Olympic Club with a three-shot
victory in an 18-hole playoff. Today, Dunlap will go head-to-head
with Tiger Woods, the Hogan of this era, in the third round of
golf's fourth major.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, 24, shot a 5-under-par 67 to Dunlap's 68 on Friday to put
a sliver of daylight between himself and the 37-year-old Floridian,
with whom he started the day tied for the lead. In the bigger
picture, there's a chasm separating Woods, the No. 1-ranked golfer
in the world rankings, and Dunlap, who is No. 67.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has won more majors than I have made cuts,'' said Dunlap of
Woods, the defending champion here who is bidding to become the
first golfer since Hogan in 1953 to win three consecutive majors.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap, the delightful journeyman, is bidding to make his first
PGA Tour title a major win in the manner of Jeff Sluman at the 1988
PGA Championship. He realizes it's a formidable role he is
undertaking, but, hey, somebody has to play it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to put yourself in a position to win before you can
win,'' said Dunlap, who has never finished higher than third on the
Tour. ``If you can forget it's a major and just go out and play,
who knows? You never know when you're ready to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap, who turned 37 on Wednesday, had to overcome not only the
specter of Woods on Friday but also the ghost of his second-round
showing at last month's British Open. As he did here, Dunlap broke
from the gate fast at the Old Course in St. Andrews, opening with a
68 that was surpassed by only three golfers.
</P>
<P>
   In the second round he stumbled to a 78 and missed the cut. ``To
play like that at the British Open on Friday was a real bummer,''
said Dunlap, who could have been forgiven for wondering if he was
back in Scotland when he found himself staring at 12-foot putts to
save par on each of the first two holes of his second round here.
</P>
<P>
   He made a par at the par-5 second, which felt like a bogey
considering that six of the other nine players on the first tier of
the leaderboard birdied the hole. Just when the wheels on Dunlap's
bandwagon appeared to be wobbling, Dunlap steered his game back
into the fast lane with a snaking 35-foot birdie putt on the par-3
third hole. He had the elephantine crowds riding shotgun for the
rest of his five-birdie, one-bogey jaunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are eager to jump on the bandwagon,'' Dunlap said.
``I'm eager to keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
   The inclination is to portray Dunlap as Everyman. It's not until
you glance at his 2000 record and see he has earned $795,028 in 21
events that it hits you that he is actually less like you and more
like the CEO way down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap's face definitely shows the wear and tear of a man who
had to go to South Africa and South America to find his game. It's
as weathered as an old suitcase, every line on his face a veritable
sticker attesting to the out-of-the-way places he has been.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap turned professional in 1985, after graduating from
Florida with a degree in finance, but didn't qualify to play a PGA
Tour event until 1992. By the time he gained his PGA Tour playing
privileges, in 1998, Woods already had won seven times on the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Before this week, Dunlap's greatest distinction, as he took
delight in describing, was a dubious one. ``I was the oldest
American still living with his parents,'' Dunlap said. ``Until I
was 31 years old my official residence was my folks' (house).''
</P>
<P>
   Not to suggest his 20s was a debt-ridden decade or anything, but
``MasterCard was sponsoring me on a number of occasions,
unbeknownst to them,'' Dunlap said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   He can afford to chuckle as he has left those lean times behind.
Without winning Dunlap has managed to collect $1,677, 703 in 109
PGA Tour events. That's more than Jack Nicklaus, who designed
Valhalla and missed the projected cut here by one stroke, earned in
his first six years as a professional despite winning 20
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap remembers watching the telecasts of golf's Grand Slams in
the 1970s and thinking the tournaments were over as soon as
Nicklaus took the lead. ``As it usually was, wasn't it?'' mused
Dunlap, who obviously appreciates why there are some people who
don't think he has a prayer against Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing with majors is they are so much more important and
the better players relish those moments,'' Dunlap said. ``It's not
that their games are that much better; it is that they are so much
better in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why Tiger will be so extremely difficult to beat,
because, you know, that is what he lives for. He actually gets that
much better at that time and at that moment, much like Jack did.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap is going to go out today, anyway, and try to give the
performance of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there will be many bookies taking bets on Scott
Dunlap,'' he said and laughed, playing his role for all it's worth.

FAMILIES OF SUBMARINE'S TRAPPED CREW LASH OUT AS HOPE FADES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRINA TAVERNISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURMANSK, Russia _ The weather lightened Friday, but tempers
lashed out, on the day when authorities had said that 118 Russian
sailors trapped under the sea would run out of air.
</P>
<P>
   Morose and angry, families gathered here, in the biggest city in
the Arctic Circle, and in the nearby naval town of Vidyaevo, in a
final vigil.
</P>
<P>
   At Vidyaevo, home to many of the sailors on board the Kursk, the
nuclear submarine that sank last weekend, drawn-looking government
officials explained the sputtering rescue efforts to mothers and
wives in the town's officers club. On local television, pictures of
a dazed woman, unable to sit up, preceded frames of women hurling
accusations at the officials, their voices shrill and full of pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you say anything? This is a shame before the whole
world,'' one woman yelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``More waiting, another week?'' another shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long can this go on?'' yelled another. ``They are closed
up in a canning jar!''
</P>
<P>
   Officials stared back in silence, their shoulders slumped. Once
they discovered the cameramen, uniformed guards demanded they
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Life is difficult enough in this northern region where gardens
don't grow, and where satellite television broadcasts barely reach.
The town has two schools, and the officers club is its main meeting
place. Residents have not had hot water for three months now. City
authorities shut it off in the summer, as they do in many of
Russia's northern cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women held the officials responsible,'' said one woman, who
gave her name only as Galina, and whose daughter Sveta is terrified
that she has lost her husband, Victor Kuznetsov. Galina has lived
in Vidyaevo for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been better if the officials didn't come at
all,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``Either they needed to
put a check mark on their lists, or they were pressured to come by
their bosses.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members continued to arrive from all over the country,
frantic for news.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday morning, 25 relatives of crew members had arrived
in Murmansk and been taken to Vidyaevo. Many had endured long train
rides; one woman traveling with her sister even told of having to
pay a bribe to get a seat.
</P>
<P>
   It was rumored that President Vladimir Putin would arrive late
Friday. He has been criticized by the Moscow press for not being at
the scene of the disaster. But no one here seemed to blame him;
people said only that Putin should fire the military leaders
responsible for such bad decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of the Kursk region, the submarine's namesake and
home to seven of the sailors on board, arrived Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   News reports fleshed out new details for the local people, who
have been intently watching their televisions. State television RTR
sent afternoon newscasts from one of the base boats, the Pyotr
Veliki, and showed, for the first time, the striped yellow rescue
vehicles plunging into choppy sea.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with the rescuers, in orange rain gear, provided
faces to some of the people involved in these long days of rescue
attempts that until now have been off limits to the public. The
stony-faced captain of the rescue operation, Vyacheslav Popov,
spoke for several minutes about the task.
</P>
<P>
   He gave little cause for reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions are very difficult,'' he said. ``Half the fleet
is here. We've been working only to save the people, save our
people, save our sailors.''
</P>
<P>
   The news coverage has become eerily routine. Flocks of
journalists in expensive raincoats stop passengers arriving in the
train station, combing crowds for signs of crew members' families.
Northern Fleet headquarters on Friday began to hold regular news
conferences twice daily. People tune into news broadcasts every
morning, but with little hope.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Vidyaevo, Galina was picking cranberries Friday to
soothe her nerves. Her daughter, Sveta, 23, is planning to
celebrate the third birthday of her son Dima next week, and Galina
expressed the hope that the family would be reunited by then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have faith,'' she said.

HARLLEE BRANCH JR., 94, FOE OF GOVERNMENT'S UTILITY ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harllee Branch Jr., a top utility executive and outspoken critic
of such government-subsidized competitors as the Tennessee Valley
Authority, died Aug. 16 at a nursing home in Atlanta. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a lawyer, Branch joined Georgia Power Co. in
midcareer and quickly became its president. Then, in 1957, he was
named chief executive of its parent, Southern Co., a post he held
until retiring in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   His career spanned a period of rapid industry growth and fierce
debate over what he and other executives saw as unwarranted
government encroachment into the business.
</P>
<P>
   A.W. Dahlberg, current chairman of Southern, called Branch ``one
of the most eloquent orators I have ever heard _ one of a
disappearing breed in corporate America.''
</P>
<P>
   On numerous occasions Branch lashed out at the forces of
``socialization'' that he said had seeped into both major political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their maneuverings have almost always been accompanied by
noisy denials of any intention to compete with or destroy
investor-owned enterprises,'' Branch said in an address while
heading the Edison Electric Institute, the industry's chief trade
group. ``But as their plans have grown in magnitude and boldness,
they have inexorably crowded out or proscribed privately financed
operations, as in Tennessee and Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   He managed to hold his tongue, however, when his daughter, Kay,
wrote a term paper during her freshman year in college in which she
heaped praise on the TVA and received a superior grade. ``He was
appalled,'' she recounted Friday. ``But he congratulated me _
though he felt they had inadequate research facilities'' at the
college library and donated dozens of books to rectify an apparent
imbalance.
</P>
<P>
   Branch also served as a member of the numerous government
panels, including the Federal Advisory Council on Employment during
the Johnson administration; the National Commission on Productivity
under President Nixon; and as a director of the Federal Reserve
Bank of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   One of six children of a newspaperman who served as city editor
of The Atlanta Journal and its Washington correspondent, Branch
graduated from Davidson College and worked as a cub reporter for
the paper while at Emory University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   But upon graduation in 1931, the law prevailed and Branch joined
what became the Atlanta law firm of MacDougald, Troutman, Sams &AMP;
Branch. The firm was acting as general counsel to Georgia Power. He
joined the electric company as vice president and general manager
in 1949 and became president in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Branch's academic ties included serving as trustee at Emory,
Davidson and the Georgia Tech Research Institute and director of
the Columbia Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 he received a brotherhood award from the National
Conference of Christians and Jews. While not a publicly active
proponent of racial integration, Branch worked on its behalf behind
the scenes and was an occasional informal adviser to the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King, his daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides serving on his own company's board, Branch at various
times was a director of U.S. Steel, General Motors, Southern
Railway, General Reinsurance and Interfinancial Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harllee could respond to any question he was asked, no matter
what the subject, with an extraordinary historical perspective,''
said Dahlberg, whose tenure at Southern overlapped Branch's between
1960 and 1970. ``His intellect was truly amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although of only average height and lacking an orator's booming
voice, Branch, who did not use his given first name of William, was
described as having the commanding presence of a leader and highly
polished talent as a storyteller and raconteur. He delighted in
fielding questions from students, whom he often addressed, the
subject typically a vigorous promotion of the free-enterprise
system.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Katherine Hunter, of
Atlanta, whom he married in 1932; four children, William Harllee
Branch III of Sacramento, Calif.; Barrington H. Branch, David S.
Branch and Kay Branch McKenzie, all of Atlanta; 12 grandchildren
and five great-grandchildren.

 INVESTORS STILL UNFAZED BY PEOPLEPC  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY

   SAN FRANCISCO _ PeoplePC signed its biggest deal yet, but the
announcement's failure to boost the company's sagging stock price
could spell trouble for the San Francisco supplier of low-priced
computers.
</P>
<P>
   PeoplePC agreed to offer its computer and Internet service
packages for $23 per month to more than 2.5 million customers and
employees of Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield, an insurer based in
Pittsburgh, Pa. PeoplePC's stock moved up 10 percent in Friday
morning trading, but closed at $6.81, the same price as Thursday's
close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a significant win in terms of potential, but
financially, they're just not sound,'' said Anne Bui, a senior
analyst with International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   PeoplePC made its initial public offering at $10 a share
Wednesday and the price fell immediately, ending the day down 11
percent. Bui suggested that investors are uncomfortable with
PeoplePC's business model, which she said smacks of free PC and
dot-com companies that have already gone out of business. PeoplePC
sells its bundled computer and service packages at a very low
margin, and hopes to make a profit from commissions it earns when
its customers shop at selected e-tailers. However, PeoplePC hasn't
generated significant revenue from this channel so far, according
to the company's financial filings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business model of e-tail referrals isn't paying off,''
said Bui. The fact that PeoplePC doesn't expect to break even until
2003 probably dampened Wall Street's response to the announcement,
Bui added. ``Three years is a long time to wait for signs of making
money.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the San Francisco startup won press attention
when it signed agreements with Ford Motor Co., Delta Air Lines and
Singapore's largest trade union to provide workers with computer
systems that their employers would subsidize. Those deals give
PeoplePC access to more than 700,000 potential customers, but the
1-year-old company hasn't realized any revenue from them. Highmark
predicts that as many as 100,000 of its customers and employees
will take advantage of PeoplePC's offer. They should be able to
start placing orders by the end of September, a Highmark
spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
   After PeoplePC's IPO flopped Wednesday, some analysts suggested
that the problem was a lack of new, big agreement announcements.
Now that a big deal has arrived with little effect, PC Data senior
analyst Steve Koenig says that PeoplePC's whole plan of wiring the
masses through their employers may be suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reliance on big corporate deals is a little bit risky because
you're putting all your eggs in one basket,'' said Koenig. ``If
they could do more to reach into the consumer space, and
demonstrate that they can be more successful there, that might help
attract investors.''
</P>
<P>
   PeoplePC may also be overwhelmed by orders if too many of its
new potential customers sign up right away, Bui said.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike other computer suppliers, PeoplePC outsources
its equipment, Internet service and tech support to
more-established companies, which it hopes will allow it to meet
large volumes of orders.
</P>
<P>
   PeoplePC said it could not comment on the agreement with
Highmark, announced Thursday night, because it is still in the
``quiet period'' surrounding its IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Delta subsidize their employees' computer purchases,
reducing workers' monthly payments to $5-to-$12 per month over
three years. Highmark isn't helping its customers or employees buy
the computers. Its agreement with PeoplePC simply offers them a
better deal than they could get otherwise _ $2 less than what
individual customers pay. The agreements require customers to pay
monthly fees for three years. After that time, they can keep the
computer and pay for their own Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, PeoplePC made two new higher-end packages
available to both individual and business customers.

 SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT PLANS RESTAURANT UPGRADE  &HT;     By MICHAEL TAYLOR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There you are, at San Francisco International
Airport and _ surprise! _ your fight to London has been delayed.
It's lunchtime and you now have got time to kill. How about a
withered ham sandwich, washed down with a cup of some dank brown
liquid possibly resembling coffee?
</P>
<P>
   Well, airport eaters, the revolution has arrived. As you wait
for your flight at San Francisco's new international terminal _
scheduled to open sometime before the end of the year _ you will be
able to sit down at the chic new Restaurant Qi and Water Bar or one
of 17 other restaurants of local origin and actually eat something
worth remembering.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you would like to tuck into a three-course (``30
minutes, Guaranteed!'') lunch. You could order up a ``soft tofu and
shrimp terrine in Green Kimono, summer yellow tomato Jus and
avocado puree'' followed by ``saffron risotto, sauteed sea
scallop,'' with a ``julienne of spinach, dust of Parmesan and twist
of chili.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, after all that, pour me on that 747 and let me know when
we're on approach for Heathrow.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be a while before you get to try this new culinary
adventure. The new terminal's September 26 opening has been
postponed for at least six weeks because of construction troubles
and equipment installation delays. For the restaurant owners,
construction costs charged by the airport have tripled because of
the complexities of building in an airport. After a committee of
owners complained to Mayor Willie Brown, the Airport Commission
voted to reimburse the restaurateurs for the extra costs.
</P>
<P>
   When the terminal does open, San Francisco will be trying a
concept that is part of a new movement in U.S. airports: Instead of
giving travelers a motley collection of overpriced and
underwhelming snack bars, the new terminal will have 18
restaurants, all operated by local restaurateurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a trend toward doing this,'' said Jordanna Smida,
associate editor of Airport Business, a trade magazine. ``And San
Francisco is definitely in the forefront.''
</P>
<P>
   Smida said airports in such cities as Chicago, Minneapolis,
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh have already installed locally operated
restaurants, but San Francisco airport officials say theirs is the
first to be entirely derived from local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, the Airport Commission selected Pacific
Gateway Partnerships _ a collaboration of airport-retail developer
Marketplace Development of Boston and the San Francisco retail
developer Reininga Corp. _ to start finding food businesses that
might like to set up shop at the new international terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Through a laborious selection process, involving a committee of
local ``hospitality industry'' experts, the airport's new
restaurateurs were culled from a list of more than 256 applicants
who clearly saw the advantage of having a captive audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a real desire on the part of the airport and the
city to make the restaurants represent the culinary diversity of
San Francisco,'' said airport spokeswoman Lisbet Sunshine,
explaining the motives behind the new venture. (Sunshine has since
left the airport for another job.) ``We didn't want to go with
chain-themed restaurants. We wanted to make them independently
owned.'' There is one chain, however _ Il Fornaio _ but it is based
in Corte Madera and most of its 22 restaurants are in California.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to convince Bay Area restaurateurs they should operate at
the airport, however, was tricky.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a lot of fears,'' said Bob Weinberg, the president of
Marketplace Development. ``If your restaurant is out on a
concourse, you have to take your lettuce through a metal detector.
You don't normally do that on Union Street. And then you have to do
a 10-year background check on all employees, for security.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg said to further whittle down the list, ``every
restaurant we didn't know was visited by one or two (of our)
people. They looked at food quality and service, and at the end of
the visit they would introduce themselves and do an informal
kitchen sanitation inspection. At that point, we did a very fast
cut, and anybody we thought just couldn't handle it, like very
small restaurants or places with no management capacity to do this,
was dropped from the list.''
</P>
<P>
   When the list of prospective restaurants had been chopped to
110, Weinberg started meeting with their owners in small groups,
where he told them ``the good and bad news _ the long hours, the
demand for high quality,'' and explained some of the arcana that
fetch up in leases with the City and County of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Added Weinberg, ``I told them about all the positives _ no one's
going to open a restaurant across the street from you, your market
is likely to grow, and you're going to get a lot of publicity that
will benefit your other restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to get an initial doubter like George Chen, owner
of such hot San Francisco spots as Shanghai 1930 and Xanadu, to
investigate further.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought, `Why would I want to do that?''' Chen
said the other day. ``Airports are not generally known as a place
for fine food _ you hear about the $8 hot dog and the $6 beer.
 &LR; Nobody  &LR; wants to eat at airports.'' Chen also said he had little
interest in ``the potential bureaucracy one would have to deal with
in doing a restaurant in the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Chen made the final cut in the selection process,
Weinberg encouraged him to stay with it. ``After being selected I
did more research,'' Chen said. ``Now I look at this thing as kind
of revolutionary, something that fills a need.'' The result was his
Restaurant Qi and Water Bar, the anchor restaurant in the new
airport eating complex.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said the customer he looks forward to feeding is the
``first-class business traveler who's stuck at the airport a lot''
and has a flight to Asia at 1:30 or 2 in the morning. ``A lot of
these people have to check in at 11 or 11:30 (p.m.) and the last
thing they want to do when they get on these planes is have a meal.
They want to sleep.'' So Chen figures he will feed them, and the
airline will put them to bed. Just to make sure his customers don't
miss their planes after a post-prandial cognac or two, Chen will
have closed-circuit flight information screens in his restaurant's
bar.
</P>
<P>
   There will be three kinds of restaurants at the new terminal,
according to Lorri Vasquez, the airport's concessions czarina _
``fine dining,'' like Chen's restaurant, which means you can sit
down in an upscale place; bars; and ``quick serve.'' The airport
will have two ``food courts, which we're calling food collections,
because they are higher quality than you would normally find,''
Vasquez said. ``We'll have (a version of) Harbor Village and Osho.
These are not your typical food-court lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbor Village will be what the airport calls a ``quick-serve
version of the high-end Harbor Village'' restaurant in San
Francisco's Embarcadero Center. Osho is a spin-off from a
well-known Millbrae restaurant. The new terminal will also have
versions of such well-known Bay Area eateries as Harry Denton's,
Lori's Diner, Emporio Rulli, Andale Mexican Restaurant, Cafe Metro
and the Deli-Up Cafe of San Francisco's Potrero district.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant operators will lease their location for a ``minimum
annual guarantee,'' based on square footage or a percentage of
gross revenues, whichever is higher.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez said that because the airport wants the prices to be the
same as they are in comparable restaurants elsewhere in the city,
``we try to make (the leases) reasonable based on how much they
could afford. We really want these restaurants to provide high
quality at reasonable prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new airport restaurants will be required to stay
open 16 hours a day and Vasquez said the airport, in a concession
to the possibility that business may be slow for some restaurants,
is not charging restaurant owners for maintaining the common areas
around the restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Nidal Nazzal, owner of the Burger Joint, a restaurant under
construction at the new terminal, said that he will open for
business in mid-September despite the delays. He plans on serving
airport employees, construction workers and the occasional charter
flight passengers who are scheduled to come through starting in
early September.

 &HT;    GINGRICH, BISEK WED IN NIGHTTIME CEREMONY BEFORE FAMILY, FRIENDS
 &HT;    Moving in both (w) Washington and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was married
Friday night to Calista Bisek, the congressional secretary with
whom he has been romantically involved for the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding, Gingrich's third and Bisek's first, took place in
front of 150 guests at the Morrison House, a small, expensive and
somewhat secluded hotel in Alexandria's historic Old Town district.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, in black-tie and tails, beamed broadly as soon as he
saw the blonde bride being escorted by her father to the altar
where the Rev. James Ford, the former chaplain of the U.S. House of
Representatives married them.
</P>
<P>
   Bisek admitted in a court deposition a year ago that she and
Gingrich had been having an affair since November 1993, more than a
year before he engineered the first Republican takeover of the
House since the 1950s and became speaker.
</P>
<P>
   She was deposed by lawyers for Gingrich's second wife, Marianne.
Gingrich filed for divorce from Marianne Gingrich on July 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But with the state flags of Georgia and Wisconsin, Bisek's home
state, flying over the hotel beside the U.S. flag and a string
quintet playing Pachelbel's Canon in D, Gingrich and his new bride
seemed radiantly happy, making their separate ways down a curving
set of steps at the hotel's entrance and into a nearby tent.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel officials said the former speaker ``just beamed'' when
Bisek and her father, Alfonse Bisek, entered the tent.
</P>
<P>
   The bride wore a white strapless gown with a short train and
carried white roses. Her bride's maids wore black gowns and carried
bouquets of red roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those roses are red. I'm a biologist and I know,'' said Carla
Fehr, one of several Old Town residents who watched the wedding
from behind police lines, along with journalists.
</P>
<P>
   A soprano sang Ave Maria and The Lord's Prayer, and guests _
primarily family and friends _ sang Ode to Joy during the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Wanda McKeon, general manager of the Morrison House, said
Gingrich had reserved the entire hotel, which has 43 rooms and
suites that range from $180 to $500 a night, as well as the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   After the wedding, guests dined on filet mignon and Alaskan
salmon, which was grilled according to a recipe provided by Sen.
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. Then they returned to the tent for dancing.

 NAPSTER INITIATES APPEAL PROCESS  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Arguing that its members are not copyright
criminals, Napster Inc. on Friday formally asked a federal appeals
court to throw out a preliminary injunction against the popular
online music-swapping company.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining a legal brief filed minutes before a deadline set by
the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco, Napster lawyers said
they believe a federal judge who issued the injunction
``misunderstood and misapplied'' previous court rulings and case
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our users are not liable,'' said Napster attorney Jonathan
Schiller. ``They are immune from liability under the Audio Home
Recording Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, he said, ``if they're not liable, we're not liable.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Mateo, Calif., startup ignited a digital music
revolution by creating an easy-to-use software program that lets
Napster members share for free MP3-formatted songs stored on one
another's computer hard drives. Napster estimates about 22 million
people have used the program.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the widespread use of Napster will drain revenues, major
record labels represented by the Recording Industry Association of
America sued Napster for copyright infringement last December. The
RIAA contends a vast majority of the music being exchanged by
Napster members are illegal copies.
</P>
<P>
   In an oral ruling July 26, U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn
Hall Patel ordered Napster to halt the sharing of songs owned by
RIAA members. Two days later, and hours before the injunction would
have taken effect, the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco
issued a stay.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court, finding there were precedent-setting legal
issues that had to be decided before the injunction took effect,
gave Napster lawyers until Friday to file their legal arguments
against Patel's order.
</P>
<P>
   Patel filed a 45-page written version of her ruling last week.
The judge rejected Napster's defense that a preliminary injunction,
to remain in effect until the copyright suit went to trial several
months later, would put Napster out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any destruction of Napster Inc. by a preliminary injunction is
speculative compared to the statistical evidence of massive,
unauthorized downloading and uploading of plaintiff's copyrighted
works, as many as 10,000 files per second,'' Patel wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court has every reason to believe that, without a
preliminary injunction, these numbers will mushroom as Napster
users, and newcomers attracted by the publicity, scramble to obtain
as much free music as possible before trial.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schiller said Napster's appeal to the Appeals Court is based
on the assertion that Patel misapplied several instances of case
law, particularly the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The act protects all non-commercial copying by consumers of
digital and analog recordings,'' Schiller said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Rubin, a Chicago attorney who specializes in copyright,
trademark and entertainment law, said the landmark case could be
decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, although he expects ``Napster
will probably wind up on the losing end.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Rubin said that among several legal arguments the
defense will use, Napster will try to convince the appeals court to
focus on the individual acts by Napster members rather than the
cumulative effect of millions of people downloading songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the individual act is not copyright infringement, then you
can't argue that all of these people somehow are collectively
committing copyright infringement,'' Rubin said. ``Napster is
saying that if copying by our subscribers for their own home use is
not copyright infringement, how can we be contributing to copyright
infringement.''
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry has until September 8 to file its
response, and Napster would have until September 12 to file a
reply. A hearing before the Ninth Circuit judges will be scheduled
sometime after that date, but until then, Napster fans will be able
to download songs.

TWIN GYMNASTS ARE PUSHING TO COMPETE IN SYDNEY TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wis.)   By SELENA ROBERTS   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Just a month or so short of their 18th birthdays, and
newly introduced to the shaving-cream market, Paul and Morgan Hamm
are back to wearing matching clothes.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, when they were into OshKosh overalls and pajamas
with feet, their mom, Cecily, would dress her twin sons alike for
fun. But she always encouraged them to be individuals &UR;  &LR; and pursue
their own paths. Still, somewhere along the way, the Hamm twins
developed identical ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, both walked off the floor of the Fleet Center
after the men's preliminary round of the U.S. Olympic gymnastics
trials, each in red, white and blue warmups, and each closing in on
a trip to Sydney, Australia. Paul Hamm is in the better position of
the two to make the six-man team, which will be named after the
finals on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   By nailing his pommel-horse routine and high-bar performance
with a pair of 9.75 scores, he finished in second place behind
Blaine Wilson. The top four gymnasts, ranked by their combined
scores from the trials and July's nationals, earn a place on the
team. The fifth and sixth places on the team will be decided by a
selection committee through a more subjective process.
</P>
<P>
   That puts Morgan Hamm in a much more precarious position.
Entering the finals, he is sixth among the men, just ahead of
30-year-old John Roethlisberger, a two-time Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can John make the Olympic team just because he made the last
one? '' Olympic coach Peter Kormann said. ``No. He knows he has to
do well in the finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Roethlisberger's career on the national team spans more than two
presidential terms. The Hamms aren't eligible to vote yet.
Roethlisberger wears a knee brace, has absorbed as many injuries as
a crash-test dummy, but is looking for one last Olympic team berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as prepared as I can be, and I've trained well, but it's
just not happening for me right now,'' a mystified Roethlisberger
said after several spills in the preliminaries. ``I can't explain
why I'm not hitting my routines. On the vault, I was fine, but I
got lost in the air and then I'm on my butt. On the high bar, I was
in perfect shape and then I ended up landing on my back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is. I mean I'm 30, but with the way I've
been practicing, it's not age. In that respect, that doesn't make
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hamms are newborns in comparison. For men gymnasts, maturing
into your 20s is an asset, as men often gain strength as they exit
from their teens. That makes the Hamms' arrival on this stage _
perhaps nudging out some older, more established gymnasts like
Roethlisberger _ even more remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's surprising how calm they are in competition,'' Peter
Kormann, the coach of the U.S. men's team, said. ``They look like
seasoned veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the peach fuzz, they are intense and focused, but not
blind to what the other is doing. After Morgan Hamm fell off the
pommel horse during preliminaries, one of the first people to
approach him was his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like, `You're strong, don't' get down,''' Morgan said.
``He really psyched me up. He got me going and was right there to
get me back on track. We want to motivate each other. We want the
other one to do well. That's the way it is with us.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no visible signs of a sibling rivalry. As if to
punctuate their normality, they entered an interview room Thursday
night looking like cast members off the set of a Doublemint
commercial, oozing wholesomeness, dripping Americana. It was a
scene made complete by a couple of quaint facts. They grew up in
Waukesha, Wis., with a father who was once an all-American diver
and a mother who makes candles.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the Hamm twins appear to be a pair of fresh faces to
light up the men's team, two similar soothing voices that come at
you in stereo. No twins have ever made a men's Olympic gymnastic
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like going through this with my twin,'' Morgan Hamm said.
``I think to be in the position we're in is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Even their enthusiasm is equal. As Morgan spoke, Paul finished
his sentence. But there are ways to tell them apart. In
competition, Paul is the more consistent one. In appearance, Morgan
is the one with the slight curve in the bridge of his nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both want the same thing,'' Paul Hamm said. ``Right now,
Morgan is on the spot a little bit. He could get in or fall out. I
want to see him hit his routines when I'm watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I made it and he didn't, I'm sure he'd be happy for me, but
we want to do this together. That's what we're here for. That's our
goal.'' &QL;

SUPERIOR INSURANCE REVIVED IN AGREEMENT
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. _ State regulators on Friday announced an
agreement reached with Kemper Insurance Cos. that finalizes the
rehabilitation plan for Superior National Insurance Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Edelen, a spokesman with the state Department of
Insurance, said Superior had also lifted the temporary suspension
of claims-related payments, and checks were again being issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are acquiring the renewal rights to write workers'
compensation policies to existing policyholders of Superior
National Insurance,'' said Linda Kingman, a spokeswoman with
Chicago-based Kemper.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is still subject to approval by a Superior Court
judge in Los Angeles, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are we pleased with Kemper's commitment to the claims
operations, but also that the rehabilitation plan can now go
forward, and we anticipate filing the final contract documents with
the court within a week, said Richard G. Krenz, special deputy
insurance commissioner, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   To acquire the rights to policies, Kingman said Kemper would pay
$2.25 million and a 2 percent commission on business signed over
the next three years to the state of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have pretty significant experience in workers'
compensation,'' she said. ``We think we can bring our expertise to
this business and do it in a way that will be profitable to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelen said the deal, reached early Friday morning, ``allows for
the rehabilitation and gives Kemper part of the package to bring
Superior National back to viability.''
</P>
<P>
   The next phase of the rehabilitation plan will be the
application for a Liquidation Order early next month. The order
ensures that all policyholders and claimants are protected, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kemper, headquartered in Chicago, had revenues of almost $3
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Calabasas, Superior National consists of five
companies. Four of them - California Compensation Insurance Co.,
Combined Benefits Insurance Co., Superior National Insurance Co.,
and Superior Pacific Casualty Co. - were seized March 3 by
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators took over day-to-day operations at the state's
largest workers' compensation insurer saying it lacked the reserves
to pay claims.
</P>
<P>
   Customers with questions about coverages or policies with
Superior National can contact the Department of Insurance Consumer
Hotline at 800-927-HELP or (213) 897-8921.

CLEANUP CREWS SWEEP BACK INTO CITY

   LOS ANGELES _ Whew!
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people - from Los Angeles merchants and city
leaders to out-of-town reporters and Democratic officials -
breathed a collective sigh of relief Friday as workers tore down
the convention hall inside the Staples Center a day after the
Democratic National Convention ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank the Lord, it's over,'' said Jack Serna, manager of a
Winston Tires store across the street from the Staples Center that
was damaged in June by rioters after the Lakers won the NBA
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners and city officials had been waiting for this
week for months, many fearing that protests and negative publicity
might grip the city.
</P>
<P>
   But four days later, most are calling the convention a success
and are eager to return to business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went very well,'' said City Councilman Alex Padilla, who
also was a delegate at the convention. ``I talked to people this
last week from all over the country, and they were just blown away
with how great of a time they had here in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Staples Center on Friday, workers vaccuumed confetti,
tore up phone and electrical lines and hauled out materials from
the arena that, only a matter of hours before, was packed with
35,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   In the adjacent Convention Center, workers were dismantling news
organizations' work booths.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's a little bit of a letdown, just because now you
look around and the confetti's just slowly falling to the ground
and it's really over,'' said Staples Center communications director
Michael Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said it will take about 10 days for crews to fully clean up
and move out of the Convention Center and Staples Center. The next
two events scheduled for Staples Center are the Latin Grammy Awards
on Sept. 13 and Barbra Streisand's final two concerts on Sept. 20
and 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a nice feeling to go home,'' said Reuters News
Service cameraman Tipp McClure, who will head back to Washington,
D.C., this weekend after joining 15,000 journalists who converged
on Los Angeles for the convention. ``It's sort of a strange
euphoria when you pack everything up.''
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Avery of Virginia has been in Los Angeles for a month,
volunteering for the Democratic News Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here at the beginning, I was here during and I am here
after,'' she said, surveying the aftermath of the convention
Friday. ``And they pulled it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Green, director of communications for the DNC, stood
inside the arena and watched crews starting to dismantle the
massive stage below and makeshift television studios in the
skyboxes above.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an arduous process, but I think very successful, and
everyone just wants some time to relax,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Green will go home to Washington, D.C, next week, where she
already has decided what she will do first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleep,'' she said.

WOODS SHARES SPOTLIGHT, BUT LEAD IS HIS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GLF-ANDERSON-COLUMN, GLF-PGA-INJURY) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Tiger Woods did not mind sharing the spotlight
with Jack Nicklaus, but Woods wanted the lead for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Capped by a special moment on the 18th green, where Woods and
Nicklaus both made birdies, the second day of the PGA Championship
ended with Woods in a familiar position, at the top.
</P>
<P>
   While Nicklaus barely missed the cut and probably played his
last round of a PGA Championship, Woods continued his methodical
march toward what would be another historic victory.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, unlike what happened in the U.S. Open and the
British Open, when Woods ran away from the field, the pursuing pack
was not very far back.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was the clubhouse leader at 11 under par (133), holding a
1-stroke lead over Scott Dunlap when second-round play was
suspended by darkness with 11 players still on the course. Davis
Love III, the 1997 winner of the PGA Championship, was tied for
third place at 7 under par, with Fred Funk and J.P. Hayes. And
Nicklaus shot a 71 after an opening-round 77.
</P>
<P>
   So while it has been difficult to play quickly at Valhalla Golf
Club, with some of Thursday's rounds taking more than six hours, it
has not been difficult to make birdies. Perhaps Woods will
ultimately win his third consecutive major, and join Ben Hogan as
the only player to win three professional majors in one year.
</P>
<P>
   But many other players had legitimate reason to hope, and the
weekend had legitimate potential for drama.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a 5-under-par 67, after an opening-round 66, Woods
broke out of a first-round tie with Dunlap (10 under par), who shot
a 68 Friday after an opening-round 66.
</P>
<P>
   But the focus Friday was on Nicklaus and Woods, who were paired
in the first two rounds for the first time, and probably the last
time. Both players finished in style at No. 18, with Nicklaus
nearly making an eagle from the fairway before his tap-in birdie,
and Woods making a beautiful up-and-down birdie from a difficult
position in a green side bunker.
</P>
<P>
   After Woods' final 12-foot birdie putt disappeared into the
hole, Nicklaus smiled approvingly. And after Nicklaus made his
birdie, Woods did the same.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fitting ending to a memorable day, as the gallery
serenaded Nicklaus with affection from tee to green. For Nicklaus,
winner of 18 professional majors, including five PGA Championships,
it was a farewell. But for Woods, the tournament was only
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been quite a two days,'' said Woods, who can become the
first back-to-back winner of the PGA Championship since Denny Shute
in 1936 and 1937. ``I enjoyed playing with Jack and it was great
for me. Nobody even noticed what I was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with where I am because this golf course is very
demanding. You're faced with some difficult shots and some
difficult putts. Any time you shoot 11 under par after 36 holes at
a major, you should be leading.''
</P>
<P>
   When Woods won the U.S. Open by an astonishing 16 shots in June,
he led by six strokes at the halfway mark. When he won the British
Open in July by eight shots, he had a 3-stroke lead after two
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Woods is not entering the weekend with a lead
that looks insurmountable. Dunlap, a 37-year-old who has never won
on the PGA Tour, has been the surprise player of the tournament,
showing the moxie to stay in contention when most people are
waiting for him to fall back.
</P>
<P>
   Starting the day tied with Woods at 6 under par, Dunlap nearly
kept pace with the world's No. 1 player, and he continued to make
huge putts.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap made a 35-foot birdie putt at No. 3, he made a 25-footer
for birdie at No. 10, and he almost made a 40-foot birdie putt for
eagle at No. 18, before settling for a tap-in birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Can a player who has never won on tour outplay Woods at a major?
Dunlap was eager to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger will be extremely difficult to beat because you know
that is what he lives for,'' said Dunlap of the pressure facing the
leaders this weekend. ``He actually gets better at that time, much
like Jack did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there will be many bookies tonight taking bets
on Scott Dunlap. I don't have anyone else's expectations to live up
to, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if anything in his past would prepare him for playing with
Woods in Saturday's final group, Dunlap said: ``No. You never know
when you're ready. At the end of 72 holes, you realize you didn't
choke, you didn't screw up, you won. Who knows? Maybe it will
happen this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Love reached 9 under par after a birdie at No. 16, but he
finished his day with costly bogeys at both No. 17 and No. 18, a
finish Love will regret if he ultimately loses by a shot or two.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of play has been somewhat regrettable already. It has
been very slow at times, particularly on Thursday, when some rounds
took more than six hours to complete. Players grumbled heavily,
unhappy about waiting as much as 10 or 15 minutes between shots.
</P>
<P>
   All four par-5 holes are reachable in two shots, so when players
reached the tee on a par-5 hole, there was often a group standing
in the fairway, waiting for the green to clear so that they could
hit their second shot.
</P>
<P>
   The deep rough, the long walks between some greens and tee
boxes, the humid weather and the severely undulating greens that
often left players with long putts, only added to the slow pace.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing seemed to distract Woods, who remained the man to
beat. His birdie at No. 18 Friday was special, when he hit an
impressive bunker shot from a buried lie that cleared a high ridge
and settled 15 feet from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' lie in the bunker was so bad, and the ridge was so steep,
that he considered hitting out of the bunker sideways. But after
his skillful bunker shot, Woods ended the day by making his putt to
take the outright lead over Dunlap, who was already in the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend should be intense. But once again, Woods is the man
to catch.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOGADISHU, Somalia _ The warlords of Mogadishu are a courteous
bunch. They smile. They reason in soft tones. They even serve
visitors cardamom tea and something sweet and orange resembling
Tang. But it is not their good manners that you notice first.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is,'' Osman Atto, one warlord, said with some
understatement, ``an assortment of armaments in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside his house, Atto's militia was decked with countless
automatic weapons, including a spiffy submachine gun that would fit
nicely under a jacket. Many militiamen drive around town in pickups
mounted with anti-aircraft guns. That might seem excessive, but
apparently it was useful when gunmen allied with Atto blasted down
a steel gate recently to kidnap two foreign aid workers for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The warlords _ who prefer the title ``faction leader'' _ look as
scary as ever. But there is a question in the hopeful air these
days: How much power do they really wield? Not as much as they once
did, many Somalis say, but enough to make trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The question will be put to the test if, as expected, the first
Somali government since 1991 is formed and actually tries to
govern. For the last several months, thousands of Somalis have
gathered in neighboring Djibouti to plan. They have already set up
an assembly aimed at establishing a permanent government.
</P>
<P>
   But four of the five major warlords in Mogadishu have refused to
attend the conference, so any government's success is uncertain. No
one has forgotten that it was the warlords who frustrated the U.N.
operation here in the early 1990s. And in interviews, three of them
hinted at violence if a new government comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the consent of the population and the leaders of the
factional organizations, this would lead to civil war,'' said
Hussein Aidid, 38, who took over a major faction after his father,
Gen. Muhammad Farah Aidid, was killed in 1996. ``Nobody can impose
on us a government.''
</P>
<P>
   Another warlord, Muse Sudi Yalahow, said, ``We are going to
defend our town from these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Atto, who speaks with a rough idiomatic American accent, said:
``I would ignore it. And if anybody tries to tell me, `I am your
government,' I would tell them, `You go to hell.'''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the harsh words, there is a sense that the warlords
_ who divided power into clan fiefs after Muhammad Siad Barre fell
in 1991 _ may not be the deciding factor anymore. Courts and police
units set up by Islamic groups have siphoned off authority. So have
business people, who not only hire their own militias but also
provide jobs and money to people other than thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most of all, Somalis seem plain weary of the warlords,
who have caused much of the factional fighting, and who have failed
in 12 peace conferences over a decade to settle their differences.
``Nobody listens to them,'' said one Mogadishu resident, Ali
Muhammad Osman, 38.
</P>
<P>
   Another, Farhan Muhammad Hersi, 18, suggested that the warlords
were out of step with most Somalis, who seem to support the work in
Djibouti overwhelmingly. ``We are against anyone who is against
peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the warlords would oppose any government, no matter
what, seeing it as impinging on their power. But it is clear why
they hate what is happening in Djibouti: The conference was
organized explicitly to exclude them as leaders. They were invited,
but only as citizens or members of their clans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Djibouti is a reconciliation conference,'' Yalahow said. ``But
with whom are we reconciling in Djibouti? All the faction leaders
are here.''
</P>
<P>
   All except one, Muhammad Ali Madhi, who served as president
after Siad Barre fell and who is active in Djibouti. He seems to be
betting his future on a new government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the faction leaders who will decide what will
happen,'' he said in a recent interview in Djibouti. ``It's the
people who have the right to decide for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are not here,'' he added, ``they don't care
about their country.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, there are prominent Somalis other than the warlords who
object to the Djibouti conference. Among them are a number of
officials from the Siad Barre regime, including the former
ministers of interior, finance and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Also among them are two politicians who command more respect and
influence than the warlords. One is Abdullahi Yussef Ahmed, a
former faction leader who set up a stable government in a
northeastern Somali region called Puntland. The other is Muhammad
Ibrahim Egal, who leads another pocket of stability, Somaliland, in
the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Aidid said the Djibouti conference was rushing ahead without
Ahmed and Egal _ and could turn them further away from the rest of
Somalia, perhaps violently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a fear,'' he said. ``There is no quick solution to the
problems of Somalia.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts say that although Somaliland and Puntland present
political problems, they are more long-term. The warlords, on the
other hand, present the real threat of violence as soon as any
government tries to assert its authority. To lessen that worry, the
delegates in Djibouti are seeking to seat the new government in the
inland city of Baidoa, at least temporarily, rather than in the
still-fractious capital, Mogadishu. But that issue is still not
settled.
</P>
<P>
   As with so many problems in poor regions, the deciding issue may
be money. Many Somalis say a government's surest road to success
would be paved with money from rich countries. It would make the
government popular and provide jobs for the warlords' gunmen _
maybe even for the warlords themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they are going to do: kill them, put them
behind bars or give them contracts,'' said one businessman in
Mogadishu, whose name is being omitted just to be on the safe side.
</P>
<P>
   The last option is not so far-fetched. All three men are in
business, and Atto was once a successful construction contractor.
He made a point of showing off to a visitor his huge garage, filled
with millions of dollars in bulldozers, backhoes and other heavy
machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't he make more money, he was asked, rebuilding the nation
in peace?
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not a problem _ being rich,'' he insisted. ``The
problem is achieving what you would call stability.''

LAWRENCE H. COOKE, 85, NEW YORK CHIEF JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawrence H. Cooke, a former chief judge of New York state known
for his homespun style and liberal rulings on such matters as the
rights of criminal defendants and freedom of the press, died Aug.
17 at his home in Monticello, N.Y. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   As chief judge, he was responsible for administering one of the
largest judicial systems in the country, and he served as chief
judge of the state Court of Appeals, the highest judicial position
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, one of his successors, issued a
statement Friday in which she praised Cooke for his ``outspoken
support of women and minorities'' and for a personal style that was
``never abstract or bookish'' and that led him to prefer to be
called just Larry.
</P>
<P>
   In a judicial career of more than 30 years, some of Cooke's most
significant opinions came while seated on the state Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a case called People v. Roberts, Cooke wrote in
the majority opinion that once a lawyer has entered a proceeding in
what may develop into a criminal case, the police must cease
questioning the suspect, and that a waiver of the right to counsel
may be made only in the presence of counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Cooke's liberal opinions were in criminal cases. In
Sharrock v. Dell Buick-Cadillac, Cooke wrote the majority opinion
that a state lien law permitting garage operators to satisfy an
overdue bill by auctioning off the delinquent customer's car
constituted a state deprivation of property without due process of
law under the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In Beach v. Shanley, Cooke wrote the court's opinion that the
Shield Law permits a reporter who has been called before a grand
jury to withhold the name of confidential sources without being
subject to any sanction for criminal contempt.
</P>
<P>
   While chief judge, he frequently tangled with governors over
court budgets and with lower-court judges over assignments. In
1982, Cooke went so far as to appear as a litigant in his own
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those struggles, he later acknowledged, were little more
than turf wars waged by those whose authority had been diminished
by the 1977 constitutional amendments making the administration of
the state court system the responsibility of the chief judge.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had behaved highhandedly in these matters,
Cooke replied, ``You cannot consult with 3,500 judges or 10,000
people on every decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooke received national recognition for his work as chief judge
in improving New York's courts.
</P>
<P>
   He had leadership roles in the National Center for State Courts,
where he served as president, and in the Conference of Chief
Justices, of which he was chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke was elected to the Court of Appeals in 1974 and was
appointed chief judge by Gov. Hugh Carey in January 1979. He had
been named associate justice of the Appellate Division, 3rd
Department, by Gov. Nelson Rockefeller in 1968, and had been a
justice of the Supreme Court, 3rd Division, since 1961; he had
twice been elected Sullivan County judge and surrogate.
</P>
<P>
   He was a vigorous advocate for the State Justice Institute,
which provides grants to state and local court systems, and in 1986
President Ronald Reagan named him to its first board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in 1984 shortly before he reached 70, the age of
mandatory retirement, Cooke called his rise to one of the most
coveted judicial positions in the country a ``miracle'' because he
was the son of a small-town lawyer who lacked both money and
significant statewide political connections.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Henry Cooke was born Oct. 15, 1914, in Monticello. He
graduated from Monticello High School and then from Georgetown
University cum laude in 1935, and from the Albany Law School in
1938.
</P>
<P>
   After opening a law office in Monticello in 1939, he was elected
supervisor of the Town of Thompson for two terms. His judicial
career began in 1953 when he was elected county judge, surrogate
and Children's Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement in 1984, Cooke returned to private practice
and was also a scholar in residence at Pace Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke is survived by his wife, Alice McCormack Cooke of
Monticello; two sons, Edward M. Cooke of Monticello and George L.
Cooke II of Rock Hill, N.Y.; a daughter, Mary Lauren Cooke Opie of
Amesbury, Mass.; nine grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke agreed that his country-style informality and small-town
involvement, which included four decades of service as a volunteer
firefighter in Monticello and later in administrative firefighting
posts throughout Sullivan County, led some people to regard him as
something of a hayseed. But his critics, he said, underestimated
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some people wanted to feel I was a rustic, a country
bumpkin, but I never thought so,'' he said. ``I went to the proper
schools. I had been around, and I felt I could hold my own in any
company. But I never lorded over anybody. I felt you could be
efficient and still be nice.''

2ND COSTCO SUSPECT ARRESTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAN NUYS, Calif. _ Los Angeles police on Friday announced the
arrest of a Van Nuys man as the second suspect in Sunday's shootout
at a Costco store that left one person dead and three injured.
</P>
<P>
   Ignacio Chavez, 47, was taken into custody without resistance
Wednesday at his home in the 7000 block of Hazeltine Avenue, Police
Chief Bernard Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were given a lead on Chavez through a source who
tipped off police about his unregistered vehicle, which had been
seen in the vicinity of the shooting, Parks said. Police kept his
house under surveillance, followed him when he left and arrested
him.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is believed to be the brother of the other man in
custody, identified as Ramon Gutierrez, 38, of Van Nuys, who was
wounded in his left leg after the shootout and arrested the same
day, said Lt. Jimmy Grayson of the LAPD Robbery-Homicide Division.
</P>
<P>
   Grayson said officers will refer the case to the District
Attorney's Office and seek homicide and robbery charges against the
two. Police, however, would not release pictures of the suspects
because they are still seeking witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Police also displayed weapons recovered from Gutierrez and from
Chavez's home. These included a Chinese version of an AK-47, an
MAK-90 semiautomatic, a Colt .45 equipped with a silencer, several
ammunition magazines capable of holding 12 to 50 rounds and
hundreds of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells me they were professionals and had done this
before,'' Grayson said, adding officers are looking to determine if
the two were responsible for a holdup of a Brinks armored truck
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez and Chavez did not live in the same home, Grayson
said. Both men were unemployed and had no families, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfire broke out last Sunday shortly after 2:30 p.m. as
hundreds of shoppers were going in and out of the Costco at 6100
Sepulveda Blvd.
</P>
<P>
   Grayson said the two were stalking an armored car from Sectran
Security Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``They followed the guard and stood outside the doors with their
weapons hidden in carts,'' Grayson said. ``When the guard came out
of the store, they pulled the weapons and people started scurrying
all over, looking for cover, and bullets started being fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Owen Wolf, 21, of Studio City died in the gunfire. He was a
customer at the store.
</P>
<P>
   The guard was able to get back into the armored car, and the
driver backed into the vehicle the two suspects were using as a
getaway car.
</P>
<P>
   Grayson said that helped lead to the arrest of Gutierrez because
the vehicle broke down with a flat tire.
</P>
<P>
   The detective said Chavez has a prior arrest on suspicion of
robbery, but no record has turned up on Gutierrez.

1975 KILLING INVOLVES LAWS NOT MEANT FOR ADULT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ In making the crucial decision on whether
Michael Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy charged with the 1975
murder of Martha Moxley, is to stand trial as a juvenile or as an
adult, Judge Maureen D. Dennis must navigate a thicket of
quarter-century-old juvenile justice laws never intended for
application to a middle-aged defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel, now 39, is charged as a juvenile because he was 15 when
Moxley, a neighbor in the gated Belle Haven enclave of Greenwich,
was bludgeoned to death with a golf club. The prosecution has asked
Dennis to transfer the case to Superior Court, where conviction by
a jury could bring a sentence of life imprisonment. Conviction as a
juvenile could mean no jail time at all.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Dennis ruled that there was ``reasonable cause,''
based on evidence presented at a hearing in June, for Skakel to
stand trial. Meticulously following the letter of the law, she has
now ordered an investigation, to be conducted by a juvenile
probation order, that will provide a profile of Skakel. Using that
profile, the judge will then answer several questions posed by the
25-year-old juvenile justice law.
</P>
<P>
   To transfer the case from juvenile to adult court, the judge
must find that ``there is no state institution designed for the
care and treatment of children'' to which Skakel can be sent if
convicted, or that the ``safety of the community requires'' Skakel
to be detained as an adult. She also must find that the Superior
Court is a ``more effective setting'' for deciding the case and
that an adult prison is ``more suitable'' for Skakel's ``care or
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Supreme Court has ruled that in the context of
juvenile delinquency, the law must be applied as it existed at the
time of the offense. The statutes have been revised many times
since 1975, and under current law Skakel's case would have been
automatically transferred. But neither the current law nor the 1975
law cover the situation of a middle-aged defendant. A grown man
being tried for a killing allegedly committed as a boy is a first
in the state, leaving Dennis unable to rely on precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Both the initial finding of reasonable cause by Dennis and the
follow-up investigation she has ordered were required under the law
that in 1975 governed the transfer of murder cases involving
juvenile defendants to Superior Court. Another section of the law
specified that the investigating probation officer should collect
detailed information about the juvenile defendant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge has to make certain findings, and I think it's
through that investigation that she will get the information that
she needs to make those findings,'' said Francis J. Carino, who was
the state's chief juvenile prosecutor for 17 years and now works in
the chief state's attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Carino said that the old juvenile justice statutes viewed the
transfer of a child's case to Superior Court as a grave decision,
and therefore required a thorough investigation to understand the
circumstances of the juvenile's life, with an eye toward treatment
and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman, said he believed that the
probation officer's investigation would confirm a point that he
sought to make during the reasonable cause hearing in June: that
Skakel's life over the last 25 years proves that he is not a danger
to society and that the case should not be transferred to Superior
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge has to base her decision on what she thinks the
future holds for a young person,'' Sherman said in an interview
Friday. ``Here we have the benefit of knowing the future. It's
behind us. We own the crystal ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said that wherever the case is tried his client would
be found not guilty. ``The bottom line is: is he guilty?'' Sherman
said. ``I do not believe for a minute that Michael Skakel committed
this crime, and I have no doubt that a jury or a judge will make
that determination.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what would happen if Dennis decided to try Skakel
as a juvenile and he was ultimately found guilty. ``If the case
went on and stayed in juvenile and if there was a conviction, there
wouldn't be a juvenile program that could accept an adult,'' said
Ginny Apple, a spokeswoman for the state's judicial branch.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley's mother, Dorthy, who has long pressed for justice in the
case, said Friday that she was hopeful it would be heard in
Superior Court. ``This decision of Judge Dennis' was only half of
what we wanted to hear, but you know I have patience and I am
willing to wait for the other half,'' she said.

PROUD DAY AFTER FOR L.A.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a joyous shout and a collective sigh of
relief, Los Angeles officials congratulated themselves on Friday
for getting through the Democratic National Convention with what
they said was flying colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it right,'' an exuberant Mayor Richard Riordan shouted
at a news conference in front of City Hall with some 100 of those
involved. ``We hosted the greatest convention ever. I've never been
more proud of the city of Los Angeles than I am today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been more proud of city employees and Angelenos who
showed the world why we are the capital city of the 21st Century.''
</P>
<P>
   As some limping and bleary-eyed supporters applauded, Riordan
and others who were involved in the planning of the convention -
from the event itself to security, transportation and other
emergency services - said they were ecstatic at the results of the
four-day event and what it has done for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Riordan acknowledged, he wasn't ready to host another such
event in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever heard of NIMTO?'' Riordan joked. ``It means Not In My
Term of Office. It's like hosting a wedding for your oldest
daughter. You hope the others will elope.''
</P>
<P>
   What was important about the event, Riordan said, is how it
helped change the image of the city in the eyes of the rest of the
world - which often thinks of it in terms of riots, earthquakes,
fires and floods along with the latest corruption scandal involving
the Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed the world that we can handle an event like this and
accommodate everyone,'' Riordan said, adding he was also grateful
to demonstrators who worked to keep peace while voicing their
viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Schatz, president of the Central City Association of
downtown businesses, echoed Riordan's thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sent an important message to the world and to the city
itself,'' Schatz said. ``It showed the talent we have here for
putting on a sophisticated event and how safe downtown is. It put
the '92 riots behind us and showed how the city can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, who drew some criticism for the
way officers handled a melee after a concert on Monday night, said
he also was pleased with the way the convention went.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for Los Angeles,'' Parks said. ``We showed
we can handle an event of this size with no serious problems.''
</P>
<P>
   City Council President Pro Tem Ruth Galanter said she was
impressed with how the police - along with other agencies including
the Secret Service, California Highway Patrol and FBI - were able
to allow demonstrators to make their points known.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed the world how democracy works with the Democratic
convention and in allowing people to protest in the streets without
violating anyone's rights,'' Galanter said.
</P>
<P>
   Noelia Rodriguez, the former deputy mayor who was brought on as
chief executive officer of the convention's Host Committee, said
she believed the committee did its part to show off the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The predictions of doom and gloom never came to fruition,''
Rodriguez said. ``This is a day of pride. When we undertook the
effort to show Democrats around the city, we showed them they were
right in picking Los Angeles. This week, the city of Angels was
heaven on Earth for Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez offered particular thanks to Riordan for his
fund-raising efforts, bringing in more than $6 million for the Host
Committee to meet its obligations to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said the entire convention was a high point for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what I enjoyed most is that everywhere I went
delegates would give me high-fives and tell me how wonderful the
city is,'' Riordan said. ``It made everything worthwhile.''

RED BULLET WILL MISS A DIMINISHED TRAVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ After reeling off their respective
victories in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness in May, Fusaichi
Pegasus and Red Bullet were being counted on by many to help
reinvigorate the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Now, neither colt will run in the summer's biggest race for
3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Orseno, who trains Red Bullet, announced Friday that he
would hold his colt out of next Saturday's Travers Stakes here
because of the lingering effects of the same viral infection that
caused Red Bullet to skip the Haskell at Monmouth on Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus finally back in
training but still having yet to race since losing the Preakness,
the Travers, Saratoga's signature race, is without the two biggest
3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing needed a horse like Red Bullet and a horse like
Fusaichi Pegasus to run against each other,'' Orseno said Friday.
``It's good for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   What has not been good for the game is the prolonged absence of
either, much less both.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame,'' Orseno said, ``because I think the Travers
needs a big name.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the race known as the Midsummer Derby will feature a
field of nine less distinguished colts, led by the surprise Belmont
winner Commendable, who finished last in the Dwyer and second to
last in the Haskell his last two times out. Also missing will be
Graeme Hall, the upset winner of the Jim Dandy last month at
Saratoga. His trainer, Todd Pletcher, said Friday that the horse
had sustained a hairline fracture of his left knee during that
race.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Red Bullet and Fusaichi Pegasus keep missing each
other, as a once-budding rivalry has all but fizzled. The colts
have raced head-to-head only twice, with Fusaichi Pegasus winning
the Wood at Aqueduct before Red Bullet returned the favor, and
dashed Fusaichi Pegasus' Triple Crown hopes, in the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus, who was syndicated for a reported $60 million
last weekend, began working out again in Southern California this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet last raced on July 9 at Belmont, where he finished
third in the Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cautious approach, Orseno and the colt's owner, Frank
Stronach, had held Red Bullet out of both the Kentucky Derby and
the Belmont, hoping not to overtax the horse. But Friday, Orseno
conceded that the colt ``seems to come up with excuse after
excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least there's next year. Orseno said Friday that Stronach
was committed to racing Red Bullet as a 4-year-old. &QL;

Rodriguez said. ``This is a day of pride. When we undertook the
effort to show Democrats around the city, we showed them they were
right in picking Los Angeles. This week, the city of Angels was
heaven on Earth for Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez offered particular thanks to Riordan for his
fund-raising efforts, bringing in more than $6 million for the Host
Committee to meet its obligations to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said the entire convention was a high point for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what I enjoyed most is that everywhere I went
delegates would give me high-fives and tell me how wonderful the
city is,'' Riordan said. ``It made everything worthwhile.''

GORE'S SPEECH SATISFIES HIS SUPPORTERS IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add 2nd `n' to Georgianna in 7th graf.)  
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   MAPLEWOOD, N.J. _ As the confetti fell and the delegates
thundered in Los Angeles Thursday night, there was a far more
modest eruption of glee at the Fabrizio home here, where three
generations of women were watching Al Gore's long-awaited televised
pitch to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore promised that his administration would serve the
people, not the powerful, Lois Corcoran, 39, just home from her
nursing job, whooped along with the ecstatic throng at the Staples
Center. Her daughter, Amanda Orem, 18, who will vote for the first
time this year, cheered, as well.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of doubting Gore and his ability to wow a crowd,
Orem and her mother said they were pleased by his speech _ and
relieved. ``I was kind of worried he'd be a dud, but he came off
great,'' said Orem, a sophomore at the College of New Jersey who is
a registered independent. ``His words seemed heartfelt. As a
struggling middle-class family, we felt like he was talking to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's presidential coming out Thursday night may not have won
over any rock-ribbed Republicans, but interviews with New Jersey
voters found that he had carried enough zest to turn them, at
least, from tepid supporters into veritable stalwarts.
</P>
<P>
   Until Gore mounted the stage, many Democrats and independents
spoke of the vice president as if he were a kindly, if somewhat
insufferable, uncle. ``I wish he wasn't so stiff and didn't seem so
distant,'' said Jo Allen Henry, 44, a fourth-grade teacher from
Plainfield, voicing a common refrain. ``He needs to be more
lively.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Davis did not look entirely mesmerized as he sat in his
living room watching Gore jab the air with his hands. Still, at
least he did not join his wife, who dozed through the entire
52-minute speech. ``Obviously Gore doesn't compare to Clinton, but
he was much more dynamic than I expected,'' said Davis, 36, a
medical recruiter from Bloomfield. ``There were a couple of times
where he threw in some fake laughter, but everyone does it. Except
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Gore is succeeding in crafting an
identity separate from that of his charismatic boss. After watching
him speak, Georgianna Walsh, 55, an elementary school teacher from
Montville, said she was satisfied that he would be his own man. But
most of all, she thought he had shown Americans that he would spare
them from the indignities of the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said that unlike the president, whom she called a
disappointment, Gore seemed ``wholesome and honest.'' ``We've been
through enough,'' she said. ``You can't imagine what it's like to
have a bunch of fifth-graders asking you about the cigar and the
blue dress.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Walsh has been sold, her husband, Mike, has not. A
construction worker, union loyalist and National Rifle Association
member, Mike Walsh, 55, is a registered Democrat who usually
hopscotches his way through a ballot without regard to party
affiliations. He voted for Ronald Reagan and George Bush, but he
also voted for Clinton the second time around.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what he termed a decent performance by the vice
president, Walsh said he had not been entirely impressed by Gore.
``I still might pick Bush or even Ralph Nader,'' he said. ``We'll
see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many voters seemed swept up by the news media's endless
dissection of Gore's public persona and his lack of razzle-dazzle,
others were more focused on his politics and his positions. Orem,
who opposes the death penalty and supports gay marriage and
abortion rights, said there was no way she could vote for Gov.
George W. Bush. She is not thrilled by Gore's support for capital
punishment, but she said she appreciated his defiant words on Roe
v. Wade; his reference to Matthew Shepard, the young gay man who
died after being beaten in Wyoming in 1998; and his promise to make
college tuition tax- deductible.
</P>
<P>
   In a swing state like New Jersey, where half the voters are
independents and recent polls show the two candidates to be neck
and neck, pulling in voters like Orem will be critical. But in his
effort to play to the middle and the left, Gore runs the risk of
turning off voters like Mike Walsh, who sees Gore as too liberal.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, die-hard progressives like Steven Cherry, 44, of
Wayne, said that Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman, were too conservative. Despite the vice president's
populist proposals for working-class America and Lieberman's
efforts to recast his positions on affirmative action, Cherry was
not swayed. ``Lieberman is too moralistic and Gore doesn't have any
moral fiber,'' said Cherry, who edits engineering publications on
the Internet. ``I'll vote for them, but I'll be holding my nose.''
</P>
<P>
   Jo Allen Henry, who is black, complained that the Democrats were
not doing enough to ease racism, joblessness and the despair in her
community. ``Everyone keeps talking about this great era of
prosperity, but in the black community, you just don't see it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, any thoughts Henry had of voting for Bush were vanquished
as she watched the Republican National Convention, with its
strategic splashes of minority color. ``I found their convention
scary,'' she said. ``But on the other hand, I feel like the
Democratic Party takes the black vote for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, she will swallow her cynicism, vote for
Gore and hope for the best. ``I liked a lot of what he said,
especially on education and campaign finance reform,'' she said,
``but I've seen too many candidates make promises they don't
keep.''

COMMENTARY: THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION AND THE CHANGING FACE OF LOS
ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>
   (CHANGES ``of the old'' to ``powerful'' in 7th graf)  
 By STEVEN R. WEISMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Democrats this week, a flood of nostalgia
evoked a bygone time in politics when Lew Wasserman, head of MCA,
Frank Sinatra and other figures in the old Hollywood establishment
hobnobbed at the 1960 convention with John F. Kennedy. Back then,
the entertainment industry supplied the glamour for a political
party trying to look hip and committed. But the real power in Los
Angeles resided elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The convention this week showed how the entertainment industry
has moved from the gilt-edged periphery of the Democratic Party to
its financial and cultural center. For Los Angeles that transition
has come with a striking geographical twist. Forty years ago the
power center was downtown. This Democratic convention, though it
took place downtown, reflected how much the center of power has
shifted to the city's west side, where the entertainment and
fashion industries are rooted.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ronald Reagan was a son of Hollywood, he had no interest
in engineering such a transition when he ran for president in 1980.
Reagan's financial backers were not from show business, but from
the other Los Angeles business establishment _ men like Justin
Dart, Holmes Tuttle, Henry Salvatori and Alfred Bloomingdale. Many
of them had earlier recruited Reagan to run for governor after
making fortunes in the oil, aerospace and real estate industries.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1960 convention the new and largely Jewish Democratic
political establishment on the west side and the San Fernando
Valley was beginning to hit its stride. But it was a time when
Jews, blacks and other minorities were still excluded from the
California Club, the Jonathan Club, the Los Angeles Country Club
and other precincts where Los Angeles' movers and shakers virtually
ran the town. Indeed the downtown and west side establishments when
I was growing up here hardly even knew each other.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``The Powers That Be,'' David Halberstam spoke of
the time in the 1960s when Dorothy Chandler, doyenne of the family
that owned The Los Angeles Times, then a conservative Republican
paper that Jews looked on with disapproval, tried to bridge the gap
between downtown and West Los Angeles. She realized that to raise
money to save the old Hollywood Bowl and build a new music center,
she had to go where the money was, to men like Wasserman of MCA and
to Paul Ziffren, the top lawyer in west Los Angeles and a stalwart
of the Democratic Party. Chandler, Halberstam wrote, ``knew what
was happening in the world of the arts, and there the changes were
taking place much faster than they did in the world of the
California Club.''
</P>
<P>
   The coming together of new and old money occurred so fast that
by the 1980s, when the Reagan team reached its zenith of power in
the nation, the old guard was becoming increasingly irrelevant in
its own home town. Mayor Tom Bradley, an African-American, had put
together his own coalition of minorities, Jews and moderate
business leaders. He barred city officials from attending meetings
in the California Club and even got an ordinance passed banning
discrimination in any private club where business is conducted.
Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican, has kept the Bradley coalition
going and tried to expand it.
</P>
<P>
   Today the old-line conservative Republican business
establishment has largely disappeared from view. Many powerful
banks and financial businesses have died or been bought by
outsiders, just as The Los Angeles Times has been. The oil and
aerospace industries are ailing, and the Mojave Desert to the north
of the city, where the stealth bomber was tested and the space
shuttle still lands, is now being torn up for residential
communities by developers like Eli Broad, the tycoon from the west
side who is a close supporter of Riordan and was instrumental in
bringing the Democrats to town this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The exciting thing about Los Angeles now is the emergence of new
elites, most notably in the Asian and Hispanic communities. Instead
of being dominated by a handful of wealthy barons, it is a city
laced with entrepreneurs striving to reinvent the city. The next
mayor could be either Assemblyman Antonio Villaraigosa or Rep.
Xavier Becerra, two rival leaders of the Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   The new concern in Los Angeles is that it has lost its cohesion
and sense of purpose provided by the old elite. Even the
entertainment industry has fragmented into dozens of power centers
outside the shadow of giants like Wasserman. Some fear the loss of
support of the city's central cultural institutions. Others worry
that without a new identity, places like the San Fernando Valley
and the harbor district to the south may secede. For anyone
fascinated by how the city has changed from 1960 to now, what it
will be like in 2020 is anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly a different city today, but you wouldn't
expect it to be the same,'' says Betsy Bloomingdale, the widow of
one of the pillars of the old Reagan inner circle. ``You've got to
go forward or you die.''

BROKEN CHAIR FORCES OUT MEDIATE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The bizarre injury of the week belongs to
Rocco Mediate, the winner of the Buick Open last Sunday. He had to
withdraw Friday after his chair broke while he was sitting outside
the contestant family dining area.
</P>
<P>
   Mediate, who underwent major back surgery in 1994, injured his
right wrist, right shoulder, neck and lower back in the incident.
He played with discomfort and shot a first-round 77, but he decided
he could not continue.
</P>
<P>
   Gaylord Sports, Mediate's management firm, was livid that a
broken chair had led to Mediate's injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``As his management firm, we are beyond disappointment and
particularly upset that Rocco would suffer such consequences due to
something that could have and should have been avoided,'' said the
statement by Gaylord Sports. ``He is missing more than just a
chance at a major championship title. He was in position to
possibly make the President's Cup team by points or as a captain's
selection with a good week of play.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other players withdrew, including Tom Lehman (sore
knee), Jim Carter (undisclosed) and Ben Crenshaw (undisclosed). &QL;

 Gore speech gets mostly positive results in reaction test  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   LOS ANGELES _ In a cavernous
television studio, parked in rows of folding chairs and clutching
pager-size gadgets each topped with a single dial, three dozen
voters embody the pulse of America's undecideds.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On two televisions in front of them, Vice President Al Gore is
declaring that ``I stand here tonight as my own man,'' and most of
them are lapping it up.
</P>
<P>
   They are making $350 each for four evenings of watching the
tube. They have strict orders to turn their dials clockwise when
they like what they hear, back when they are displeased.
</P>
<P>
   Their composite scores _ split into three groups to represent
those leaning Republican, those leaning Democrat and those who are
independents _ chart three lines across a television monitor they
cannot see. A neutral score is 50. One hundred means they love what
they hear. Zero means they hate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have cut the welfare roles in half and moved millions into
good jobs,'' Gore says.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' reaction leaps to the mid-80s, the independents
to 70, and even the Republicans inch up to 65.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just wrong for seniors to have to choose between food and
medicine while the big drug companies run up record profits,'' the
vice president tells his convention, the nation and this collection
of Southern Californians.
</P>
<P>
   The lines go up again _ the Democrats to 90, the independents
past 70, and the Republicans into the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore declares support for affirmative action and promises
an end to racial profiling, the lines go their separate ways.
Democrats top 90. After his story about a family advised to give up
a son for adoption because an HMO would not pay for the nursing he
needed, one woman broke down in tears. Half the group later
confessed to becoming teary-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Luntz, the boyish, 30-something polling guru running the
focus group for MSNBC-TV, has moderated more than 500 such
gatherings. Rarely have people so adored what they heard, the
longtime Republican pollster says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This'll move people,'' he whispers out of earshot from his
political guinea pigs. It will win over a sizable lump of voters
the way George W. Bush's acceptance speech did at the Republican
convention two weeks earlier, Luntz says. Bush hit nearly the same
highs, according to a similar Luntz dial-a-pulse group assembled in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But the high scores measure the responses of just 36 persons in
a country where more than 100 million vote. And polling
professionals note that results of a national telephone poll reach
a reasonable margin of error only when about 1,000 randomly chosen
folks have been surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz found these Southern Californians by combing through voter
registration rolls and by telephoning hundreds of people, searching
for those who had yet to make up their minds. From there his staff
attracted a fraction willing to share their feelings for some cash
and for the chance to appear on MSNBC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that this group and the one in Philadelphia
could have regional biases.
</P>
<P>
   He likes to say that a traditional telephone poll is a like a
table of contents and that ``dial groups'' like this fill out the
chapters. In general, though, pollsters warn that such focus groups
are far from science.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing it gives you is real-time response to what
people think as they're watching the speech,'' said Charles
Franklin, a specialist in public opinion, at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison. ``You can see what these 36 people responded to.
That's fine. But by definition, those people can't be
representative of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Neil Newhouse took Luntz to his first focus
group years ago, before Luntz helped the GOP craft its ``Contract
with America'' and worked for Reform Party founder Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   The groups do far better at testing a winning phrase than
figuring out what direction an election is heading, Newhouse said.
``It's not science, but it's not at all worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's camp uses the technique. Gore meets almost every morning
with pollster Harrison Hickman to learn what focus groups had to
say the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the currency of the dial group that rated Gore, Luntz
said the Democrat could not have expected better.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the speech, the group members' average prediction of
how much they will like it scores 62 on Luntz's dials. Afterward
they rate it 80. ``This is incredible,'' Luntz says when told of
their review.
</P>
<P>
   Later he declares to his cable audience that Gore has belted a
``home run. No doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Between speeches throughout the week, Luntz administers a sort
of oral inkblot test to the ostensibly undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I need you to tell me one word or short phrase you think
of to describe George W. Bush,'' Luntz commands and then begins
pointing to one voter after the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Conniving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich and powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very civil...''
</P>
<P>
   After polling the group on that question, Luntz says: ``Now
describe Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Trustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Negative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A politician above all else...''
</P>
<P>
   When Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke Monday night, the scores
regularly scaled toward 80 and even 90 when she called for
increased adoption rates, a higher minimum wage and improving
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not beating up on Republicans,'' Luntz observed. ``The
voters want these guys to shut up about the other guy and tell us
what you'll do....This is a very smart speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, both vice presidential candidates scored lower in
their speeches, especially when criticizing their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton followed, the scores were especially high
when he talked about the spunk in America's new economy and a need
for sturdier gun control and when he cracked that Harry Truman was
right when he said, ``If you want to live like a Republican, you
should vote for the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Clinton praised his wife, the scores tumbled. The
voters in this laboratory said it only made them think of his
affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the Republican dialers expressed gratitude toward
Clinton, and to a lesser extent toward Gore, for the country's
booming economy. And although many held doubts before his speech
about Gore's ability to lead, all but a handful said they saw him
as a dynamic man afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost brought me to tears,'' said Mike Evans, a
32-year-old carpenter. ``He convinced me he's going to work hard to
help regular people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the man,'' said Diana Cuevas, a 40-year-old who
voted for Clinton in 1996 but who was unsure about Gore until
Thursday night. ``I'd like to see him be president for two terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, some Republicans were won over. Gore spoke about paying
teachers more. That made a skeptical Paula Schoppe, the daughter of
two educators, a believer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see me changing my mind away from him now,'' said the
29-year-old personal trainer. ``I'm going to call my parents and
try to get them to vote for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not unanimous. Pretty words delivered with enthusiasm
made one 62-year-old Republican think Gore was merely well-coached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Santa Claus tonight,'' he said. ``He promised the world
but didn't say how he'd pay for it.'' The focus group was made up
mostly of lemmings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His skepticism was shared by Democrat Melinda Moore, a
34-year-old secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said everything Clinton did eight years ago,'' she said.
``He told everybody want they wanted to hear, but he won't follow
through.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, more than two-thirds were in Gore's camp.
Seven who started the week leaning toward Bush said they were solid
Gore backers now.
</P>
<P>
   Will that show up on the national scene?
</P>
<P>
   Don't bank on it. For starters, few Americans watch a convention
with the motivation of this group. They read newspapers, watch
television and talk with friends about the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If minds were changed, they can be changed again. More than two
months of political commercials, debates and campaign news
developments are yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   A focus group can focus on only so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just more art in the interpretation than something you
can take to the bank,'' Newhouse said. ``But it can tell you what
works.''

EVA GATLING, 87, ART CURATOR, LED THE HECKSCHER MUSEUM  
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Va., Ala., N.C., Mich., Iowa)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eva Gatling, an art historian and curator who for many years was
the director of the Heckscher Museum in Huntington, N.Y., died on
Tuesday in Virginia Beach, Va., where she had lived in recent
years. She was 87.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the museums in America are small,'' Gatling
once wrote. ``They have a potential for greatness that often
escapes public attention.'' As head of the Heckscher from 1962 to
1978, she turned it into a valuable suburban museum.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald G. Pisano, an art curator, said, ``She had an unerring
eye for art, and was responsible for enriching the Heckscher
collection with significant acquisitions, and elevating its
reputation to that of one of the finest regional museums in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   August Heckscher founded the museum in 1920. In the 1950s it
showed works from its permanent collection on a limited schedule.
Under Gatling's leadership, the museum expanded the collection and
held four or five major exhibitions each year. She rediscovered the
work of the painter Helen Torr and was instrumental in acquiring
many paintings by Arthur Dove, Torr's husband. George Grosz's
``Eclipse of the Sun'' became the centerpiece of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Ingersoll Gatling was born in Mobile, Ala., and graduated
from the University of Alabama and Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the Heckscher, she was director of exhibitions at
Duke University, curator at the Museum of the Cranbrook Academy of
Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and assistant director of the Des
Moines Art Center in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   When Gatling retired, the Heckscher honored her with an
exhibition, ``The Art of the Director: Eva Gatling's 15 Years at
the Heckscher Museum.'' In 1996, another exhibition, ``A Founding
Director's Legacy,'' was a tribute to her.
</P>
<P>
   There are no immediate survivors.

 Mixing religion and investing  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN MARGOLIES  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ On any given
weekend 5,000 people _ out of a membership of 8,000 adults and
children _ stream into the United Methodist Church of the
Resurrection in Leawood, Kan.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Founded a decade ago in a Kansas City funeral home, the church
is one of the fastest-growing in United Methodist history, its
membership exploding by 50 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two years ago it dedicated a 1,700-seat sanctuary at
its 137th Street and Roe Avenue location. Now the church plans to
break ground in 2002 for a sanctuary seating from 5,000 to 7,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the Rev. Adam Hamilton, its 36-year-old senior pastor,
United Methodist has never done things by the book, although it
manifestly takes its inspiration from the Book.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a pastor who's extremely gifted and has an immense
desire of what this megachurch can and should become,'' said member
Ben Craig, chairman of Metcalf Bank and a longtime Johnson County,
Kan., booster. ``He is the driving force _ no ifs, ands or buts.
He's absolutely fearless.''
</P>
<P>
   So fearless, in fact, that when the church decided to buy 47
acres of bean fields immediately north of 44 acres it bought in
1997, it came up with a rather unorthodox way to finance the
purchase: selling investment units in a company it formed to
develop the property.
</P>
<P>
   The company, COR Development LLC, recently filed a registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission proposing to
raise $16 million through the sale of 1.6 million units _ akin to
shares of stock _ for $10 apiece. Church members are expected to be
the main purchasers of the units, which will be sold in minimum
lots of 100.
</P>
<P>
   Church members ``approved the concept even though it's kind of
way out there,'' Hamilton said, quickly adding: ``I personally have
no interest in being a commercial real estate mogul. It's just a
means to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   That end is severalfold: to accommodate the church's need for
additional space, to give it much-needed parking, to control
development around the church and to generate a profit for the
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Because the church would get less than a third of the land and
the rest would be developed commercially, COR Development and the
investors would stand to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The Leawood church is not the first United Methodist church to
embark on a commercial venture. Decades ago the First United
Methodist Church of Chicago erected a 21-story high-rise in that
city's downtown. The church occupies the first four floors and
leases most of the rest to lawyers and other commercial tenants.
</P>
<P>
   SEC officials, however, said they could not recall any
church-affiliated organization filing a registration statement with
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offhand we can't come up with any that has filed,'' said SEC
press officer Carol Patterson, who has been with the agency 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC filing was triggered by the Leawood church's decision to
make the investment units available to ``nonaccredited'' investors,
whose annual incomes or net worths fall beneath a certain
threshold. The minimum investment in COR Development is $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started out, we were asking people to give a lot more
than $1,000,'' said church member Greg Walton, owner of Walton
Construction Co. and one of the prime movers behind the project.
``But people who were less well off said, `Hey, don't leave us
out,' and we decided to open it up.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, close to 750 congregants have made financial commitments
ranging from $1,000 to $600,000. ``People believe that much in Adam
and his vision,'' Walton said.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial venture will not jeopardize the church's
tax-exempt status, because COR Development and the church are
separate entities. Though church members will make up most or all
of COR's investors, and church members will volunteer their time to
run the business, the church itself will not be an investor in COR.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's no legal relationship between the two, it's just a
normal LLC (limited liability company) subject to federal taxes,''
said tax lawyer Stanley Weiner of Shook, Hardy &AMP; Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   The church decided to go the investment route because
congregation members had already pledged money for the 1,700-seat
sanctuary and the 44-acre parcel just a few years ago. Asking them
to pledge an additional $12 million _ the approximate cost of the
proposed purchase at $250,000 per acre _ would have been too much,
Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   The church does not need all 47 acres that will be acquired, but
the property's owner _ L&AMP;F Land Co., a partnership managed by
developer Harlan Laner _ had plans to put up a big-box retailer
just north of the church. That would have created parking problems
on Sundays, when United Methodist holds no fewer than five
services. (Hamilton preaches at all five, as well as one the night
before.)
</P>
<P>
   So Hamilton and some church members, including Walton and
developers Estel Hipp and Dennis Eskie, began mulling over the idea
of setting up a for-profit venture to buy all the land. The venture
would donate 15 acres to the church _ which investors could deduct
as a charitable contribution _ for the new sanctuary and an exit to
135th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the land, they figured, could be developed
commercially: retail shops facing 135th Street and office space
between the shops and the new sanctuary. The church could share
parking with the office buildings on Sundays, when they were little
used. And COR Development, and its investors, could make money by
leasing the property and, eventually, selling the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In short, a chance for investors to do well by doing good.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the 20 acres it acquired before it moved to its
current location in 1995, and the 44 it acquired in 1997, the 47
acres COR Development proposes to buy will give the church control
of more than 100 acres. That is 100-plus acres of prime space in
the heart of one of the area's fastest growing commercial
corridors. The area sits immediately east of the LionsGate
residential development, which includes a Jack Nicklaus-designed
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound like a lot of land, said Hamilton, but other
megachurches around the country have gobbled up even more. Hamilton
visited more than 20 such churches on a summer sabbatical in 1998
and found that ``once you get 10,000 Sunday worshippers'' _ the
number United Methodist projects it will have in a few years _
``all of them were looking at 80, 100, 120 acres,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not the stuff that excites me. This is a means to
an end. And the end is to have enough space for ministries that can
happen here in the future. The end is the opportunity to reach
people.''

 &HT;    Judge won't give this guy a break today
 &HT;    By John Lynch
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Did someone say McDonald's?
</P>
<P>
   The golden arches are off the menu for a 21-year-old Longview
man Friday after he admitted to scuffling with a police officer.
Judge David Brabham told Quintal Miller that if he goes to a
McDonald's restaurant, he faces prison time.
</P>
<P>
   Brabham ordered Miller to stay out of the restaurants after he
pleaded guilty to assault on a public servant in the 188th District
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all McDonald's,'' Brabham said as he sentenced Miller
to eight years in prison for the third-degree felony assault April
23 on Longview police Sgt. Sean Pendleton. Brabham suspended the
prison time to five years of probation, plus a $100 fine, anger
management counseling and 240 hours of community service. Miller's
McDonald's ban is for the duration of his probation.
</P>
<P>
   Miller also must pay at least $298 in restitution, which
includes the officer's medical bills, the judge ordered. Miller
knocked Pendleton down and scuffled with him during a disturbance
at the McDonald's Family Restaurant at in Longview.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant, who suffered minor injuries in the scuffle, agreed
that the sentence is appropriate punishment for the man, said Gregg
County Assistant District Attorney Joe Black, who prosecuted the
case. Miller could have been sentenced to between two and 10 years
in prison for the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was one of several people on the restaurant grounds to
use a pay phone who got into an argument with restaurant security
guards, Black said. Pendleton was called to quell the disturbance,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs appeared to be at the root of Miller's problems, the man
revealed during questioning by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you feel like you have a drug problem, Mr. Miller?''
Brabham asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' Miller replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``You realize, if you don't beat your drug problem, you won't
complete probation,'' the judge said later.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he had skipped an earlier treatment program because
he couldn't get a ride, but promised to comply with the judge's
order for continued drug testing during his probation even if he
had to walk.

FOUR KILLED IN MEXICAN POLITICAL PROTESTS   (SUBS to update number
of dead in 1st, 3rd grafs) 
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIMALHUACAN, Mexico _ At least four people were killed and
dozens wounded Friday as political protests swept across Mexico
state, shattering the euphoria from last month's elections and
dashing hopes for a peaceful political transition.
</P>
<P>
   The protests erupted on Thursday in cities like Ecatepec and
towns like Huixquilucan as local party leaders in Mexico's most
populous state clashed during ceremonies to swear in new mayors and
town councils. But the worst demonstrations occurred Friday in this
town 20 miles east of Mexico City between rival factions of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   As supporters of the PRI mayor-elect, Jesus Tolentino Roman,
gathered in the main plaza here for the ceremony, shots rang out.
The state attorney general reported that at least four people had
been killed and 40 others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The violence, according to reports by witnesses, was started by
armed followers of a local political boss, Guadalupe Buendia, who
has coerced politicians in Chimalhuacan for years in support of the
PRI. But last year when her choice for mayor lost in the PRI
primary, Buendia turned against her party, leading protests that
turned into riots outside the town hall.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general said a warrant had been issued for
the arrest of Buendia.

 Flu vaccine may be in short supply this fall, government warns  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FINN BULLERS and ROBERT A. CRONKLETON  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Health
departments throughout the country are being warned that flu
vaccine may be in short supply this fall _ a warning that comes as
some officials worry that a major outbreak is due.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta say a shortage of vaccine is possible because it has proved
unusually difficult to produce and because production by two of the
four suppliers was delayed after the Food and Drug Administration
ordered plant renovations to meet federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Health departments are expected to know by September whether
there will be a shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get all of our information from the CDC, and what they are
telling us is that we should expect delays and a possible shortage
of flu vaccines,'' said Sue Denny, public information and education
coordinator for the Missouri Department of Health's immunization
program.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Hanley, director of health education for Johnson
County, Kan., said: ``We don't want to panic people. But we want to
give John Q. Public a heads-up that this may be a problem this flu
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal centers are uncertain how much of the vaccine will
be produced this year. Last year as many as 85 million doses were
produced for distribution in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers are having a difficult time producing one of three
strains of the flu virus needed to create this year's vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Because viruses are constantly changing, the strains used in the
vaccine must be updated each year. The World Health Organization
recommends which strains to include, based on the most prevalent
varieties from last year's flu season in the Southern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   From January through March of each year, U.S. public health
officials select the virus strains for the vaccine for the United
States for the upcoming fall.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's vaccine, two new strains, the
A-Panama/2007/99-like (H3N2) and the A-New Caledonia/20/99-like
(H1N1), were recommended for inclusion. The third strain,
B-Yamanashi/166/98-like virus, is unchanged from last year's
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the companies growing the Panama strain are
having difficulties. They have discovered that it is harder to grow
than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Food and Drug Administration has cited two of the four
companies _ Parkedale Pharmaceuticals of Rochester, Mich., and
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories of Marietta, Pa. _ for problems.
According to the federal centers' Web site, both manufacturers
indicated they would correct the problems.
</P>
<P>
   The other two manufacturers are Aventis Pasteur of Swiftwater,
Pa., and Medeva Pharma Ltd., in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the vaccine could increase this year because the
centers had lowered the recommended age for the flu vaccination to
50 from 65.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are backing away from that recommendation now because of
the potential shortage,'' said Denny of the Missouri Health
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Denny said, the federal centers recommend that people in
high-risk groups and those older than 65 should get the vaccine.
Also, health care workers and people who take care of high-risk
groups should be immunized.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, most people should not get their vaccines until late
October or early November to make sure that they are still immune
to the viruses in March.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials are being urged to proceed as normal with
immunizations for the elderly and others who are at risk, including
people with chronic illnesses such as asthma, diabetes and
respiratory conditions.
</P>
<P>
   According to American Health Line, researchers at six hospitals
are testing the effectiveness and safety of using half-doses of the
vaccine as a way to stretch supplies. Results of the study are not
expected until October.
</P>
<P>
   How big the problem is and how severe the winter flu bug will be
are still wild-card factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems the flu season starts earlier and earlier each
year,'' said Hanley of Johnson County. Last year the first
confirmed case of flu in the county came in early December.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, major flu epidemics hit about every 30 years, said
Bill Schmidt, administrator of the Jackson County Health
Department. The last one came in 1970, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if you believe in history, we are probably due to have
another flu epidemic pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what health officials thought in 1999, and they made an
all-out effort to pump up education campaigns to increase the
number of people receiving flu shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we thought it was our time. But since the flu didn't
hit big, it increases the likelihood that something will happen
this year,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, health departments are being urged to develop
contingency plans that put at-risk populations at the top of
priority lists for vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is: People should stay tuned and be alert and
stay away from people with respiratory symptoms,'' said Hanley.
``Wash your hands, cover your mouth, and a lot of these problems
can be avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt is anxious to get more information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to make people paranoid,'' he said. ``Life has
to go on. But we do have to give people a warning.''

NEW JERSEY OFFICER KILLS SUSPECTS IN EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   By GEORGE JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A New Jersey police officer shot and killed a man before dawn
Friday after the man reportedly fired a gun at him in a wooded area
of Hunterdon County, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred while dozens of police officers were
searching the woods for the suspect, one of five men who had fled
from a Clinton police officer who had stopped their car for a motor
vehicle violation. Two men in the car reportedly fired shots at the
officer, the police said, and the officer returned fire, and all
then got out of the car and fled the scene on foot.
</P>
<P>
   The car, a Plymouth Horizon with Pennsylvania license plates,
was stopped about 3:40 a.m. on Route 513, south of Interstate 78 in
Franklin Township. The police would not specify the violation that
prompted the officer to stop the car.
</P>
<P>
   None of the police officers were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Police would not release the names of anyone involved. They said
they had not yet positively identified the men, but believed that
they were from the Allentown, Pa., area.
</P>
<P>
   After the men fled from the car, the police, using dogs and a
helicopter, searched an area at the juncture of Clinton, Franklin
and Union townships.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter found three of the men in the woods surrounding the
Hunterdon Developmental Center, a 600-patient facility for the
mentally retarded. Officers found the fourth man, the car's driver,
on a road behind a nearby Wal-Mart store.
</P>
<P>
   But the fifth man eluded capture until shortly before 6:30 a.m.
As dawn was breaking, the helicopter reported spotting the suspect
in the woods in Union Township, about an eighth of a mile from the
abandoned car.
</P>
<P>
   There the suspect was confronted by an officer from the New
Jersey Department of Human Services assigned to the Hagedorn
Gero-Psychiatric Hospital in nearby Glen Gardner. The officer
called for the suspect to surrender, the police said, but he
instead fired several shots at the officer.
</P>
<P>
   The officer returned fire, the police said, striking the man. He
was pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said it was not clear Friday night whether the
dead man was one of those suspected of firing on the Clinton police
officer who had stopped the car.
</P>
<P>
   Police recovered one gun, said John Hagerty, a spokesman for the
state police, but he said he could not reveal the make of the
weapon or the number of shots exchanged, because the investigation
was continuing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Police said that when the men's car was stopped, as it entered
Franklin Township, the Clinton officer asked the driver for his
license and registration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young man was unable to produce any identification, so the
police officer asked him to get out of the car and then moved
forward with a pat-down search for safety,'' Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was at this point where the passenger jumped out and
started to fire,'' Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   As the man ran away, Hagerty said, the driver, who had been
facing the car, backed up suddenly and knocked the officer to the
ground. He also shot at the officer before fleeing, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police officer returns fire toward the passenger and the
driver,'' Hagerty said. ``At the same time, the other three people
get out and they start running.''

NYC GETS 14 PROPOSALS TO PRIVATIZE ITS FAILING SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mich., Pa., Mass.)   By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fourteen companies and nonprofit organizations from
around the country have submitted proposals to manage some of the
worst-performing New York City schools under a privatization plan
outlined last month by Schools Chancellor Harold Levy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the submissions received by Friday's deadline was a
sweeping proposal by Edison Schools, the Manhattan company that is
the country's largest commercial manager of public schools, to take
over 45 low-performing elementary and middle schools by the fall of
2003. Under the plan, Edison would take over 12 elementary schools
in September 2001 and the remainder only if students at the initial
12 schools outperformed their peers at similar schools on
standardized tests by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Edison's proposal was submitted, the program
outlined by Levy and approved by the Board of Education had the
potential to be one of the country's largest educational
privatization efforts. In his plan, Levy appeared to be addressing
two constituencies: minority families and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the schools eligible for privatization under Levy's plan
are in neighborhoods with large black and Hispanic populations;
nationwide, minorities have supported charter schools and other
alternatives to public schools. Giuliani set aside $60.8 million of
the Board of Education's $11 billion budget for the current fiscal
year to pay for private management of some of the worst-performing
city schools.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Edison, seven other organizations in New York
state submitted proposals, including Victory Schools, a Manhattan
company that this fall will run three charter schools in New York
City and on Long Island, and Boys Harbor Inc., a nonprofit Harlem
group that last year tried and failed to secure a charter school
license from state authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Six groups from outside the state made bids as well, including
National Heritage Academies, a Grand Rapids, Mich., company that
will begin operating a charter school in Rochester this fall.
National Heritage has attracted criticism for its plan to make
students aware of _ but not teach, the company insists _
creationism and other theories that company officials say are
alternatives to the theory of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other companies that submitted proposals were Nobel
Learning Communities of Media, Pa., and Advantage Schools of
Boston, which recently gave up management of the troubled New
Covenant Charter School in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Crowe, a spokeswoman for the New York City Board of
Education, said board officials would begin reviewing the
submissions this weekend to see if they fulfilled the board's
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Under Levy's plan, some of the roughly 50 struggling schools
that are both on the state's list of ``schools under registration
review'' and are part of the special Chancellor's District would be
converted into charter schools beginning in the fall of 2001.
Though the schools would still receive money from the city and
state, their conversion to charter status would free them of many
state and city regulations and allow their managers to renegotiate
some union contracts. Last month, board officials said they
expected five to seven schools to be privatized in the program's
first year, although one official said as many as 20 could be
converted.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the proposals received Friday were quite modest. Victory
Schools, for example, proposed converting and managing one or two
schools, and Advantage Schools requested management of two schools.
By contrast, beginning this fall, Edison will manage more than 100
schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Under its proposal, Edison would invest $80 million in New
York's program, recruit 1,000 highly qualified teachers, distribute
about 25,000 IBM computers to teachers and students, and start a
$50 million philanthropic campaign to support its schools, company
officials said Friday. They also suggested a collaboration with the
Board of Education to bring one of Edison's planned Teacher
Colleges to New York City. In addition, Edison said it wanted to
work with the city teachers' union, the United Federation of
Teachers, in developing the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Benno Schmidt, the chairman of Edison, said he believes that in
order to determine whether this type of experiment will work, many
schools must be privatized.

CUBAN HIGH JUMPER RETURNS FROM DRUG BAN TO WIN MEET 
</HEADLINE>
  By   CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTE CARLO, Monaco _ He has been notably absent from major
track and field competitions for more than a year, and he was
notably absent from Friday night's pre-meet parade of stars during
which the likes of Maurice Greene and Gail Devers took a lap on the
track at the Louis II Stadium in classic convertible cars.
</P>
<P>
   But Javier Sotomayor, a former and perhaps future Olympic
champion, finally did make an appearance, pulling on his spikes and
his wraparound sunglasses in the humid evening air of the Cote
d'Azur, and smiling through the mixture of boos, whistles and
cheers that greeted the announcement of his name in tonight's
lineup of high jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, Sotomayor heard more mixed reviews from the
crowd as he stood on the podium after winning his event at the
Golden League meet in Monaco by clearing 2.30 meters (7 feet 6
inches).
</P>
<P>
   Sotomayor and Cuban track officials may have been able to
persuade the International Amateur Athletic Federation to reduce
his suspension for testing positive for cocaine from two years to
one year. But from the sound of it, some track fans still need to
be convinced that Sotomayor, who won the gold medal in the 1992
Olympics, should be allowed back among the pack of Olympic hopefuls
who are clearing bars at big-money, one-night meets in hopes of
reaching their peaks next month in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Javier has a really good chance of winning another
gold,'' said Alberto Juantorena, the president of the Cuban track
and field federation, who successfully pleaded Sotomayor's case
here in front of the IAAF council on Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not fantastic today,'' Sotomayor told French television
reporters on Friday. ``I was very tired because I have been
practicing a lot, and I also have a new baby since July, which is
another reason why I'm a little tired. But I should be able to
clear 2.36 or 2.37 at the Olympics. I just hope nobody else does
2.40.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotomayor, who set the world record of 2.45 meters (8 feet) in
1993, tested positive for cocaine during last year's Pan American
Games and was stripped of the gold medal he had already won.
Sotomayor denied ever using cocaine and was cleared by the Cuban
federation, which maintained that the second of his two urine
samples might have been tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   After months of legal wrangling and hearings, an IAAF
arbitration panel upheld the two-year ban on June 27, which meant
that Sotomayor was ineligible to compete until July 30, 2001. But
the Cuban federation pursued his case under a clause in the IAAF
rulebook that allows drug bans to be modified under exceptional
circumstances. The IAAF, citing the hundreds of drug tests the
32-year-old had passed during his career, cut Sotomayor's penalty
in half on Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Sotomayor returned to competition on Tuesday in a minor meet in
Montauban, France, and won with a leap of 2.28 meters, the minimum
established by the Cuban federation for Olympic selection. But
Friday night was his return to his sport's first division, and his
victims included Charles Austin, the reigning Olympic champion, and
Nathan Leeper, both of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Other Americans fared better. Greene won the men's 100 meters
over a relatively weak field in the unspectacular time of 10.01
seconds. Inger Miller won the women's 100 in 10.91, her best time
of the season, and later helped the women's 400 relay team warm up
for Sydney by beating teams from the Bahamas and France in a
season-best time of 42.13 seconds. Devers, also part of the relay
tonight, remained undefeated in the 100 hurdles this season,
winning in 12.54 seconds after what she called ``a technically poor
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive run of the night came from Ali Saidi-Sief,
the emerging Algerian middle-distance star who set a national
record and meet record by wining the men's 3,000 in 7 minutes 25.02
seconds. Cathy Freeman, the Australian who will be a focus of
attention in Sydney, also ran the season's fastest women's 400,
winning in 49.48 seconds, and Irina Privalova, a former European
champion in the 200 who has switched to the 400 hurdles, surprised
the American champion Sandra Glover-Cummings to win in 54.06
seconds.

YANKEES LOSE TO ANGELS, 9-8 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Darin Erstad waded through teammates wanting to
congratulate him in the Anaheim dugout after his game-saving catch
in the bottom of the 10th inning Friday night at Yankee Stadium,
and his expression never changed before he reached the bat rack. He
had business to tend to in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad followed his spectacular catch with a home run in the
11th against the Yankees' Mike Stanton, capping a wild comeback
victory by the Angels in which the Yankees blew a five-run lead in
the ninth and lost, 9-8.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Yankees blew a five-run lead in the ninth and
lost was on May 16, 1968, in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led Anaheim, 8-3, into the ninth, with Roger Clemens
working on a complete game and his 258th career victory. But
Clemens allowed back-to-back singles and was relieved by Jeff
Nelson, walking off to a standing ovation, tipping his cap and
raising a gloved hand.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, he had thrown 122 pitches and been charged with
only three runs. But after Nelson retired Adam Kennedy on a fly
out, Nelson walked Kevin Stocker and manager Joe Torre replaced
Nelson with Mariano Rivera, who had converted 10 of his last 11
save chances.
</P>
<P>
   The air of invincibility has not surrounded Rivera this year,
however. One run scored on a fielder's choice, and then Orlando
Palmeiro pulled a double inside first base and down the line. There
were two outs, two on, and Vaughn was coming to the plate as the
tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn fouled Rivera's first pitch off the right toes of the
catcher Jorge Posada, who limped away from the plate and slumped to
the ground, where he remained for a couple of minutes, waiting out
the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Posada stood up, returned to his position, called for a fastball
_ and Vaughn launched a high drive that landed in the right field
stands, sucking all emotion other than disappointment out of Yankee
Stadium. Tie game, on Rivera's fifth blown save of the year; he
converted 45 of 49 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Glenallen Hill, who hit two homers earlier in the game, led off
the Yankees' 10th by topping a slow roller to the left side against
Shigetoshi Hasegawa, and there was no play. Luis Polonia ran for
Hill, and advanced to second on Luis Sojo's bunt. Jose Canseco
batted for Jose Vizcaino and hit a deep fly ball; Polonia tagged up
and moved to third.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter was walked intentionally, and Posada blistered a
drive to left-center that appeared destined for the gap and
game-ending hit. But Erstad charged back and to his left, dived,
stretched his body and back-handed the liner, saving the game.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton relieved Rivera for the 11th, and Erstad drove a high
homer into the first rows of the right field stands, his 21st homer
and 189th hit of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee collapse took the hero's mantle from Hill, who has
been with the Yankees for less than a month, and is already known
to his teammates as something of an eccentric personality. He plays
music loudly _ ``All kinds,'' said Jeter _ and speaks softly. He
wears eye black in night games, and in the day. He dresses
elegantly, but swings his bat viciously, quickly, powerfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Muhammad Ali's left jab,'' said Torre.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, there are ways to get him out. He came into this
season with a .271 batting average, striking out an average of once
every four and a half at-bats. But so far, he is dominating
American League pitching.
</P>
<P>
   He would probably not have played Friday night, except for the
fact that he smashed a soaring homer on Thursday against the Angels
and Torre wanted to keep him in the lineup, to stay with a hot
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Hill led off the fourth for the Yankees, after Tim Salmon
homered in the top half of the inning for the Angels and reduced
Clemens lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of Hill in the count no balls and one strike, Anaheim's
Ramon Ortiz floated a change-up, a pitch he aimed outside, at the
target set by the catcher Bengie Molina. Ortiz was off target,
however and Molina reached back to retrieve the ball after it
crossed the plate; except it never got to Molina.
</P>
<P>
   Hill jabbed, one side of the ball caved in, and Hill's eighth
homer with the Yankees disappeared over the left field wall, on a
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored once more in the inning. Luis Sojo was on
second and Jose Vizcaino on first and Jeter singled to right. Sojo
turned at third and was held up by Willie Randolph, the Yankees'
third base coach. But Vizcaino, far past second, slipped and fell
when he tried stopping, and soon he was in a rundown.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim third baseman Troy Glaus took a throw and ran
Vizcaino back toward second, where Jeter already was stationed _
and Sojo bolted for home. Inexplicably, the Angel never looked
homeward, and Sojo scored uncontested, giving the Yankees a 5-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the top step of the Anaheim bench, manager Mike Scioscia, who
had seen his team make two brutal base-running mistakes Thursday,
complained with exasperation to Alfredo Griffin, one of his
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels picked at Clemens in the fifth, scoring after Adam
Kennedy and Kevin Stocker opened with singles. But Hill flexed
another muscle in the bottom of the fifth. With two out, Tino
Martinez smacked a single to left. Hill moved slowly to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz threw a fastball. Hill snapped his bat at the ball, that
massive 35-ounce bat. There was a line drive to right and the ball
was quickly gone.
</P>
<P>
   The fans stood and screamed, beckoning for Hill to come out to
take a bow. After a pitch to Sojo, Hill moved onto the top step of
the Yankee dugout and waved his helmet with his right hand.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ In 1983, fresh from the University of
Florida with a finance degree, Dean McQuiddy went to work for
Barnett Banks, then the state's largest bank, as an analyst
recommending stocks to portfolio managers. Soon, he helped create
Barnett's Emerald Small Cap fund, and in 1994 took over management
of the portfolio, consistently outperforming the benchmark Russell
2000 growth index through the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But then Barnett, an old-line Florida bank, was swallowed in a
wave of mergers. First, NationsBank of North Carolina took over
Barnett, and Bank of America later merged with NationsBank.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, McQuiddy and four key members of his Barnett team
turned down offers of NationsBank jobs in Charlotte, N.C., deciding
that it was time to take a risk by opening their own firm, Sawgrass
Asset Management, in Jacksonville, the former home of Barnett. This
summer, Sawgrass hit $1 billion under management, including the
$162 million that McQuiddy manages in AmSouth Small Cap, a growth
fund offered by AmSouth Bancorp in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   In his move from employee to investment entrepreneur, McQuiddy
jettisoned most of his dark bankers' suits in favor of khakis and
short-sleeved golf shirts. More significantly, he and his
colleagues installed networked personal computers with a variety of
professional investment programs to obtain real-time quotations and
analysis. Back at Barnett Bank, when they had to wait their turn
for the mainframe computer, it sometimes took days to get reports.
The ability to upgrade technology without the struggle for
budgetary approval has been liberating. ``We literally were able to
leapfrog a couple of generations in technology,'' McQuiddy said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, McQuiddy, 39, has five computer monitors glowing in his
office, and reports cover his desk and spill over onto chairs and
the floor. Technology is crucial to his quantitatively driven
style. ``We spend a lot of time and effort and brain cells,
tinkering with and improving our modeling system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He started the fund in March 1998. After a slow start, it ranked
39th out of the 266 small-cap growth funds tracked by Lipper Inc.
for the six months ended July 31 of this year, with a return of
15.27 percent, compared with an average of 4.36 percent for the
group.
</P>
<P>
   From its inception until July 31, the fund had an annualized
total return of 10.10 percent, compared with 27.82 percent for the
group. McQuiddy's explanation for the turnabout is his criterion
that a company must be profitable before he will invest in it. Last
year, when stocks of money-losing technology companies were
soaring, momentum players could chalk up gains with timely trades.
But since the luster of the dot-coms has worn off, his conservative
approach has proved sounder.
</P>
<P>
   McQuiddy, working with Patrick Riley and Martin LaPrade, who
were also portfolio managers at Barnett, starts with the 1,400
growth-sector companies in the Russell 2000 and quickly weeds out
any foreign or unprofitable concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Then they apply a series of models to measure companies on three
key factors: earnings momentum, positive changes in analysts'
estimates of future earnings and a value analysis. An exacting
attention to upticks in analysts' estimates is a hallmark of
McQuiddy's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   McQuiddy likes to buy stocks with price-to-earnings ratios of 30
to 40, but he has found high-earning bargains at lower multiples.
Companies are ranked by ratios including price to earnings, price
to book, price to sales and price to cash flow.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The number-crunching typically turns up 150 to 200 stocks, of
which 50 or 60 are selected. ``This is a consistent discipline that
has worked for us over the years _ we don't stray from that,''
McQuiddy said from his office in the booming southern end of
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   When comes the personal touch. McQuiddy, Riley and LaPrade and
other associates read analysts' reports about a company, talk with
analysts, interview company principals, look at the company's
rivals and study profit margins. They focus on companies with high
market share and an ability to defend it with patents, high budgets
for research and development or unique technology _ all to find
companies that are likely to post better-than-expected earnings
that will send their stocks higher.
</P>
<P>
   The fund tends to hold a rising stock six to nine months; after
that, it tends to get out. Turnover averages 150 percent a year.
``That sweet spot is the two or three quarters that the company
does better than the street expects, and the market rewards the
positive surprise,'' McQuiddy said.
</P>
<P>
   Just over half of the fund's holdings are in technology.
McQuiddy likes profitable stocks that feed the backbone of the
Internet, not flashy retail Web stocks. ``I like to use the
analogy, and it's not original with me, that the people who made
money in the gold rush weren't the people who mined for gold,'' he
said. ``It was the people who supplied pickaxes, shovels and
pans.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His behind-the-scenes Internet holdings include Hall, Kinion &AMP;
Associates, a staffing firm in San Francisco that specializes in
engineers, systems analysts and programmers. McQuiddy bought the
stock at $26.70 on May 15, and later added to his holdings, for an
average cost of $30.31. It closed Friday at $39.25. The company's
revenue has been growing 70 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes Silicon Valley Bancshares in Santa Clara, Calif.,
the parent of Silicon Valley Bank, a lender to Internet start-ups.
``They take warrants for their services, and a lot of their clients
have gone public or are in the pipeline to go public,'' McQuiddy
said. Earnings this year will double, to $2.40 a share, he
predicted. He bought the stock in April at an average cost of
$33.90 a share. It closed Friday at $53.4375.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McQuiddy doesn't turn his back on low-tech companies. In April,
he bought shares of the Shaw Group, which fabricates piping
primarily for electric generating plants, at an average of $41.31 a
share. Shaw recently scooped up assets of a bankrupt peer operation
and is expected to benefit from the proposed merger of the Entergy
Corp., a Louisiana utility, with the FPL Group of Florida. ``I
don't think the market has yet focused on this,'' McQuiddy said.
The stock, which closed Friday at $44.75, has been selling for less
than 20 times analysts' expected earnings for next year.
