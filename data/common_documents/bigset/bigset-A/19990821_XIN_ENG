<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China, who has always
backed the peace process in Sierra Leone, Friday called upon the
international community to give full support to the implementation
of the peace accord, signed on July 7 in Togo's capital of Lome,
and help the Sierra Leonean people for the early achievement of
the national reconciliation and the economic reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Chen Xu, representative of the Chinese
Mission to the United Nations, took the floor on the draft
resolution on Sierra Leone. Later, the 15-nation Security Council
unanimously adopted the resolution for a provisional expansion of
the U.N. Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) up to 210
military observers.
</P>
<P>
"China has always supported the elected government in Sierra
Leone, and supported the peace process in the country," Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have, through various channels, provided various kinds of
assistance to the Sierra Leonean Government and to the West
African Military Observer Group (ECOMOG)," he said. "We will
continue to provide to that country various assistance within our
capabilities."
</P>
<P>
"The peace in Sierra Leone is just beginning, and everything
has to start from scratch, it needs urgent assistance," he said.
"We, at the same time, should see very clearly that peace at
present is very fragile in Sierra Leone, and there are many
uncertain factors in that country."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "We call upon the international community on the
basis of the forward-looking principle to support the efforts to
carry out the peace agreement and help the Sierra Leonean people
to realize their national reconciliation and begin their economic
reconstruction at an early date," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Government of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary United
Front signed the peace accord on July 7 in Lome, putting an end to
the eight-year civil war in the West African country.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday decided to authorize "the provisional expansion" of the
U.N. Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNMOSIL).
</P>
<P>
The decision was contained in a resolution unanimously adopted
by the 15 Council members. As of July 29, there were 48 military
observers in Sierra Leone, they are from such countries as China,
Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Russia, the United Kingdom and
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "authorizes the provisional expansion of
UNMOSIL to up to 210 military observers along with the necessary
equipment and administrative and medical support to perform the
tasks" to promote peace in the West African country, the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also welcomed the July 7 signing of the Peace
Agreement between the Government of Sierra Leone and the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Lome, capital of Togo.
</P>
<P>
The resolution commended the Sierra Leonean Government and
the West African peacekeepers for their contribution to
advancing the peace process in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the resolution stressed "the importance of the
safety, security and freedom of movement of United Nations and
associated personnel."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council encouraged the ongoing consultations among
the parties concerned on future peacekeeping arrangements in
Sierra Leone, and called upon the RUF and all other groups in
Sierra Leone to begin immediately to disband and give up their
arms in accordance with the provisions of the peace agreements,
said the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Government of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary United
Front signed the peace agreement on July 7 in Lome, capital of
Togo, putting an end to the eight-year civil war in the West
African country.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of the agreement requires UNOMSIL perform
significantly expanded as well as new tasks, in close coordination
with ECOMOG, whose presence in Sierra Leone remains, in this
critical period, indispensable," said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan in his latest written report the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that, in addition to the major disarmament and
demobilization effort, the implementation of the Lome Peace
Agreement will require the presence of a substantial number of
peacekeepers throughout the country, together with the
deployment of additional United Nations military observers, in
mutually supporting roles," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Before the Council began the vote on the draft resolution,
Chen Xu, representative from the Chinese Mission to the United
Nations, said, "China has always supported the elected
government in Sierra Leone, and supported the peace process in
the country."
</P>
<P>
"We have, through various channels, provided various kinds of
assistance to the Sierra Leonean Government and to the West
African Military Observer Group," Chen said. "We will continue to
provide to that country various assistance within our
capabilities."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "we call upon the international community on the
basis of forward-looking principle to support the efforts to
carry out the peace agreement and help the Sierra Leonean people
to realize their national reconciliation and begin their
economic reconstruction at an early date," he added.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Journalists Sympathize with Turkey's Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Union of Cyprus Journalists
Friday expressed "grief and deep sympathy" to victims in Tuesday's
fatal quake in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In a message sent to the Journalists Syndicate and the
Progressive Association of Journalists in Turkey, the Union
conveyed its "undivided solidarity and support" to rescue efforts
to help the victims of the catastrophic earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The Union also donated 1,000 U.S. dollars for the relief work.
</P>
<P>
Death toll has reached over 10,000 in the quake, measuring 7.4
degrees on Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
The quake, coming only days after a weaker tremor struck
Cyprus' Limassol town, has prompted many in Cyprus to put aside
enmity for its long-time rival Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Cyprus government took the unprecedented
step of promising medical aid to Turkey. President Glafcos
Clerides sent a message of condolences to his Turkish counterpart
Suleyman Demirel despite the fact that the two countries have no
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
The Astra radio, which is backed by the left AKEL party,
Thursday made an appeal for donation for Turkish people.

<P>
KAMPALA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni is to address Parliament about the recent fighting
between Ugandan and Rwandan troops in the Democratic Republic of
Congo.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Apolo Nsibambi had communicated the House
request to the president, the New Vision newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the State House has not yet responded to the request,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs
Eriya Kategaya Wednesday declined to answer defense related
questions, saying that the president would do so at an appropriate
time.
</P>
<P>
MPs had questioned the rationale of Ugandan troops' prolonged
stay in the Congo following the recent street to street battles
between Ugandan and Rwandan troops in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here observed that the conflict, which claimed dozens
of lives on either side, was the latest twist of event which
further complicated the peace process of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The fighting began Saturday and lasted to Tuesday. Following
the clashes between the two sides, Ugandan and Rwandan leaders met
in western Uganda and hammered out a cease-fire after two days'
talks.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Plans to Sell Two Old Boeings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has agreed in
principle to sell or lease two rather old Boeing 757-200 series
aircraft at the request of Air Tanzania Corporation (ATC).
</P>
<P>
ATC's Public Relations Manager Innocent Mungi said here Friday
that the Ministry of Transport and Communication is in the process
of preparing a paper on the sale or lease of the two aircraft. The
paper will then be presented before the cabinet for decision.
</P>
<P>
Mungi said that the 23-year-old two Boeings are among the
planes categorized as environmentally unfriendly because of the
noises made by the engines, adding that it is quite expensive to
upgrade the engines to a level in compliance with internal
regulations.
</P>
<P>
He said it is a good opportunity at present for the corporation
to dispose the aircraft because they have been evaluated to be
worth between five and six million U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
"The same aircraft will be rated as zero value in the next two
to three years," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Agriculture
Ministry Friday called on people of the whole country to exert
efforts to tackle the problems of food shortage and drought.
</P>

self-sufficiency through the application of improved agricultural
technology and inputs.

He noted that expanding small-scale irrigation projects in
those places affected by recurrent drought is one of the solutions
to solve food shortage problem.

According to Mengistu, more than two million hectares of hilly
and mountainous areas in Ethiopia has so far not been cultivated
while 14 million hectares of land has been heavily eroded.

Besides, he said, there is also 27 million hectares of other
land that has been denuded.

Ethiopia, with a population of 60 million, is an
agriculture-dominated country, which has long been striving for
food self-sufficiency.

<TEXT>

HARARE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Friday said more needs to be done to improve the status of
women.
</P>
<P>
He said this is the case although his party and government
have striven to put in place an environment that allows women to
fully participate in the political, social and economic affairs of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 1999 ruling Zanu (PF)
Women's League Congress in Harare, Mugabe called on women to take
advantage of the Constitutional Review Commission to make
contributions which would ensure that more rights for women be
enshrined in the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
"We want the status of both men and women to be equal to
improve the conditions of living in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe called on men to desist from interfering with what the
women desired by imposing candidates they wanted to fill certain
positions in the party.
</P>
<P>
He challenged parents and chiefs to re-examine some of the
traditional customs which oppressed women.
</P>
<P>
"There is need to work together with chiefs and parents to
promote the correct status of women," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said there is need to look into such issues where more
girls are dropped out of school than boys, stressing that women
need to be equipped with skills that would enable them to be
economically empowered.

<HEADLINE> Row on Wye Accord Still Exists: Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli negotiators
failed to iron out differences on the timetable of the
implementation of the Wye River accord, said senior Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat Friday.
</P>
<P>
The talks, held overnight for six hours in Jerusalem, were
"highly serious," Erekat told Palestine Radio, adding that the two
sides still disputed on the implementation of the Wye agreement,
release of Palestinian prisoners and the opening of Gaza seaport
and a safe passage.
</P>
<P>
No specific time was set for the resumption of the talks, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Israeli government to make a political decision on
implementing the signed agreements with Palestinians as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
On some new suggestions by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
Erekat said there is no need to further negotiate on or merge
later stages of the already-signed accords, adding that such
proposals were not raised during recent talks between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Israeli daily Ha'aretz reported on Thursday that Barak had
presented three main points to push forward the peace process,
namely:
</P>
<P>
- Start implementation of the Wye accord after some
mutually-accepted modifications from September 1 to early 2000;
</P>
<P>
- The two sides start marathon talks during the first week of
September on a framework or a declaration of principle of the
final status talks till the target date of early 2000;
</P>
<P>
- The two sides refrain from any unilateral moves that could
affect the status of the Palestinian territories.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Prolonged dry periods in
southern Somalia have put one million people to a situation of
dismal harvest, the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Less than 130,000 tons of sorghum and maize are expected to be
harvested this year, against 101,760 tons in 1998, which was
especially low as a result of EL Nino floods and 205,850 tons
gathered in 1997, according to WFP statistics.
</P>
<P>
A recent assessment by international agencies indicated that
this year's cereal harvest in the east African country will only
just exceed that of 1998, which saw the lowest production in five
years, said WFP.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Production of Unconventional Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Friday rejected
U.S. media accusations that its armed forces are producing
unconventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
According to the Islamic Republic News Agency, the Defense
Ministry said in a press release that U.S. newspapers violated
their professional principles in making this claim.
</P>
<P>
U.S. newspapers did so "under the influence of extreme
political leanings, to their own discredit," said the release.
</P>
<P>
Iran had been the number one victim of chemical and biological
weapons, and has consistently led and supported international
campaigns for destruction of all unconventional weapons, it said.
</P>
<P>
Iran lost many lives in unconventional warfare during the
eight-year-long Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. But the U.S. and its
Western allies have been accusing it of pursuing nuclear and
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The press release said Iran is committed to international
conventions and its activities in those areas have been
"frequently inspected by responsible international bodies."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it said Israel has consistently denied
international inspection bodies access to its chemical and
nuclear arsenals, and has recently reached a military agreement
with Washington on the purchase of warplanes.
</P>
<P>
This is "a glaring example of U.S. support for rogue
states in the world," the Defense Ministry blasted.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Shoddy Construction, Lax Administration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, August 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 people have
been killed and over 45,000 injured in Tuesday's massive
earthquake in northwest Turkey. And the numbers are still rising
by the hour.
</P>
<P>
As rescue efforts for those 35,000 still believed trapped under
the rubble and relief work for quake survivors continued well into
the fourth day, the Turks pondered over the question: was it
merely by a stroke of bad luck that so many lives were claimed?
</P>
<P>
Maybe not, or at least it was not the whole story, some people
said.
</P>
<P>
Poor construction of the buildings was to be blamed for the
high death toll, said a seismologist who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
His claim might find evidence in our second visit to the
quake-hit Avcilar in west Istanbul, about 400 kilometers west of
Ankara, Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a residential area in Avcilar, we saw several buildings
reduced to debris while surrounding houses remained virtually
intact.
</P>
<P>
Since Turkey launched speedy economic drive in early 1980s,
the construction sector thrived as people tried to improve their
housing conditions and rural Turks poured into large cities by
the millions looking for jobs.
</P>
<P>
Many contractors skimped on materials or used inferior cement
and concrete bars to cut down on costs. When the powerful
pre-dawn quake struck Tuesday, those jerrily-built houses
collapsed like stacks of playing cards.
</P>
<P>
A 50-some man, who claimed to be an architectural engineer
himself, told us, as rescuers were scrambling several meters away
the piles of rubble in search for about 10 people trapped inside,
that many of the houses pancaked down in the quake were built in
the 1980s or since.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers have lately been running articles critical of
government officials for their lax administration in enforcing
building codes. Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit had promised
a crackdown on unscrupulous builders.
</P>
<P>
Apart from shoddy houses, the government's initial
ineffectiveness in launching research and rescue works also
contributed to the heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
In a country known to major seismologic activities, "it is
incredible that the state apparatus was stunned for nearly 24
hours" after the quake hit the most populous areas and industrial
centers of the country, said the Turkish Daily News in its
editorial Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In many quake-hit areas, rescue apparatus like electric saws
used for cutting tangled steel were hardly available and
relatives or neighbors had to dig into the debris with bare hands
in search for trapped people.
</P>
<P>
After the quake hit early Tuesday morning, electricity and
water supplies in many parts of the country were cut off for about
24 hours. Traffic was also deadlocked as people driving cars were
trying to flee stricken areas, seriously hampering rescue works.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the quake, which was measured at 7.4 degrees
on the Richter scale and lasted for 45 seconds, was only 10
kilometers underground, thus aggravating the intensity of the
quake.
</P>
<P>
And, not unusual with seismologic activities, the catastrophe,
hitting at 3:02 a.m. (0002 GMT) Tuesday, occurred while most of
the people were sleeping, thus crushing tens of thousands of
people in their sound sleep.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six aftershocks with magnitude over four degrees were
recorded so far since Tuesday's fatal quake.

<HEADLINE> Well-known Aid Worker Killed in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A well-known aid worker was
killed Thursday night in Hargeisa Yarey Village, 35 km south of
Jilib district of the Middle Jubba region, Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Qasim Aden Egal, the head of the Medicine Sans Frontier of
Spain in Gedo and Lower Jubba regions of southern Somalia, was
killed by unidentified gunmen who intercepted his vehicle at an
illegal roadblock outside the village.
</P>
<P>
The aid worker, who had been the former Director-General of
Somalia's Health Ministry during the last regime, was driving a
Landcruiser vehicle on his way to Bardera district of Gedo after
his routine business trip from the southern port town of Kismaio
which he left Thursday afternoon, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the killing is not known, but eye-witnesses said
the gunmen aimed at looting the well-sought vehicle. Landcruisers
are very much liked by Somali gunmen because they are of high
value and can be turned into battle wagons.
</P>
<P>
After a little hesitation following the order of the occupants
to get down, the gunmen opened fire. The first bullet hit Egal in
the heart and he died on the spot.
</P>
<P>
The killers reportedly belong to the Marehan clan of General
Omar Hajji Massaleh, Chairman of the Somali National Front which
together with other allied forces captured the town of Kismaio
from General Hirsi Morgan. Masalleh, however, described the
killing as an unfortunate incident and purely banditry act not
related to any kind of clan animosity.
</P>
<P>
Even so, local and international aid workers have felt more
and more insecure in Somalia when there are serious humanitarian
crises in the country.

<HEADLINE> Greek Stance Towards EU Aid to Turkey Remains Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece reiterated Friday that its
position towards the European Union (EU) financial aid to
neighboring Turkey remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting chaired by Prime Minister
Costas Simitis, Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said that
Greece's stance was undoubtedly the same. It was of course too
early to speak about certain things since Greece must wait and see
what the EU's reaction would be to the catastrophic earthquake
which has claimed over 10,000 lives in the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greece's Alternate Foreign Minister Yiannos
Kranidiotis also stressed that Greece would see what initiatives
would be taken by the EU which would discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
He added that the issues which were connected with Turkey's
European vocation were based on the terms set by the EU itself at
the Luxembourg summit and other meetings.
</P>
<P>
For years, Greece has insisted that it will not lift its veto
on the EU's 1-billion financial aid to Turkey unless Ankara takes
effective measures to improve its relations with Athens.

LUANDA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Authorities are making
an investigation into the involvement of the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in the recent conflict in
Caprivi Strip, Namibia, Namibia's Ambassador in Angola said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Local radio quoted the ambassador as saying that "I confirm the
capture of seven UNITA militants in Caprivi Strip, and the
investigation is underway."
</P>
<P>
"Information shows that at least 50 percent of the arms used by
the separatists in the attack were furnished by Savimbi's
terrorist organization," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the counter-attack against the separatist Caprivi
Liberation Army, which once occupied a radio station in a
northeast Namibian city , the government troops captured seven
UNITA militants fighting with the separatists.
</P>
<P>
The capture of seven UNITA militants during the conflict
indicates UNITA's involvement in the Caprivi conflict, which broke

<HEADLINE> S'pore's Trade Expands by 8.4 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total trade rose
for three consecutive months in July, increasing by 8.4 percent
compared with a year earlier, according to statistics released by
the Trade Development Board (TDB) Friday.
</P>
<P>
The growth reflected the continued strength of the global
electronics demand and the further improvement in economic
conditions of the crisis-hit Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports (NODX) expanded by 11.5 percent over
the same month of last year, maintaining a positive trend which
started in April 1999 and marginally better than the 10.3 percent
growth registered in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
Compared to July last year, non-oil re-exports (NORX) fell by
3.5 percent, the third consecutive month of milder decline as
compared to the double-digit contractions in the preceding months.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil imports expanded by 13.4 percent, following a healthy
growth of 11.0 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Despite the overall improvement in trade performance, there
were isolated export segments and markets which remained
depressed.
</P>
<P>
After a 9.1 percent contraction in June, domestic exports of
printers remained in the negative territory, contracting by 4.0
percent in July if compared with a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
NODX to Hong Kong continued its downward trend, contracting by
15.6 percent in July over the same month of 1998.
</P>
<P>
As to the performance of key trade components, the improvement
in NODX mirrored the continued recovery of electronics exports and
the healthy growth in non-electronic exports.
</P>
<P>
Domestic exports of electronic products increased for the third
consecutive month, by 8.6 percent in July compared to the same
month of 1998. Domestic exports of non-electronic products
expanded for the fifth consecutive month, growing by 17.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase continued to come from strong growth in domestic
exports of pharmaceuticals and intermediate compounds to the EU
and disc media products to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Compared with July 1998, domestic oil exports grew by 6.2
percent in July 1999, moderating marginally from the 6.9 percent
for June. The increase in oil price continued to contribute to the
growth of oil exports in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil re-exports (NORX) fell by 3.5 percent in July, the
third consecutive month of more moderate decline as compared to
the double-digit declines in the preceding months.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil imports (excluding aircraft and ships) grew by 13.4
percent, largely due to increases in imports of ICs, parts of
semiconductors, capacitors, cellular phones and radio phones,
parts of CTCs and radios, and printed circuits.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the same month of last year, among the top five
markets, only NODX to Hong Kong remained in the doldrums in July
with a contraction of 15.6 percent while the remaining four, the
U.S., the EU, Malaysia and Japan, continued to expand during the
month.
</P>
<P>
In particular, NODX to the U.S., the EU, Malaysia and Japan in
July rose 7.6, 8.3, 9.2 and 41.3 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
NODX to the emerging markets continued to expand in July,
growing by 6.8 percent following an 8.7 percent growth in the
previous month.

<HEADLINE> (roundup)German Ruling Party Calls For State Intervene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 20(Xinhua)-Amid a drastic decline of electricity
price caused by the bitter competition among domestic power
providers, spokespersons of Germany's ruling Social Democratic
Party (SPD) on Friday urged the federal authorities to regulate
the market.
</P>
<P>
The continuously dropping power price, they said, would hinder
the employment of environment-friendly technologies in electricity
generation, and would leave those small power plants under huge
market pressure.
</P>
<P>
Volker Jung, SPD's parliamentary spokesman on energy issues,
told the Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA) news agency in Berlin, that
federal regulation was needed "to secure a reasonable entrance
into German electricity network, both for those small power plants
and for those market-newcomers."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was also quoted as calling for more renewable
energy and power-warm coupling in German electricity market.
</P>
<P>
Jung's colleague on environmental policy Christoph Matschie
approved the initiative by suggesting the Federal Cartel Office to
interfere the price war.
</P>
<P>
"Eventually the federal government must keep equal chance for
all the electricity providers," he told the Deutschland Radio in
Berlin, adding that Germany's anti-trust authorities, the Federal
Cartel Office, would be a suitable institution to take over the
regulation.
</P>
<P>
After German government partly loosened the regional monopoly
on electricity market, the price war broke out earlier this summer
when large concerns such as RWE and PRUSSAG announced to cut power
price and to provide electricity for nationwide customers.
</P>
<P>
In latest developments, Bayernwerk, power provider in the
southern state of Bavaria and Germany's third largest energy
concern, on this Tuesday declared to sell cheap electricity all
over the country after September 1. And Bewag, the company
supplying the capital Berlin with electricity, said on Friday it
would cut power price by at least 10 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Though most enterprises and common citizens might benefit from
the price war, small power plants, outcome of the regional
monopoly policy and mostly generating power only for one city,
were under the pressure of market. Plans of corporate fusion and
staff lay-off in this branch were widely reported over the summer.
</P>
<P>
The situation aroused worries inside Germany's ruling
coalition, including SPD that struggles against the high jobless
rate and its junior partner, the Greens party that boasts
environmental protection. They said renewable energy would have no
chance with much higher production cost, and some control by the
government might be necessary.
</P>
<P>
Michael Mueller, deputy chief of SPD's parliamentary fraction,
warned against an uncontrolled war on electricity price earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
"If our argument is only about the price, the ecologically
meaningful power generator and the power-warm coupling will have
no chance to survive," he was quoted as telling the "Tagesspiegel"
newspaper in Berlin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Mueller, by now there are 50 to 90 small municipal
power plants to be sold. If this situation develops, he added, one
day German market will overflow with cheap power from the east
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The arguments did not convince Germany's opposites, the
conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and the tiny Free
Democratic Party (FDP). The two prefer a free electricity market
with less governmental intervene.
</P>
<P>
Paul Friedhoff, FDP's parliamentary spokesman for energy
policy, said on Friday that the government should open the market
more. Those small power plants must seize the chance in the
rapidly expanding electricity market, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Alert on Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Minister of
Finance Daniel Yona has directed the Tanzania Revenue Authority
(TRA) to become vigilant against massive tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Yona said in Dar es Salaam earlier this week that tax evasion
exists in all areas and TAR should take measures to stem all
loopholes used by unscrupulous businessmen.
</P>
<P>
"The burning issue of smuggling across borders could be
extinguished and resolved faster if TRA gained full support from
members of the public and state organs," media reports Friday
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, taxes worth millions of dollars were
evaded through under-declaration of petroleum products, sugar and
cooking oil imports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the finance minister said that Tanzania's exports of
cash crops may pick up this year with the blessing of favorable
rains.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Open Up an Inland Port in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RNA quoted Vincent Biruta, Rwandan Minister of Transport and
Telecommunications as saying that the inland port will be opened
at Isaka in northwestern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He said that Isaka dry port managed by the Tanzanian Railways
Cooperation (TRC), is strategically important in serving the rich
agricultural, commercial and industrialized hinterland of Rwanda,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Uganda and
northwestern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Isaka will provide a holiday point for a containerized traffic,
thus alleviating the necessity to travel to Dar-es-Salaam.
</P>
<P>
"The dry port is set to provide an efficient sea link at
competitive tariff, rapid transit time, safety and security of
cargo, easy documentation and proactive customer services,"
minister Biruta underlined.
</P>
<P>
The conversion of Isaka container terminal into a dry port will
make it quite a viable gateway for Rwanda's sea-borne trade.
</P>
<P>
While addressing Rwandan business people, Cassian Ngamiro, head
of the Tanzanian delegation which visited Rwanda early this week
underscored that Isaka dry port has adequate capacity to handle
all types of cargoes, the timely processing of documents, timing
of nominated vessels for shipments and assured safety and security
of cargo.
</P>
<P>
"It will reduce the costs of transport in terms of time saved,
documentation, reduced burden on return of empty containers and
provide a competitive route tariff," Ngamiro stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan business community hailed the initiative by both
countries, saying that it will reduce the transportation costs by
40% which will further reduce the prices of goods.
</P>
<P>
Isaka dry port is connected to Kigali, capital of Rwanda by the
tarmac road at a distance of 480 kms which is less costly compared
to the former route Dar-es-salaam-Kigali which is 982 kms long.

<HEADLINE> Roman Catholic Bishop in Court for Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The former Roman Catholic Bishop
Augustin Misago of southwestern Gikongoro Diocese was called to
the Kigali Criminal Court for the first time, Rwanda News Agency
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Misago faces five charges, including genocide and other crimes
against humanity, the creation of armed militia, complicity in
genocide and non-assistance to a person in danger. If found
guilty, he may be placed in the category one of genocide criminals
whose punishment is death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the prosecution finished reading charges against
him, the trial was immediately suspended following a disagreement
between the defense council and the prosecution on whether the
prelate should be legally detained or not.
</P>
<P>
The defense also requested the court to secure provisional
release to the accused because of his allegedly ill-health. This
prompted the court to hold a short session at the end of which it
announced that its decision on the above disagreement will be made
public on August 25, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was ready for being tried, Misago said: ''I'm
not prepared for trial, because I did not have enough time to read
and understand my case file.''
</P>
<P>
The prosecution rejected the arguments put forward by Misago
and his three lawyers, saying that they were resorting to dilatory
tactics aimed at securing provisional release for the prelate.
</P>
<P>
Misago, 56 and a Hutu, was arrested on April 14 this year, just
one week after the fifth commemoration of the 1994 genocide at
Kibeho, 100 kms south of Kigali, capital of Rwanda during which he
was accused by genocide survivors of having played a leading role
in the massacre of Tutsis and moderate Hutus which claimed the
lives of more than 500,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Britain Signals Sinn Fein to Stay in N.Irish Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain signaled Friday that it
would not expel the IRA's political wing from a planned review of
Northern Ireland's stalled peace accord even if it decides that
the guerrilla group has broken its two-year-old ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam hinted that any breach
might be penalized by suspension of a scheme for early release of
jailed IRA members.
</P>
<P>
"She explained the consequence of her finding a breach of the
ceasefire would be an effect on the prisoner release program," the
Reuters quoted a spokeswoman at Mowlam's Northern Ireland Office
(NIO) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam, after receiving security briefings about recent
incidents, has spent this week grappling with the thorny issue of
whether the IRA has breached a truce that is pivotal to peace
hopes -- and if so whether sanctions should be imposed on its Sinn
Fein political arm.
</P>
<P>
But amid calls by some of Sinn Fein's pro-British opponents for
its expulsion from the peace process, the NIO said there was "no
automatic process" for excluding it from a review of the peace
accord by U.S. mediator George Mitchell next month.
</P>
<P>
Last year's landmark Good Friday peace accord has been crippled
by wrangling between rival parties and Britain and Ireland have
called in Mitchell in the hope he can ease problems about
disarmament and lack of trust between politicians.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Firm Bars Illegal Use of Stolen Mobile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A leading Tanzanian mobile
phone company has taken measures to make it impossible for people
to reuse handsets acquired from the hands of thieves.
</P>
<P>
The General Manager of Mobitel, based in Dar es Salaam, Jim
Bell, said here Friday that his firm would immediately bar the
Electronic Serial Number (ESN) of a stolen handset so that any
other persons can no longer use it.
</P>
<P>
He called upon Mobitel customers to report to the Mobitel
office immediately once they lose their phones so as to start the
process of recovery.
</P>
<P>
When someone goes to a Mobitel office seeking for connection of
a used phone, Bell said, he is supposed to supply with details
about how and when he acquired the handset.
</P>
<P>
!0Many people disappeared and left the handsets in our hands for
fear of legal action, because the next step is to call the police
and arrest them, Bell said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ally Clashes Overshadow Fragile Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Rwanda, best allies
in the region but supporting different factions of the main rebel
group in the Congo, turned guns against each other in Kisangani in
northeastern Congo recently, overshadowing the fragile peace
process aimed at resolving the year-long conflict.
</P>
<P>
The clashes, which reportedly erupted on Saturday and lasted
till Tuesday, was for the control of an airport in Kisangani where
Ugandan troops were greatly outnumbered and out gunned. Dozens of
soldiers died in the exchange of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
This negative twist of event would further complicate the Congo
issue and fan hostilities between the two factions of the
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) Kampala and Kigali are
supporting, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda, out of different strategies and tactics,
chose to support opposing factions of the RCD after it split on
May 19 following a leadership wrangle. Even before the shoot-out,
a verbal battle had been fought between Uganda and Rwanda, in
which both parties had accused each other of backing the wrong
side.
</P>
<P>
This fighting between friends alerted again the international
community who had felt a bit relaxed after the Lusaka cease-fire
agreement endorsed by six African countries on July 10 because it
threatened to nip the fresh peace process in the bud.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the incident, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan announced that the two belligerent countries had breached
the cease-fire agreement they had just inked and that it greatly
undermined the peace efforts the international community is making
in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
The just concluded 19th summit of the Southern African
Development Community had invited Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart Pasteur Bizimungu to discuss
the issue of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Both presidents
aired their views about the conflict and put forth their
suggestions for resolutions during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity Salim
Ahmed Salim and Congolese Foreign Minister Yerodia Ndombase, who
represents President Laurent Kabila at the meeting, welcomed the
cease-fire agreement between Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The wrangling among rebel groups over representation in Lusaka
led to failure to sign the cease-fire pact. And Uganda-Rwanda
conflict created further hurdles to the realization of real peace
in the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
Although both sides agreed to stop fighting and began to smile
at each other, Kisangani is still shrouded in a tense and hostile
atmosphere. So it is still too early to say the cease-fire is
holding and both sides would willingly bury the hatchet. The
impact of the fighting on the peace process is negative and
enduring, observers said.

Intensified demand for land has placed unprecedented stress on

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges to Promote Solution for Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
pledged that the U.S. would continue to promote a solution to the
Cyprus issue based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation, the Cyprus
News Agency (CNA) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In his bi-monthly report to the U.S. Congress on the Cyprus
issue, Clinton recalled that during NATO's Washington summit on
the 50th anniversary of the military bloc, he "met with Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel and Greek Premier Constantinos Simitis
to underscore the importance of a just and lasting solution for
all Cypriots."
</P>
<P>
He said that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright conveyed a
similar message during talks with her Greek and Turkish
counterparts on the possibility of resuming the Cyprus peace
talks in the fall.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the U.S. would continue efforts to promote
"a settlement based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to settle the Cyprus issue have been stalled after
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash set preconditions for the
recognition of the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus".
</P>
<P>
He is also demanding that the peace negotiations would result
in establishing a "confederation of two states."
</P>
<P>
The U.N., the Cyprus government and all key players in the
peace efforts have rejected the demand.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras saw his 24-match
winning streak come to an end when a right hip flexor strain
forced him to retire after two sets of his quarterfinal matchup
with fellow American Vincent Spadea at the RCA Championships in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
Sampras dropped the first set 6-4 but rebounded to take the
second 6-3. The injury really began to bother the world's top-
ranked player and he opted against playing the decisive third set.
</P>
<P>
"I felt it after I hit that overhead (early in the second set),
" Sampras said. "I hit just kind of -- I kind of felt it go. I
didn't feel the shot just after it, I felt it definitely twinged
my -- it was deep in my hip flexor."
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who had won this event three times, is hoping that the
injury will not sideline him for long. The U.S. Open begins August
30.
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping three or four days of just rest and treatment and
taking care of it, and hope I can start hitting by the middle of
the week."
</P>
<P>
Spadeea advances to face unseeded Sebastian Grosjean of France
in the semifinals. Grosjean surprised third seed Gustavo Kuerten
of Brazil 6-4, 6-3. Grosjean is a hardcourt stalwart who reached
the
finals at this years's Lipton Championships.
</P>
<P>
In the lone matchup of seeded players, 11th seed Nicolas
Lapentti of Ecuador routed fourth seed Carlos Moya of Spain 6-1,6-
2. Lapentti will meet the Netherlands Jan Siemerink, who walked
into the semifinals on Thursday, when second-seeded Patrick Rafter
of Australia pulled out with a shoulder injury.

TEHRAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Warplanes of Iran's air force
held the last stage of air-to-surface firing exercises
code-namde "Heydar Karrar" (Brave Lion) Saturday in Shabester
area in the northwestern province of East Azarbaijan.
</P>
<P>
One hundred fighter planes and bombers from the country's
various air bases took part in the three-day maneuvers, in
which 300 sorties were carried out, according to the official
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).
</P>
<P>
The fighters and bombers conducted low-altitude bombing, and
fired air-to-surface missiles and machine guns. They included
the U.S.-made F-14s, F-5s, F-4s, F-7s, and Russia-made Su-24s
and Mig-29s, the local Persian-language daily "Kayhan" (Worl
d) reported.
</P>
<P>
IRNA quoted an Air force commander as saying that a remarkable
achievement of Iranian technicians is their installing of equipment
on the F-14s to enable them to act as multi-purpose bombers.
</P>
<P>
The project for upgrading F-14 fighter planes showed the
air force has reached self-sufficiency and it has no
limitation in maintenance and upgrading the fighter planes as
well as manufacturing modern equipment, the commander said.
</P>
<P>
Military officials said one of the main purposes of the
drilling was to test the reliability of Iran-made spare parts for
maintenance of U.S.-made warplanes as it had been difficult for
Iran to procure such spare parts due to U.S.-imposed military
and economic sanctions.

ISLAMABAD, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia Saturday rejected the accusations by the United Nations
that it was sending juveniles to fight against the opposition
forces.
</P>
<P>
Taliban's senior official responsible for information, Mulla
Amir Muttaqi, was quoted by the Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) as
saying that the claim by the U.N is "totally false and an
allegation."
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA) has never recruited
young men to its ranks and will never do so," Muttaqi said.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. official Friday voiced concern over the growing
recruitment of students from Islamic schools in Pakistan into the
ranks of the Taliban militia in its current war against the
country's beleaguered opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
A large number of the students are under the age of 18, said
Louis-Georges Arsenault, UNICEF representative for Afghanistan, at
a news briefing in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
According to AIP, Muttaqi accused the U.N. of "making untrue
statements in order to defame and pressure the IEA" in a bid "to
heighten the propaganda campaign against the Islamic Emirate."

<HEADLINE> Taliban Say Willing to Discuss Osama Issue With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia Saturday repeated its offer for talks to the United States
to resolve the long-standing issue of the expulsion of Osama bin
Laden, the alleged terrorist.
</P>
<P>
"Differences could not be solved through force," said a Taliban
official statement issued in Kabul on the first anniversary of the
American missile attack on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The statement condemned the attack, urging Washington to
refrain from repeating the mistakes committed by the British and
the Russians.
</P>
<P>
The United States fired around 70 Tomahawk cruise missiles on
August 20 last year on the eastern Afghan town of Khost in a bid
to kill Osama, who survived the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi dissident has been accused by the United States of
involvement in the bomb blasts at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Taliban senior official Amir Khan Muttaqi Thursday condemned
"the naked aggression" by the U.S. last year and said any other
U.S. attack on Afghanistan would be a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban militia is ready to settle all issues,
including Osama, with the United States through talks.
</P>
<P>
Amid renewed fears of fresh strikes by Washington, Taliban have
resisted all pressures to evict Osama because of his participation
in the Afghan Jihad (holy war) against the Soviet occupation in
the 1980s.

ISLAMABAD, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan opposition alliance

northeastern Takhar province, a key supply route for the Panjsher
valley -- the stronghold of opposition commander Ahmad Shah
Masood.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from the Afghan capital of Kabul quoted
opposition spokesman Abdullah (one name) as saying that the attack
on Takhar had been launched from three directions Friday from the
neighboring Kunduz province which is controlled by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
"The attack, backed by helicopter gunships and tanks, started
around dawn and continued till late into the night," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban troops were hit back after their initial advance
and lost the areas they had taken including some of their own
positions, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 42 Taliban soldiers were killed and dozens of others
wounded during the fighting, said Abdullah, adding that seven from
the opposition side were killed and 15 wounded.

immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Involvement in Buenos Aires Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday rejected claims
by Argentine Vice President Carlos Ruckauf that its diplomats had
been involved in a bombing attack on a Jewish center in Buenos
Aires five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid-Reza Asefi dismissed the
accusations as "unfounded," saying Ruckauf's "repeated,
undocumented and irresponsible claims were aimed at creating
ballyhoo against Iran."
</P>
<P>
Iran's cultural attache to Argentina was accused of being
involved in the bomb explosion in 1994 which killed 88 people and
injured 159 others.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian national, Manouchehr Motamer, offered some
information after the bombing to Argentine authorities claiming
that Iranian diplomats were behind the attack.
</P>
<P>
However, Argentina failed to find enough evidence to support
the accusations over the past five years, and Iran has repeatedly
denied any involvement in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Asefi turned the table on Ruckauf, who was interior minister of
Argentine at the time of the bombing, accusing him of
mismanagement in the past and cover-up at present.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that Ruckauf ... who failed to justify his
mismanagement ... now is trying to cover up past weaknesses during
his tenure as interior minister, by raising such unfounded
accusations," Asefi was quoted by the official Islamic Republic
News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Argentina suffered great setbacks
after the bombing, with both sides lowering their diplomatic
representation in each other's capital.

<HEADLINE> Forum on Developing Nuclear Power Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 Chinese experts and
leading officials attended a forum here today sponsored by three
domestic research institutions to discuss China's strategy for
developing nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the forum was Zhu Guangya, a vice-chairman of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
Some speakers pointed out that China's nuclear power output
accounts for only 1.3 percent of the country's total power output,
compared with the 17 percent in the world.
</P>
<P>
They urged the construction of more nuclear power plants and
stations as well as natural gas and hydro-electric power stations
around the country.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, during its Ninth Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2000), China is building and plans to build four
nuclear power stations with eight generators which have a combined
generating capacity of 6.6 million kw.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Expedition Boat Collides With Ice Floe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, August 21 (Xinhua)-- A boat from the Chinese
Arctic Expedition ship Snow Dragon collided with an ice floe on
the Arctic Ocean this morning and was seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
No one was aboard the boat when it crashed into the four-meter
thick, football-field-size ice floe.
</P>
<P>
The 30-meter-long expedition boat The Great Wall was at anchor
on the sea when the incident occurred, as it was prepared to ferry
expedition members and equipment to a temporary observation
station on the ice.
</P>
<P>
The floating ice appeared all of a sudden, striking the boat
violently and pushing it toward the Snow Dragon, said Chen Bo, a
biologist who was preparing to carry instruments to the boat as
the collision took place.
</P>
<P>
"The boat was crushed out of shape, and then the ice continued
to float far away with almost no loss," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The sea around the ship was shrouded in a thick fog at the time
and visibility was less than 100 meters, a member of the
expedition team said, adding that "the thick fog hid everything,
including the quietly approaching ice floe."
</P>
<P>
"It was only two minutes from the time we saw the ice coming to
the time of the collision," said Boatswain Wu Lin. "The ice was
coming at so high a speed that we had no time to use the crane to
lift up the boat."
</P>
<P>
After the incident, the expedition team had to use another boat,
the Zhongshan No. 1, to carry out the unfinished task of The Great
Wall.
</P>
<P>
The accident has had some negative impact on transport
effectiveness, since the substitute boat is less advanced than The
Great Wall, according to Captain Yuan Shaohong.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Arrest Two for Attempted Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Police in northeast China's
Liaoning Province have arrested two men suspected of attempted
murder who had been hired by a convicted economic criminal.
</P>
<P>
The two, both released prisoners, were hired by Li Zhongquan,
former head of a district branch of the Fuxin City Public Security
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Li had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for serious
economic crime, but was serving his prison term outside under
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
Li and his wife reportedly hired the two to kill Chen Ming, a
city discipline inspector who was one of the principal persons to
deal with Li's case.
</P>
<P>
On July 1 of this year, the two men stabbed Chen in the chest
while he just came out from his home to go to his office. Chen's
lung was seriously injured and was taken to a nearby hospital
where he was recovered after 45 percent of his wounded lung was
removed.
</P>
<P>
Seven days later police arrested Li in Beijing and his wife in
Inner Mongolia.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Ruling Party Holds Grand Procession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's ruling People's
Alliance (PA) Saturday staged a massive procession in Colombo to
mark the coalition's five years in power despite warnings of Tamil
rebels' suicide bomb attacks.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of men and women from all walks of life
attended the procession, which was described as a grand national
ceremony to mark the millennium.
</P>
<P>
About 160 colorful floats were driven along the parade
depicting the government's achievements during the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
The parade will be followed by a mass rally in the evening.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the event is "Five-year vision -- vision for the
new century." President Chandrika Kumaratunga is expected to make
a policy statement at the rally enunciating her government's
vision to herald an era of peace and unity, enlightenment and
modernity in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The National Intelligence Bureau warned the week before that
over 20 suicide bombers of Tamil rebels of Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had infiltrated into Colombo recently to carry
out suicide missions, and that the situation in the capital city
was not advisable for large crowds to congregate.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting since 1983 for a Tamil homeland in
Sri Lanka's north and east, have been blamed by the government for
carrying out a suicide bomb attack which killed leading Tamil
lawmaker Neelan Thiruchelvam in Colombo at the end of July.
</P>
<P>
Former president Ranasinghe Premadasa and several others were
killed in 1993's May Day procession in Colombo by Tamil rebels'
suicide bombers.

<HEADLINE> Institutional Reform for SADC Enjoys Priority: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Priority will be given to the
institutional reform for the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) during the time when Mozambique becomes the
chairman nation of the regional body, Mozambican Foreign Minister
Leonardo Simao has said.
</P>
<P>
Feasibility study will be conducted first toward this goal, he
was quoted as announcing at a press conference by Saturday's
Noticias newspaper. Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano was
elected last Wednesday as the new chairman of the 14-member
regional body.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that "recent operation of the SADC
shows that its set-up needs reform, which includes its
secretariat". This was required at the 19th summit of the
regional organization held last week in Maputo, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Discussion will be conducted on what is SADC and what is its
aim," he said, noting that the regional body's strategic plan
lacks "visibility".
</P>
<P>
One of the SADC's aims, he said, is to help resolve the
conflicts existing in the region at present. Mozambique will play
a bigger role in this field, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region government has approved more than five
million HK dollars this year to subsidize projects promoting
volunteerism among young people.
</P>
<P>
Funds have been channeled to support 127 projects under the
second phase of the Youth Community Service Funding Scheme,
according to a spokesman for the Commission on Youth.
</P>
<P>
"The projects will provide some 120,000 participation times for
young volunteers aged between 15 and 24 to take part in a wide
range of meaningful community service activities," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
These include services for the elderly, tutoring students,
recreational and cultural activities, visits and exhibitions, he
added.
</P>
<P>
More than five million HK dollars have been approved on these
projects which will be completed towards the end of this year, the
spokesman said, adding that about 110 community services projects
sponsored under the first phase of the project have been completed
around June this year.
</P>
<P>
"The participants have also benefited by learning how to work
with others, acquiring leadership skills, and being better
equipped to cope with success and failure in the future," the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Shifts Stand on Niger's Military Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Executive Secretary of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Lansana
Kouyate Friday in Abuja canvassed international support for Niger
Republic, implying the regional body's softening of stance
against the country's military authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to Kouyate, ECOWAS, which condemned the April 9 coup
d'etat in the country, was shifting its stand and moving to
accept the prevailing reality by supporting its on-going
democratization process, reported the Guardian, a Nigerian
newspaper on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The military government led by former head of the presidential
guard, Major Dauda Wanke, which emerged after the assassination
of former president Ibrahim Mainassara, has been battling for
international recognition since the April putsch.
</P>
<P>
"We are being realistic in the belief that the authorities in
Niger would abide by their promise to hold presidential elections
in November and hand over to elected civilians," Kouyate
declared.
</P>
<P>
He said that the organization, which was at the forefront in
the campaign for the international isolation of the regime of
Wanke, had also found its efforts undermined by some member
states.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate said the latest support by ECOWAS was intended to
"encourage the on-going democratization" in that country to
ensure that it did not relapse into another era of military rule.
</P>
<P>
He promised to visit Niger to evaluate its democratization and
stressed that the sub-region was still committed to discouraging
coup plotters. The country is shopping for one billion French CFA
to hold elections ahead of the handover to civilians.

<HEADLINE> Lagos Police Crack-Down Yields Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Lagos state, Nigeria's economic
hub, recently has seen a drop of violent crimes with the adoption
of new security measures and effective use of new logistics, said
the state's police Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Saturday quoted
Lagos State Police Commissioner Michael Okiro as saying that the
police's efforts last week had led to the arrest of some gang
leaders.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a week-long crack-down on criminals led to
the arrest of no fewer than 15 robbery suspects.
</P>
<P>
Six double barred guns, two pump action rifles and 209 bullets
were retrieved from suspects in Lagos during the week.
</P>
<P>
"Lagos is now visibly peaceful," the police said, noting
however, that " there is no way that the police can completely
eradicate crime."
</P>
<P>
But Okiro assured Lagos residents of police determination "to
keep it at the minimum".

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- About 315 persons died in 1,702
accidents involving 2,245 vehicles between January and June this
year in Lagos State, Nigeria's commercial center, reported a
Nigerian newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Besides, 1,050 sustained injuries of varying degrees during the
same period reported the Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Lagos State Sector Commander of the Federal
Road Safety Commission (FRSC) Olagunju Kayode as saying that the
accident figure is seven percent higher than that of the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
He, however, blamed the increase on low level of FRSC
operations on the first quarter of the year, generated by the
crises on motor-parks, indiscipline on the highways by motorists,
bad roads, alcohol and bad vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons adduced by the FRSC boss are impatience, night
travels and general indiscipline by road users, including
pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
To reverse the trend, Kayode said the commission would embark
on intensive patrol of highways and public enlightenment
activities.
</P>
<P>
Other measures to be employed include involvement of the
police, state and local governments as well as other interest
groups, in decongesting
Lagos roads.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 600 rare and precious
coins will be auctioned off at a function scheduled to be held
here on September 11.
</P>
<P>
The coins range from the Qin Dynasty (221 B.C.-207 B.C.) to the
modern era and are made of a variety of materials including gold,
silver, copper, nickel, paper, cloth, and ceramics, according to
Fan Ganping, deputy president of the Shanghai International
Commodities Auction Co. Ltd., the auction's organizer.
</P>
<P>
"China has a long history of producing coins, which are
considered the epitome of the country's social and economic
development at any given period of time," said Fan.
</P>
<P>
The hobby to collecting coins has gradually become a new trend
in China because people believe that coins have a stable
investment value.
</P>
<P>
Fan said an exhibition of the coins will also be held from
September 8-10, prior to the auction.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, another auction of over 400 art works,

<HEADLINE> Innovation in Production Process Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Levels of productivity and
competitiveness in Zimbabwean industries will continue to fall
unless a continuous process of innovation is implemented, the
Center for Innovation and Enterprise Development (CIED) said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The CIED is part of an international initiative in Africa to
foster innovation and development of technological capability for
industrial competitiveness primarily among small to medium
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A CIED report issued here Saturday said that lack of a culture
of innovation in improving products had resulted in the industry
failing to sustain competition both locally and regionally.
</P>
<P>
"At the micro-level, successful competition requires quality of
products, superior process of technology, and a proper
organization of production," it said.
</P>
<P>
"This can only be attained if a wide array of domestic linkages
between the users and producers are formulated," the center said.
</P>
<P>
The center recently introduced its services to Zimbabwe to
assist firms in identifying appropriate local and external
networking partners in innovative activities as well as to provide
training programs for firms across the country in the specific
sub-sectors.
</P>
<P>
The center is financed by the International Development
Research Center of Canada with project management services
provided by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development.

<HEADLINE> One of First Giant Panda Triplets Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Professor Zhang Hemin, a giant panda specialist,
at around two o'clock this morning, a worker who was on round-the-
clock care duty found that one cub had been deserted by mother,
and the cub, who weighed 137 grams at birth, was already dead.
</P>
<P>
A medical examination showed that three-day-old little cub died
of a fatal bladder disorder, said Professor Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The three cubs were born on the morning of August 18. The
oldest of the cubs weighs 156 grams, and the middle one, 137.7
grams. They are the first recorded giant panda triplets in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The youngest surviving cub was being tended to by the mother,
and the eldest cub is being taken care of by the center staff
members. The two remaining cubs are said to be in good health.
</P>
<P>
Normally, giant pandas give birth to one or two cubs each time.
China used artificial insemination to produce the first giant
panda cub born in captivity in 1963.
</P>
<P>
The 30-hectare center, located at the Wolong Nature Reserve in
the northern suburbs of Chengdu, was developed by the Chinese
government and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in 1980 and has
successfully bred 24 giant pandas since 1991, of which 15 survived.
</P>
<P>
There are only about 1,000 giant pandas, both in captivity and
in the wild, remaining in the world, 80 percent of which live in
the mountains around the Sichuan Basin.

<HEADLINE> British Warship to Visit Kuwait Wednesday: Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 21 (Xinhua) -- British warship HMS
Birmingham will arrive here Wednesday on her second visit to
Kuwait since last June, the British Embassy said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
HMS Birmingham, which is the third generation since the first
Birmingham was built in 1914, is a Type 42 destroyer, and is
capable of dealing with both surface and underwater targets, the
Embassy said in a statement quoted by Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the ship, which is mainly an air defense
ship, is equipped with Sea Dart missile system with a range of
about 30 miles (48 kilometers).
</P>
<P>
It is also equipped with an automatic 4.5" KM 8 Gun and the
Phalanz radar guided battling gun. The automatic 4.5" KM 8 Gun was
effectively used against aircraft and surface ships during the
Falklands conflict between Britain and Argentina in 1982.
</P>
<P>
HMS Birmingham, with an overall length of 412 feet and a
discharge capacity of 4,000 tons, carries on board Lynx ASW
helicopter, which can carry Sea Skua missiles.

<HEADLINE> Symposium Marking Return of Macao to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Over 50 experts from the Chinese
inland areas and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan regions today
attended a symposium marking the return of Macao to China in the
city of Zhuhai, one of China's five special economic zones, in
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was sponsored by the China Foreign Affairs
College and the office of the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone
Newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Participants discussed issues including the significance of the
return of Macao, the economic development of Macao after the
return and its economic relations with the Chinese inland areas,
and Hong Kong and Taiwan regions, economic cooperation between
Macao and Zhuhai, as well as the reunification of China and
relations between the Chinese inland areas and Taiwan province.
</P>
<P>
Those taking part unanimously denounced Lee Teng-hui's the "two-
state" and the "special state-to-state " remarks.
</P>
<P>
Yang Fuchang, President of the China Foreign Affairs College,
said that just when all Chinese are busy making preparations to
greet the return of Macao to the motherland in December, Lee Teng-
hui threw out his "special state-to-state" remark on July 9, which
severely damaged cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
"Unity and reunification have long been a fine tradition of the
Chinese nation, and safeguarding national unity has always been at
the core of China's politics and culture, " said Yang, who is a
former vice foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui's "two-state" remark violates international law
and has been rebuked by the international community, Yang
continued, adding that the return of Macao demonstrates that the
reunification of China is a strong tide which no one can block,
and Lee's remark will be doomed to being swept away by history.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jiaji, a veteran diplomat, said in an article that Lee's "
special state-to-state" remark violates the "one China" principle
and goes against the consensus on this principle reached by both
sides of the Straits before the 1992 meeting between Wang Daohan,
President of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) and Chairman Koo Chen-fu of the Straits Exchanges
Foundation (SEF).
</P>
<P>
"The principle of 'one China' is the foundation of contacts,
exchanges, and dialogue between two sides of the Taiwan Straits,
and Lee Teng-hui has taken a very dangerous step toward splitting
up the motherland by throwing out his 'special state-to-state'
remark, as these remarks destroy the foundation of cross-Straits
relations and harms the gradually stabilizing nature of these
relations," said the veteran diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Xiangduo, a history professor at Dongwu University in
Taiwan, said Lee Teng-hui's remarks are fraudulent, and Lee
misguides the Taiwan people and will eventually be spurned by them.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Pursues Bid to Host 2006 Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is refusing to drop
its proposal to host the 2006 Asian Games despite pressure from
neighboring Malaysia, which is also bidding for the event.
</P>
<P>
National Sports Council (KONI) vice chairman Arie Sudewo said
that Indonesia wanted to show other Asian countries that it could
act as a good host for the quadrennial event although it was not
in serious medal contention.
</P>
<P>
"We will wait for the Malaysians to talk to us for the best
solution, but it doesn't mean we must withdraw from the bidding.
We are remaining consistent with our stated intention. Take Brunei
Darussalam as an example. The country showed it could be a good
host for the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games and bring honor to the
country, but it did not aggressively pursue the Games title," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Arie reminded that Indonesia previously hosted the Asian Games
once in the 1962.
</P>
<P>
He also said KONI would reallocated portions of its budget to
support the campaign.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to host the Asiad, that's why we are bold
enough to bid to host the Asiad," Arie was quoted by The Jakarta
Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, India, Qatar, Syria and Uzbekstan also have
expressed interest in hosting the event.
</P>
<P>
The Olympics Council of Asia will announce the 2006 Asiad host
in November.

PARIS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Saturday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- According to the United Nations, 40,000 people were killed
by the earthquake which took place in Izmit in northwest Turkey on
Tuesday. Four days after the earthquake, the hope for finding the
survivors is very small. The Turkish government said that 10,000
are confirmed dead, while many are still buried in the rubbles of
tens of thousands of houses.
</P>
<P>
-- The actions of intimidation by small groups of Albanians
against the Serbs and Gypsies still remaining in Kosovo are
attaining an alarming situation, according to U.N. High Commission
for Refugees. The U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Kosovo (KFOR) is
trying to protect the Kosovars of non-Albanian ethnicity, mainly
women and the elderly, in isolated places of hostile environment.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- While the latest provisionary account of death toll from the
earthquake in Turkey now stands at 10,000, the U.N. fears that 35,
000 people are still buried in the rubbles. One in three of the
population living in the earthquake zone is affected, said Turkish
government who made the estimation by accounting the destroyed
houses from the air.
</P>
<P>
-- The movement of merger-acquisition is accelerating in the
world. The restructuring of the banking sector of Japan gave birth
to a largest bank in the world on Friday. In France, a project to
re-group three banks (BNP, Societe General and Paribas) has been
launched for six months and is yet to be completed.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has requested for
contributions from Malaysians to alleviate problems faced by its
earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
Malaysians could send in their contributions, either in cash or
kind such as medical equipment and blankets to the embassy here,
Attila G. Kizilarslan, Commercial Counselor of the Turkish

The disaster was far beyond the capacity of any country or
nation to handle alone, Attila said, adding the quake was
considered to be one of the most powerful in this century with the
number of directly affected people to be around one million.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish government has released a list of urgently needed
materials to be used for immediate requirement of survivors and a
number of countries including Malaysia has responded to the
request and decided to send assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Attila expressed the Turkish government's gratitude to the
Malaysian government for sending a 24-member rescue team from its
Special Malaysian Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team which left
for Ankara Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Makes Progress in Poverty Reduction Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The number of poor households in
Vietnam has dropped from 70 percent to 30 percent since the 1980s,
Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The progress was shown in a survey made by Vietnam's Ministry
of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs with support from the
Danish government, the World Bank and The United Nations
Development Program.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that trading centers such as Ho Chi Minh
City, Dong Nai and Vung Tau with relatively well developed
infrastructure are the wealthiest in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Mekong Delta is the country's second most prosperous area.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey showed that Vietnam's battle to beat hunger
and poverty is far from winning.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 4,800 households in Vietnam's seven economic
regions found that former Region 4 and the northern midlands are
the poorest areas.
</P>
<P>
Between 37 and 51 percent of the families in these areas live
in makeshift housing.
</P>
<P>
The poorest people live in areas with poor economic and social
infrastructure and most of the people living in such areas are not
part of the majority Kinh population.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is now listed at 122 in the world's total of 174
countries for life expectancy, education and job creation.
</P>
<P>
To raise its standing, the Vietnamese government has launched a
program to eliminate chronic hunger and poverty by the year 2010
and increase this decade's per capita income eight to ten times by
2020.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Open to Charter Change Talks With Critics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Saturday he is open to talks with political and
church leaders to enlighten them on the issue involving his call
for economic reforms through constitutional correction and
development (Concord).
</P>
<P>
In a weekly radio-TV program here, Estrada said that he is
always ready for talks with Manila Archbishop Cardinal Jaime Sin
and former presidents Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos to thrash out
issues involving his administration's call for constitutional
reforms.
</P>
<P>
"We are exploring all possible solutions to our problems.
Perhaps we can talk about this, and I'm ready to talk with former
presidents Aquino and Ramos and Cardinal Sin," he said.
</P>
<P>
Around 75,000 people, led by Cardinal Sin and former president
Aquino, staged an anti-charter-change rally Friday afternoon in
the capital city.
</P>
<P>
In the program, Estrada also appealed to critics of economic
reforms to give his administration a chance to clearly explain to
the people the need to introduce changes to the constitution to
realize his goal of eradicating poverty among Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
"I could have done away with Concord to avoid controversy and
confusion. But, I decided to push through with this because there
is no other solution but to lift the restrictions in the
constitution on the entry of foreign capital," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing constitution, foreigners are not allowed to
own land in the Philippines and their ownership share of the
country's industry can not exceed 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
"That's why I thought of proposing economic reforms to the
constitution and nothing else," he added.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that the move to bring in foreign investments
reflects the new economic nationalism of providing Filipinos with
more jobs and uplifting their living standards.
</P>
<P>
Economic reforms to the constitution will also make the
Philippines at par with its Asian neighbors that have already
forged ahead in the race toward development, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Saturday, the presidential office
said that Estrada's call for economic reforms, which include
allowing foreigners to own land and enter certain businesses and
public utilities, is expected to draw in billions of dollars worth
of investments in real estate and capital-intensive industries.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish monster earthquake

</P>
<P>
Local private NTV Saturday quoted the experts as saying that
the economic loss caused by the killer earthquake also accounts

ruins of the destroyed buildings and houses in the stricken
provinces of Istanbul, Kocaeli (Izmit), Sakarya (Adapazari),
Yalova, Bursa, Bolu, Eskisehir, Zonguldak, and Tekirdag.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that the fire in the Izmit Refinery of the
Turkish Petrol Company, about 110 kilometers southeast of
Istanbul, has cost at least 5 billion dollars. The fire, caused by
Tuesday's earthquake, has been taken under control with the help
of foreign rescue experts.
</P>
<P>
The tremor also caused a loss of 15 billion dollars in the
industrial production and bases in the stricken regions, and for
trade economy, said the experts.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has made an urgent call for providing
aid for the quake-hit areas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Privatization Moves Slowly in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The privatization drive in
Bangladesh has been moving slowly, the Economic Observer reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Privatization Board invited tenders to off-load some 15
SOEs (state-owned enterprises) between November last year and
August this year, but only two entered into the final stage of
transfer, and the board had to put some SOEs on re-tender.
</P>
<P>
"The privatization goes slow. What can we do if entrepreneurs
do not respond to tenders?" said a board official.
</P>
<P>
The board floated tenders for four enterprise last November,
but could finalize the deal for only one of them. In April this
year, it put five SOEs on sale, and only one of them was in early
stages of selling while there was no response for the four others.
</P>
<P>
Huge long-term and short-term liabilities, separation of land
from factories, procedural delays in handover and excessive
manpower are among the decelerators for the much-needed sell-out,
business people said.
</P>
<P>
"The government lacks strong political decision for quickening
the privatization fearing labor unrest," said an executive member
of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and
Industries.
</P>
<P>
Superfluous manpower of the state undertakings frustrate
prospective buyers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Privatization is donors' recipe and the government's top
priority to stop hemorrhage of national exchequer to the tune of
25 billion taka (500 million U.S. dollars) per year on account of
the SOEs.
</P>
<P>
The Privatization Board, which is now put under the prime
minister's office and has handed over only 18 units so far since
it was set up in 1993, needs government's approval at every stage
to off-load an SOE.
</P>
<P>
"If everything goes smoothly, we need at least six months to
complete the whole journey up to the prime minister's office and
then issue letter of intent for an SOE," said a board official.
</P>
<P>
To speed up the privatization process, the cabinet has approved
a draft law vesting more authority and autonomy upon the board.
The law, if passed in parliament, would empower the board to
directly trade out a state enterprise worth up to 250 million taka
(5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, it takes one year or more for a buyer to take over
the unit. "In the meantime, the machinery loses capacity and the
entrepreneur loses interest. But we've nothing to help," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 300 SOEs in the country, with the total value
of output accounting for about 6 percent of the gross domestic
product and incurring a loss of about 568 million dollars every
year.

ISTANBUL (Turkey), August 21 (Xinhua) -- Blaze in a refinery in
western Turkey has been under control after the strong efforts
made by foreign rescue experts, a Turkish official said on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish private NTV quoted Ismail Alakoc, the chairman of the
boarding committee of Turkish Petrol Refineries Company as saying
that the strong fire of the Izmit Refinery in Kocaeli province
caused by Tuesday's monster earthquake has been under control with
the help of foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Germany, Azerbaijan, Greece, France, the Netherlands,
Kazakistan, Ukraine and Russia have been participating in the fight
against the blaze that threatened to engulf the entire field of 30
storage tanks containing 1 million tons of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The fire fighting aircraft dropped special chemical foam to
control the flames in the Izmit Refinery, about 110 kilometers
southeast of Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Alakoc added that the fire has burnt 250,000 tons of the crude
oil in the Turkey's largest oil refinery.
</P>
<P>
Turkish experts are expected to make research for the pollution
caused by the burning, which has spread to large areas around the
Izmit Refinery, he said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the devastating fire, the Turkish government has made an
urgent appeal for delivering crude oil to Turkey. Many taxi
drivers in Istanbul have been lining up for filling LPG as the
Izmit Refinery stopped supplying petrol to the city.

<HEADLINE> EU Team to Come to Tanzania to Review Fish Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 21 (Xinhua)-- An European Union
inspection team will arrive here next week to inspect Tanzania's
efforts in controlling toxic fishing in Lake Victoria, a move
which may lead to partial lifting of the ban on fish fillet
exports from the country to Europe.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation's first secretary in Dar es Salaam, Ranieri
Sabatucci, has said a group of veterinarians will be in Tanzania
next Monday to check whether or not Tanzania has made any
improvement in fighting the illegal practices of fishing with
chemical substances that threaten food health.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, EU suspended imports of fresh fish fillets
produced from Lake Victoria, the largest in Africa, following
reports that fishermen of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda have used
cotton pesticides to poison fish. The three countries incurred
great loss in foreign exchange earnings following the trade
embargo.
</P>
<P>
Although the team has already expressed dissatisfaction with
Kenya's failure to enforce required standards, Tanzania might be
considered on an isolated basis, Daily Mail reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, The EU Head of Delegation, Peter Beck
Christiansen, said that Tanzania had fully complied with required
standards and hoped that the ban would be lifted. He however
argued that because Tanzania shares common borders on Lake
Victoria with Uganda and Kenya, it was necessary that the three
countries maintain uniform standard of fish exports.
</P>
<P>
Fish processors say that since imposition of the ban, the price
of fish fillet exports has dropped from 2.5 dollars to between 2.0
dollars and 1.85 dollars per kilogram.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- India plans to set up a
center for small-scale industries in Tanzania this year to help
the African country develop economy, Indian High Commissioner to
Tanzania, Virendra Gupta, has said.
</P>
<P>
The center will provide technical assistance to Tanzanian
entrepreneurs wishing to set up small industries, The Guardian
Saturday quoted Gupta as saying.
</P>
<P>
"India is consulting with the Small Industries Development
Organization (SIDO) to clear the ground for the center and is
looking for a possibility of establishing the center in the next
few months," the diplomat said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The center will be under SIDO and India has proposed the
center to be manned by an expert from India for at least six
months before handing it over to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He said that the center would include information and
documentation of small and medium scale industries in India.
</P>
<P>
The Indian small-scale industries, referred to as the backbone
of the Indian industry, contribute about 35 percent of the
country's total export.
</P>
<P>
The sector also provides more than 80 percent of industrial
employment offering 16.7 million jobs, he said. Currently India
has a population of one billion people.

<HEADLINE> Tax Dodge Goods Held at Kenyan Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Goods worth more than 50 million
 shillings (around 700,000 U.S. dollars) have been seized by the
customs in a major new crackdown on tax evasion at Mombasa port,
the second largest city in southeastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
H.P. Ndungu, deputy commissioner of customs at the port, said
that seven Toyota Landcruisers were also being seized, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have seized two 40-foot containers and one 20-foot
container following attempts by the clearing agents to evade duty
through false declaration," Ndungu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the agents had indicated that one of the
containers had 115 cartons of garlic, but after verification, it
was found to contain 115 bales of printed fabrics.
</P>
<P>
The other two containers seized were discovered that the goods
 indicated in the documents submitted to the customs were not the
ones inside the containers, Ndungu added.
</P>
<P>
The goods have been held and the licences of the clearing and
 forwarding agents have been suspended, the customs official said,
adding a manhunt for the directors of clearing and forwarding
companies has been launched.
</P>
<P>
Tax evasion at Mombasa port was on the rise until 1997 when
the government mounted a crackdown on tax evaders.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian House Calls for Suspension of Officials Involved in Bank Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's House Commission
VIII (state budget and financial affairs) Saturday issued a
political statement, calling for suspension of state officials
involved in Bank Bali scandal.
</P>
<P>
The political statement was read to reporters by Commission
Chairman Tayo Tarmadi here Saturday morning after a meeting of the
formulating team that lasted for more than five hours.
</P>
<P>
The 13-point political statement should have been drafted by 15
members of the House commission, but two of them, Syaiful Anwar
from the United Development Party faction and Markus Wauran from
the Indonesian Democratic Party faction, were absent.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the Bank Bali scandal has shaken
the country's monetary system, weakened the rupiah exchange rate
against the U.S. dollar, and led to the drop of stock trading in
the bourse.
</P>
<P>
Such a condition has been detrimental to the public interest,
lowered international confidence in the Indonesian banking system,
and damaged foundations of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, as a moral and political responsibility, the House
commission called on all state officials and those directly and
indirectly involved in the scandal to be suspended, aimed at
facilitating the investigation of the scandal in line with the
existing laws and regulations, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement further said that the minister of finance and the
chairman of the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) should
be responsible for the emergence of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
If the Bank Indonesian governor is proven to also be directly
or indirectly involved in the scandal, he should also be
responsible in the framework of public accountability and he
should also be suspended.
</P>
<P>
The House commission demanded that banks unable to meet
recapitalization requirements should also be closed down. In this
connection, the statement called for a review of banks that have
been put under the government-sponsored recapitalization program.
</P>
<P>
The statement also urged the country's legal authorities,
particularly the attorney general's office, to be more pro-active
in probing the Bank Bali scandal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several political parties, including the ruling
Golkar Party, Friday urged Finance Minister Bambang Subianto and
several other officials believed to be implicated in the Bank Bali
scandal to resign.
</P>
<P>
Economist Yusuf Faisal of the National Awakening Party said
that all government officials involved in the Bank Bali case,
including Bambang, IBRA Chairman Glenn Yusuf and Bank Indonesia
Governor Sjahril Sabirin, should resign.
</P>
<P>
"If they do not want to resign, they should appear on
television or place statements in 10 newspapers to apologize,"
Faisal said.
</P>
<P>
The Bank Bali case centered on Bank Bali's transfer early in
June of some 546 billion rupiah (78 million U.S. dollars) to Pt
Era Giat Prima (EGP) as a commission for the company's services in
assisting the bank to recoup some 904 billion rupiah (129 million
dollars) in interbank claims on closed Bank Dagang Nasional
Indonesia (BDNI).
</P>
<P>
Part of the money allegedly went to finance the money politics
activities of the so-call "(President B.J.) Habibie Success Team"
which aims to secure the "re-election" of the incumbent president,
who is Golkar's presidential candidate.

LAGOS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Canada's High Commissioner to
Nigeria Ian Ferguson disclosed Friday that his country has
canceled all the debts Nigeria owed it, reported the Guardian, a
leading Nigerian Newspaper, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Canada forgave all Nigeria's debts in the 1980s and we're in
the forefront of efforts in the G-7 to get some debt relief.
Nigeria is now debt free to Canada," he said in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Canada will support the country in meeting the
recommendations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the
areas of debt management and its economy so that Nigeria can go
to the Paris Club and negotiate for debt rescheduling, Ferguson
assured.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said that a joint team of Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) and International Development Research
Center (IDRC) would soon arrive the country to discuss ways of
developing the economy and entrenching democratic transition,
human rights, rule of law, women's equality and free media.
</P>
<P>
The proposed visit would be the first by Canadian officials in
many years.

<HEADLINE> PAL, Lufthansa to Discuss Maintenance Unit Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' flag carrier
Philippine Airlines (PAL) and German carrier Lufthansa Technik Ag
will hold formal talks next month on the impending sale of the
PAL's maintenance and engineering (M&AMP;E) unit based in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa is expected to wrap up its due diligence study of the
M&AMP;E operations in September so the formal negotiation can begin,
the Philippine News Agency said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that PAL President and Chief Operating Officer
Avelino Zapanta has confirmed the upcoming talks but refused to
discuss any details.
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa has engaged the services of Asian Appraisals to
undertake the critical inventory of the M&AMP;E property equipment,
and Price Waterhouse to conduct an audit of the total business
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency said, problems may crop up because of a
possible disagreement between joint-venture partners Lufthansa
and airport services firm MacroAsia Corp.
</P>
<P>
Even before Lufthansa's due diligence audit began, industry
officials said the German aircraft maintenance firm expressed its
intention to hold the majority stake in the new joint-venture
company.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, MacroAsia management had also informed
PAL that it, too, wanted majority ownership.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, a PAL official said the company is more inclined
to a "50-50" arrangement.
</P>
<P>
He added that PAL will try to get the best terms possible and
make the negotiations "very transparent" so as not to get any
complaints from its creditors, to whom the PAL owes 2.2 billion
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Harsh Economic Climate Hits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The current harsh macro-economic
climate in Zimbabwe has hit the country's agricultural production
because of farmers' weak resource base, Minister of Lands and
Agriculture Kumbirai Kangai Friday said at the close of the
two-day Zimbabwe Farmers' Union 60th congress in south Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Kangai said the country had in the last two years experienced a
very harsh economic environment that impacted negatively on
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
"This harsh macro-economic climate is still with us and
preparations for the 1999/2000 production season are being made
under very difficult conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the harsh economic conditions would make it
difficult for farmers to invest in agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Despite these difficulties, agriculture remains the most
critical sector to the economic growth and development of the
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture has made a significant contribution to the
country's economic development and continues to play a central
role in employment, export earnings, provision of food and supply
of raw materials to the manufacturing sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
It will continue to play this major role in creating a stable
macro- economic climate through increased crop and livestock
production. To have a sustainable economic growth, Zimbabwe needs
a dynamic agricultural sector, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Kangai said there was no doubt that the potential for growth of
the agricultural sector was largely in the small holder sector.
</P>
<P>
"The small holder sector has a lot of underutilized labor
which, if given the opportunity and the necessary resources, can
revive and drive the growth of the agricultural sector," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Airways to Reduce Fares to Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Airways (CY) has
announced plans to reduce ticket fares to Greece to less than 100
Cyprus pounds (185 U.S. dollars) from next month.
</P>
<P>
CY Chairman Takis Kyriakides announced the decision Friday,
saying passengers could travel to Athens, Greek capital, all year
round on the reduced fares, the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The return fare to Athens is about 130 pounds (241 dollars).
</P>
<P>
CY's move appears to have been prompted by the government's
intention to liberalize air links between Cyprus' Larnaca and
Athens in an effort to induce more Greeks to travel Cyprus and to
help reduce fares for Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Commerce, Industry and Tourism Minister Nicos Rolandis
said earlier this week that moves towards liberalization of the
route could see fares fall to as little as 50 pounds (93 dollars)
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Full liberalization of air transport in Cyprus had not been
expected until the island's tentative European Union accession
date in 2002, giving CY time to become more competitive.
</P>
<P>
But clashes between pilots and management in June led the
government to announce plans for early liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The Larnaca-Athens route is one of only three profitable
airlines for CY. The other two are Larnaca-London and Larnaca-Tel
Aviv. Flights to the three destinations brought in a total of 9
million pounds (16.7 million dollars) last year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Official on Development of Natural Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The prospects are good for the
development of natural gas in the Philippines as an alternative
source of energy, a senior official said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Mario Tiaoqui of the Department of Energy (DOE) said
in a radio interview: "Our oil reserves are rather low. But we
have an abundant supply of natural gas."
</P>
<P>
Tiaoqui said that the government and some private firms are now
developing natural gas as a new source of energy, and expect to
start making full use of it by year 2001.
</P>
<P>
"We can start harnessing our natural gas resource in 2001. It
is now being developed, with pipelines being laid from Palawan to
Batangas (in the southwestern Philippines)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Joseph Estrada said that his administration
is developing natural gas as a major energy source to
substantially reduce the country's dependence on imported oil.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the government, which is now constructing gas
wells in Palawan, expects to start using this source of energy in
three years.
</P>
<P>
As of last year, Tiaoqui said, the country got 75 percent of
its energy production from oil.
</P>
<P>
Thus, he said, the government is working to reduce its
dependency on oil.
</P>
<P>
"By the year 2004 we expect that to go down to 25 percent," he
said, adding the Philippines by that time would be using
hydroelectric, coal and geothermal energy as well.

<HEADLINE> China Discovers Terra Cotta Horses From Western Zhou Dynasty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The recently discovered terra
cotta horses and carriages from the Jin Kingdom in Quwo County,
north China's Shanxi Province, has proved to be 600 years earlier
than those in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi, which were made in
the Qin Dynasty (221 B.C.-207 B.C.), said archeologists after
investigation and study.
</P>
<P>
Overall excavation of the relics has begun recently. And up to
now six horse-carriage pits have been unearthed, with over 100
horses and more than 50 carriages discovered. The pits,
constructed during the Western Zhou Dynasty (11th Century B.C.-
771 B.C.), have been the largest and most complete.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists said that the unearthed daily-use carriages and
chariots with various designs and of different sizes, demonstrate
the extraordinary political, economic and military strength of the
Jin Kingdom as one of the five strongest kingdoms at that time.
</P>
<P>
And they believed that the discovery will be of great help in
the study of the dynasty's politics, economic conditions and
military affairs.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: "863 Program" Promotes Development of High Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China began to launch the first
high technology research development plan, the "863 Program", in
February 1987. The program mainly involves science and technology
related to the development of the national economy and overall
national strength.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government decided to spend more than ten billion
yuan (about 1.2 billion US dollars) on the program before the year
2000 which focuses on projects of biological, space, information,
laser, automation, energy, new material technology and marine
techniques.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 years since the implementation of the project,
China has made major achievements in some key technologic fields
such as two line hybrid rice, transgenic animals and plants,
genetic engineering drugs and plants' genome pattern. These
scientific findings have promoted biological development in China.
</P>
<P>
In the field of information technology, China developed large
scale parallel computing, and new era computers with its own
intellectual property rights, and have made major developments in
optical and electronic components and parts and other relevant
fields.
</P>
<P>
The "863 Program" has helped China make breakthroughs in the
field of automation. The successful ocean tests of the 6,000-meter
autonomous underwater vehicle has shown that China has acquired
the ability to conduct deep-ocean exploration.
</P>
<P>
In the field of nuclear technology, Chinese scientists have
developed high-temperature gas-cooled reactors and other kinds of
advanced reactors.
</P>
<P>
New materials such as high-performance ceramics and resin and
compound materials have also been developed with the support of
the "863 Program".

<HEADLINE> UAE Plans to Market Dates in U.S., Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Plans are well under way in
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to market dates, one of the major
agricultural products in the desert country, in the United States
and European countries.
</P>
<P>
The output of dates this year can meet the domestic market need
and a surplus will go for processing and export to international
markets, the Khaleej Times daily reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The dates harvest season is very promising this year and we
are looking forward to entering international markets including
the United States and some European countries," said Mohammed
Suhail Al Mazroui, director of Abu Dahbi-based Mirfa Dates and
Vegetables Processing and Packing Factory.
</P>
<P>
He said marketing centers in the country had received large
quantities of dates and many more would come in the next few
days. Initial agreements and contracts to market this season's
harvest locally and internationally have been signed, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a marketing and processing plan has been
drafted by the factory which has been expanded and equipped with
hi-tech machinery. The overall production standards and the
industrial quality of the factory are now very high.
</P>
<P>
"This development has brought forth further ambitious plans to
develop local industries and replace food imports with local
products and to further export the surplus," Mazroui said.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural exports from the UAE - mainly vegetables - have
been declining recently, largely because of an increased demand
from a growing population and a consequent small surplus
availability, according to the Khaleej Times report.
</P>
<P>
Date palm trees occupy almost 50 percent of the total
cultivated area in the country, with the rest being planted with
vegetables, fruits and other crops. Dates export, however, is
very small.

which are of the world's advanced level, have greatly promoted the
economic development and scientific progress.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, the Chinese Academy of Sciences started research
in space science and technology, and has provided thousands of
high quality components and parts and new materials  with special
functions for China-made satellites, radar, remote control and
monitoring systems, and telecommunication systems.
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the 1960s, China successfully developed atomic
and hydrogen bombs. In 1970, China launched its first man-made
satellite, which provided a technological basis for future
development on satellite communication and meteorological service.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of reform and opening-up policies in
1978, China has improved its basic research and knowledge
innovation capacity by establishing a national natural science
foundation, launching major scientific projects and building state
key laboratories.
</P>
<P>
The National Committee of the Natural Science Foundation, which
was founded in 1986, has been receiving money from the government
budget each year for the basic research fund. The fund, increasing
on a year-to-year basis, stood at 780 million yuan (about 94
million US dollars) in 1997.

<P>
In the past two decades, China has spent 720 million yuan (
about 87 million US dollars) on 11 major research projects of high-
energy physics, nuclear physics, synchrotron radiation and nuclear
fusion. They include the heavy ion accelerator, the electron
positron collidor, the synchrotron radiation accelerator and the 2.
16-meter optical astronomical telescope which are developed by the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Since 1985, the CAS has founded
more than 100 national key laboratories which are open to Chinese
and foreign research organizations, and has provided them with
advanced scientific facilities.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, China has launched the
second phase of the national synchrotron radiation laboratory,
built up the Chinese earth crest monitoring system, the Large Sky
Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopy Telescope (LAMOST) and the HT-
7U Tok Mark fusion device.
</P>
<P>
During the period, basic research in China has made big
progress, with many scientific findings with the high temperature
superconductor, the mechanization of mathematics, the physical
patterns of the paddle's genome and animal fossils in Chengjiang,
south China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China is implementing the Development Program of
National Key Basic Research Projects. According to the program,
China will provide funds in the next decade to research on major
scientific problems in agriculture, energy, information, resource
and environment, population and health, material and other fields.
</P>
<P>
The first group of 15 basic research projects have already been
launched with a total investment of 170 million yuan (about 20
million US dollars) in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Trade Union Slams New Salaries for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) has condemned the182-percent salary hike for
government ministers, describing the increase as "outrageous" and
"totally unacceptable", the daily Herald reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement last night, the ZCTU Secretary-General Morgan
Tsvangirai said it was cheap politicking to compare Zimbabwe with
other countries in the region instead of considering the serious
economic crisis the country was facing.
</P>
<P>
"Dust has barely settled when civil servants were pleading for
a mere 20- percent cost of living adjustment which was met with
fierce resistance by the powers that be," Tsvangirai said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The labor movement totally condemns this appalling
insensitivity and, in the light of this shocking development, the
ZCTU will immediately engage in consultations with civil servants
and the rest of its affiliates."
</P>
<P>
The August 19 issue of The Financial Gazette reported that
government ministers had been awarded a 182-percent salary
increment backdated to July.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information, Posts and Telecommunications Chen
Chimutengwende was quoted in the local Press defending the
increases, saying Zimbabwe's Cabinet ministers were the lowest
paid in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Slum Dwellers Occupy Supreme Court Premises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of evicted slum dwellers
who entered the Supreme Court premises in central Dhaka Wednesday
night have built makeshift homes there like their demolished
shanties.
</P>
<P>
The slum people refused to leave the area until their demand of
immediate rehabilitation was met, press reports here said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 squatters, who camped in Osmany Uddyan, a park near
the Secretariat housing government ministries and agencies,
following their eviction from slums earlier this month, moved to
the court premises Wednesday evening and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The occupation of the court premises by the squatters
"embarrassed" the High Court Bench which was hearing the case of
the slum dwellers Thursday and earlier passed a stay order on
eviction until the next date of hearing.
</P>
<P>
The court bench adjourned its hearing following the
"unprecedented" move in the court area, and referred the writ
petition, filed by some non-government organizations and slum
dwellers challenging the evictions, to the Chief Justice who later
passed the matter to another bench. The hearing was adjourned till
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I've heard that the court is very sympathetic to us and I've
been asked by some other people to come here," a slum dweller was
quoted by The Independent daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Bangladesh Bastuhara Samity (BBS), an
organization for the poor homeless people, were seen organizing
the slum dwellers on the court premises, the report said. Munshi
Mohammad Ali, treasurer of the BBS, said they had come to the
Supreme Court compound following a decision by the organization.
</P>
<P>
The BBS, reportedly a front organization of the ruling
Bangladesh Awami League (BAL), has the same official address as
the BAL, The New Nation newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Thursday police turned down a request for removing the poor
people swarming in the court premises.
</P>
<P>
"We need a written order from the court, otherwise we feel it
would be in violation of the court orders to purge the former slum
people," a police official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government mounted a four-day drive to evict the slum
dwellers in the capital city earlier this month saying that the
slums had become dens of terrorists and criminals. Nearly 70,000
people were evicted from slums.
</P>
<P>
It is said there are about 2 million slum dwellers in the
Bangladeshi capital, home for some 9 million people.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Closes 18 Ports Threatened by Storm "Bret" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Mexican authorities Friday
closed 18 ports along the Gulf of Mexico to small and medium craft
navigation as the tropical storm "Bret" could strengthen into a
hurricane and hit the country's eastern coasts.
</P>
<P>
Storm Bret, carrying sustained winds at 102 kilometers per hour,
continues moving to the north of the Gulf, according to a
communique of the Communications and Transports Ministry (SCT).
</P>
<P>
The SCT said that four of the 18 ports closed are in the state
of Tamaulipas, nine in Veracruz, and five in Tabasco.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, Bret was located 293 kilometers east of
the Gulf port city of Tuxpan in the state of Veracruz, and 375
kilometers southeast of port Tampico in Tamaulipas. It had a
radius of 165 kilometers, and was moving northwards about 10
kilometers with maximum sustained winds nearing 100 kilometers per
hour.
</P>
<P>
The Civil protection authorities were on alert in the port city
of Tampico, 350 kilometers northeast of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
A hurricane warning had once been extended to as far north as
the coastal town of La Pesca, 550 kilometers north of the port
city of Veracruz.
</P>
<P>
According to the United States National Hurricane Center in
Miami, tropical storm Bret could strengthen into a hurricane by
Friday night or Saturday, and reach Mexico's eastern coasts
probably on Monday anywhere from La Pesca to Veracruz, where a
hurricane watch is in effect.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Condemns Japan-U.S. Deal on Anti-Missile System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Japan-U.S. deal on an anti-
missile system, known as the Theater Missile Defense (TMD),
undermines peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, said
the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
"Such grave developments disturbing peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region are arousing deep apprehension and high
vigilance from among the regional people," the KCNA said in a
comment issued on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese cabinet approved the TMD plan on August 13 and
signed a formal agreement and memorandum of understanding with the
United States on Monday to jointly research the anti-ballistic
missile system.
</P>
<P>
Japan has claimed that its decision to join the TMD is out of
concerns over "missile threats" from the DPRK, alleging that a man-
made satellite launched by Pyongyang on August 31 last year was a
medium-range missile.
</P>
<P>
Since June this year, the United States and Japan had sped up
their talks on the TMD on the ground that the DPRK might be
preparing to test-fire another upgraded ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
"As known to everyone, the TMD system is a system of reinvasion
to make preemptive attack and contain the DPRK and a war system to
prevail over big powers in the Asia-Pacific region," the KCNA said.
</P>
<P>
The comment said Japan's "reckless military threat" could not
work in the DPRK, as the "launch of satellite or missile is a
matter pertaining to our sovereignty" and "we will exercise this
sovereignty unhesitatingly at our own will, if necessary."

CARACAS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan basket of crude
oil prices rose by 37 U.S. cents this week to 18.20 dollars per
barrel thanks to an increase in oil demand, the Ministry of Energy
and Mines said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have increased over six dollars since March this

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Exports Shrink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan traditional exports
will shrink 30 percent by the end of the year, compared to 1998,
President of the Venezuelan Exporters Association (AVEX) Luisa
Romero said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Non-traditional exports, excluding oil and steel, will drop
from 4.7 billion dollars in 1998 to 3.4 billion dollars in 1999,
said Romero.
</P>
<P>
These kinds of exports amounted to 2.6 billion dollars between
January and June, and have dwindled about 26 percent, said Romero.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the drop in exports to a reduction in
imports by Venezuela's regional partners who are also suffering
from an economic contraction and an avalanche of surplus Asian
commodities.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Urged to Fire Top Finance Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian ruling Golkar Party
Friday urged that President B.J. Habibie dismiss Minister of
Finance Bambang Subianto and Chairman of the Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency (IBRA) Glenn S. Yusuf over the Bank Bali
scandal.
</P>
<P>
Golkar legislator Thomas Suyatno said "responsibility for
policy mistakes must be taken by policy decision-makers, which in
this case are the Ministry of Finance and the chairman of IBRA".
</P>
<P>
"(We demand) that firm measures be taken against all government
officials as well as officials from other institutions who are
directly or indirectly involved (in the case)... in the form of
dismissing them to allow a thorough investigation," he was quoted
Saturday by The Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Following Thursday's hearing session on the Bank Bali affair
with the government and Bank Indonesia, the Golkar faction at the
House of Representatives released a 13-point statement calling for
Bambang and Glen to tender their resignations.
</P>
<P>
Thomas also said that if Bank Indonesia Governor Sjahril
Sabirin was found in the future to be directly or indirectly
involved in the affair, he would also have to resign.
</P>
<P>
The United Development Party faction has urged Bambang and
Glenn resign, or be temporarily suspended, until investigation of
the matter is completed.
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's hearing session, which ran from 10 a.m. until
10 p.m. local time, most of the commission VIII legislators were
apparently pushing Bambang and Glenn to acknowledge that a mistake
had been made. But Bambang and Glenn maintained that payment of
Bank Bali's interbank claims had followed established procedures.
</P>
<P>
State Secretary/Justice Minister Muladi Friday denied reports
that Habibie had considered dismissing Bambang and Glenn.
</P>
<P>
"We'll watch the developments. The House has not yet (had its
final say)," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to The Indonesian Observer, the House is expected to
summon Habibie to provide an explanation on the bank scam.
</P>
<P>
The Bank Bali case, first revealed to the media late July,
centered on Bank Bali's transfer in early June of some 546 billion
rupiah (78 million U.S. dollars) to PT Era Giat Prima (EGP) as a
commission for the firm's "service" in assisting the bank to
recoup some 904 billion rupiah in interbank claims on closed-down
Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia (BDNI).
</P>
<P>
EGP is a company owned by businessmen Djoko Chandra and Setya
Novanto, both of whom are affiliated to the Golkar. Most of the
commission allegedly landed in the hands of Habibie's close
associates in charge of leading the team to secure his election in
the November presidential election.
</P>
<P>
A document containing the transcript of confessions made by
former Bank Bali president Rudy Ramli on the involvement of
cabinet ministers, senior government officials and business
tycoons in the scandal was circulated among legislators on August
19.
</P>
<P>
Election winner Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle said it
has hard evidence showing the direct involvement of 16 people in
the scam.
</P>
<P>
The National Mandate Party Friday urged the House to thoroughly
investigate the Bank Bali case, as it believed the scandal
involved powerful people close to the president.
</P>
<P>
The party said there were indications of efforts to scapegoat
individuals, with key players left untouched.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Police General Roesmanhadi Friday reiterated that the
police will continue its investigation of the Bank Bali scandal,
and a number of high-ranking officials will soon be summoned for
interrogation.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Central Bank's Bonds Auction Pulls Dollar Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar dropped 1.18
percent in Brazil Friday, with the purchase price of the real, the
national currency, closing at 1.91, and the selling price at 1.92,
following an auction of Central Bank (BC) bonds.
</P>
<P>
The dollar opened bullish Friday and rose to 1.98 buying and 1.
99 selling. The auction of 3 billion reals (1.56 billion dollars)
of the BC, however, pushed back the U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended the week in the Sao Paulo parallel market with
a quote of 1.97 reals to buy and 2.01 to sell.
</P>
<P>
Before the auction, the Brazilian real skidded to a five-month
low on Friday, pushed by uncertainty about deficit-cutting reforms
and flagging investor confidence in South American markets.
</P>
<P>
For Brazilians, the scramble to buy dollars was uncomfortably
reminiscent of the panic that followed the 1997 crisis in
southeast Asia and last year's turmoil in Russia. Shock waves
eventually reached Brazil, which was forced to devalue its
currency in January and plunged into a recession from which it is
now emerging.
</P>
<P>
Authorities were quick to argue that the situation now is very
different.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank President Arminio Fraga said markets had the wrong
impression the government was weakening in its resolve to enact
deficit-cutting reforms, a condition required by the International
Monetary Fund for a 41.5 billion-dollar loan last year.
</P>
<P>
"The market is nervous now," Amalia Estensorro, a Latin
American economist at BBV Latinvest in London said this week. "
International currencies are a bit wobbly in general, but
particularly in Brazil, because of the uncertainty of the fiscal
situation."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Economists Urge Govt to Improve Its Credibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A group of Indonesian noted
economists issued an "Economic Memorandum" aiming to improve the
credibility of the current government of President B.J. Habibie,
national newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the five-point declaration, they noted that under the
present government, various economic scandals had occurred in the
country, such as corruption in the distribution of social safety
net program funds, concessional credits and bank closure scandals.
</P>
<P>
Other cases were the bank recapitalization program and the
implementation of the government's program to guarantee liquidated
banks' liabilities which led to the Bank Bali scandal that had
inflicted enormous damage on the entire bank restructuring
program.
</P>
<P>
"A credible government is a must. In many cases, no matter how
good an economic policy is, it won't work if the ruling government
has no credibility," said Sri Mulyani Indrawati, the group's
spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
In their memorandum, the economists said that to improve its
credibility, the government must take concrete steps as a
reference for running the country's administration and economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
The government should also act to ensure that its policies and
economic recovery move in the right direction, remain consistent
and transparent, and eliminate potential weaknesses in the
implementation of its policies, while at all times managing the
economy based on the principle of prudence in stabilization
efforts.
</P>
<P>
It said the government is and will be facing a very heavy
fiscal burden due to, among others, bank restructuring costs and
debt repayments -- both principal and interest.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts to stimulate the economy can be conducted through the
empowerment of the private sector and the (financial) markets, as
well as through the opening of investment opportunities," it said.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum is the result of a two-day conference titled
"The Economic Issues Facing the New Government.".
</P>
<P>
Signatories to the memorandum include Marie Pangestu from the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, Anggito Abimanyu
from Gadjah Mada University and M. Chatib Basri from the
University of Indonesia.

SANTIAGO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Chile and Argentina signed a
series of accords on Friday to promote bilateral cooperation and
subregional integration.
</P>
<P>
The agreements, signed here during the official visit by
Argentine President Carlos Menem, committed the two countries to
joint efforts in fighting drug trafficking and money laundering,
and in the joint production of naval vessels.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed on scientific and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement signed by President Menem and Chilean

<HEADLINE> IRRI Comes up with Iron-and-Zinc-Rich Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines-based
International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has developed an
iron-and-zinc-rich rice, which is expected to dramatically improve
the diet of women, infants and toddlers.
</P>
<P>
The Malaya newspaper Saturday quoted IRRI project scientist
Glenn Gregorio as saying that the rice variety could cure
nutritional anemia, or "hidden hunger" in children and women.
</P>
<P>
Gregorio said that IRRI scientists developed the
iron-and-zinc-rich rice after years of research.
</P>
<P>
Nutritional anemia -- caused by low dietary intake and
bio-availability of iron, blood loss due to parasites, and
unsatisfied demand associated with rapid growth and pregnancy --
limits learning capacity during childhood, impairs immune function
and reduces labor productivity.
</P>
<P>
A World Health Organization survey shows that 3.7 billion
people in the world are iron-deficient, severe enough to cause
anemia in 2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
Gregorio said that efforts to combat malnutrition by
artificially fortifying milled rice has encouraged them to develop
improved germ plasma with enhanced iron and zinc in the grain.
</P>
<P>
Doubling or tripling iron or zinc contents in rice could
improve the health of those at risk, he said.

<HEADLINE> IOC Affirms Blood Tests for Sydney Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, Spain, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Some form of blood
testing will be introduced at next year's Sydney Olympics in the
wake of spate of high-profile drug scandals in athletics and other
sports.
</P>
<P>
In another move to step up the fight against drugs, the
International Olympic Committee determined that a world anti-
doping agency will be set up by the end of this year and will be
operational for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
The drug issue was mainly discussed in an IOC executive board
meeting on the eve of the World Athletics Championships opening
Saturday here because several performance-enhancing drugs, such as
human growth hormone and EPO (erythropoietin), can not be detected
in current standard urine tests.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to have a blood test that could be used as part of
the official doping control procedures during the Sydney Games.
The blood tests could also be implemented in out-of-competition
controls on the eve of the Sydney Games.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Is to Export 4 Mln Tons of Rice This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has already exported more
than 3 million tons of rice so far and will surely export at least
4 million tons of rice this year, Vietnam's business newspaper The
Saigon Times Daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the first 17 days of August, an official of the Vietnamese
Food Association said, Vietnam shipped some 332,000 tons of rice
abroad, bringing the total export volume this year to more than
3.1 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Export price is 3-5 U.S. dollars higher than earlier in the
month. Currently the high-grade 5 percent broken is generally
quoted at 231-232 U.S. dollars per ton FOB at Vietnam's Saigon
Port, while quotations for the low-grade 25 percent broken center
around 213 U.S. dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
More than 132,000 tons of rice was being loaded on 16 vessels
this week in the Saigon Port, with destinations including
Indonesia, Ghana, Iraq and Tanzania. Last week 14 vessels loaded
nearly 110,000 tons of rice.
</P>
<P>
Paddy price in Mekong Delta, Vietnamese biggest rice bowl, has
also risen with the selling price of the summer-autumn paddy at
1,700-1,800 Vietnamese dong (0.12 -- 0.13 U.S. dollars) per
kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the price of high-class winter-spring paddy are
staying at 2,000 Vietnamese dong (0.14 U.S. dollars) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's summer-autumn paddy yield could amount to 7.3 million
tons, some 900,000 tons higher than expected, according to an
official of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has already contracted to ship 3.7 million tons of rice
so far this year, said the official, adding that the country would
surely export at least four million tons overall.

Schumacher made a stunning return to the track, beating his
teammate Eddie Irvine's best time in the previous day.
</P>
<P>
According to the Italian news agency Ansa, Schumacher, shortly
after his helicopter landed on the track, slipped into his Formula
1 car and clocked a lap in 1.28.732, bettering Irvine's best time
the previous day.
</P>
<P>
After lunch, he improved on his time by clocking in at 1.28.72,
and shortly afterwards raced a lap in 1.28.70, this time shedding
a fraction of a second off his substitute, Mika Salo's best time
in Thursday's practice runs.
</P>
<P>
Marking his return after an accident forty days ago that left
him with a broken leg, the double world champion got a hero's
welcome from his team of mechanics, and even received the visit of
Umberto Agnelli, brother of Fiat's honor boss Gianni Agnelli, who
watched several of his test runs.
</P>
<P>
"I was happy about the team's welcome, and it was nice to see
my friends again," Umberto said, adding "It was like coming home
after too long a holiday."
</P>
<P>
Schumacher's doctor was also on hand, to check that "no
problems surfaced," according to the Ferrari team's spokesman,
Claudio Berro, who added that "everything is going to plan."
</P>
<P>
But, in spite of his surprising performance Friday, the
consequences of Schumacher's accident were still evident as he
limped round the paddock.
</P>
<P>
Chances of his return at next week's Belgian Grand Prix at Spa,
on August 29, remained limited; a return at the Italian Grand Prix
at Monza, on September 12, is seen as a virtual certainty.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher was visibly raring to drive, after doctors Thursrday
gave him the green light to get back behind the wheel of a Formula
1 car.
</P>
<P>
"I'll see how fit I am in the next few days, and after another
medical check-up, I'll decide with the team whether I can come
back at Monza or before," he said.

<HEADLINE> Seville Opens World Championships with 2008 Olympics on Its Mind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, Spain, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Filling the Olympic
stadium that was completed three months ago, some 2,000 athletes
from a record 204 countries and regions joined on Friday for the
World Athletics Championships opening ceremony -- a spectacle
intended to show the history and future of the ancient city.
</P>
<P>
"A few years ago it seemed like a dream and now, as of today,
it has come true," said Calos Herrera, mayor of Seville.
</P>
<P>
The mayor added: "They say that Seville '99 is the last great
sports event of the 20th century. I prefer to think that these
World Championships in Seville will be the first of the new
Millennium."
</P>
<P>
The World Championships, which will run until August 29, was
regarded as the third sports gala in the world, only next to the
Olympic Games and the World Cup football tournament.
</P>
<P>
Athletes entered the stadium behind the flags of their nations -
-the most ever at a major international sporting competition,
organizers said. The colors of the flags were in sharp contrast to
the white cloth which covered the seats of the guests, athletes
and coaches on the field.
</P>
<P>
Primo Nebiolo, head of the International Amateur Athletics
Federation, spoke high of Seville's efforts in preparing for the
championships.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Seville unites 204 countries and regions from around
the world. Your dreams, your sacrifices, your hard work and
dedication have made it possible to welcome more athletes here
than in any previous single athletics event ever."
</P>
<P>
After the IAAF's flag appears carried by athletes and is
hoisted to the top of the stadium, his Royal Highness Prince
Felipe of Borbon declared the World Championships open.
</P>
<P>
The world championships was also part of Seville's efforts to
bid for the 2008 summer Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
But the Spanish city, which lost the bidding campaign for the
2004 Games, faces fierce challenge from other candidates including
Beijing, Istanbul, Toronto, Paris and Osaka with Beijing
considered the favorite. At least four other cities are weighing a
bid.
</P>
<P>
Seville also hosted the Expo '92 universal fair -- one of the
highlights of Spain's 500th anniversary celebration of Columbus'
journey to America.
</P>
<P>
The competition will start on Saturday with three gold medals
to be decided in the women's pole vault, men's 20 kilometers walk
and men's shot put.
