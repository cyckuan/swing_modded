<HEADLINE> Sudanese Government Hopes to Bridge Gap With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman Ismail Wednesday expressed hope that the coming round of
talks with the opposition Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA)
would help bridge their gap.
</P>
<P>
The fresh round of talks between the SPLA, the leading rebel
faction in southern Sudan, and the government will be held in
Kenyan capital Nairobi next month, Ismail told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of the planned talks despite the
failed previous negotiations in Nairobi and Addis Ababa due to the
insistence of SPLA leader John Garang on carving up south Sudan to
establish a confederation which the government opposes strongly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Presidential Adviser for Peace Nafe' Ali Nafe' said
the government prefers dialog to establish peace with the
northern opposition forces and the south's SPLA as well.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing fighting in south Sudan was mainly caused by
Garang's intransigence, he said, adding that the signing of a
peace accord with the SPLA would establish peace in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA waged a separatist war against the Sudanese government
in 1983.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Chief Appeals to Combat Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Klaus Toepfer, Executive Director
of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has appealed for
the global efforts to combat desertification and drought for the
lives of the people inhabiting the world's dry lands
</P>
<P>
In his message released here Wednesday to mark the World Day to
Combat Desertification, which is observed annually on June 17, he
said the day serves to strengthen the global effort to face the
challenges of desertification in all the regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that UNEP's environmental concerns are in broad terms
such as ozone depletion, extinction of biodiversity, climate
change and loss of soil fertility.
</P>
<P>
These environmental issues touch the lives of millions of
people around the world, and impact disproportionately on the
poor and the vulnerable, he said.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer pointed out that the degradation of a particular
rangeland or soil erosion on farmland or the progressive
shortening of fallow, directly affects the poor because they are
directly related to household food security.
</P>
<P>
In their quest for food security, Toepfer said, the poor
inhabiting the ecologically fragile dry lands have to overuse the
limited resources available to them. As a result, environmental
degradation imposes further constraints on their livelihood in a
"vicious circle".
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the effects of desertification are
manifested socially. Land degradation directly affects the poor
who are not involved in decision-making and planning which
influence their lives.
</P>
<P>
Prevention and control of desertification requires much more
than money, he said, adding the science and technology are
fundamental to an improved management of the dry lands.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the Convention to Combat Desertification is the
first international treaty to squarely address poverty and
environmental degradation in rural areas, with the aim to benefit
the hundreds of millions of predominantly poor and food-insecure
people.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer pledged that UNEP would continue to work toward
strengthening the implementation of the convention and reinforce
partnerships with other U.N. agencies, community organizations
and even individuals worldwide to fight the menace of
desertification.

<HEADLINE> One Third of World Refugees in Africa: UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said Wednesday that as of
January 1999, there were 6.5 million people of concern to it in
Africa, out of an estimated 21.1 million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
In its June issue of "Africa fact Sheet", the UNHCR said the
Africa figure includes 3.3 million refugees, 2.1 million
internally displaced and 1.1 million former refugees who have
recently returned home.
</P>
<P>
In January 1998, the global number of people concerning to
UNHCR was 22. 3 million, of whom 7.2 million were in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR announced that the top five African refugee countries
of origin are Sierra Leone, with 410,900, Somalia, with 401,300,
Sudan, with 372,900, Eritrea, with 342,300 and Burundi with
299,400.
</P>
<P>
It also announced that the top four refugee-hosting countries
in Africa are Guinea , Sudan, Tanzania and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
However, UNHCR said the above figures do not include 200,000
Burundians who have been in Tanzania since 1970's and who are not
assisted by the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said among the 10 largest refugees return movements
in 1998, seven were related to African countries. These were:
235,700 returned to Liberia; 193,800 to Sierra Leone; 62,400 to
the Democratic Republic of Congo; Somalia with 48,100 returnees,
Mali with 27,000, Burundi with 23,600 and Angola, with 21,800.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reclaims Sovereignty over Disputed Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Wednesday reaffirmed its
sovereignty over the three islands in the Persian Gulf in a
response to the call of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for a
peaceful solution to their dispute over the islands.
</P>
<P>
"The legal status of the three Iranian islands, Abu Musa, the
Greater and Lesser Tunbs are clearly transparent and there exist
no legal ambiguity in this regard," Iranian Majlis (parliament)
Vice Speaker Hassan Rowhani said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), he said
the islands have belonged to Iran throughout the history and
for sometime the Britons occupied these Iranian islands and
then they returned them to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the three islands at the mouth of the strategic
Hormoz Strait in 1971 soon after the British colonist forces
withdrew from the region.
</P>
<P>
However, both Tehran and Abu Dhabi claimed sovereignty over
the islands and relations between the two countries have been
sour in recent years over the issue.
</P>
<P>
At the founding conference of the Parliamentary Union of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) which opened here on
Tuesday, IRNA said, the UAE representative called on Iranian
officials to solve the issue "through cordial negotiation or
through international legal bodies."
</P>
<P>
Rowhani, also secretary of the Iranian Supreme National
Security Council, said the history shows that the UAE has nothing
to do with the islands.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the seriousness of the UAE threat to quit the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC), Rowhani said that "this does not show
the UAE bounds and that the bounds of maneuverability is too
limited in nature."
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that the UAE has warned to withdraw from the
GCC in a protest to the recent warm-up of relations between Iran
and other GCC members without safeguarding the UAE's interests.
</P>
<P>
Iran and its Gulf neighbors, particularly Saudi Arabia,
entered a new era of their relations after Iran's moderate
President Mohammad Khatami initiated a detente policy with the
rest of the world in 1997.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports AIDS Control in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- India will embark on the second
phase of its fight against HIV/AIDS with the help of an
International Development Association (IDA) credit totaling 191
million U.S. dollars approved by the World Bank, the bank
announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Second National HIV/AIDS Control Project will provide
further momentum to the country's ongoing program to reduce the
rate of growth of the HIV infection and strengthen the country's
capacity to respond to the epidemic, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 18 months, the Indian government has dramatically
increased the scope of its HIV/AIDS control activities by adopting
a new National Policy Document; engaging public, private, and
voluntary sectors in the preparation of plans; moving
implementation of services to states and municipal corporations;
and completing a baseline survey of HIV prevalence.
</P>
<P>
According to the National AIDS Control Organization, India has
more than 4 million HIV-infected people. By early in the next
century, India will have the highest number of AIDS cases in the
world. Even if HIV infection reaches a "low" level of five percent
seen in many other countries, more than 37 million Indians would
be HIV infected.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank said that global experience with HIV/AIDS and
other sexually transmitted infections (STI) demonstrates that the
most effective strategy to prevent an epidemic is to intervene
quickly among the groups at high risk for contracting and
spreading HIV.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the most important component of the project focuses
on high risk groups -- commercial sex workers, truck drivers,
migrant laborers, men having sex with men, and injecting drug
users -- by providing peer counseling, condon promotion, treatment
of STIs, and client programs.
</P>
<P>
The total costs of the project are 229 million dollars to which
the Indian government will contribute 38.8 million dollars. The
interest-free IDA credit is provided on standard IDA terms with 35
years to maturity and 10 years grace.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Serious About Peacemaking: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak will meet in Washington in December to prepare for the
final status talks between the Palestinians and Israel, a top
Palestinian official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians "are serious about peacemaking" and hope to
make progress in the peace talks with the Israelis, Palestinian
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Shaath
told Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinians' priority is to "achieve tangible
progress in negotiations (with Israel) that will lead to declaring
an independent Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
Shaath said the Palestinian National Authority "will pursue
contacts with the United States, European Union states and other
friendly countries" for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Shaath arrived in Cairo on Sunday to take part in a two-day
United Nations conference on maintaining rights for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Palestinians did have plans to declare a
state in case the hard-line Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu won last month's elections.
</P>
<P>
Had Netanyahu won, "a Palestinian state would have been
declared immediately," MENA quoted Shaath as saying.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was defeated by the moderate Labor Party leader Ehud
Barak in the May 17 Israeli elections. Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat postponed plans to declare statehood last month to avoid
influencing the elections.
</P>
<P>
Barak has said he will make the resumption of peace talks with
the Palestinians a top priority, following three years of deadlock
under his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
Shaath called on Barak to show goodwill and earnestness,
implement the Wye interim peace accord, halt settlement activities
and judaization of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians will not give up anything for nothing," he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Injured in U.S. Warplanes Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 16 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi civilian was injured on
Wednesday in U.S. and British warplanes' attacks on civilian
facilities in southern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman
announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying
that at 16:30 (1230 GMT), 23 formations of enemy warplanes coming
from Saudi and Kuwaiti airspace violated southern Iraqi airspace
over Thi-Qar, Basra, Misan, Qadisiya and Najaf provinces.
</P>
<P>
The enemy planes bombed civilian facilities in the region,
injuring one civilian, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraqi air defenses fired back and forced
the enemy planes to flee to their bases in Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Ten formations coming from Turkish air space violated Iraqi
airspace at 10:42 (0642 GMT) over Dohuk, Erbil and Neineva
provinces, said the spokesman, adding that Iraqi anti-aircraft
units repulsed the enemy planes.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched airstrikes against Iraq
last December, their warplanes have made 1,639 sorties over the
so-called northern no-fly zone and 6,847 sorties over the
so-called southern no-fly zone, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in
Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims from
possible attacks by the Iraqi troops.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's four-night bombardment of Iraqi targets,
U.S. and British warplanes have been regularly attacking Iraqi
civilian and military targets, causing severe civilian casualties
and property damages.

KUWAIT CITY, June 16 (Xinhua) -- An independent committee to
manage a power grid linkage project among the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) member state was set up Wednesday in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Five states of the six-member GCC, namely, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirate (UAE) and Bahrain, signed
an agreement to this effect Wednesday after a one-day electricity
ministerial meeting, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Oman is the only exception due to its local technical
reasons. Muscat said it has yet to finish the linkage of its own
power networks.
</P>
<P>
The proposed authority, which will be based in eastern Saudi
region, will manage and supervise the link-up project approved by
GCC leaders during their 1997 summit in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The project, designed to exchange the reserves of energy
available in the Gulf, was estimated to cost 1.1 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to a related agreement reached by GCC electricity
ministers last March, each member state should pay 5 percent of
its share in the first phase of the project. But it didn't mention
the specific amount each state should pay.
</P>
<P>
The first stage involves Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi
Arabia, and the second covers Oman and the UAE.

PARIS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- France closed on Wednesday its
strategic nuclear missile base on the Plateau of Albion in the
southeast part of the country, which served as one of France's
nuclear deterrence bases from 1971 till 1996, Agence France-Presse
quoted military sources as saying.

The 800 sq-km large base, called Base 200, came into operation

missiles officially targeted at the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear missiles were dismantled on September 16, 1996, and
all the nuclear materials were removed from the base last year.
</P>
<P>
The work of completely closing the base, including the
re-settlement of the thousands of civil and military personnel at
the base, has more than three years.

<P>
Atacanli stressed that the efforts of the G-8 contradicted the

and his Cyprus envoys.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the June 10 statement of the G-8s will not bring
about any acceleration in the solution process and it contains
contradictions within itself."
</P>
<P>
The G-8s do not have the authority to call on the two sides to
restart dialog, Atacanli pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He added that the proposal of Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktas for the establishment of a confederation has the full
support of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"Any talks in Cyprus can be held only between the two
sovereign states. There cannot be any talks between communities,"
Atacanli said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.

MAPUTO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A southern African conference on
the prevention and fight against AIDS Wednesday called on all
African countries to map out plans to reduce the incidents of the
deadly disease among them.
</P>
<P>
A document issued at the end of the three-day conference here
suggested actions be taken by African countries to cut one fourth
of the HIV infected cases among youths between 15 and 24 years
before 2005, in most highly infectious African countries.
</P>
<P>
The document also urged countries on the continent to make sure
that at least 90 percent of the youths in this age group know how
to prevent themselves from contracting AIDS and that half of the
HIV-positive pregnant women get access to medical examination,
consultation and treatment.
</P>
<P>
Joint action and coordination were also urged at the meeting in
order to wage a more effective campaign against AIDS in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The annual expenditure in fighting against AIDS in Africa
should be doubled to reach 300 million U.S. dollars next year,
from the present 150 million, the document said.
</P>
<P>
There are over 20 million AIDs patients in Africa, while two
million died of the disease last year, with half a million being

Antiquities Council, was quoted by the news agency as saying the
tomb is believed to belong to the nobility of the Second Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
It has two halls, Gaballah said, adding that there are two
burial chambers on either side of one hall and six chambers along
the other.
</P>
<P>
The joint team also discovered a deep hole carved in the rock,
which was probably designed as a burial place, with large numbers
of broken pottery pieces and a small headless clay statue of a man
with his hands tied behind his back, believed to be a captive.
</P>
<P>
The team further found in the same area a raised platform of
adobe bedecked on its outer wall with figurative designs and
believed to have been used for storing utensils and pottery pieces.
</P>
<P>
Human skeletons and the remains of a clay coffin were also
discovered nearby.

LONDON June 16 (Xinhua) - European stock markets moved higher

turned out to be lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
Britain's benchmark FTSE 100 advanced 0.8 percent, or 53.7
points, to 6504.9 on the strength of a triple-digit surge in the
Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
The good inflation figures helped boost the financial sector,
led by Barclays, which announced that its business had got off to
a good start in 1999. The bank sector accounted for 32 points of
the blue chip advance.
</P>
<P>
Railtrack climbed 7.1 percent, and was the top gainer among

<HEADLINE> Minister Warns of Humanitarian Catastrophe in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Emergency Situations
Minister Sergei Shoigu said Wednesday that Yugoslavia might soon
face a widespread humanitarian catastrophe with the high
concentration of refugees and increasingly hot weather.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who returned to Moscow from a trip to Belgrade,
said water purification and supply system has been virtually
destroyed in NATO bombings, which may lead to epidemics.
</P>
<P>
Shoigu said that 700,000 refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina
in Yugoslavia have been joined by some 50,000 people from Kosovo,
adding that he saw a column of refugees from Kosovo 30 kilometers
long.
</P>
<P>
"They were not only Serbs but also Romanians, Gypsies and
members of other ethnic groups," the Interfax news agency quoted
the minister as saying in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Shoigu said, lack of fuel could well result in the
loss of this year's harvest.
</P>
<P>
With the power system destroyed in the NATO air attacks, many
hospitals and other social services and institutions cannot
function properly.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Yugoslavia has only a few months to restore
its power system and oil refineries before cold weather sets in.

<HEADLINE> Iran Backs Lebanese Resistance Against Israel: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said Wednesday that his forthcoming visit to Lebanon is
aimed at supporting the Lebanese resistance against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Iran supports those who resist Israel's expansionist policies,
Kharrazi said on the eve of his five-day visit to Lebanon and
Jordan, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Terming Lebanon as a country on the forefront of struggle
against Israel, he said the resistance of the Lebanese people
against Israel is a source of pride for Muslims and has brought
unity and solidarity among various Lebanese ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iranian-back Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since been
spearheading a guerrilla war to oust the Israeli occupation troops
and their allied South Lebanon Army out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister stressed that the Middle East region is
one of the sensitive areas in the world, to which Iran's foreign
policy gives top priority.
</P>
<P>
On his visit to Jordan, Kharrazi said that his trip is
regarded as a reciprocal response to a recent visit to Iran by
the Jordanian foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that his talks with Jordanian officials will cover
bilateral ties and other matters of mutual interests.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the visit will lead to further
promotion and consolidation of Iran-Jordan relations.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM: Efforts to Be Made for Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said here Wednesday that necessary efforts will be made for
reconstruction of Kosovo and safe return of refugees to the
Yugoslav province if the problem of security is solved.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that there is no plan yet on the return of Kosovar
refugees to their homes, adding that one can't consider the war
to be completely finished.
</P>
<P>
The prior target of the civilized world is to heal the wounds
in Kosovo as soon as possible, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "for this, one has to launch efforts for
the reconstruction of Kosovo. Turkey will do what is necessary
regarding this issue."
</P>
<P>
"Turkey played a very constructive and humanitarian role in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and she continues to play," Ecevit said,
adding that "Ankara will do the same in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization involved in the bloc's air attacks on
Yugoslavia, was shut out of the Kosovo peace process because of
Russian objections.
</P>
<P>
Local Milliyet (National) Daily Wednesday quoted Ecevit as
saying that "Turkey can not be excluded in shaping the future of
Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 Turkish troops were scheduled to be deployed in
the sector of Kosovo allocated to the U.S. surveillance.
</P>
<P>
However, the Turkish prime minister said that the departure
date of the Turkish troops is not clear.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder: Cologne Summit Should Give World Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 16 (Xinhua)--The upcoming Cologne summit of the
seven industrial nations (G-7) will give the world economy a clear
signal for a new booming stage, German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder told his parliament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech entitled "Design the Globalization Together",
Schroeder expected a world economy growth rate of 3.4 per cent in
next year as a consequence of the summit.
</P>
<P>
State or government chiefs of Britain, France, Italy, Canada,
Japan and the United States are expected to attend the summit
chaired by Schroeder from June 18 to 20.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Jeltsin is due to arrive in Cologne on
Sunday. And he will meet with the G-7 leaders separately under the
Group of Eight(G-8), namely the G-7 plus Russia.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder set four "equally important strategic goals" that
must be achieved in the age of globalization, including economic
competitiveness, social equity, environmental endurability, and
constitutional democracy.
</P>
<P>
"These four goals will make up the magic square of the
modernization in the next century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Amid the current weakness of European economy, Schroeder
foresaw a revival in next year, saying a better interest rate
policy of the Eurolands would help pushing their economy at a
growth rate of 2.9 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor's optimism was ironically criticized by the
opposition leaders, who said Schroeder had done little to solve
Germany's unemployment since he governed the country.
</P>
<P>
"That... is something like The New Clothe for The Emperor,"
commented Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the main opposition
Christian Democratic Union (CDU).

<HEADLINE> EU to Offer Angola 10 Million Euro in Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union representative
in Angola, Cons des Rueal, announced here Wednesday that the EU
Commission decided to offer Angola 10 million euro (about 11
million U.S. dollars) in emergency humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
The aid will be used to "cover the Angolan people's urgent
needs," and the priority will be given to the war refugees and to
provide them with basic food, health products and medicines, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The EU representative noted that due to lack of security, the
current aid could only benefit the residents in "accessible"
regions. Besides, he added, the cost of humanitarian actions will
be increased remarkably since most resources will be airlifted.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Angolan government indicate that the number
of refugees in the country has reached 1.7 million since the
civil war was renewed in the southern African country at the end
of last year.
</P>
<P>
In central Angola's Huambo and Bie provinces where fighting
between the government army and the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola is the most fierce, many cities have
been besieged, leaving the residents there to fend for themselves
with not even the basic livelihood secured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the Angola News Agency, Portuguese
ambassador in Luanda announced here Wednesday that his government
will donate 500 tons of rice (which is worth of 300,000 U.S.
dollars) to Angola, its former colony, to aid the refugees in
central Angola's Benguela, Huambo, and Kwanza-sul provinces.

<HEADLINE> First Shipment of Saudi Foodstuff Reaches Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The first shipment of foodstuff
from Saudi Arabia under the oil-for-food program has arrived in Um
Qasr Port in the southern Iraqi province of Basra, an official
source at the Iraqi Trade Ministry said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The total value of contracts Iraq has signed with Saudi
companies for the purchase of foodstuff, prerequisites of
agricultural production and some oil equipment reaches 150 million
U.S. dollars, the unnamed source was quoted by the Iraqi News
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sixth phase of the oil-for-food program, which came into
force on May 25, allows Iraq to export 5.2 billion dollars worth
of oil in six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-Saudi relations have been cool since the 1991 Gulf
War touched off by Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the Saudi government of providing
logistic support to U.S. and British warplanes taking off from
its bases and patrolling a no-fly zone over southern Iraqi
airspace and thus making it a key partner in aggression against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the southern no-fly zone
in Iraq in 1992 with a claimed aim of protecting the Shiite
Muslims there from any possible attacks by the Iraqi troops.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-night airstrikes
against Iraq last December, their warplanes taking off from
Saudi, Kuwaiti and Turkish bases have been regularly attacking
Iraqi targets.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Appoint Commission to Monitor East Timor Ballot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said on Wednesday that he would soon appoint an independent
electoral commission to monitor the East Timor ballot
ascertaining its future.
</P>
<P>
In a video-message to the people of East Timor, Annan said the
commission "will be the final authority on electoral justice and
will ensure the transparency and impartiality of all procedures
and decisions".
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with an area of nearly 19,000 square kilometers and
a population of 800,000, is defined by the U.N. General Assembly
as one of the 17 non-self-governing territories remaining in the
world.
</P>
<P>
It had been a Portuguese colony until 1975 when Indonesia
occupied it following an internal rift. Jakarta annexed it in 1976
and since then the U.N. has been trying to find a solution to the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Indonesia and Portugal under the U.N. mediation
resulted in an agreement on May 5 this year that a direct ballot
be held on August 8 to determine whether East Timorese will choose
special autonomy or independence.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General was charged by the agreement with
setting up a U.N. mission to organize and conduct the ballot.
Annan said the mission will comprise some 900 international
personnel.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Annan said the U.N. is neither for or against
any result and that the ballot is not about winning or losing a
competition, rather a chance for the East Timorese to settle the
question peacefully and an opportunity to launch a new era of
reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Deri's Exit Paves Way for Shas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua)-- The Council of Torah Sages of
Shas, one of Israel's major political parties, on Wednesday
announced its painful decision to accept Aryeh Deri's resignation
as head of the party.
</P>
<P>
The four-member council headed by Shas spiritual leader Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef also announced that the council will not appoint
a new party leader until Deri's case is settled by the High
Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Deri's resignation will surely produce
repercussions across the country's political spectrum as it has
not only paved the way for Shas to join an emerging coalition to
be headed by Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak, but also has made it
possible for Barak to shape the coalition into a broad-based one.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the country's proportional direct election law, 15
political parties have been elected into the current 15th Knesset
(parliament) during the elections, causing tremendous trouble for
Barak to form the coalition as they have raised so many demands.
</P>
<P>
Shas won 17 Knesset seats in the elections and turned out to be
the third largest party just behind Barak's One Israel and the
Likud headed by the outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. But One Israel's sister party Meretz, which helped
Barak win the elections, refused to accept Shas to join the
coalition, citing Deri's fraud and bribe-taking acts in the past.
</P>
<P>
After Deri's resignation, there will be no reason for
Meretz to continue opposing Shas's inclusion into the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Apparently delighted by Deri's resignation, Barak announced
Tuesday night to halt the coalition talks for 24 hours, giving
Shas more time to settle the Deri case and decide whether to join
the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said, Deri's resignation has pushed Barak onto and
advantageous position.
</P>
<P>
With Shas's 17 Knesset seats in hand, Barak has nothing to
worry about the unreasonable demands raised by some other small
parties. This could help him speed up the coalition talks and
form the new government at an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, based on the progress in the coalition talks, Barak
is set to form a broad-based coalition which occupy over 70
Knesset seats, enough to maintain the government's stability.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, Shas is an orthodox religious party in Israel, but
it adopts a moderate policy in handling with political affairs.
Shas's inclusion into the coalition will help One Israel to
formulate policies concerning peace talks and move the Middle
East peace process forward more easily.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Government Urged to Investigate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A total of 24 Lebanese lawmakers
Wednesday urged the government to conduct an inquiry to determine
the identity of the mastermind behind the scathing diatribe
against former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri through the official
National News Agency (NNA).
</P>
<P>
Deputy Hussein Yatim submitted the request which was signed by
24 deputies, most of them from the two parliamentary blocks of
Hariri and another leading opposition leader Walid Jumblatt.
</P>
<P>
They asked the government of Salim Hoss to answer who in deed
launched the smear campaign, a move decried by politicians as a
blow to the transparency preached by the current administration.
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday night, a two-page statement was faxed to leading
news organizations in the country from unknown sources and
published in the late edition of the NNA.
</P>
<P>
The statement accused Hariri of seeking to undermine Lebanon's
political and economic stability, sabotaging Lebanon's alliance
with Syria in the U.S.-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace talks, and of
having an "overlap of interests" with the assassins who killed
four judges in his hometown of Sidon last week.
</P>
<P>
The accusations, attributed to "government sources," also
lambasted Hariri's domestic conduct, claiming that his
high-profile appearance at the Luciano Pavarotti concert Saturday,
and an ensuing stroll with his family through the Flea Market in
downtown Beirut, displayed insensitivity toward the slain judges.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous charges caused sharp reaction and uproar across
the country's political spectrum. Many politicians think it is a
non-democratic, impermissible and unacceptable practice in the
state of law to wage attack on ex-premier through the independent
state-run media.
</P>
<P>
Hoss, Hariri's long time political foe, was quick to deny he
was involved in the anonymous statement, saying that is not his
style, while Harri remained tight-lipped on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The tirade broke a three-month ceasefire brokered by Syria
between the former prime minister and the current regime of
President Emile Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon with 35,000 troops
stationed across the country as peacekeepers to prevent the
rekindling of the 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Press reports predicted that Syria was expected to step in
soon to reconcile the Lahoud-Hoss dyarchy with Hariri
again.

ADDIS ABABA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A total of 900 Somali refugees
have been repatriated Wednesday from eastern Ethiopia to northwest
Somalia, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua here, UNHCR Addis Ababa office
press official Mahary Michow said this was the second batch of
repatriated Somali refugees since their repatriation from eastern
Ethiopia to northwest Somalia restarted on Monday or June 14,
1999.
</P>
<P>
Mahary said 689 Somali refugees went home on that date alone.
</P>
<P>
He said the 1999 operation began from Hartisheik camp in
northeast Ethiopia where 10,000 Somali refugees are expected to be
repatriated, adding that following is another 10,000 Somalis in
six other sites.
</P>
<P>
There will be three movements per week -- on Monday, Wednesday
and Saturday, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation operation was agreed in March this year
between UNHCR and officials in northwestern Somalia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Almost 60,000 Somali refugees had gone home from camps in
Ethiopia from late 1997 to November 1998.

Ivanov said on Wednesday that the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)
should be disarmed "as soon as possible".
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival here, Ivanov told reporters that "the KLA must

Defense Secretary William Cohen have started their talks on
Wednesday to solve a dispute between the two countries over Russia
's peacekeeping role in the war-battered Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, Sergeyev told reporters that all differences
over Russia's advance troops in Kosovo had been eliminated in the
negotiations between Russian and NATO officers and it was
unnecessary for the West to be worried over the presence of the
Russian troops in Pristina, capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Cohen has declared in Washington that the talks on options for
Russia's part in Kosovo peacekeeping had made much headway and the
United States would study the options in line with the two basic
principles: a unified command and no separate sector for Russia.

<HEADLINE> Gore Formally Declares for Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
formally kicked off his campaign for president Wednesday in his
home state of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to a hometown crowd of about 3,000 people, Gore
promised moral leadership to solve "the crisis in the American
family."
</P>
<P>
"With your help, I will take my own values and faith and family
to the presidency -- to build an America that is not only better
off, but better," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And that is why today, I announce that I am a candidate for
the president of the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
Using phrases like "moral leadership" and "values and faith and
family," Gore appears to be distancing himself from Clinton's
character questions to show he can stand on his own as a
presidential figure, political observers said.
</P>
<P>
"Seven years ago, we needed to put America back to work, and we
did," the vice president said. "Now we must build on that
foundation. We must make family life work in America."
</P>
<P>
"The crisis in the American family today knows no boundary of
class or race," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
Gore is only facing challenge from former New Jersey Senator
Bill Bradly for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination,
but his campaign seemed to start in the shadow of Texas Governor
George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner who leads in polls for
months.
</P>
<P>
But Gore said polls taken so far before the November 2000
presidential election were meaningless. He said "instead of 18
months before the election maybe 18 days" is when people should
pay attention to polls.
</P>
<P>
Gore, 51, a Vietnam veteran, is running for U.S. president for
the second time. He is a former journalist, House member and U.S.
Senator.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz Wednesday announced a cabinet reshuffle, the second
one in nearly 25 years, with no changes in key ministries.
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, who has been in
charge of the day-to-day affairs of the kingdom since his
ailing half brother King Fahd suffered a stroke in 1995,
retained his post as deputy prime minister and chief of the
national guards.
</P>
<P>
Former foreign, defense and interior ministers, all senior
princes of the ruling Al-Saud family, also remained in their
offices in the newly-formed 23-member cabinet, the Kuwait News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
There has been no change either in the oil and finance
ministries, also two-key portfolios in the world's largest oil
producing and exporting country.
</P>
<P>
Those who lost their posts in the new cabinet are former
Minister of Islamic Endowments Abdullah al-Turki and Minister of
Pilgrimage Affairs Mahmoud Safar. They are replaced by Saleh
Abdul-Aziz Al-Sheikh and Iyad Ibn Amin Yemeni respectively.
</P>
<P>
Khalid Al-Qosaibi took over as planning minister, while
former Labor and Social Affairs Minister Musaid Al-Sanani left
in favor of Ali Al-Namla.
</P>
<P>

Institution, took the portfolio of the newly-established Civil
Service Ministry.

<HEADLINE> China's Puts Its Insurance Market In Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Remarkable achievements have been
realized in China's efforts to put its insurance market in order
since the beginning of the year, according to Ma Yongwei vice-
chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC).
</P>
<P>
In a press release here today, Ma said the watchdog's
strengthened supervision over the market's behavior and risk
management of insurers has led to the healthy development of the
sector.
</P>
<P>
According to CIRC figures, the sector recorded a total premium
income of 52.9 billion yuan in the first five months of the year,
up 7.79 percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
This includes a premium income of 31.28 billion yuan from life
insurance and 21.62 billion yuan from property insurance, up 11.07
percent and 3.06 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The insurers paid out 17.29 billion yuan in indemnities, a rise
of 0.34 percent over the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to properly control the market, the CIRC has
introduced unified policies for vehicle and aviation accident
insurance, hence preventing the misuse of fake policies and unfair
competition by kick-backs and the expansion of liabilities.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC also launched a crackdown on illegal brokerage
activities, including suspending the British-funded Sedgwick
Insurance &AMP; Risk Management Consultants (China) Limited for
unlicensed brokerage business.
</P>
<P>
The release said most of the representative offices of foreign
insurance companies in China have now stopped their brokerage
business activities.
</P>
<P>
The watchdog also stepped up its annual inspection and
supervision of the daily activities of insurance firms, including
their business expansion, management and existing financial
situation.
</P>
<P>
A number of companies found to have been practicing improper
activities were duly punished. Among them are local branches of
the China Pacific Insurance company and the Huatai insurance firm
and the People's Insurance Corporation of China.
</P>
<P>
To provide a solid base for the rule of law in the insurance
market, the CIRC has issued a number of regulations concerning the
operation of the watchdog itself, set down the required
qualifications for senior managers of insurance firms and rules
for the administration of overseas-funded insurance firms.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yongwei noted that though there has been a remarkable
improvement more has to be done in the remaining months of the
year, particularly in the supervision of the market by the
watchdog and the prevention of risks.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Forces Not Crossed into Indian-Held Kashmir: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz
said here Wednesday that Pakistani forces have not crossed into
India-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Kashmiris are struggling for their right of self-determination,
Aziz told the media while commenting on U.S. President Bill
Clinton's demand for the withdrawal of Pakistani forces from
Kargil on the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Media reports here said Wednesday that Clinton, in his
telephonic talks Tuesday night with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,
asked Pakistan to withdraw the Kashmiri militants and its troops
from India-held Kashmir to defuse the tension on LoC.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Kashmiri freedom fighters are not in Pakistan's
control and Pakistan could not impose its decisions on them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistan's army spokesman Brig. Rashid Qureshi told
the press that Pakistan is closely monitoring movement of the
Indian troops along the LoC.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation on LoC, he said Indian troops
continue to shell areas on Pakistan's side of the LoC and
Pakistani troops retaliate strongly.
</P>
<P>
Indian artillery shells fell four to five kilometers deep into
the Pakistani side of the LoC. However, there was no damage or
casualties, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF to Rehabilitate Street Children, Mothers in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) has launched a three-year program to rehabilitate
165,000 street children and mothers in six towns of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Herald Wednesday quoted the Ministry of Economic
Development and Cooperation as saying that a sum of 13.5 million
dollars is required for the rehabilitation of these folks living
in Addis Ababa, Nazareth, Shashemene, Makalle, Bahir Dar and
Awassa.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said UNICEF launched the program to back up the
Ethiopian government's effort in alleviating the growing social
problems in major cities of the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 150,000 street children and their families as well
as 15,000 street-dwelling mothers would be supported if the
program is being implemented by the government and regional labor
and social affairs offices.
</P>
<P>
A similar study has also been conducted to assist children who
are on the verge of joining street life due to family and other
social problems.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, the street mothers and children will
receive extensive orientation in public health, AIDs prevention
means and family planning.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the street dwellers will also be given
financial assistance in the form of credit services as well as
professional training which will allow them to become
self-supporting and productive citizens.

<HEADLINE> 200,000 Tanzanians Suffering from Eye Diseases: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- An African doctor has warned
that Tanzania should take measures to cure eye diseases for
people, otherwise the number of the blind in the country will be
more than doubled in two decades.
</P>
<P>
A workshop held recently in the northern town of Moshi revealed
that some 200,000 Tanzanians are suffering from blindness because
of the prevalence of cataract, trachoma, corneal disease,
glaucoma, and deficiency in vitamin A, The Guardian reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If the situation is not contained, the number will rise to
450,000 by the year 2025, said David Yorston, an eye specialist at
Kenya's Kikuyu hospital.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a paper at the workshop on Community Eye Care,
Yorston said the blindness of people means a loss of 26 million
U.S. dollars in production to the country, a situation which could
be controlled by improving nutrition of children and pregnant
women.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same workshop, Prof. John Shao, the
vice-chancellor of the Tumaini University, advised African
institutions and communities to improve the quality of their
services to minimize eye-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
The professor, who is also director of the Kilimanjaro
Christian Medical Center, stressed the need of training
practitioners with necessary knowledge, skills and attitude in
treating patients with eye diseases.

PRETORIA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A crowd of more than 50,000
people had gathered on Pretoria's Union Building lawns by mid-day
on Wednesday to commemorate the inauguration of Thabo Mbeki as
South Africa's second democratic president.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration proceedings at the Union Buildings were shown
to the crowd on a giant screen, and they roared their approval at
the events.
</P>
<P>
The biggest cheers were reserved for outgoing president Nelson
Mandela, but Mbeki also got his fair share of applause.
</P>
<P>
Many of those in the crowd wore T-shirts especially printed for
the event and handed out to those who braved the chilly morning
air and arrived early.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the day's proceedings are to move from the Union
Buildings in Pretoria down to the gardens Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki and Mandela are due to address the crowd, which will then
be treated to an eight-hour concert.
</P>
<P>
People danced and sang throughout the morning enjoying the
perfect weather and police said no incidents had been reported.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Economic Delegation to Visit Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Iranian economic and
industrial delegation is due in Cairo in early July to seek
business opportunities in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will include representatives of the Iranian
Company for External Investments and Iranian members in the Board
of Directors of the Egypt-Iran Weaving and Spinning Company based
in Suez, 120 kilometers east of Cairo, the Middle East News Agency
(MENA) reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The planned visit of the delegation constitutes a further sign
of the improving ties between Egypt and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries were severed after Egypt
signed in 1979 a peace treaty Israel, which Iran regards as its
arch enemy in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, especially after moderate Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami came to power in August 1997, the two
countries have often exchanged visits by senior officials,
economic and cultural delegations in a bid to thaw out the
relations.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians will study the possibility of investing in
industrial development projects in the free zone area north of the
Gulf of Suez, the news agency added.
</P>
<P>
The group will also discuss setting up a huge weaving and
spinning complex by the Egypt-Iran Company, MENA quoted
Abdel-Hakim Hagag, head of the company, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will invest 300 million Egyptian pounds (88.24 million
U.S. dollars) for the complex and Iran will put up 100 million
pounds (29.41 million dollars), Hagag said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, due to begin in the first week of July, the
two sides will study the financing of expansions in the Egypt-Iran
Company. Some 50 million dollars are expected to be invested in
the company, MENA added.
</P>
<P>
Iran has invested 220 million pounds (64.7 million dollars) in
seven projects of weaving, carpets, ready-made garments and banks
in Egypt. The two countries' trade volume stood at 75 million
dollars in 1997, with Egypt's imports amounting to 35 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Crowds Believe Mbeki Will Boost Jobs, Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africans attending a
"people's concert" in celebration of Thabo Mbeki's inauguration as
president, appeared to share a belief that their new leader would
speed up job creation and boost economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"I think that changes promised by the African National Congress
will be sped up by Thabo Mbeki," said 44-year-old Dintoe Taunyane,
echoing the view of most people interviewed Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that as an economist, he has all the skills needed
to improve our economic situation."
</P>
<P>
Taunyane's wife Janet, 41, said she believed Mbeki would tackle
issues close to the hearts of young people, as he himself was a
young man.
</P>
<P>
July Skosana, 22, said he had confidence in the new president,
"because he has a lot of experience", while Bongani Mkhatshwa, 29,
said: "I like him because he will do good things".
</P>
<P>
"I like him, he will make everything better," said 54-year-old
Mirriam Vilakazi, while Mary Mokolo, 32, said: "I am happy --
maybe I will now get everything I need -- work, food...
everything."
</P>
<P>
Most of the concert-goers said they were sad about the
departure of Mbeki's predecessor Nelson Mandela, but believed he
should have some time to himself.
</P>
<P>
"He is old and he needs to rest," said Numsa Twala, 19.
</P>
<P>
South Africans travelled from as far as Thaba Nchu, Thohoyandou
and Groblersdal to attend Wednesday's celebrations, which kicked
off shortly after 1:00 p.m. with speeches by Mbeki and Mandela.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 people attended the event.
</P>
<P>
They were shuttled to the Union Buildings from 7:00 a.m. by
about 100 buses from six depots in and around Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Artists expected to perform include South African stars Brenda
Fassie, Johannes Kerkorrel, Lucky Dube, Johnny Clegg and Juluka,
and African performers such as Youssou N'dour and Angelique Kidjo.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Intensifying Effort Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government is
intensifying its effort against terrorist activities in the
country to make sure everyone is living in safety.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Minister of Security Muruli Mukasa at a
press conference here at the International Conference Center
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said various security agencies in the country had launched a
joint operation on May 3 of 1999 and a total of 77 terrorist
coordinators have been netted so far in various parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 13 of them have already appeared before courts of
law, he added.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, the exhibits include 13 rifles, three
pistols, one U.S.-made sub-machine gun, one bomb, some grenades,
1,657 rounds of live bullets as well as military fatigues.
</P>
<P>
A government soldier was arrested in the eastern district of
Tororo. He was found with a home-made bomb which he intended to
plant in one of the beer depots in the district.
</P>
<P>
The soldier confessed that he had been having a network in
eastern Uganda, Central and West Nile regions.
</P>
<P>
The minister also revealed that the government troops attacked
and overran an enemy camp in Rwenzori mountains bordering the
Democratic Republic of Congo and captured some documents showing
all the details of the rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces.
</P>
<P>
This information is going to help the security agents track
down these criminals and arrest them.
</P>
<P>
Terrorism is a pretty new thing in Uganda. The minister called
on the press and general public to assist the government in
checking the rampant crime.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, there have been 28 urban terrorist incidents in
Uganda which have claimed 55 lives and injured 183 others.
Twenty-two of these cases have occurred in the capital city of
Kampala.

<HEADLINE> Student Murder in Uganda Not Linked to Terrorism: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The weekend killing of three
students of the renowned Makerere University by an unidentified
gunman has nothing to do with rampant terrorism in Uganda, a
senior security officer said.
</P>
<P>
Henry Tumukhunde, director of military intelligence, told
reporters here Wednesday afternoon that the above case is just a
case of serious murder.
</P>
<P>
As the investigations are still going on, it is too early to
comment on the nature of the murder. There has not been enough
evidence so far indicating that the case is a result of terrorism,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The three students were shot dead by a gunman near a gate of
the university at 10:30 p.m. Friday night. They were reportedly
followed by the assailant in a vehicle from the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
The shoot-out triggered off a large student demonstration
through the center of the capital city the next morning and a big
vigil in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Students blamed this on the laxity of security agencies and
demanded security be strengthened in the fenceless university.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Inkatha Freedom Party leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi Wednesday confirmed that he had rejected an
offer by President Thabo Mbeki to serve as his deputy.
</P>
<P>
The reason, Buthelezi said, was that his appointment as deputy
president was conditional on the KwaZulu-Natal premiership being
given to Mbeki's African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said he would not be drawn into speculation that he
would accept the post if it was unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said IFP and ANC leaders would continue talks about
provincial cooperation Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from both sides met in Johannesburg Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
President Mbeki is to announce his cabinet Thursday, his office
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The composition of the new Cabinet is being awaited with keen
interest by politicians, political analysts and the financial
markets.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Urges G8 Ministers to Free Poor Nations from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) said Wednesday that perpetuating the debt
crisis denies the social and economic rights of hundreds of
millions of impoverished children and women, and it urged G8,
seven major Western nations plus Russia, to take real steps to
break the debt bondage of the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
"Children and women have an absolute right to basic education
and health," UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said,"
Nations freed from excessive debt burdens are prepared to make
these rights a reality and their creditors have a moral obligation
to help them do so."
</P>
<P>
The appeal came before G8 ministers are to meet in Cologne,
Germany, on June 18-20.
</P>
<P>
"On the eve of the new millennium, it is no longer that
hundreds of millions of people be held in debt bondage to the
world's rich countries," Bellamy said, "The G8 ministers could
take the lead in ensuring that countless millions of children and
women are no longer victims of, but, instead, participants in,
today's global economic system."
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said that a growing international movement favors
dramatic debt relief and urged the G8 ministers to make a
significant reforms in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative.
</P>
<P>
HIPC was launched in 1960 to provide relief to 41 of the
world's poorest nations -- the great majority of which are in
Sub-Saharan Africa -- but has failed to move far and fast enough
to achieve its modest objectives. Few target nations have
benefited and, because HIPC relief is tied to export earnings,
plummeting commodity prices have dealt an unexpected added blow to
the initiative.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said it is a sad irony that this year's 10th
anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)
coincides with the 10th year of a virtual free-fall in economic
development assistance to the world's poorest nations. "That only
makes it more imperative that debt relief be give a human face,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF's appeal coincides with the Day of the Africa Child, and
Bellamy urged G8 ministers to take special heed of how the
external debt crisis has hurt sub-Saharan Africa, which owed 84
billion U.S. dollars in 1980 and now owes more than 225 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Sub-Saharan Africa is caught in a debt trap which which
creates an impossible drain on the region's fragile economies,"
she said. "Child mortality reates in this region are one-third
higher than the average for other developing countries, and
maternal mortality rates are nearly three times greater."
</P>
<P>
"More than a third of the children have not been immunized and
approximately half the population is illiterate," she said. "Yet
the region is forced to spend more on serving its external debt
than on the health and education of its 306 million children," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Levy to Be Halved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Finance Ministry of Zimbabwe
said Wednesday it will be reducing the controversial 10 percent
tobacco levy by half in the year 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
At present, farmers pay 10 percent levy on gross sales, of
which five percent is apportioned to the producer and five
percent to the buyer.
</P>
<P>
According to the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA), the buyer
discounts the cost of the levy to the seller through the price
offered and thus the farmer effectively pays a 10-percent levy on
all tobacco sales.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa Wednesday told delegates at
the 39th annual congress of the ZTA that the government would
undertake to further review the levy, introduced in 1996, to
assist the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is Zimbabwe's single largest foreign exchange earner,
netting some 32 percent of total annual earnings.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Civil Servants Strike for Salary Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Despite Zimbabwean cabinet's
approval of the outstanding five percent increment back-dated to
January, civil servants in Harare and other cities held strike
Wednesday demanding 20 percent cost of living adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The civil servants' decision to down tools came a day after the
cabinet agreed to pay them the additional five percent to the 25
percent increase awarded last December to cushion the workers
against economic hardships.
</P>
<P>
About 140,000 civil servants were expected to participate in
the nationwide strike whose ending would depend on the
government's willingness to start negotiations on a further 20
percent cost of living adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The civil servants gave the government until Friday to resume
negotiations to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Zimbabwe Teachers Association (ZIMTA),
the Public Service Association and Zimbabwe Nurses Association
held a press conference Tuesday on the issue.
</P>
<P>
ZIMTA President Leonard Nkala said the decision to call off the
national strike would depend on the government's commitment to
negotiate.
</P>
<P>
"We are allowing the negotiations of the 20 percent between now
 and Friday so that the issue can be presented to the next cabinet
meeting," he said.

<P>
TEHRAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Lawmakers of member states of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) agreed Wednesday to
establish the Parliamentary Union of the OIC.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after a charter was passed in the

the Organization of the Islamic Parliaments.
</P>
<P>
According to the charter, the union will comprise legislative,
consultative assemblies or similar bodies (parliaments) of the
OIC member states.
</P>
<P>
The union was intended to enhance cooperation and coordination
among the OIC parliaments and between these parliaments and
parliamentary, governmental and non-governmental organizations of
other countries.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to foster coordination among peoples of the world
in order to respect and defend human rights and humanitarian
principles and establishment of peace, based on justice.
</P>
<P>
According to the charter, the union will have four organs of
conference, the council, the executive committee and the
secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The conference consists of speakers of member parliaments of
the union or their representatives, in addition to a maximum of
four parliamentarians from each member of the union.

<HEADLINE> Angola Needs $500 Million to Restore Agricultural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Angolan official said here
 Wednesday that the country needs about 500 million U.S. dollars
to restore its agricultural irrigation facilities damaged in the
civil war.
</P>
<P>
Dario Daniel Catata, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural
Development, said "Agriculture is one of the foundations of
Angola's economic development. And the restoration of these
facilities is of great importance to increase agricultural output
and employment."
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the capital needed for the
restoration of agricultural facilities will rely mainly on
international assistance. However, the Angolan government also
has some capital on hand for some priority projects aiming to
develop food products.
</P>
<P>
Angola used to be an agricultural giant, with sufficient food
to feed its people and even for some export. However, the
protracted civil war has severely damaged the country's
agricultural infrastructure, forcing farmers flee from their homes
and farm lands.
</P>
<P>
The southern African country is short of over 500,000 tons of
grain this year.

<HEADLINE> Population of Black Rhinos on Rise in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of black rhinos in
Kenya, a species of wild animals on the brink of extinction in
the world, has increased to 470 heads from 280 in 1984, the Kenya
Wildlife Service (KWS) announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to KWS, there were over 20,000 black rhinos in Kenya
In the 1970s. However, the number of this precious species
declined drastically due to rampant poaching activities.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen its management of the wildlife games in the
country, the Kenyan government in 1990 set up KWS and worked out
the act of wildlife conservation. It also established an
anti-poaching task force, the first of

its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
Timothy Oloo, an official working with the rhino protection
program in KWS, told Xinhua that each black rhino has its own file
including its serial number, the birth date, the place of birth,
sex and health conditions. Each of them has also been tagged for
easy tracking by the wildlife personnel.
</P>
<P>
The black rhinos are now mainly distributed over six national
wildlife parks and six private pastoral farms. Of which,
three-fourth are in the national parks, Oloo said.

<HEADLINE> OAU Calls to Ratify African Charter on Rights and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Wednesday called on member states to sign and ratify
the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child to
enable it come into force and implement it at their national
levels.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by OAU Assistant Secretary General Pascal
Gayama at a gathering held at Africa Hall here to mark this year's
"the Day of the African Child", which falls on June 16, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Gayama said the charter which was adopted in 1990 still lacks
the required number of ratifications to enable it come into force.
</P>
<P>
He said, "today 12 member states have ratified the African
Charter and only 28 have signed it," adding that "the Charter
needs only 15 ratifications to enable it come into force."
</P>
<P>
On the theme "peace education" of this year's "the Day of the
African Child", Gayama pointed out that peace education is
tolerance, mutual understanding, respect of human rights, love for
each other and democracy.
</P>
<P>
"As the future generation, they (African children) have a role
to play to propagate peace and live in peace," he said, adding
that "a child should therefore know and be taught about peace."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Speaker of Ethiopian Parliament Dawit
Yohannes said peace means harmony, tolerance, wholeness and
well-being in all human relationships.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to "develop the culture of peace", saying
that "in the process of constructing a culture of peace, education
should play a significant role."
</P>
<P>
There was a dialogue on the theme "peace education" between
children, teachers from various schools of Ethiopia and Ethiopian
Government officials, OAU officials and representatives from the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Committee
of Red Cross (ICRC) at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
June 16 was named by the 26th session of OAU summit in 1990 as
"the Day of African Child" in remembrance of the massacre
perpetrated by then racist regime of South Africa in Soweto in
which many innocent children lost their lives.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Remain Unchanged in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua)-- The Labor Department said
Wednesday that consumer prices held steady in May after a big jump
the month before.
</P>
<P>
The falling energy prices balanced rising food costs to help
keep the Consumer Price Index flat last month, the Department
said.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, the core
prices rose just 0.1 percent as clothing and auto prices declined
and medical and housing costs edged up. April's consumer prices
increased an unexpectedly sharp 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the annual rate of inflation felt by
consumers is 2.6 percent, compared to a 1.6 percent rise for all
of 1998, the smallest in a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
Although the April spike in prices was surprisingly large, many
analysts have predicted more moderate inflation for the rest of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said prices are expected to rise as other countries
begin to recover from nearly two years of global financial
turmoil, and world demand will pick up.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices dropped 1.3 percent in May after a record 6.1
percent jump in April. Gasoline prices fell back 2.7 percent after
a 15 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
Electricity and natural gas prices also declined in May,
although fuel-oil prices continued to edge up slightly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, food prices increased 0.4 percent in May, building
on a 0.1 percent April rise.
</P>
<P>
However, clothing prices fell 0.2 percent in May, with the cost
of footwear down 1.3 percent. Computer prices also dropped, by 1.9
percent. The apparel and computer industries continue to be
affected by stiff competition from low-priced imports.
</P>
<P>
The price of new cars and trucks also fell in May, by 0.1
percent, and public transportation costs dropped 1.5 percent.
Airline fares fell 2.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> China's Imports Surge in First Five Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China's imports surged 15.3
percent in the first five months of the year, the highest growth
rate since May 1996, latest statistics released by the General
Administration of Customs show.
</P>
<P>
The overall trade volume recorded between January and May this
year reached 128.03 billion US dollars, up 3.4 percent from the
same period last year. The increase was largely attributed to the
increase of imports, which hit 60.48 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
China's exports during the period dropped 5.3 percent to 67.55
billion US dollars, but the exports in May reported the first
positive growth rate of 4.2 percent in five months.
</P>
<P>
Among the increased imports, industrial goods accounted for a
major share at 18.7 percent. The importing of chemical goods and
related products grew 30.8 percent; the imports of steel surged 38.
5 percent; paper and paper boards increased by 18.7 percent while
those of electronic products and machinery grew 27.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the import value of primary goods dropped 0.2 percent.
But analysts here say that the decline does not imply a shrinking
in the amount of imports because the price of many primary goods
declined on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the volume of a number of primary goods imports
actually increased as did that for cooking oil, sugar, timber and
processed timber and commodity oil.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts have pointed out that the increase of imports
was mainly because of an enlarged domestic demand since late last
year and price cuts among primary goods.

reliable intelligence reports indicated that positions held by the
"sneakers" in certain areas were becoming increasingly untenable
for them due to high rate of attrition and lack of ration,
ammunition and medical cover.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported that "heavy
concentration" of Pakistani troops along the so-called line of
control in the Neelam Valley area of Pakistan side. The report
could not be confirmed here.
</P>
<P>
Asked how long the military operations would take to complete,
the army spokesman said the "intruders" had been pushed from
positions inside Indian territory to three to 3.5 km, adding "you
can not expect results overnight".
</P>
<P>
With the fierce fighting going on in Kashmir, Indian officials
claimed that U.S. President Bill Clinton had expressed his support
to New Delhi's stand on the on-going conflict with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Clinton held a 20-minute talk with Pakistan Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif through telephone Tuesday following his call to and a
10-minute conversation with Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
In his talk with Sharif, according to a White House spokesman,
"the president basically indicated that he did not see how
progress could be made on this issue (the conflict in Kashmir)
until those forces are withdrawn".
</P>
<P>
India has seen this as a major diplomatic boost for it,
asserting that its position on the current conflict had been
recognized by the United States and Clinton was in fact asking
Pakistan to pull back its forces from where Indian claimed as its
territory.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to see that the basic fact of the situation and
the whole misadventure, originating in Pakistan, has been
recognized by the U.S. government," a senior government official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Indian officials, Including Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
and Defense Minister George Fernandes, vowed to continue the
military operations till the last "intruder" from Pakistan was
thrown out.
</P>
<P>
They have made it clear that there would be no talks with
Pakistan before the pullout of Pakistan troops and "mercenaries".
</P>
<P>
However, the External Affairs Ministry spokesman said that
India had never been adverse to a dialogue with Pakistan based on
the Lahore Declaration signed between the prime ministers of the
two neighbors last February and the Simla Agreement in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Government officials declared that India was not in the least
interested in seeing a military flare-up, saying New Delhi's
policy was aimed at building "a stable, long-term, cooperative
relationship" with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at everything pragmatically keeping in view the
mutuality of interests" and other factors, a high-ranking official
said, adding there were powerful interests in the business
communities of both countries to speedily normalize bilateral
ties.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Helps Arrest Environmental Degradation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced on
Wednesday that it has approved 135 million U.S. dollars to help
arrest environmental decline, boost agricultural growth, and
ensure better management of scarce land and water resources in the
Shivalik Hills which is one of India's most environmental degraded
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Integrated Watershed Development (Hills II) project builds
on the success of the 1990 First Project of Watershed Development
(Hills I) in the Shivalik Areas which addressed the need for new
technologies and mechanisms for increasing agricultural
production, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"The project (Hills II) focuses on the most degraded watersheds
in the rain-fed areas, which are primarily dependent on rain for
agricultural production, and targets some of the poorest
populations in India," said Hamdy Eisa, task leader and principal
agriculturist for the South Asia Rural Development sector.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, the project will reach the most vulnerable
groups, especially women and landless labor. This will contribute
significantly to poverty alleviation in the project states," Eisa
said.
</P>
<P>
The total project cost is estimated at 193 million dollars, of
which the bank will finance 85 million dollars and the
International Development Association (IDA), the bank's
concessionary lending arm, will finance 50 million dollars. The
governments of the five participating states and beneficiaries
will jointly contribute an equivalent of 58 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IDA credit is on standard terms, with a maturity of 35
years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Armor-Piercing Ammunition Sold for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military transferred
about 100,000 rounds of armor-piercing ammunition to the civilian
market over the past year, a congressional study said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The transfer was done under a government program set up to help
the military dispose of surplus and obsolete ammunition, said the
study released by the Democratic minority of the House Government
Reform Committee.
</P>
<P>
The report said the U.S. Defense Department sells surplus
50-caliber shells designed for long-range military sniper weapons
for one U.S. dollar a ton to a West Virginia manufacturing
company.
</P>
<P>
"The sale of armor piercing ammunition in the civilian market
poses a threat to public safety," said the report, while
acknowledging that no laws are being violated.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian and Brazilian military were listed by the report
as Talon's foreign military customers, purchasing a total of
203,000 rounds over the past year. The company also refurbished
and sold back to the U.S. military 35,000 rounds, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Democratic lawmaker Rod Blagojevich, who with another
Democratic legislator Henry Waxman commissioned the study, said
the program allowing high-powered ammunition to pass from the
military into civilian hands may not be illegal, but should be.
</P>
<P>
"This shows an unhealthy relationship between the Pentagon and
gun dealers," Blagojevich said.
</P>
<P>
The report was based partly on an undercover investigation by
the General Accounting Office, the investigative branch of
Congress.

<P>
PARIS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- French troops joining the U.N.
peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR) rushed to a village north of
Kosovo's capital Pristina Wednesday afternoon to prevent fighting
between Serbs and Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted a spokesman of the French
troops as saying that 300 French soldiers rushed to the village of
Vucitrn in armored vehicles while 600 others flew in by helicopters
late Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The move was demanded by the Yugoslav military liaison office,
who said that Yugoslav forces pulling out of Kosovo are coming under
more and more threats from the local Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The abrupt movement of the French soldiers, which was made two
days ahead of schedule, went on without any accident with the
Albanian guerrilla group the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), said the
spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Philippe Tanguy.
</P>
<P>
When the French soldiers arrived in Vucitrn, which is 30
kilometers north of Pristina, gunshots were heard in the mountains
nearby, said AFP..
</P>

Figting reportedly broke out Wednesday afternoon near Vucitrn

LONDON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- NATO and the Kosovo Liberation Army
have reached agreement on an outline plan for disarming KLA
fighters, according to British government sources.
</P>
<P>
They said on Wednesday that the framework agreement was reached
at talks between military officials in Tirana and had been
forwarded to the North Atlantic Council, NATO's ruling political
body. Details were still being discussed, a Reuters report said.
</P>
<P>
"Discussions are still going on on the modalities of
demilitarization," one government source was quoted saying.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, a KLA representative in London said ethnic
Albanian guerrillas would not disarm in northern Kosovo until
Russia agreed to place its troops under a unified command with
NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
But British officials said Russia's peacekeeping role in Kosovo
had not been included in the Tirana talks. They said the framework
agreement included a timetable for KLA disarmament and NATO
intended to hold the KLA leadership to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"It was never imagined that the KLA would disarm overnight,"
one official said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Peaceful Ballot in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Security Council on
Wednesday called on all parties to take the necessary steps to
allow the ballot for East Timor's future to go peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Following consultations, the council issued a press statement
by June president, Gambia's Baboucarr-Blaise Ismaila Jagne, saying
that it would like to see the electoral process to be in "an
atmosphere free of intimidation and violence from all quarters".
</P>
<P>
East Timor is set for a direct ballot on August 8 to determine
whether the majority of the people in the non-self-governing
territory, as it is called by the U.N. General Assembly, would
choose special autonomy or independence.
</P>
<P>
The voting was agreed to by Indonesia and Portugal on May 5
after long-time talks mediated by the United Nations, which is
charged with organizing and conducting the voting process.
</P>
<P>
East Timor with an area of 19,000 square kilometers and a
population of 800,000, has been a Portuguese colony until 1975
when Indonesia occupation it following an internal rift.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta annexed it in 1976 and since then the U.N. has been
trying to find a solution to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
During consultations, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
personal representative Jamsheed Marker on East Timor briefed the
15 council members on the current situation there.
</P>
<P>
Members expressed their full support for the work of the U.N.
Mission in East Timor which comprises some 900 international
staff, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Mission's chief electoral officer Jeffrey Fischer has
already arrived in Dili, capital of East Timor, a U.N. spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Currently the U.N. has 127 international staff on the ground and
the first group of 42 civilian police are due to arrive in Dili
this Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They are from Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Spain, Britain
and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan has appointed Alan James Mills of Australia as
the Mission's civilian police commissioner. He has begun his work
in Dili already.
</P>
<P>
Council members were pleased with the good cooperation so far
by all the parties and appreciate the measures taken by Indonesia
to ensure a stable security situation for the ballot.
</P>
<P>
They "noted that the responsibility for creating a secure
environment for the process "lies with the Government of
Indonesia", the statement said.

UNITED NATIONS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of

Escalating violence in Angola is severely disrupting

<HEADLINE>   Philippine Archers Appeal for Private Financial Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Financial shortage pinches the
Filipino archers' preparation for the 40th World Archery
Championships (WAC) in Riom, France slated on July 16-30.
</P>
<P>
With the Philippine Sports Commission's denial of financial
assistance, the National Archery Association of the Philippines (
NAAP) is in quandary in looking for funds to support the archers'
participation for the WAC, a qualifying tournament for the 2000
Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to raise more funds, the NAAP is appealing to the
private sector to lend their helping hands to the archers whose
dream is to compete in the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"We are asking the private sectors to help our archers and
coaches who have prepared and trained intensively for this event
in the hope that they will be able to participate in the Sydney
Olympics," NAAP President Ramon Lim said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The NAAP strongly believes that the country's archery team has
a better chance to qualify because the top 43 in the WAC final
standing will qualify for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
As gold medalists in the Chang-Mai and Jakarta Southeast Asia
Games and other archery events since 1955, the NAAP is confident
that the Filipino archers can compete against the world's best
bow and arrow specialists.
</P>
<P>
The NAAP said aside from the World Championship, the
Philippines' archery team is also set to compete in the Asian
Championship to be held in Beijing, China in August.
</P>
<P>
Among the male archers that achieved outstanding performances
in the local and international scenes were Francisco Naranilla Jr.,
Miguel Martinez, Manuel Lopez, Victoriano Tabora and Teofisto
Nugud while the top female archers that brought home pride and
glory were Jocelyn Guerrero and Joan Chan Tabanag.

<HEADLINE> France, U.S. Differ Over Lifting of Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- France and the United States still
differ over the lifting of the U.N.-imposed economic sanctions on
Iraq, said visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton and his French
counterpart, Jacques Chirac, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Chirac at the Elysee
presidential palace, Clinton said that Washington wants to
maintain the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in Iraq as a strict
control preventing the development of arms of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"Without a strict control mechanism, Saddam Hussein will try to
rebuild his arsenal of mass destruction," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also warned that if an international strict control on
the flow of arms of mass destruction is not imposed, the world
could be confronted with a "proliferation of weapons of high
technology" within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
In that case, such arms will fall into the hands of terrorists
and members of organized crimes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that France wants the U.N. to replace the
commission with a new U.N. mechanism of arms control in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the U.N. should re-examine its economic
sanctions imposed on Iraq since 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait, he
said, because it is the Iraqi people who have suffered most from
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The French president said that France does not agree with a
British-Dutch proposal on suspending oil embargo on Iraq as the
first step to alleviate economic sanctions, a plan which is
supported by the United States.

LHASA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Lobang Toinzhub, vice-chairman of
Tibet Autonomous Region, and a Brazilian delegation met today and

</P>
<P>
The visitors are here for a four-day visit at the invitation of

Lobang Toinzhub briefed the visitors headed by Brazilian State
Secretary of Human Rights Jose Gregori on Tibet's dramatic changes
since the democratic reform in 1959.

Democratic reform outlawed the serf system and gave Tibetan
people the right to live and to develop. Tibetans account for an
overwhelming percentage of delegates to the local people's
congress and government officials in the autonomous region,
according to the vice-chairman.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan working people were classified as serfs prior to
democratic reform, he said. They were, in fact, enslaved by monks,
aristocrats and officials who owned ninety-five percent of the
local wealth and resources while constituting a mere five percent
of the population, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the delegation on monumental changes in the
region's economy, culture, education and social development.
</P>
<P>
Members of the delegation expressed belief that Tibet will
continue to advance in spite of difficulties.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, is to publish tomorrow a commentary entitled "
It Is up to the One Who Tied the Knot to Untie It," in the wake of
Thomas Pickering's China visit, in which the U.S. President's
personal envoy attempted to explain the U.S.-led NATO attack on
China's embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says the U.S.-led NATO wantonly attacked the
Chinese embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on May 8, a
move that "brutally violated China's sovereignty and dignity and
caused heavy casualties and severe property losses." "The Chinese
government has taken a firm stance against the act," it says.
</P>
<P>
On June 16, U.S. President's Personal Envoy and Undersecretary
of State Thomas Pickering arrived in Beijing to present to the
Chinese government a U.S. government report on the results of its
investigation into the attack.
</P>
<P>
Even though the atrocity took place almost 40 days ago, the U.S.
explanation still "played the old tune," the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. explanation, what led to the "tragic
mistaken bombing" were three reasons: the use of techniques used
in the field by the Army that led to a wrong target location; the
tardily updated databases; and the target review process which
failed to detect and correct the afore-said two mistakes.
</P>
<P>
"The explanation still lacks any convincing factual basis or
rational logic so it is still not justified and its conclusion of
'mistaken bombing' is not convincing," the commentary says, adding
that "It naturally cannot be accepted by the Chinese government
and people."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma on Thursday
unanimously approved a resolution "on the need to hold NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana responsible for being the
organizer of the NATO aggression against Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
Deputy speaker Sergei Baburin (Popular Rule), who presented
the resolution to the lower house of parliament, said it had been
drafted by the anti-NATO commission that unites members from all
parliamentary groups.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that deputies have brought up the criminal
nature of the NATO aggression many times.
</P>
<P>
"Top officials from NATO and primarily NATO Secretary-General
Solana, who decided on the commencement of hostilities against
Yugoslavia, committed a war crime and should be punished for
crimes against humanity committed during the aggression," the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Duma will forward the resolution to President Boris
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin.

With regard to the U.S. explanation that its review process
failed to detect and correct the errors, it is known to all that
the United States has a set of stringent review procedures
throughout the process of reconnaissance, identification and final
selection, according to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
What's more the Chinese embassy building has a distinctive
architectural style with marked features and there is no similar
buildings within a radius of several kilometers, the commentary
says.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side would not determine intended targets until after
verification and reviews at all levels, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, it is totally unacceptable to
attribute the attack to the failure to detect and correct
intelligence errors, the commentary says. No one can deny the fact
that the Chinese embassy was attacked precisely from different
angles.
</P>
<P>
The brazen U.S.-led NATO attack on the Chinese embassy
constituted a gross violation of the United Nations Charter and
relevant norms for international relations and barbarically
deprived Chinese citizens of their basic right, the commentary
says. The responsibility for the unlawful act should therefore be
affixed.
</P>
<P>
The commentary points out that the United States has up to now
failed to win the trust of Chinese people and indeed that of the
international community. The farfetched explanation simply shows
the U.S. lack of sincerity, the commentary says.

<HEADLINE> Indian Claims to Regain Strategic Height in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- India said Thursday that its
troops had regained a strategic height in Batalik, north Kashmir,
after a fierce battle which began Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported from Srinagar, capital
of the India-controlled Kashmir, that "5031" height was captured
after inflicting heavy casualty on what India termed as
"intruders" from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
PTI said that heavy fightings were continued in several spots
of Kargil sector with support of the Indian Air Force, which
launched its strikes on Pakistan positions in the disputed area on
May 26.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indian media reported today that the Pakistan Army
were believed to have started withdrawing from pockets that had
been encircled by the Indian forces while despatching
reinforcements to back their stronger positions in the Kargil
sector.
</P>
<P>
PTI quoted official sources as claiming that there was a heavy
military buildup in Pakistan side along the so-called line of
control in Skardu sector of Pakistan controlled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
With no sign of diplomatic breakthrough, the two neighbors have
ordered their troops along the border in high alert.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Indian Naval Staff Sushil Kumar asserted today in
Mumbai that the Indian Navy was in "maximum combat readiness" for
retaliation or counter strike in the event of any "adventurism" by
Pakistan including a nuclear strike at sea.
</P>
<P>
"We have put together maximum combat capability in the western
theater by additionally deploying ships from the Eastern Fleet,"
Kumar said.
</P>
<P>
According to PTI, Kumar said at his first press conference
after taking over as the navy chief that Pakistan Navy Fleet was
on a red alert and was preparing for action.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan failed to reach any agreement on defusing,
to say nothing of cease-fire, the on-going conflict in Kashmir in
talks between foreign ministers of the two countries last week.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi maintained that it was Pakistan which was responsible
for the conflict and therefore, as a precondition for further
talks, Islamabad should take the right steps to fully restore the
status quo ante along the line of control.
</P>
<P>
Government officials her declared that India was not in the
least interested in seeing a military flare-up, saying New Delhi's
policy was aimed at building "a stable, long-term, cooperative
relationship" with Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Murderer Faces Lethal Injection Again in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian murderer will die
Thursday by lethal injection in Taxas, U.S., barring last minute
intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court or by Governor of Texas
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
If put to death, Joseph Stanley Faulder will be the first known
Canadian executed in the U.S. since 1952, the "National Post" of
Canada reported.
</P>
<P>
Faulder, 61-year-old former auto mechanic, has been twice
convicted in the 1975 stabbing murder of Inez Phillips, a 75-year-
old widow in the east Texas town of Gladewater.
</P>
<P>
Faulder's request for clemency has been rejected by the Texas
Board of Pardons and Parole in a 18-0 vote and he is resigned to
his fate again in six months.
</P>
<P>
On December 10, he was within 30 minutes of being injected with
a lethal mix of sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide and
potassium chloride when the Supreme Court issued a temporary stay.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy wrote to U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Wednesday, asking her to use
influence for more time to examine claims that Texas violated
Faulder's human rights when he was arrested in 1977.

China adheres to an independent foreign policy of peace and
steadfastly opposes hegemony and power politics, and has therefore
won wide acclaim for its stand on upholding justice in handling
international affairs, says the commentary.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some countries or group of countries have
developed their hegemonic value and logic of power politics to the
extreme. They have, in fact, randomly resorted to the use of force
to attack other sovereign nations, without the authorization of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The commentary stresses that the U.S.-led NATO attack on the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade has again exposed the people worldwide
to the true threat to peace and stability in the world.
</P>

"China has never bowed to any pressure or evil power, and no
violent acts or threats can change its principled stand," says the

On the incorrect targeting location method, the U.S. claimed
that all other targets were located by making use of precision
targeting for air attacks. "Why was it that this airstrike
breached the operational rules and unusually used a targeting
system normally operated in the field by the army for a target
that the U.S. military considered so important?" the People's
Daily asks.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. side cannot deny that they knew the precise location
of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia. People, henceforth, can
hardly believe that the U.S. military used an outdated map in
which the Chinese embassy was unidentified," it says.
</P>
<P>
On the explanation that the U.S. labeled the target as the
Yugoslav Federal Directorate for Supply and Procurement (FDSP),
the commentary describes it as "rhetoric to fool people," for the
two buildings are not only far from each other but also bear no
resemblance in physical structure.
</P>
<P>
The commentary considered the database flaw as "a tale from The
Arabian Nights." "The situation demonstrated that the U.S. side
fully knew the overall layout of foreign missions in Belgrade," it
says.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that the United States had been planning the
strikes against Yugoslavia for a long time, the commentary says.
Long before the military actions against Yugoslavia, it had been
photographing, mapping and surveying all parts of Yugoslavia,
Belgrade in particular, by various high-tech means. In the many
rounds of attacks against Yugoslav targets in central Belgrade,
the U.S. side had avoided bombing foreign embassies in Yugoslavia
only dozens or several hundreds of meters away from the targets. "
How should such precision be explained in the light of the savage
attack on the Chinese Embassy," the commentary asks.

the development of Sino-U.S. ties, which is in line with the
fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries and
beneficial to the world peace, stability and development."
</P>
<P>
However, it stresses: "Principles must be upheld in the
development of Sino-U.S. relations. In other words, the
development of Sino-U.S.ties must be based on the basic norms for
international relations, especially the principles of mutual
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-

Belgrade is both rational and restrained," says the commentary.
</P>
<P>
It adds "it is up to the one who ties the knot to untie it."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side must "squarely face the severe consequences of
its attack and its effect on Sino-U.S. ties, provide a convincing
explanation of causes leading to the incident, make sufficient and
effective compensation for all losses, including both personnel
and property, and punish those responsible," it said.

"This is the only way to create necessary conditions and an

LHASA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Tibetan members of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the country's
leading advisory body, today hailed the 40th anniversary of
democratic reforms in Tibet carried out since the Dalai Lama
clique's failed rebellion in 1959.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 CPPCC members attended today's forum to share their
views on monumental changes which have taken place in Tibet over
the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC members denounced the feudalistic religious and political
regime in place before the democratic reform. They noted that the
former local government, aristocrats and upper-class lamas
oppressed serfs by denying them any freedom, access to means of
production. Serfs were also denied the right to elect
representatives or stand for office and their right to education.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that the democratic reform opened a new
era in Tibet and completely dismantled the old system. The
democratic reform also led to freedom for serfs and slaves who
made up 95 percent of the region's population before 1959.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC members praised development over the past four
decades, especially the monumental development in recent years.
Official statistics show that Tibet's gross domestic product (GDP)
has surpassed the national average for five years running. Living
standards for local residents have also improved rapidly.
</P>

<P>
Shenhua, the only club who grabbed both titles of the Chinese
league and F.A. in one season, also greeted the match as "a very
meaningful event".
</P>

"Man. United is one of the greatest teams in the world. We
believe there will be a sell-out crowd in the 80,000-seat Shanghai
Stadium," said Shenhua president Yu Zhifei.

Manchester United made no secret of their strong interest in
entering the lucrative Chinese market.

The departments arrested 404 suspects involved in 221
counterfeiting and trafficking cases, according to a police

Law enforcement departments handled an average of less than 100

cases in 1998 involved counterfeit currency with a face value of 6.
75 million yuan.

He said Beijing police cracked 70 cases and seized 3.8 million
yuan in fake money in the first four months of this year alone.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Remains at Record High in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department said
Thursday that the trade deficit in April was 18.9 billion dollars,
matching a revised estimate of the deficit in March and holding
steady at a record high.
</P>
<P>
Since global financial turmoil continued to hamper U.S. trade
performance, the trade deficit is running at an annual rate of
218.1 billion dollars, compared to the all-time high of 169.3
billion dollars set last year.
</P>
<P>
However, because other countries began a tentative recovery
from recession this spring, U.S. exports have started to pick up
again.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports, which had fallen for five previous months staged
a small comeback in April. Exports rose 1.2 percent to 78 billion
dollars, including all categories from food to toys to cars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. imports have also continued to rise, climbing 1 percent to
97 billion dollars in April, a record high. Imports of foods,
feeds and beverages reached a record 3.5 billion dollars and
imports of consumer and industrial goods were also up. But imports
of motor vehicles and parts declined in April by 5.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Imports from Japan declined, pulling the sensitive deficit with
Japan down 13.1 percent to 5.6 billion U.S. dollars, the first
drop since November.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit with Mexico, a partner in the North American
Free Trade Agreement, also declined in April by 32.5 percent to
1.7 billion due to a sharp drop in imports.
</P>
<P>
However, the April deficit with OPEC countries was more than
doubled in April to 1.8 billion U.S. dollars, the most since
October 1997. That was largely due to a sharp spike in oil and gas
prices because of the production limits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. deficit with the 15-nation European Union
increased by 9.7 percent to 2.9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration argues that the overall trade
deficit has a positive side: As the only major economy doing well,
the United States is playing a valuable role providing markets for
other countries struggling to get back on their feet.
</P>
<P>
Some economists also note that cheap imports have helped keep
inflation low here during a period of unusually high employment
and heavy consumers spending. But government officials are worried
that too big a trade deficit could cause U.S. industries to go
further to pressure Congress for protectionist measures.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report Thursday, the Commerce Department said steel
imports fell by 8.6 percent in April, less than the 14 percent the
government had first estimated.

<HEADLINE> Arab Summit Necessary for Solidarity, Arafat Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- President of Palestinian National
Authority Yasser Arafat said here on Thursday that convening an
Arab summit is a political necessity for Arab solidarity and unity.
</P>
<P>
Arriving here from a tour of South Africa and Egypt, Arafat
described his meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
Tuesday as "positive and fruitful."
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting dealt with the efforts to hold an Arab
summit in response to a relevant call by Mubarak and Moroccan King
Al-Hassan II.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Al-Hassa II called for an Arab summit after the
failure to hold a five-party Arab summit by the "ring countries"
(the Arab countries neighboring Israel) with a view to forming
Arab consensus toward the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Supports Egypt's Call for Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Yemen Thursday expressed support for
a pan-Arab summit proposed by Egypt to forge a unified Arab
position toward the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Iryani made the expression
here after a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, al-Iryani also conveyed a message to Mubarak
from Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh on bilateral ties and
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
"Yemen categorically welcomes and supports Mubarak's call for
convening an Arab summit," al-Iryani told reporters, terming such
a summit "the optimum means to clear the Arab atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this call would be welcomed by all Arab
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
After Ehud Barak, moderate leader of Israel's Labor Party, was
elected prime minister in the May 17 elections and pledged to push
the Mideast peace process forward, Arabs are talking about holding
an Arab summit in one way or another to adopt a united stance.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, Syria and
Lebanon have been stalled after outgoing Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu took power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak raised the pan-Arab summit proposal with Morocco's King
Hassan II during his visit to the North African country earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat voiced his support for the
idea during his visit to Egypt Tuesday and said there have been
positive responses from other Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni prime minister arrived in Egypt Wednesday to attend
the annual meetings of the Yemeni-Egyptian Higher Committee.

<HEADLINE> Simple Machine Brings Opportunities for Sustainable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A simple low-cost machine
based on a diesel motor is changing the patterns of life and
enabling thousands of rural people across Mali to increase their
productivity and income generation, the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) officials said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The machine, known as the "Multi-dimensional Platform," can be
used for crushing, grinding, shredding, sawing, drilling, welding,
pumping water or generating electricity.
</P>
<P>
A UNDP-supported project has helped 45 villages to finance and
install the platforms. The target is to cover 500 villagers in
five years.
</P>
<P>
Each village is first asked to appoint a small group of women
to operate and manage the platforms and to mobilize counterpart
funds. The women appointed are trained on the functioning of the
platform, including how to operate it and sell its services.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of women in Mali are illiterate, UNDP officials
said. The women's group that manages the platform often includes
illiterates, and the new role gives them a strong incentive to
acquire basis literacy and arithmetic skills, for which help is
given.
</P>
<P>
In a country like Mali, where electricity is still a distant
reality for most rural communities, the impact of the machine on
daily life has been dramatic. By switching from human and animal
energy sources to the multi-dimensional platform, rural Malians,
particularly the women, have seen a significant reduction in their
workload.
</P>
<P>
This, in turn, has allowed them to devote more time to other
income-generating activities such as market gardening and
trading.
</P>
<P>
Installation and maintenance of the platform is by local
artisans who are given any needed additional training by the
project. The maintenance is a direct business relationship between
the women managers and local artisans.
</P>
<P>
Cereal processing has been the main revenue-generating activity
for which the platform is used. It is also popular in powering
water pumps which has led to significant reduction of the workload
of rural Malians who no longer have to spend hours searching for
water for domestic use.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, by making electricity available, the platform has
had strong social impact on village life, making possible such
activity as evening classes for those unable to attend regular
classes, refrigeration and use of television.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands vs. Australia in Champions Trophy Women's Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 17 (Xinhua -- The Netherlands secured the point
necessary for a berth in the final as they held the world and
Olympic champions Australia to a 1-1 draw on Thursday in the
Champions Trophy women's hockey tournament at Brisbane, Australia.
</P>
<P>
With Australia already in the final following a 4-0 record in
the six-nation tournament, the Netherlands capitalized on a rare
defensive error to go ahead 1-0 through Fleur van de Kieft in the
20th minute.
</P>
<P>
Australian striker Alyson Annan canceled out the lead four
minutes later but neither side was able to find the net until the
match faded out to a draw.
</P>
<P>
The tie killed the last hopes of Germany who would have gone
through if the Dutch had slipped up against the Australians after
winning 4-0 over South Korea earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Germany opened their account after just five minutes when
Franziska Gude scored but the team failed to find the net again in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans, who were yet to win in the round-robin
matches, hung on desperately only to see the dominating Germans
add three more goals through Britta Becka, Heike Latzsch and
Natascha Keller.
</P>
<P>
The Germans will now face Argentina in Saturday's bronze medal
play-off after the South Americans drew 2-2 with New Zealand. The
New Zealanders will play South Korea in the play-off for fifth
spot.

The 22-km No.2 Asia-Pacific fiber optic cable will run from the
cities of Kitaibaraki and Chikura in Japan to Kuantan of Malaysia
and Singapore, via Shanghai, Shantou, Hong Kong, and Toucheng in
Taiwan. The project is scheduled for completion in 2002 and the
network will become Asia's leading undersea fiber optic cable
network in terms of its handling capacity and the use of advanced
technology.
</P>
<P>
The line will be connected to one transpacific undersea fiber
optic line linking China and the U.S. and another line linking

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Breakthrough in SOEs Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The restructuring of China's state-
owned enterprises (SOEs) has reached a crucial stage and efforts
should be intensified in solving the outstanding problems now
facing them, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said today.
</P>
<P>
"We must fully realize the importance and urgency in solving
these problems as they are crucial to completing the reform of
the SOEs reform and shaking off the poverty with three years,"
Jiang said at a forum on the topic in Xi'an, which was attended by
provincial officials from five northwestern China provinces and
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
"The causes of the problems are various, but the only way out
for SOEs is to deepen the current reform and turn enterprises into
market-oriented ones," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Concrete measures should be taken to improve the management of
SOEs and establish a strict responsibility system to ensure the
stable increase in the value of state-owned assets.
</P>
<P>
"To better restructure SOEs, China should strive to develop its
high-tech industry and phase out old fashioned industries.
Meanwhile, it is also important to rejuvenate small- and medium-
sized enterprises," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Further efforts should be taken to readjust and improve the
structure of the state sector to create a situation in which
public ownership serves as the backbone while other forms of
ownership enjoy smooth development," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang promised that the government will adopt active measures
within its financial capability to gradually help SOEs solve such
problems as shortage of capital, high debt ratio and heavy social
burdens.
</P>
<P>
"The reassignment of laid-off workers is directly related to
the overall situation of reform, development and stability," he
said. "All localities and government departments must strictly
implement the series of principles and policies that the central
government has made to ensure all laid-off workers are properly
settled."

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Dissociates from ILO Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has announced dissociation
of itself from a current resolution adopted at the 87th session of
the International Labor Conference (ILC) in Geneva which accused
the country of widespread use of forced labor and restriction of
freedom of association.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release of the Myanmar Foreign Ministry
Thursday night, Myanmar will cease participation in activities
connected with Convention 29 (Forced Labor Convention) and
Convention 87 (Convention on the Freedom of Association).
</P>
<P>
A number of western nations pushed through the resolution at
the current session of the ILC. The Myanmar government says the
resolution is an unfair and biased one.
</P>
<P>
"This is an action which is unprecedented and is also not in
conformity with the existing procedures of the International Labor
Organization (ILO)," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the unfairness of the exercise, its lack of balance
and objectivity as well as the underlying political motives,
Myanmar finds it impossible to accept such deplorable and
unscrupulous action on the part of those nations who want to
interfere and meddle in the internal affairs of Myanmar," it
stated.
</P>
<P>
The participation will cease "until such time that Myanmar
receives fair and equitable treatment that must necessarily be
accorded to all members of the ILO," it warned, adding that the
country will continue to comply with the conventions to which it
is a party.
</P>
<P>
A Commission of Inquiry on Forced Labor in Myanmar was formed
in 1997 which the Myanmar government then objected, saying that
there existed no ground for the establishment.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government also refuted the report of the
commission and its recommendations issued in July 1998, saying
that they are one-sided, biased and based on unfounded allegations
made by dissidents.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar became a member of the ILO in 1948, a few months after
it regained independence from the British colonial rule, and had
ratified 19 ILO conventions.
</P>
<P>
The country also charged some western nations with attempting
to use the ILO to further their political aims in Myanmar since
the early 1990s.

</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Special Saudi market bonds valued at 1.3 billion
U.S. dollars are expected to be issued soon.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported Thursday that two banks expect Saudi
Arabia to issue more special bonds to cover payments to
contractors and suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia had issued special bonds to cover contractors'
dues when it faced shortage in liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Though the date of issuing has not been fixed, market sources

<P>
CAIRO -- Iran is considering participation in several joint
ventures in Egypt in the fields of industry, services, transport
and infrastructure with investments of some 200 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Hakim Haggag, president of the Egypt-Iran Weaving and
Spinning Company in Suez said that an Iranian economic and
industrial delegation is expected in Cairo in the first week of
July to discuss the prospects of Iranian investments in productive
development projects in the free zone, north of the Suez Gulf, and
the possibility of establishing a huge complex for weaving and
textile.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian side will put up 300 million Egyptian pounds (88
million dollars) for the complex and Iran will invest 100 million
pounds (29.4 million dollars), the Arabic Alam Al Yom reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Haggag, who is also chairman of the Holding Company for
Weaving, Spinning and Textiles, added that the Iranian side was

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Breakthrough In SOEs Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang urged all local leading officials to be audacious and
innovative in tackling prominent problems in the course of
reforming and developing the SOEs.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has a large population with but a
comparatively weak economy and underdeveloped productive forces,
and this determines that it will take a long period of time to
solve the prominent problems.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged all the local officials to lead the people to
surmount the difficulties and sum up fresh experience and tackle
the problems by every means.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader stressed that Northwest China is home to
many minority ethnic groups and that it is extremely important to
strengthen their unity and maintain political and social stability.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining political and social stability is "the common
aspiration" of China's 56 nationalities and accords with their
fundamental interests, he said, pointing out that this has a vital
bearing on the country's reform, opening up and socialist
modernization drive as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the people of the country's 56 nationalities
are pressing ahead along the road of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics and this excellent situation is "hard-won".
Local leading officials should lead them to continue to push ahead
the cause of reform, opening up and the socialist modernization
drive, he added.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Commit to Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the African Economic
Community (AEC) Thursday urged African countries to demonstrate
more seriousness and commitment to the AEC programs that they have
entered into.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Antonio, acting secretary general of the OAU, said here
in his statement at the opening ceremony of the two-day third
ordinary session of OAU/AEC Economic and Social Commission that
"continent integration through the establishment of the AEC is
indeed a major program that should be accorded high priority at
all levels -- national, regional and continental."
</P>
<P>
The Abuja Treaty establishing the AEC came into force in May
1994 and since the signing of the treaty, 43 African countries
have signed and ratified it.
</P>
<P>
Antonio said the first five-year stage of strengthening of the
regional communities has been completed and has now entered the
second stage of the implementation of the AEC which will focus on
trade liberalization and harmonization of customs and sectoral
policies.
</P>
<P>
Referring to international negotiations faced by Africa,
Antonio said "Africa has to be fully prepared for these major
global encounters."
</P>
<P>
The ACP-European Union negotiations for a successor cooperation
 agreement to Lome IV were launched in September 1998 and the
negotiations have been going on in Brussels and elsewhere since
March this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization is seriously preparing for its 3rd
 ministerial conference in Seattle, the United States, and there
are growing indications of the launching of a new round of
multilateral trade negotiations at this meeting, scheduled for
November 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Lalla ben barka, deputy
executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for
Africa (ECA), said the establishment of the AEC laid a solid
foundation for economic cooperation and integration among member
states.
</P>
<P>
She hoped African countries and developing countries in general
to present their common position in Lome agreement negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The two-day ministerial meeting followed a two-day preparatory
meeting attended by experts. The second ordinary session was held
in Cairo, Egypt last year.

<HEADLINE> ECA to Hold Regional Hearing on UN's Role in New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) announced Thursday that
representatives of African member states are to meet here from
June 24 to 25 to elaborate proposals on the United Nations in the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
According to an ECA press release issued here, the two-day
meeting, under the theme "United Nations in the 21st century",
will also draw representatives from the academia, the private
sector, the media, and non- governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is the second in a series of regional hearings
being organized by the five UN regional commissions as part of the
consultative process being undertaken in preparation for the
Millennium Assembly, planned for the year 2000 in New York.
</P>
<P>
"The arrival of the new millennium offers opportunities to
think innovatively on how to address the profound economic, social
and political development challenges facing the world," said the
release.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations as the global organization has the
overriding obligation to consider how to respond to the needs and
aspirations of the great majority of society, still on the margins
of development. The United Nations must rise to the challenge as a
means of restoring faith in the organization's ability to meet the
needs of the 21st century," it said.
</P>
<P>
The African regional hearing will address the five core
priority areas of peace and security, economic and social affairs,
development cooperation, humanitarian affairs and human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Views from the hearings will contribute toward a report to be
prepared by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan outlining a vision for
the UN in the next millennium," it said, adding "these proposals
will be presented to the Millennium Assembly which is expected to
feature a large number of heads of states and government from
member states."

<HEADLINE> Russia-U.S. Talks Make Headway n Kosovo Peacekeeping: Ivanov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the United States have
made progress in solving their differences over the command of
Kosovo peacekeeping forces, but they are still wide apart over a
separate sector for Russia's peacekeepers, Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting with Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja Ha
lonen, Ivanov told reporters that Russia and the United States
have reached consensus on the use of the Pristina military airport
and the division of tasks for Russian and other countries'
peacekeeping forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Pristina military airport is now under the control of a
contingent of Russian advance troops,which entered Kosovo
unexpectedly last weekend ahead of NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said that the two sides also agreed on the participation
of Russia's troops in the command structure of the Kosovo
Peacekeeping Force(KFOR). But he added that the two sides will
continue discussing the possibility of giving Russia a separate
sector in the war-battered Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Russia only hopes to take part in the peacekeeping mission in
Kosovo on an equal basis with other countries , he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the top Russian diplomat said that it is possible for
Russia to make compromise in its negotiations with Washington, but
the compromise should not undermine Russia's interests.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov reiterated the necessity of disarming the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA), saying that KLA' s disarmament is "
absolutely necessary" in settling the Kosovo crisis and a task of
the KFOR.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and U.S.Defense
Secretary William Cohen entered into the second day of
negotiations Thursday in the Finnish capital on Russia's
peacekeeping role in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
They will be joined later by Ivanov and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who arrived here Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, Albright
said the United States has made clear that there would be no
separate sector for Russia.

<HEADLINE> France, U.S. Agree on Western Strategy in Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton
and French President Jacques Chirac reached wide agreement
Thursday on the Western strategy in the Balkans, including
economic aid and a future stabilization plan for the southeast
European region.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after concluding their talks at the
Elysee presidential palace, Clinton and Chirac said that the
priorities now are to let the Kosovo refugees return home in
security, and to arrange a Western-sponsored "Pact of Stability"
for the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
They said that the West should help the Balkan countries
maintain peace and seek economic development through an aid
program. But they did not mention any specific plan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Europe differ widely over who should pay for the
reconstruction of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has asked the European Union to provide "a lion's
share" of an economic aid package for Kosovo, because the U.S.
has paid most of the costs of the NATO operation against
Yugoslavia. This argument has been rejected by France.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Chirac also agreed that Western countries will not
send any aid, except humanitarian, to Yugoslavia unless the
country "adopts the rule of democracy."
</P>
<P>
Clinton ruled out the possibility that NATO send commando
troops to Belgrade to arrest Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
and other Serb leaders, who are indicted by the U.N. war crimes
tribunal for "crimes against humanity."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that as long as Milosevic remains inside Serbia,
he is safe from any intervention of foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president also said that France has accepted "two or
three" U.S. options on the way to let Russian troops participate
in the Kosovo peacekeeping force (KFOR).
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials holding talks with Russian officials in Helsinki
have suggested that Russian deploy troops in the northern part of
Kosovo, most likely the French-controlled zone, where there is the
largest concentration of Serbs.

their partisans.
</P>
<P>
Conditions to be outlined by the various groups will be
harmonized Thursday and added to already identified criteria for
onward submission to the Presidency.
</P>
<P>
Guidelines listed Wednesday included needs for security
clearance, due tax clearance, record of service, and evidence of
assets declarations. Those who have served in government before
are expected to forward a more comprehensive declaration.
</P>
<P>
Senator Idris Abubakar confirmed after the committee session
that elaborate debates on the list could not begin until
identified documents are supplied. In the interim, however, he
said 37 names are ideal in the interest of adequate
representation for all 36 states and the capital.
</P>
<P>
Senator Gbenga Aluko said the matter had to be discussed at the
 committee of the whole Senate for transparency reasons. If it
were in a few member committee, suspicions over bribery could be
the order of the day, he added.
</P>
<P>
He reminded the Senate that it has been agreed that the
constitutional requirements for a ministerial nominee has to be
met. This requirement stipulates compliance with House of
Representatives membership election conditions including 30 years
minimum age, school certificate minimum educational
qualification, representation from a state and sponsorship by a
political party.

In another development, along with the arrival of the first
senior state delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) since 1994, the year its then leader Kim Il Sung
passed away, the two armies of China and DPRK, which have enjoyed
a traditional friendship stretching back decades, had their first
high-level meeting in five years.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, this event was of positive significance toward
implementing lasting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula
and even the whole of northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
While the issues of the Korean Peninsula and south Asia are
regional in their characteristics, the meeting between the
military leaders of China and Russia not only concern peace in the
Asia-Pacific region, but exerts a far reaching impact on world
peace and stability in general.
</P>
<P>
During a ten-day visit, Zhang Wannian met with members of the
Russian government and army leaders and exchanged views on
regional and international security, and other issues of common
concern.

<P>
There have been more military delegations from neighboring
countries than from other regions and the number of senior
delegations headed by defense ministers or army leaders is greater
than that in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Therefore comprehensive and active relationships with
surrounding areas have become a major feature of China's military
diplomacy this year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Asia remains a relatively stable area as
is known to all, there are still elements that threaten regional
peace. Given that situation, China, as a significant player in
regional and international affairs, has used its influence to urge
those involved countries to avoid crisis situations through
dialogue in an effort to secure a peaceful all-round environment.
</P>
<P>
The visit by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Pakistani
Staff Committee to China aroused considerable attention. Chinese
President and CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin met with him and said that
"the peace and prosperity of the entire Asia would not be possible
without the stability and development of south Asia". Other
Chinese army leaders repeatedly expressed their hopes that "
relevant parties continue their patient and candid dialogues in a
bid to resolve differences and problems".

The establishment of a strategic cooperative partnership
oriented toward the 21st century, as well as enhanced consultation
and cooperation in all fields, are of far reaching influence in
promoting not only friendly bilateral ties but also peace and
stability in the region and the world at large, as both sides
agreed.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here pointed out that Zhang's current visit, the first
by a senior Chinese military leader to Russia since the
presidential summit last year, is a major step toward the
establishment of their strategic cooperative partnership.
</P>
<P>
People have the reason to believe that the military meetings
between these two major countries, which bear major responsibility
for maintaining world peace and are two permanent members of the
UN Security Council, will help unite with peace loving forces in
the world and promote the cause of peace throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Security comes through interaction. Thus, maintaining and
developing healthy and stable bilateral ties is a practical
approach for assuring regional peace and security, as is
strengthening military exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar to Hold International Trade Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- An international trade fair
will be held in Zanzibar to give local small-scale traders an
international exposure and restore the lost glory of the isles as
a mercantile center in east and central Africa.
</P>
<P>
The trade fair will take place from October 29 to November 7 at
the House of Wonders situated in the heart of the well-known Stone
Town, media reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Several reputable companies from African countries, the Gulf
region and European nations have shown interest in the event,
Nassor Mazrui, chairman of the Zanzibar Chamber of Commerce,
Industries and Agriculture, said in Zanzibar Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fair is jointly organized by the chamber, and the Women
Development for All, an non-governmental organization (NGO) led by
Salma Salmin Amour, wife of Zanzibar President.
</P>
<P>
The fair will provide a chance for women to prove their ability
in entrepreneurship, she said.
</P>
<P>
Mazuri said foreign exhibitors will be allowed to bring their
products into Zanzibar exempted from all duties.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar, part of the United Republic of Tanzania, was a
booming trading center of slaves and cloves in history. Economy
in the isles has worsened due to suspension of foreign aid.

<P>
Meanwhile, an international trade fair will be held in the
Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam during July 2-10, according to the
Board of External Trade (BET), the organizer.

<P>
HANGZHOU, June 17 (Xinhua) -- As many as 200 piano players aged
from 5 to 59 staged a combined performance of some China's best
loved musical pieces Tuesday morning in Longgang Town in east
China's Zhejiang Province, the largest performance of its kind
ever in the country.
</P>
<P>
The "Guinness Book of Records" piano performance, accompanied
by a grand chorus of 200 vocalists, was to highlight the brand new
look of the town, which has evolved from a small, barren fishing
village into a booming industrial and trade port economy since
1984.
</P>
<P>
The great changes which have taken place in the small town
epitomize the achievements and success of China's reform and
opening-up drive which began in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Longgang Town generated 2.3 billion yuan in GDP,
with income for per capita averaging at over 7,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, the local government has placed great emphasis on
harmonizing local economic and cultural development, making it
possible for such piano performances to blossom resulting in today
's event which advances local ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Longgang is now the top piano owning towns in China with local
farmers owning a total of 1,200. During recent years, more than 45
piano performances and contests have been held locally.
</P>
<P>
And local farmer Li Haicheng has also founded a piano school,
which already boasts a number of graduates.

<P>
LUANDA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's major oil company,
Energy Africa, has said it will participate more in Angola's oil
exploitation through attending public bidding for offshore
tapping.
</P>
<P>
The decision was revealed by John Bentley, general manager of
Energy Africa, during his visit here in Angola, The Angola Daily
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bentley had held a meeting on the issue with Angolan Petroleum
Minister Botelho de Vasconcelos while he was in the southern
African country.
</P>
<P>
At present, Energy Africa has joined the exploration operation
in several of Angola's offshore water areas. It also holds shares
in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Angola is the second largest oil-producing country in Africa,
with daily output of 750,000 barrels of crude oil, second only to
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
With the discovery of more high-reserve oil fields, the
government of Angola has projected that by the year 2000, the
country's daily crude production will exceed one million barrels.

<HEADLINE> Interest Subsidies Could Boost Industrial Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to maintain the strong
momentum in China's economic growth, the country's financial
institutions may offer loans with interest repayments reduced
through a government backed subsidy to encourage investment in the
industrial sector, a boost to fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
This has been revealed by Chen Huai, a researcher from the
Market Economy Research Institute under the State Council's
Research Center for Development.
</P>
<P>
Chen said in a report published in yesterday's China Economic
Times that new fiscal policy aimed at stimulating domestic demand
may help boost economic growth under the current economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the growth of fixed asset investment has slowed down
while the savings of citizens have been increasing at a high speed.
A growth of investment made by the public will be of great help to
China's pro-active fiscal policies in expanding domestic demand,
according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
Chen elaborated in his report that a large scale boosting of
fixed assets and the technical upgrading will solve the problem of
the slowing economic growth by sharpening the competitive edge of
industrial manufacturers as well as tapping the potential of idle
resources.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, the government may provide subsidies on the
interest of loans to encourage public investment. Chen believes
that a three-year-long program linked to interest subsidies may
enable the whole industrial sector to be upgraded, including steel,
automobiles, machinery and textiles, reaching an advanced level in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the new initiative may contribute to the development
of a sound capital market in China, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Trade Minister Meets British Secretary of State (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese trade minister Shi
Guangsheng met with visiting British Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry Stephen Byers here on Thursday, the first meeting
with a senior British official since NATO's suspension of air
strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The two exchanged views on trade between China and the United
Kingdom, between China and the European Union and on China's
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Shi noted that Sino-UK relations have improved much since Hong
Kong's return to China. The economic and trade relations between
the two countries, in particular, has grown at a speed higher than
that with other European nations.
</P>
<P>
"The leaders of our two countries have exchanged visits
frequently and that has greatly helped push forward bilateral
economic and trade ties," said the Chinese minister. "The
development of China-UK trade and economic relations is in the
fundamental interests of both countries and the world's peace and
development as well."
</P>
<P>
Shi said that from a long term perspective, trade and economic
relations between China and the European Union has great
development potential, but there are problems to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
The British side, while underlining its export levels to China,
should also pay attention to China's exports to Britain, he said,
adding that Britain can also play an active role in trade
liberalization as against the trade restrictions and protectionism
now rising in the EU.
</P>
<P>
Shi proposed that in the further expansion of economic and
trade relations between China and Britain and between China and
the EU, each party should open the commodities and service trade
market to the other.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and Britain can further diversify their
cooperation in the area of trade, investment, economic and
technological projects and the capital market. The two should also
utilize the joint commission system to resolve trade disputes. (

Byers offered on behalf of the British Government "its profound
distress and apologies" for NATO's attack on the Chinese embassy
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said that the British Government supports China
's accession to the WTO at an early date, adding that Britain "
strongly" holds that China's entry before the WTO Seattle meeting
in the coming autumn is conducive.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that China has never changed its stance, viewpoint and
attitude toward its accession to the WTO. He stressed that China
can only join the WTO as a developing country, and the obligations
it should undertake must be in compliance with China's current
national strength.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, it is not the proper time now to resume the WTO
talks with either the United States or the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-led missile attack against the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade has damaged the good atmosphere of negotiations," he said.
"Only after the U.S.-led NATO has made a response satisfactory to
China and a good atmosphere is reinstated, the talks can be
resumed."
</P>
<P>
The minister said that China's accession to the WTO is demanded
in the first instance by China's process of reform and opening to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that entrepreneurs from Britain and other
parts of the world have been welcome to engage in trade,
investment and other economic cooperation events, and they are and
will be welcome in the future.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by several top executive officers of large British
companies, Byers arrived here Wednesday night at the invitation of
the Chinese trade minister.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in China, Byers will visit relevant Chinese
ministries, and travel to Kunming on June 19 to attend the British

<HEADLINE> Former U.N. Envoy Visits Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Three months after he left Angola
where the civil war was renewed, regretfully, former U.N. special
envoy Issa Diallo returned here Thursday for a visit.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Angolan Foreign Ministry said, Diallo's
current three- day visit to Angola is to discuss, on behalf of the
United Nations, with the Angolan authorities the country's grim
humanitarian situation.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in the Luanda International Airport, Diallo
told the press that the United Nations "has not forgotten Angola"
and will continue its efforts in solving the armed conflicts in
the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is "very worried" about the humanitarian
situation in Angola, he said, adding that it believed that the
current political, military and humanitarian difficulties will be
overcome through "certain appropriate means."
</P>
<P>
Diallo was appointed the U.N. special envoy to Angola last year
to take the place of Alioune Blondin Beye who had died in a plane
accident.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations ended its observer mission in Angola in
February this year following Angolan government's accusation of
the poor performance on the part of U.N. peacekeeping forces and
its insistence of armed settlement with the opposition National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Diallo therefore left here on March 15.
</P>
<P>
With the stalemate in the Angolan crisis, more people at home
and abroad are calling for peaceful dialog between the Angolan
government and the UNITA. Observers here believe that Diallo's
present visit to Angola has much to do with this particular
backdrop.

<HEADLINE> Peace Meeting on Nigerian Oil Hub Crisis Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A peace meeting to find a lasting
solution to the crisis in Warri, a petroleum industry hub in south
Nigeria, kicked off in Asaba, capital of the Delta state
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was presided by Governor James Ibori drew
representatives of the three ethnic groups, Ijaw, Itsekiri, and
Urhobo, local media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the peace talks, Ibori reminded the
participants that losses sustained were not only to the
inhabitants of Warri and its environs but also to the federal and
state governments.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that the present administration would not
allow the crisis to continue without resolution, appealing to the
participants to imbibe the spirit of give-and-take so that an
amicable solution could be found.
</P>
<P>
He commended the delegates for the maturity exhibited during
the visit of President Olusegun Obasanjo and urged them to heed
the president's appeal by coming together to iron out their
differences.
</P>
<P>
The governor urged them to give peace a chance so that
government could execute the development plans to make Warri a
true "oil city".
</P>
<P>
He said that "posterity would not forgive us if we do not
plough back our oil money into the development of Warri and indeed
Delta State."
</P>
<P>
He urged the delegates of the three ethnic communities to speak
frankly as the Warri crisis talks more within the purview of the
state government.
</P>
<P>
The youths of the ethnic communities had been undertaken severe
fighting till a curfew and shoot-at-sight were announced one week
ago in the battered city of Warri.
</P>
<P>
Governor Ibori had unveiled a disarmament package over the
weekend, offering cash and job opportunities for the surrender of
arms, which had encountered a cold reaction from the three ethnic
communities.
</P>
<P>
The governor also promised in his peace plan to set up a Warri
Urban Development Authority to address the roots of the
decades-old conflicts in the region.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo had pleaded for time to enable his government to
resolve the underlying problems behind the Warri crisis when he
visit the city last Friday after ethnic clashes has claimed about
300 lives.
</P>
<P>
The Niger delta region generates most of the country's oil and
above 90 percent of the country's foreign currency reserve, yet
find itself struggling in deep poverty.
</P>
<P>
Wide spread unemployment, and deep poverty are blamed to be the
roots of the frequent and rampant conflicts in the region, while
Idle youths kidnapping oil company personnel and warring with each
other are commonplace in the area.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria President Highlights Partnership With S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has stressed the "strategic partnership" between the most populous
country and South Africa, the most developed one in Africa.
</P>
<P>
After attending the inauguration of Thabo Mbeki as South
Africa's new president in Pretoria, Obasanjo told the press in
Johannesburg Wednesday that Nigeria regarded South Africa as a
desired partner and companion in " realizing the African dream."
</P>
<P>
"There is no competition between Nigeria and S. Africa, we need
 cooperation and feel it is necessary for the benefit of the
entire citizenry of both countries," the New Nigerian newspaper
Thursday quoted Obasanjo as saying.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo told a gathering of both countries' business
communities in Pretoria Tuesday that time is now ripe for South
African businessmen to collaborate with their Nigerian
counterparts for the general good of the continent.
</P>
<P>
"The continent is like a large basket whose hands are located
in west Africa, and to lift it up, you need the support of the two
hands which our countries provide," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He said that with democracy now in place in both countries,
they should come together, adding that "with the demise of
ruthless dictatorship in my country and the death of apartheid
here, our doors are both open for greater collaboration."
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian president stressed that the two peoples could
complement each other to bring investments to their countries,
assuring that measures are currently being taken to remove all
obstacles and ensure conducive climate for investors.
</P>
<P>
There are lots of advantages for potential investors in
Nigeria, listed among others, a large market and very cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
Inviting South Africans to come and invest, the president said
that as part of government's determination to liberalize the
economy it has commenced moves to privatize some of its key
sectors, including electricity supply and communications.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, India Sign Final Accord on Bus Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and India signed an
official and final agreement to start commercial operation of
Dhaka-Calcutta direct bus service here Thursday afternoon, ahead
of a scheduled two-day visit of Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee to Bangladesh beginning Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by Karar Mahmudul Hasan, joint secretary
of the Communication Ministry of Bangladesh, and K.R. Bhatti,
joint secretary of the Surface Transport Ministry of India,
completing all legal formalities to introduce the much-awaited bus
service.
</P>
<P>
The Indian cabinet approved the draft agreement Tuesday,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Hasina and Vajpayee, who is to arrive here Saturday morning by
air from New Delhi, will receive two buses from Calcutta, capital
of the West Bengal state of India, to mark the inauguration of the
direct bus service.
</P>
<P>
The bus service will formally start before June 29, Hasan told
reporters after the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The two-year agreement will be reviewed after three months of
trial operation, during which two buses will leave from or come to
Dhaka every day except Sunday, Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 visas are issued by India to Bangladeshis every
day, and as a result, the number of buses to be plying the route
will increase to 30 or more each day in six months to one year, he
said. Most of the buses will be run by the private sector, he
added.
</P>
<P>
More than 500,000 people travel by this route to and from
Bangladesh each year, a press release said.
</P>
<P>
After an initial agreement Hasan and Bhatti signed in the
Indian capital New Delhi in February this year, a trial bus left
Dhaka for Calcutta on April 6 and an Indian bus came to Dhaka on
April 8.  The two sides signed a protocol for the final
agreement in Dhaka on April 9.
</P>
<P>
The round-trip passenger fare on this route will be 1,100 taka
(22 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> OIC Parliamentary Union Founding Conference Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The founding conference of the
Parliamentary Union of the Organization of Islamic Conference
(OIC) Members concluded here Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the conference Taha Hashemi said at a press
conference that the union's council would open its first session
Thursday afternoon to elect its secretary general.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi said the union has decided to base its permanent
secretariat in Tehran, the first time for Iran to host the
secretariat of an international organization since the Islamic
Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 49 Islamic countries, including 28
parliament speakers, attended the three-day founding conference
and all the participating countries were named as the union's
founding members, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the change in the name of the body, which was
originally "the Organization of Islamic Parliament," Hashemi said
the name was changed to "the Parliamentary Union of the OIC
Members" because some OIC members are not Islamic countries while
some others have secular parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the relations between the union and the OIC,
Hashemi said the newly-established union is an independent
organization.
</P>
<P>
"It has no contradiction with the OIC and it is not a
subordinate to the OIC, but an independent organization," he
said, adding the union would have close cooperation and
coordination with the OIC.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Insists Separate Sector for Russia in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 17 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin insisted
Thursday that Russia should have a separate sector for its
peacekeepers in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with his Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev earlier Thursday, Yeltsin voiced his "categorical
disagreement" with Russia not being assigned a sector in Kosovo,
Federal Security Service Director Vladimir Putin said before a
meeting with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev is holding talks with his U.S. counterpart, William
Cohen, in Helsinki, Finland, on Russia's peacekeeping role in
Kosovo and both talked of progress at the end of their last
session late Thursday. The two defense chiefs are expected to
resume negotiations Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said most of the issues have been settled amiably in
Helsinki. But the main question of assigning sectors has not,
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to give Russia a sector (in Kosovo). So I
warned Sergeyev that he should tell his opposite numbers at the
talks that it has been reported to the president. The president
categorically disagrees and will seek ways to oppose this," Putin
quoted Yeltsin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that he would discuss with Putin how things "will
end in Yugoslavia," how the U.N., Russia and the U.S. visualize
the future course of developments in and around Kosovo, the
Interfax news agency reported.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Federal Security Service
Director Vladimir Putin said Thursday that the main tasks in
Kosovo are the disarmament of the Kosovo Liberation Army and the
prevention of guerilla actions by Serbian forces and Serbs
remaining in the area.
</P>
<P>
Putin was speaking to the press after a meeting with President
Boris Yeltsin at the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
He said that zones of responsibility remain a key problem in
Kosovo. Moscow is negotiating with the United States in Helsinki,
Finland, on the number of Russian peacekeepers, the character and
mechanism of their interaction with NATO, as well as the degree of
their independence.
</P>
<P>
Putin said that no problems are insurmountable for the
negotiators in such matters. He cited the Bosnian model as an
example of Russian representatives working with NATO structures
and reporting to the Russian contingent only those instructions
from the joint command that meet the objectives of the Russian
side.

MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Bureau of Customs
(BOC) reported Thursday that it collected 30.822 billion pesos
(771 million U.S. dollars) in the first five months, which was
three percent higher than the 29.920 billion pesos (748 million
U.S. dollars) of the same period last year.

Customs Commissioner Nelson Tan said BOC surpassed its revenue
target by 1.2 percent over its target of 30.470 billion pesos (762
million U.S. dollars) set for the five-month period.
</P>
<P>
In May alone, the Bureau collected 7.738 billion pesos (193

CAIRO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Higher Military Court on

<HEADLINE> IMF to Support Structural Reforms in Asia: Fischer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) will continue to do everything it can to support the
continuation of the process of structural reform in Asian
economies, Stanley Fischer, first deputy managing director of the
IMF, said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The origins of the Asian financial crisis lay primarily in
capital account and financial sector problems, exacerbated in
several countries by inappropriate exchange rate policies, and
triggered by rapid outflows of capital, said Fischer, when
delivering a keynote speech at the 6th Far Eastern Economic Review
annual conference.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, policies adopted by governments to deal with the crisis,
in many cases with IMF support, had to be comprehensive to resolve
structural as well as macro problems," Fischer noted.
</P>
<P>
Of course, the structural reforms, especially in the banking
and corporate sectors, are not complete in any country, for this
is a long-term task, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But it was important to begin as soon as possible -- and
looking around the region, we see that the countries that moved
most rapidly on structural reforms are also those that are
recovering most rapidly," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said that one important risk now is that the burgeoning
recovery in crisis-struck economies will reduce the urgency of
reform, and allow complacency, or normal politics, to set in. Much
structural reform remains to be carried out in these countries, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Fischer noted that Japan's recovery is very important for this
region. This applies not only to the recovery of output growth,
but also to the strengthening of the banking system, to ensure the
revival of Japanese private sector capital flows to the region.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, actions taken to recapitalize the banks last year
in Japan are beginning to pay off, Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis has made it very clear that the
international financial system has to be strengthened, said
Fischer. The international community will continue to rely on the
IMF to play its central role in the international system.
</P>
<P>
"We do this through surveillance, lending policies, as an
institution providing the machinery for consultation and
collaboration on international monetary problems," he added.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM to Pay "Goodwill Visit" to Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee will come to Bangladesh for a two-day "goodwill visit"
beginning Saturday, Foreign Ministry officials said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the visit will be the ceremonial inauguration
of the Dhaka-Calcutta bus service on Saturday, and Foreign
Ministry officials described the visit of Vajpayee, who is now
caretaker prime minister, as "a goodwill visit."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee, who will arrive here by air in the morning,
accompanied by External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh and Foreign
Secretary K. Raghunath, will hold talks with his Bangladeshi
counterpart, Sheikh Hasina, before jointly receiving two Indian
buses carrying nearly 80 passengers from Calcutta, West Bengal, in
the afternoon, Foreign Secretary Shafi Sami told reporters at the
regular weekly news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration of the direct bus service "is very important"
for the about 1.2 billion people of the two countries, at least
for those who travel between Dhaka and Calcutta, Joint Secretary
of the Communication Ministry Karar Mahmudul Hasan told a separate
press conference. Hasan and K.R. Bhatti, joint secretary of the
Surface Transport Ministry of India, signed an official agreement
on the bus service here on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Indian premier may take the opportunity to discuss with
Hasina economic issues including port and transit facilities, and
geopolitical matters of common concern, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian side may also raise the sensitive issue of
purchasing natural gas though pipeline while Bangladesh will
insist on obtaining zero tariff facility on all its export items
to India. Both the ruling and the opposition have announced
objection to exporting gas before "meeting domestic demands."
</P>
<P>
Dhaka is likely to propose setting up of joint venture
industries in Bangladesh with "buy-back arrangements," in an
effort to bridge the huge trade gap, which is in Delhi's favor,
</P>
<P>
This will be Vajpayee's second visit to Bangladesh in two
decades. He came to Dhaka in the late 1970s as foreign minister.

China's support for Bahrain and other Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
He said Bahrain hopes to expand cooperation with China in
bilateral trade, and the finance, oil and petrochemicals industry
as well as the aviation sector as his country is an important
trade and financial center in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Bahrain minister signed another
agreement exempting aviation tax with the State Administration of
Taxation of China today.

<HEADLINE> Somali Currency Hits New Low Against US Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Somali currency hit its
lowest Thursday as it scratched 10, 000 shillings against one U.S.
dollar, down from 9,500 shillings to one dollar after the second
consignment of bank notes arrived in Mogadishu early this month.
</P>
<P>
The Somali currency valued at 8,500 shillings to dollar before
the consignments of bank notes arrived in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 billion Somali shillings worth of over 9.5 million
dollars printed in Canada have been brought to Mogadishu on three
installments since last month.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, now there is some hope that the shilling can again
gain grounds against the hard currencies despite its continuous
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
A vessel transporting more than 50,000 crates of banana sailed
for the Gulf countries two days ago for the first time in the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
The livestock dealers have also started going to the
countryside to buy goats and sheep for export following the lift
of the ban against Somalia's animals last month.
</P>
<P>
The banana and livestock exports are two major exported items
of Somalia, giving a real encouragement to the shilling.
</P>
<P>
However, life is becoming extremely difficult for many Somalis
because of the inflow of the overseas printed Somali shillings
into the local markets, increasing banditry and the raging civil
strive for control of such towns as Baidoa and Kismaio.
</P>
<P>
The illegally imported money by Somali businessmen and faction
leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid have caused a serious inflation,
further devastating the already meager economy of the
war-prolonged Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
The souring inflation is affecting almost all of the
commodities available for sale in the main markets, especially the
imported goods and food stuffs.
</P>
<P>
The ordinary Somali families are now depending on such local
food products as maize, beans and sorghum which are not yet
affected by the inflation.
</P>
<P>
But the sale of these products themselves are at risk since the
business movement in the Bay and Bakol regions are now restricted
by the recent capture of Baidoa town by the Rahanwein Resistance
Army which is allegedly backed by the Ethiopian forces.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Baidoa town indicate that the life is becoming
unbearable and expensive as a result of its isolation from capital
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
All kinds of communications including the traffic movement from
 Mogadishu to those regions have been stopped after the fall of
Baidoa some ten days ago.

Representatives (DPR). The remaining 38 seats are reserved for the
military, whose members do not vote.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Shortage Hits Zambian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The diesel shortage which has
persistently hit Zambian capital Lusaka continued Thursday with
nearly all the service stations in the city operating without oil.
</P>
<P>
The persistent fuel shortage has temporarily crippled
operations at the University Teaching Hospital, the biggest
hospital in the southern African country, police and many other
government departments.
</P>
<P>
At the hospital mortuary, an attendant said that few vehicles
had gone to collect corpses, causing congestion in the
refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
"Corpses are currently being piled on top of each other since
people just come with excuses that there is no transport to pick
their relatives due to the fuel shortage," said the attendant.
</P>
<P>
A check at the police main filling point found out that all the
diesel tanks try with only a few liters of premium.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman, Alex Chilufya, described the prevailing
situation as chaotic and called for a quick solution to the
problem.
</P>
<P>
He said only urgent cases will be attended to due to the
limited resources available.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has been advised to involve all the
oil marketing companies in the importation of refined products to
ease the fuel blues in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice-President of Zambia Association of Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (ZACCI), Boniface Chiweza, has called on the
government to allow all oil marketing companies to bring in the
fuel.
</P>
<P>
"Our economy has been liberalized and the government should
therefore allow individual oil marketing companies to import the
fuel rather than have it brought in through the Zambia National
Oil Company," he said.
</P>
<P>
The association was worried about the fuel shortage because it
had come at a time when transporters were supposed to be ferrying
this season's maize harvest from the areas of production.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Truckers Association of Zambia, Charles Madondo
said that the one million liters of fuel recently imported by the
government was only about a day's consumption as long distance
truckers required as much as 1,500 liters on a single trip.
</P>
<P>
He said oil marketing companies should share the contract
instead of awarding the tender to only one company as government
initially did early this week.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China planted trees on an area of
4.7 million hectares last year, increasing the total forest area
to 130 million ha, according to China's latest environmental
situation report.
</P>
<P>
The annual report issued by the State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA) says the forest coverage rate is nearly 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China closed hillsides of nine million ha to
facilitate afforestation. And about 2.2 billion trees were planted
by Chinese volunteers last year.
</P>
<P>
China is going ahead smoothly with its forest shelterbelt
constructions in northwest, north and northeast China, the middle
and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the coastal regions,
with more than 2.23 million ha of trees planted in those areas
last year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said China planted 327,000 ha of forests in the
middle reaches of the Yellow River, and the valleys of Liaohe
River, Pearl River and Huaihe River last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the report showed that the per capita forest share in
China is 0.11 ha, 17.2 percent of the world average.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 4,400 fires damaged about 27,000 ha of
forests, and seven million ha of forests suffered from plant
diseases.

<HEADLINE> Soil Erosion Control, Arable Land Protection Speeded up in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China successfully controlled soil
erosion over an area of more than 50,000 square kilometers last
year, according to the latest environmental situation report.
</P>
<P>
The annual report released by the State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA) says the country had succeeded in
conserving water and soil over a total area of 78 million hectares
by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
China has also built terraced fields and dams and turned
deserts into farmland, covering about 12 million hectares and
planted 40 million hectares of forests, says the report.
</P>
<P>
Water conservation authorities last year increased their water
storage capacity by 25 billion cubic meters, holding back 1.5
billion tons of sand and earth.
</P>
<P>
Several key projects to conserve water and prevent soil erosion
are now underway along China's major rivers, including the Yangtze,
Yellow and Pearl rivers. Both the central and local governments
have increased investment in water and soil conservation.
</P>
<P>
However, the report says China's arable land decreased by 261,
000 hectares last year, 126,000 hectares more than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
China revised its laws and regulations on land management last
year and using arable land for non-agricultural purposes has been
banned since 1997.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Vows to Stop Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has vowed to stop the rampant corruption in the west African
country.
</P>
<P>
After attending the inauguration of Thabo Mbeki as South
Africa's new president in Pretoria, Obasanjo told the press in
Johannesburg Wednesday that any public official who steals or
misappropriates public funds will be disgraced and made to face
the wrath of the law.
</P>
<P>
While noting his role in the formation of the anti-corruption
group, Transparency International, Obasanjo restated his
commitment to bringing corruption to an end in his country,
Nigeria's The Guardian newspaper Thursday reported.
</P>
<P>
The president praised the regime of former Head of State
General Abdulsalam Abubakar, for taking steps to recover
ill-gotten wealth from public officials.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said that more than 800 million U.S. dollars had been
recovered while private properties acquired corruptly had been
confiscated both in Nigeria and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The president restated his resolve to continue with the task as
well as initiate new procedures for recovering wealth looted from
the federal treasury.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of human rights, Obasanjo said that violations
committed between the last democratic dispensation and now would
be investigated to address the plight of those who suffered
unjustly in the past.
</P>
<P>
The Panafrican News Agency Sunday cited a survey of the
Transparency International as showing that Nigeria lists itself
in the top of the World' s 23 most bribery-rampant country.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin-based organization suggested in its survey that the
prevalence of corruption appears to deter the foreign investment
in these countries.

<HEADLINE> Poppy Seeds As Food Additive Banned in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Health has
banned food manufacturers from using poppy seeds as an additive in
foodstuffs after an illegal practice was disclosed.
</P>
<P>
An urgent circular issued by the ministry urged local
departments responsible for food hygiene supervision to "fully
investigate and deal with cases of using poppy seeds in food
preparation", warning that certain elements found in poppies may
do harm to human health and cause addiction.
</P>
<P>
A Henan based food company supplying fried chicken nationwide
was discovered recently to be adding poppy seeds in food
processing materials, and traces of morphine and other elements
were detected, according to today's Health News.
</P>
<P>
China prohibited food suppliers from adding any poppy parts to
foodstuffs such as soup and noodles in 1991. However, the illegal
practice has not been wiped out because some people believe
poppies can make food more delicious.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Share Prices rose modestly on
Singapore Stock Market Thursday as later profit-taking pared early
gains made on the back of Wall Street's rise and retail investor
interest in second liners.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) gained 13.54 points in
active trading to end at 2,057.34 points, off from its intraday
high of 2,080.93 points.
</P>
<P>
Total volume extended to 1,310.77 million shares valued at
1,239.03 million Singapore dollars (727.43 million U.S. dollars).
Advancers outpaced decliners by 275 to 68 with 99 counters
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Eagle, a Chinese township enterprise manufacturing ceramic
sanitary wares and tiles, topped the volume list with 106.86
million units changing hand. It was followed by ICT that chalked
up 86.79 million units. Dragon was the next with a turnover of
66.11 million counters.
</P>
<P>
CityDev and DBS F were the top movers as they ran up 60 cents
to close at 11.70 and 17.90 Singapore dollars respectively.
Venture climbed up 50 cents to finish at 13.10 Singapore dollars.
C &AMP; C gained 45 cents to end at 10.00 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, SPH headed the descent of the day as it
incurred a loss of 60 cents to close at 27.50 Singapore dollars.
UOB F sank 40 cents to finish at 11.40 Singapore dollars. SPH 100
retreated 30 cents to end at 27.70 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the overnight rally on Wall Street was triggered
by the tame U.S. May inflation data released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The optimism that the U.S. inflation is in check relieved
investors' fear of possible rise in U.S interest rates and further
fueled the already bullish mood in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that gains in key index-linked stocks boosted
the STI although retail stocks continued to weigh heavily on the
market sentiment.

<HEADLINE> SAFE Makes Serious Efforts to Provide Good Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China's State Administration of
Foreign Exchange (SAFE) has made great efforts this year to
improve the administration of foreign exchange and offer high
quality services.
</P>
<P>
An official from the SAFE said that by the end of March, China'
s foreign exchange reserves had reached 146.62 billion U.S.
dollars, an increase of 1.666 billion U.S. dollars over the end of
last year, with the foreign exchange market operation basically
normal.
</P>
<P>
When the SAFE held its annual meeting at the beginning of this
year, it clearly outlined its work targets which included
maintaining balanced international payments and a stable currency,
creating a good environment for foreign trade and foreign
investment, and promoting the healthy development of the foreign
economic activities.
</P>
<P>
To offer higher quality services and improve the operating
efficiency of enterprises and banks, the SAFE launched a new check
clearing computer system on January 1 among customs offices, banks
and the SAFE itself, reducing time spent on clearing and
administering checks from two or three weeks to a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
The SAFE has also created a fair, open, healthy and clean legal
environment for foreign exchange administration by drafting a
series of foreign exchange policies, which has enabled it to offer
high quality foreign exchange services.
</P>
<P>
"The recent launch of the SAFE website is one of the measures
taken to increase its openness and improve communications with the
community," the official said, adding that foreign investors
attending a recent seminar held by the SAFE have expressed their
appreciation for the good competitive environment created by
foreign exchange administrative departments.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Endangers Future of Humanity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Even though population control
remains a top priority in China's development agenda declining
male virility, which is a worldwide phenomena, is posing a serious
threat to the country's demographic future.
</P>
<P>
Environmental changes induced by wide use of man-made chemicals
are blamed for falling semen quality over the past two decades,
according to today's China Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
Recent research based on the statistical analysis of 11,726
samples obtained from examinations of semen quality nationwide
between 1981 and 1996 shows that the average amount of semen and
the total number of sperm from each ejaculation has dramatically
dropped by 10.3 percent and 30.6 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The research was conducted by scientists with the State Family
Planning Commission, the central government body in charge of
population control and improvement of reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
Their findings show that the situation is actually much worse
in cities and the more industrialized zones than in the
countryside and less developed areas.
</P>
<P>
"Pollution is closely related to the worsening semen quality,"
said Zhang Shucheng, one of the researchers.
</P>
<P>
"Animal tests have demonstrated that among the 100 known
chemical compounds, more than half of them are harmful to sperm,"
he explained. Scientists have proved that certain chemicals are
the direct cause of falling fertility and even for the extinction
of certain species like certain amphibians, fishes and birds.
</P>
<P>
They agree that the more sensitive reproductive cells are the
prime victims of newly invented compounds in the course of
industrial development, and declining male virility has
contributed to an increase in the rate of infertility,
miscarriages, abnormalities in new-borns, and sexual abnormalities
and handicaps among the young in China.
</P>
<P>
At least 100,000 man-made compounds are used worldwide, and the
long term effects of about 40 percent still remain unknown. The
influence of pollution on the human reproductive system may prove
to be the biggest challenge for human health in the 21st century,
some scientists assert.
</P>
<P>
Falling semen quality is a topic of global concern. According
to an analysis of published reports from 21 countries by Danish
scientists, the number of sperm for each ejaculation fell over 40
percent and 20 percent respectively between 1938 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
To ascertain the relationship between environmental changes and
the declining semen quality, Zhang and his colleagues are seeking
funds for new research into the cause and effect of the
environment on semen quality.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Bulgarian Foreign Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan and his Bulgarian counterpart Nadezhda Mikhailova held
talks here today, and signed two agreements for cooperation in the
fields of education and social affairs respectively.
</P>
<P>
It has been 50 years since China and Bulgaria forged diplomatic
ties, and through the joint efforts of both sides, bilateral ties
have witnessed further development in recent years, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation for the principled position of the
Bulgarian government to actively develop relations with China and
pursue the "one China" policy on the issue of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced the hope that Bulgaria would continue to keep
alert against the "diplomatic breakthrough" sought by the Taiwan
authorities in any form and under any name with the aim of
destroying the China-Bulgaria friendship.
</P>
<P>
Mikhailova spoke highly of bilateral ties, saying political
relations have been sound, and that there is great potential for
the expansion of economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is willing to continue reinforcing its cooperation
with China in various fields, she said, stressing Bulgaria will
not change its consistent stance on the Taiwan issue, let alone
conduct political contact with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also discussed international issues
of common concern including the Kosovo issue and cooperation in
specific fields, especially in the economic and trade sector.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Downs Another 2 Ethiopian Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrean Foreign Ministry said
in Asmara Thursday that the Eritrean troops shot down two
Ethiopian Mig-23 fighters Wednesday afternoon on the Mereb-Setit
front.
</P>
<P>
A news release from the ministry said that the two Mig aircraft
were hit at high-altitude as they encroached on Eritrean airspace
and fell behind Ethiopian front line.
</P>
<P>
Previously, two Ethiopian Mig-23 fighter planes and one Mi-35
helicopter gun ship were shot down on Sunday and last Friday
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that "ground fighting in the Mereb-Setit
front, which continued with less intensity in the past two days,
resumed Thursday morning."
</P>
<P>
The ministry also said that Ethiopian cumulative losses were
over 18,000 killed or wounded in the intense border battles from
June 10 to 14, although the figures for the past two days were not
available yet.
</P>
<P>
However, Ethiopia Wednesday claimed that its troops had put
21,000 Eritrean soldiers out of action in recent six days of
fighting.
</P>
<P>
War broke out in early May 1998 along the 1,000-kilometer
borders of the two Horn of African neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Although both nations have agreed to the peace framework put
forward by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), they differed
over the details of the peace plan and its implementation.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan Thursday urged East Asia, particularly Southeast Asia, to
rethink its strategy of growth and give priority to overall
structural readjustment.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 6th Annual Conference of the Far Eastern
Economic Review here, Surin said that East Asia cannot remain
dependent on outside capital, technology and management as in the
past.
</P>
<P>
The region shall invest heavily on human resource development,
science and technology, research and design for new products, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The region will have to develop diverse and varied centers of
growth over a wider geographical spread and a larger spectrum of
sectors and disciplines," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that ASEAN economies have for the past three
decades been an extension of other economies, rather than being
independent, with home-grown capital, technology and management.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve sustainable long-term growth, the region must
bolster home-bred technology and management," he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is not to say that we should close ourselves from outside
investment," said Surin. "We cannot avoid, and indeed we welcome,
economic integration and cooperation in a globalized world."
</P>
<P>
But, he said, each country and region will have to be able to
identify its own area of competency and seek to complement others
in areas where they have comparative advantages.

<HEADLINE> Major Reshuffle in China's Insurance Intermediaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A major reshuffle is imminent in
China's insurance intermediary market, a top official of the China
Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) revealed here today.
</P>
<P>
Tang Yunxiang, vice-chairman of the CIRC told Xinhua in an
interview that the first stage of the watchdog's drive to regulate
the market, in which all the insurance agents have to participate,
would be finished by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
He explained that in the next stage, all agents will undergo
examinations set by the watchdog and that those who failed would
not be allowed to operate.
</P>
<P>
According to CIRC figures, China now has about 220,000 part-
time insurance agents employing nearly 600,000 people, as well as
over 500,000 individual agents, most of them selling life
insurance.
</P>
<P>
So far there are no approved insurance brokers or professional
agents in China. However Tang disclosed that the CIRC would
approve their establishment in the near future, if the go-ahead is
given by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for this, the supervisory authorities last year
promulgated draft regulations on the necessary qualifications
required.
</P>
<P>
Based on these regulations, on May 15 this year the CIRC held
the first national brokers' qualification examination. About 7,100
people sat for it.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Liu Jingsheng, a CIRC official in
charge of the intermediary sector said here today that there are
also plans to introduce loss adjusters although he gave no details.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the remarks at an international seminar on insurance
intermediaries, which opened here today and was attended by some
140 government officials and senior managers from major insurance
firms from China and abroad, as well as insurance experts and
scholars.
</P>
<P>
According to him, in 1998, more than 40 percent of the country'
s 49.9 billion yuan premium income for property insurance came
from agents, while over 80 percent of the 68.3 billion yuan
premium income for health and life insurance came from individual
salesmen.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Informs Pyongyang of Delegation List for Beijing Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government Thursday
informed the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) of a
list of its delegation to be sent to Beijing for an inter-Korea
vice ministerial meeting next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The list was conveyed via a hot line between the liaison
offices of the inter-Korean Red Cross organizations at the truce
village of Panmunjom Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Seoul asked Pyongyang to deliver its delegation list
after its acceptance of the message despite the military clash
which took place in the Yellow Sea Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Seoul proposed in the message that the delegations meet at
Kempinski Hotel in Beijing at 10 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Vice Unification Minister Yang Young-shik will
lead the three-member delegation to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, one day after the inter-Korean clash broke out,
the DPRK Committee of the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland
stated that it restricted or suspended the visits by South Koreans
to Pyongyang as well as contacts for the time being.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the statement will affect the
forthcoming vice-ministerial talks slated for next Monday to
discuss issues on reunion of separated family members.
</P>
<P>
At around 11:30 a.m. Thursday, three South Korean ships loaded
with 30,000 tons of fertilizer have left the South Korean port of
Ulsan for the DPRK after a half-day delay, said the South Korean
National Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
A Defense Ministry spokesman said Thursday afternoon that there
were no special symptoms of mounting tension in the recent two
days.
</P>
<P>
The calm in the sea followed an armed conflict, in which one
DPRK torpedo boat was sunken and three others were seriously
damaged while two South Korean patrol ships were slightly damaged
and seven servicemen wounded.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
formed an inter-agency body to monitor developments and gather
information related to the dioxin contamination of feed and
identified food products that came from Belgium, Netherlands,
France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara said Thursday that he has
created an ad hoc committee consisting of concerned bureaus of the
departments of agriculture, health, trade and industry, as well as
representatives of meat companies and meat importers.
</P>
<P>
He instructed the committee to formulate recommendations on
further action to be taken in relation to Agriculture Department's
Administrative Order No. 23, which suspends importation of
identified products from the four European countries.
</P>
<P>
The order covers only in-transit shipments of skimmed milk and
frozen meat originating from EU (European Union) countries other
than Belgium.
</P>

According to the order, release of the product requires a

"originates solely from animals from farms, which have not used
Belgian products and is free from dioxin contamination."

<HEADLINE> China to Enhance Science Cooperation With Portugal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said here on
Thursday that China and Portugal have promising potentials in
scientific and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Being one member of the European Union, Portugal can play a
bigger role in pushing forward scientific and technological
cooperation between China and European countries," said Jin
Zhonghua, an official with China's Ministry of Science and
Technology.
</P>
<P>
Jin made the remarks at the opening ceremony of a two-day
International Forum on Scientific and Technological Culture in
Europe and Asia held in Macao.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Europe has been China's important cooperative
partner, and the two can make use of each other's advantages for
mutual development.
</P>
<P>
Scientific and technological cooperation between China and
Portugal has been well under way since 1993 when the two
governments signed an agreement in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In March 1998, ministers in charge of science and technology
from the two countries signed a joint statement which laid a solid
foundation for further Sino-Portuguese cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, science officials of the two countries met in
Beijing and fixed on 19 cooperative projects covering agriculture,
biology, information, telecommunications, new materials and
environment.
</P>
<P>
"The field of Sino-Portuguese scientific and technological
cooperation is expanding and the cooperation is very promising,"
Jin said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Crackdown on Immoral International Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has decided to
crackdown on the so-called friendship calls which, government
officials said, are both costly and immoral, a local newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It is not illegal, but we have to protect the people from such
indecent services, especially young people who make most of the
calls," the Arab Times quoted director of the Telecom Department
at the Ministry of Communications Local Service Sector Mohammed
Al-Duaij as saying.
</P>
<P>
Al-Duaij said that the Ministry will cut off such "friendship"
lines with the technical capability it possesses.
</P>
<P>
Many subscribers, he said, approach the Ministry after
receiving huge bills for international calls, of which some
reached over 2,000 Kuwaiti dinars (6,600 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Usually made by male Kuwaitis aged between 16 to 25, the
international calls are made without the knowledge of parents who
are left with huge phone bills, he said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Duaij said some of the destinations of the "friendship"
calls, which increased since 1991 with the introduction of dialing
a joke service to Canada, are Jamaica, Chile, Moldova, Sierra
Leone as well as Canada.
</P>
<P>
It usually takes 20 to 25 minutes to make such a call.
</P>
<P>
"You will find there is bad conversations, indecent words
between boys and girls, because boys are seeking 'hot feelings'
from the other end," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that these calls may lead teenagers to commit crimes
such as raping their housemaid, because they "have no ability to
start a marriage and build a family immediately."

PARIS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- French troops joining the U.N.
Kosovo peace keeping operation force (KFOR) began entering the
northern Kosovo city of Kosovska Mitrovica Thursday morning,
reported Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
The move, which was made two days ahead of schedule, could be
aimed at preventing the infiltration by the ethnic Albanian
guerrillas, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), into the city.
</P>
<P>
Serb forces will pull out of the city within a few days,
leaving to French control the city with a majority Serb population.

of French troops in Kosovo, as saying that KFOR soldiers were
entering the city by helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The Leclerc tanks of the French army left Macedonia for
northern Kosovo early Thursday morning, he said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- As the Serbs are pulling out of Kosovo, the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) is taking over, causing some clashes between
the two sides from time to time. The Serb military withdrawal is
also resulting in an exodus of Serb civilians from Kosovo, with 38,
000 Serb civilians already fleeing to other parts of Serbia and
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Jute Mills to Lose 46.4 Mln Dollars in 1998-99 Fiscal Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The jute mills in Bangladesh are
going to incur a total loss of nearly 2.25 billion taka (46.4
million U.S. dollars) during the current July 1998-June 1999
fiscal year due to a sharp price gap between the production cost
and the export price of jute goods, an English newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total amount, the loss by public-sector jute mills is
likely to stand at around 1.5 billion taka (30.9 million dollars)
while the loss by the private sector mills is at 0.75 billion taka
(15.5 million dollars), The Financial Express said, quoting
concerned sources.
</P>
<P>
All the jute mills of the country were nationalized by the
government after independence in 1971. They have been incurring
heavy losses since then, and the government had also shared the
losses by providing cash subsidy and loss-financing against jute
goods exports, they said.
</P>
<P>
In December 1982, 35 state-owned jute mills were handed over to
the private sector and another 32 mills remained under the
Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC).
</P>
<P>
During the period from 1972 to 1982, the government provided
950 million taka (19.6 million dollars) as cash subsidy, 820
million taka (16.9 million dollars) as export subsidy and 3.59
billion taka (74 million dollars) in the form of equity infusion.
</P>
<P>
Besides, under the Jute Sector Adjustment Credit Program
introduced by the World Bank, the country's jute mills received
9.46 billion taka (195.2 million dollars) in the form of
loss-financing from 1992 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
Tough competition in the world markets, increase in labor
wages, introduction of peak-hour electricity rate for the jute
mills, major devaluation of the Indian currency and higher
production cost than the export prices were responsible for losses
incurred by the jute mills, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the production costs of country's jute goods are
estimated at nearly 30 percent higher than their prices in the
international markets, they said.
</P>
<P>
A large number of looms both in public and private sector mills
had to be closed down over the years and many other are facing
closure.
</P>
<P>
Presently, some 12,000 out of the 16,000 looms in the MJMC
mills are in operation while the number of operational looms in
private sector mills are estimated at 4,500 against the previous
number of 9,500.
</P>
<P>
The prices of jute goods are showing a sharp downtrend in the
international markets over the past few years, and prices of jute
goods had declined by around four percent in 1998-99 fiscal year
compared to the previous one.
</P>
<P>
The price of exported jute goods during July-April of the
1998-99 fiscal year was recorded at 618.47 dollars per ton against
the price at 641.85 dollars in the last fiscal year, according to
statistics of Export Promotion Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Jute is Bangladesh's main cash crop, and as many as 25 percent
of the total population are involved with the jute-related
activities and around 250,000 workers are directly dependent on
jute, and another 100,000 traders also earn their livelihood from
jute business.
</P>
<P>
The jute sector is also a major foreign exchange earner of the
country, which fetches around 325 million dollars per annum from
exporting jute goods.

<P>
ANKARA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish State Minister Sukru Sina Gerel accused the G-8
countries of involving into the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the most proper method to handle the Cyprus issue
was the continuation of the United Nations goodwill mission
carried out by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his Cyprus
envoys.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a June 10 statement by the group's foreign
ministers, which calls for an immediate resumption of the dialog
between the two Cypriot sides with no preconditions, and their
upcoming summit in Cologne, Germany, where the Cyprus issue will
be again on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit warned Greece to stop
supporting terrorism, saying that "Turkish-Greek relations can
only improve if Greece stops supporting terrorist organizations."
There was evidence proving the links between the Greek officials
and Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Russia is expected to transfer its troops through Turkish
straits to Kosovo in a bid to strengthen its position in the
region.

Fourthly, the U.S. targets databases are updated frequently
with clearly distinguished target list and no-hit list. The U.S.
argument that the Chinese Embassy was mistakenly fed into the
databases as the FDSP does not hold ground.
</P>
<P>
Fifthly, the explanation given by the U.S. side that its review
process failed to detect and correct the intelligence errors is
inconceivable. Many people in the U.S. know the locations of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and the FDSP. How could the U.S.
intelligence authorities fail to consult any of them? This is
against military operational rules and common sense.
</P>
<P>
For the target list, the U.S. side has always claimed that it
has a whole set of stringent review procedures throughout the
process of reconnaissance, identification and final selection. The
technical departments concerned would not determine the intended
targets unless they were in no doubt about them. The same is true
concerning whether to make such a strike and in what manner to
carry out the strike. They would verify, review and modify the
target package in the light of changes. With such strict review
procedures, why did errors occur at every stage and none of them
was corrected?

The Chinese side emphatically pointed out that by attacking the
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, the United States not only
encroached upon the state sovereignty and national dignity valued
most by the 12.5 billion Chinese people, but also seriously
violated the fundamental human right to life. It has thus
seriously hurt the national feelings of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people sternly condemn and strongly protest against
this action. The just position of the Chinese people has gained
extensive sympathy, understanding and support from the
international community and peoples of the world.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government must give full recognition to the serious
nature of the attack incident, give serious attention to the
Chinese government's solemn position and demands, conduct a
comprehensive and thorough investigation and severely punish the
perpetrators so as to give, with concrete actions, a satisfactory
account and explanation to the Chinese government and people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side pointed out that the attack of the Chinese
embassy constituted an act of international unlawfulness on the
part of the United States. The Chinese side demands that the U.S.
government should take full compensation responsibility and make
prompt, adequate and effective compensations for the Chinese loss
of lives, injuries and loss of property.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Burns Banned Fishing Nets to Protect Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has destroyed more
than 3, 900 banned fishing nets and punished a number of convicts
involved in a major crackdown on illegal fishing activities in
Lake Victoria, the largest one in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ten people have been arrested and jailed, 25 others fined and
140 cases are still pending in court, Daily News reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The fishing gear included 3,105 under-five inch gill nets, 518
beach seine nets, 214 under-ten millimeter seine nets and
monofilament nets, worth 327.6 million shillings (about 460,000
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The action to burn the nets was supervised by the police and
fisheries officials Tuesday in the Mwanza Region on the southern
shore of the lake, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for the Fisheries Department in Mwanza
Region to destroy illegal fishing gear which over-exploited
fishery resources in the lake, bordering Tanzania, Uganda and
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Eight months ago, the department destroyed banned fishing gear
worth 255. 7 million shillings in Mwanza, said the Mwanza Regional
Acting Fisheries Officer, William Fundi.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent research done by the Kenya Marine and
Fisheries Research Institute, over the last two decades, the
fishing gears used in the lake have become increasingly
non-selective.
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the most commonly caught Nile perch weighed about 50
to 100 kilograms. In 1996, the weight of a tail of such fish was
reduced to five and 10 kilograms, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
Fundi warned people to stop using illegal means for fishing as
the crackdown operation is still going on.
</P>
<P>
Unscrupulous fishermen have also been blasted for using
explosives and chemical substances for fishing, threatening the
eco-system of the lake.

Pickering stated that the U.S. side understood the feelings of
the Chinese government and people over the bombing of the Chinese
Embassy and that the U.S. side recognized its responsibility to
report the results of the investigation to the Chinese side. He
said the U.S. side is willing to settle the issue of the Chinese
loss of lives and injuries and loss of property and is ready to
hold discussions with the Chinese side over this issue. He
emphasized that President Clinton and the U.S. government attach
great importance to U.S.-China relations and remain committed to
the development of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side made it clear that the Chinese government had
always attached importance to the improvement and development of
China-U.S. relations. But principles must be upheld in developing
Sino-U.S. relations. That is, their improvement and development
must be based on the basic norms governing the international
relations, especially on the principles of mutual respect for
sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in each
other's internal affairs. It is up to one who tied the knot to
untie it. Whoever started the trouble should end it. The U.S. side
must face squarely the severe consequences of its attack on the
Chinese embassy and the effect on China-U.S. relations, take
practical action and handle this incident properly, so as to
create necessary conditions and an atmosphere for bilateral
relations to return to a normal track.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Three members of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) were wounded Thursday in Lebanese
guerrillas' attack in south Lebanon, the Voice of the People radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The three militiamen were hit by a roadside bomb detonated by
Lebanese guerrillas at Dier Saryan on the verge of the Israeli
occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The militia also discovered another six bombs in the eastern
sector of the occupied zone, the radio quoted security sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attack, saying its fighters launched a
series of operations, including bombing ambushes, against Israeli
occupation forces and SLA from Wednesday night till Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes raided suspected Hezbollah bases in Lebanon's
eastern area of West Bekaa Valley and villages on the verge of the
occupied zone in retaliation to Hezbollah's attacks.
</P>
<P>
There has been no immediate report of casualties from the air
blast.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to dislodge Israeli forces and SLA
out of the country.

outskirts of the city in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
 It is estimated there are now only 50 or more South China

<P>
 The zoo's five remaining tigers will also be moved in a

and cost seven million yuan to construct.
</P>
<P>
 With a total area of four hectares, the breeding center
boasts the most up to date equipment and has 30 cages, as well as
extensive veterinary, research and monitoring facilities,
including 16 pick-up cameras, to keep checks on those tigers in
labour.
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, more than 30 South China tigers have been bred
artificially in Suzhou Zoo, which is regarded as Number One
worldwide for its breeding skills involving endangered species.
</P>

More than half of South China tigers which now scatter around

urged the Kosovar Liberation Army (KLA) to lay down its arms and
become a "political force."

In a statement to a joint session of the senate and lower house
foreign affairs committees, Dini noted that NATO and the KLA are
currently negotiating such terms and conditions as abstaining from
acts of aggression, turning over heavy weaponry, and giving up
their uniforms. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema called
on the Kosovar leaders to cooperate in disarming the KLA, adding
that the reconstruction of peace in the war-ridden Balkans was
facing many difficulties and the international community was
required to make a "very serious commitment." (Italy-Dini-KLA)

Bulgaria made the decision only hours after receiving Moscow's

Third, the target review process failed to detect and correct
the afore-said two mistakes. While this target of what was
believed to be the FDSP facility came under review, the system of
checks that U.S. and European command forces had in place to catch
target errors did not at any level reveal the mistake. No one, at
any stage in the process realized that the bombs were aimed at the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. As the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
was not connected in any way to the U.S. intent to strike the FDSP
headquarters, no one had ever tried to consult those who knew the
address of the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, the air strike then proceeded as
planned. At 2146 Zulu on May 7, 1999, one of the fleet of B-2
bombers from Whiteman Air Force Base (AFB) in Missouri dropped
five JDAMs-2000 pound all-weather GPS-guided bombs on the wrong
target of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. The air crew had no way
of seeing the national flag in front of the Chinese Embassy or any
such identifying markers at night and at the speeds and altitudes
at which the U.S. planes were flying, neither had they got any
idea that they were in fact bombing the Chinese Embassy. More

</P>
<P>
The U.S. intended target was the headquarters of the Yugoslav
Federal Directorate for Supply and Procurement (FDSP). To locate
physically the address of the intended target, two maps produced
by Yugoslavia in 1989 and 1996 respectively and a 1997 National
Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) map were used.
</P>
<P>
None of these maps had any reference to the FDSP building, and
none had accurately identified the current location of the Chinese
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 U.S. Government map shows the Chinese Embassy in Old
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
In the process of locating the target, a U.S. intelligence
officer, in breach of operational rules, employed techniques that
are used in the field by the Army.
</P>
<P>
These techniques involve the assumption of target locations of
a street by comparing the pattern and numbering system of its
parallel streets, and they can only be used for general geographic
location, but are totally inappropriate for precision targeting
for air attacks.
</P>
<P>
Using this process, the intelligence officer mistakenly
determined that the building of the Chinese Embassy was the FDSP
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The second major error stemmed from the flawed U.S. databases,
Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that U.S. officials had visited the Chinese
Embassy at its new address on a number of occasions in recent
years, the new location was never fed into the U.S. intelligence
or military targeting databases.
</P>
<P>
These databases has not been duly updated and still identified
the location of the Chinese Embassy in Old Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, when the incorrect location of the FDSP building
was fed into several U.S. databases for review, none of the
databases had detected the error. The U.S. satellite imagery
photos did not indicate any clear markings of the Chinese Embassy
either.

<HEADLINE> At Least 8 Killed in Philippine Troops, Rebels Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 8 people were killed
Wednesday during an encounter between Philippine government troops
and New People's Army (NPA) rebels in Davao city in the southern
Philippines, a report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine SNN TV station said in a report that the government
troops were conducting a routine patrol in the city when they were
ambushed by some 100 NPA rebels.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted army officials as saying that at least six
government soldiers were killed and two were wounded, while two
NPA rivals were killed.
</P>
<P>
Some government soldiers were still missing while more troops
were deployed in the encounter area to pursue the rebels, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
A series of clashes have been reported since the NPA withdrew
from the peace talks with the government on May 28 to protest
against the Senate's ratification of the Visiting Forces
Agreement, which allows the resumption of large-scale military
exercises with the United States in the country.

The CIA and the Defense Department of the United States are,
Pickering said, continuing to interview individuals in the field
who were involved in various aspects of the decisions that led to
the bombing. Because the NATO air campaign against FRY has only
just concluded, it has not been possible to debrief fully every
person involved and to reach conclusions regarding responsibility
for mistakes that led to the bombing. The internal reviews are
still going on in the United States. When these reviews are

will be taken.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister Casts Doubts on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The outgoing Defense Minister
Moshe Arens has raised doubts over the U.S. military aid toward
Israel, suggesting that the annual 1.8 billion U.S.-dollar
military grants to Israel may be detrimental to the state.
</P>
<P>
Arens said this in an interview with the Jerusalem Post, which
published part of the interview Thursday and the full test of the
interview will come out Friday.
</P>
<P>
Arens said that large amount of the grants has been spent in
the United States hurtting the local industries and making it more
difficult for Israeli firms to develop quality arms.
</P>
<P>
Of the total U.S. military grants, 1.4 billion must be spent in
the United States and as a result "we are actually purchasing
things in the United States that we could be procuring here,"
Arens pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, we are not developing certain capabilities
that we could be developing and we are not developing certain
systems that would not only give the IDF (Israel Defense Force) an
advantage in the battle-field, but could also serve as a potential
export items, such as the Arrow," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arens said he has asked the Defense Ministry to conduct a study
examining if the U.S. military aid is "in the best interest of the
Israeli industry."
</P>
<P>
"You have to remember that the U.S. aid program was designed to
aid U.S. industry. It was not just giving away presents. We are
allies of the United States and we are all for aiding
U.S. industry, but of course we have to weigh the question of
(wether to) pursue a policy that hurts Israel industry," he added.
</P>
<P>
Arens was the first Israeli government official raising
doubts about the U.S. military aid to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The United States provides 3 billion U.S. dollars as grants to
Israel annually. 1.8 billion dollars are military aids, and the
remaining part are economic grants.
</P>
<P>
Arens replaced former defense minister Yitzhak Mordechai in
January and till now he has not decided to purchase another 50
U.S. fighter jets, worthing 2.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Arrow is a anti-missile defense system Israel jointly developing
with the United States. The system succeeded in firing at
a computer-controlled target last August and would be deployed
first in Israel during the coming years.

PHNOM PENH, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian National Assembly
President Prince Norodom Ranariddh left here Thursday for
Guangzhou to begin his week-long official visit to China at the
invitation of his Chinese counterpart Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
He was seen off at the Pochentong Airport by Vice President of
the Assembly Heng Samrin and government leaders as well as some
diplomats including Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Yan Tingai.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the visit is to further strengthen the
traditional friendly and cooperative relations between the two

to come and invest in Cambodia," Ranariddh told reporters.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for Ranariddh to visit China since he
became president of the National Assembly last November.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, the prince will meet with top Chinese leaders
such as Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the

The Chinese side pointed out that on May 8, U.S.-led NATO
attacked the Chinese Embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
causing huge human casualties and severe damages to the premises
of the embassy. It has thus trampled on the U.N. Charter and the
basic norms governing international relations, and constituted a
gross violation of China's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, on behalf of the entire Chinese people,
the Chinese government lodged the strongest protest with U.S.-led
NATO, demanding that U.S.-led NATO bear full responsibility for it,
officially and openly apologize to the Chinese government, the
Chinese people and the families of the victims, undertake a
comprehensive and thorough investigation into the incident,
publish in detail the findings of the investigation and severely
punish the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
We have taken note of the apology extended to the Chinese
government and people by the government and leaders of the U.S.
and some of the other NATO member states.
</P>
<P>
We have also taken note that the U.S. side has conducted
investigation into the incident. However, it must be pointed out
that the explanations the U.S. side has supplied so far for the
cause of the incident are not convincing and that the conclusion
that it was a so-called mistaken bombing is by no means acceptable
to the Chinese government and people.

<HEADLINE> China Does Not Accept U.S. Explanation (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First of all, it was impossible for the U.S. side not to know
the accurate location of the Chinese Embassy in FRY. The U.S. side
claims that it made an error in locating the FRY FDSP building due
to its use of old maps published by Yugoslavia in 1989 and 1996
and by NIMA of the U.S. in 1997 that had not accurately identified
the correct location of the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side finds it difficult to believe why the U.S.
side put so much value on and faith in the out-dated maps
published by Yugoslavia. The U.S. side also acknowledges that
there are many maps which show the correct location of the Chinese
Embassy in FRY. Why then did the U.S. side not use these maps?
</P>
<P>
In its recent statement entitled Chinese Embassy Bombing, NIMA
pointed out that "recent news reports regarding the accuracy of
NIMA maps have been inaccurate or incomplete". Therefore, the
argument that the NIMA map contributed to the mistaken bombing
doesn't hold water.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the Embassy building is of a distinct traditional
Chinese architectural style with such clear markings as the
national emblem on the facade of the main building and a sign
plate at the main entrance. And the FDSP is a public agency which
many foreign diplomats have visited. There is a long distance
between the FDSP and the Chinese Embassy and there is virtually no
exterior resemblance between the two buildings.
</P>
<P>
Equipped with a full array of the most sophisticated
reconnaissance means, the U.S. could not possibly have mistaken
the Embassy building for the FDSP building.

<P>
Second, everything points to the fact that the U.S. side knew
fully well the overall layout of foreign missions in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all, the U.S. had been planning for the strikes
against FRY for a long time. Long before the military actions
against FRY, it had been photographing, mapping and surveying all
parts of Yugoslavia, Belgrade in particular, by various high-tech
means.
</P>
<P>
In the many rounds of bombings against FRY targets in central
Belgrade, efforts were made to avoid bombing foreign embassies in
Yugoslavia that were located in a short distance of only dozens or
hundreds of meters from the targets. This shows that the U.S. was
clear about the intended targets and the no-hit targets.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the U.S. claim of locating the FDSP, an intended
target for air strike, by employing a method that is used in the
field by the Army is not logical. The U.S. side admits that all
other targets have been located with other more accurate target
locating techniques, why was the army technique of land navigation
used to locate what the U.S. believed to be an important target?
</P>
<P>
According to the presentation made by the U.S. side, it took
the U.S. military command and its intelligence community and NATO
a long time to plan and identify this target. How could they
explain that an American intelligence officer would suddenly adopt
a totally different target-locating technique in violation of the
operational rules? The U.S. explanation is not convincing at all.
</P>
<P>
According to the on-site inspection made by the Chinese side
after the attack, five bombs hit different parts of the Embassy
building with 100% delivery accuracy. This proves that the U.S.
side had a very detailed knowledge of the building structure of
the Embassy and that it must have conducted careful and accurate
reconnaissance over it in advance.

CANBERRA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen people, including two

A twin-engine turbo-prop Bandierante aircraft operated by PNG
domestic carrier Airlink crashed about 19.3 kilometers southeast

<HEADLINE> China Looking for Solution to Catch Elusive Winter Olympics Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China is so eager to break its
duck at the Winter Olympic Games arenas that it will focus its
attention for the following three years upon the first Olympic
gold in the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
One year after the disappointing 18th Nagano Winter Olympics in
1998, hundreds of winter sports officials across the country were
gathering together in the Capital Stadium conference center to
find a way out.
</P>
<P>
"An Olympic gold is our premier goal in three years," said Xiao
Tian, director of the Winter Sports Management Center, at the
opening speech of the national meeting in Beijing on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We have had all kinds of gold medals in our trophy room except
the Olympic gold, which is our biggest regret in the past two
decades," Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
China won six silvers and two bronzes in the Nagano Winter
Olympics last February in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Li Jiajun led the almost overwhelming short-track team to five
silvers and one bronze in the Games, but the gold always eluded
the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
In a team boasting four to five world-class skaters, Li wrapped
up the men's overall title in the world cup series in 1998 while
Yang Yang (A) swept the women's competition last season.
</P>
<P>
Such fluctuating performances continues to perplex the sports
officials and they hope Thursday's meeting will help them find the
answer.
</P>
<P>
"No matter how much we have improved in the past years, the
elusive Olympic gold is the proof of our short-comings in training
and the lack of experiences at internationals," Xiao added.
</P>
<P>
"We're seeking for a breakthrough in the 19th Winter Games. I
believe we can make it."

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Acid Rain Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Acid rain remains a serious
problem to ecological environment in parts of China and a series
of urgent measures have been taken to try and control such
pollution, according to the latest environmental situation report.
</P>
<P>
The annual report released by the State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA) says that sulphur dioxide and
dust are the main pollutants of China's air.
</P>
<P>
However, the total volume of sulphur dioxide, smog and
industrial dust released in China last year dropped by 7.8 percent,
7.7 percent and 12.2 percent respectively, compared with 1997,
according to the report. And the treatment rate of industrial
waste gas reached 89.4 percent, up one percentage point.
</P>
<P>
The report says about 30 percent of China's total land area
suffered from acid rain as a result of smog and dust pollution
last year. The acid rain pollution in central China was alleviated
last year, while in the south, east and southwestern parts of the
country it remained the same as 1997.
</P>
<P>
Some cities in south China including Lin'an, Zhuzhou, Yiyang,
Nanchang and Changsha suffered serious acid rain pollution last
year. And Tumen in northeast China and Qingdao in east China had
no major improvements, according to the SEPA report.
</P>
<P>
In order to control acid rain, China has established acid rain
and sulphur dioxide pollution control zones covering 1.09 million
square kilometers, in which mines producing coal with sulphur
content of over three percent are banned.
</P>
<P>
A plan to further control acid rain and sulphur dioxide
pollution is being drawn up by the SEPA.

BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The expansion of Beijing's
international airport has been completed after four years'
construction work and will officially open in October.
</P>
<P>
The new passenger building, covering an area of 330,000 square
meters, is three times larger than the existing one and has
transformed Capital Airport into a modern, dynamic air-passenger
hub which rivals those in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The building boasts 51 elevators, 63 moving stairways and 26
moving footpaths. Laser scan technology will be used for luggage
checks.
</P>
<P>
Computer aided aircraft guiding systems, security equipment and
information display boards are all first rate, according to
airport sources. Test will start next month to check the
reliability of the systems.
</P>
<P>
The development is a national key project aimed at transforming
Beijing into an international metropolis. The new airport will be
able to receive 35 million passengers and 190,000 aircraft a year.
</P>
<P>
The original airport was built in the 1950s and was first
expanded in the 1970s.

SEOUL, June 17 (Xinhua) -- FIFA President Sepp Blatter said
here on Thursday that South Korea and Japan should co-host the
2001 Confederations Cup in order to prepare for the 2002 World Cup
soccer finals in these two countries.
</P>
<P>
"There is now an idea, which I will bring to you, to use the
Confederations Cup in the year 2001 as a rehearsal in Korea and
Japan," Blatter told foreign reporters.

South Korea and Japan will co-host the 2002 World Cup and it
will be the first time that World Cup Finals be staged in Asia and

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni,
who attended the inauguration of democratically-elected South
African President Thabo Mbeki in Pretoria, hailed the hand-over as
an example for other countries on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said after the ceremony that the successful transition
 consolidated democracy in the country, the New Vision paper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said he was happy about the transition, which happened to
coincide with "a generational transition from the old freedom
fighters to their children who fought with them."
</P>
<P>
An editorial in the same paper described the peaceful transfer
of power aptly representing sacrifices translated to democracy.
</P>
<P>
Change of government is often a point of crisis in most African
states. South Africa now stands out as a case to be emulated, the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
It said that free and fair election is the key to peaceful
transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who assumed the office of 80-year-old Nelson Mandela,
pledged in his acceptance speech to speed the delivery of a better
life to millions of poor blacks and to minimize crimes.
</P>
<P>
Museveni is one of the 27 African heads of state and
representatives from nearly 130 countries who witnessed the grand
ceremony.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak is convinced that
a broad-based government will be established following the
decision on Wednesday by Shas's Council of Toran Sages to accept
Aryeh Deri's resignation as the party leader. Senior sources in the
left-wing One Israel coalition said that Barak will ask the
Knesset (parliament) to expand the cabinet from 18 seats to 24 in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak is unwilling to hold
coalition talks with the right-wing Likud Party and its temporary
leader Ariel Sharon until the party holds its primaries and elects
a permanent leader in about two and a half months, sources said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that it was conceivable that after the
government is formed "the door will remain open for the Likud,
too, after its leadership contest."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- In a bid to include the powerful Shas Party into his
coalition government, Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak has
made compromise over the issue of drafting religious students into
the army.
</P>
<P>
A senior source in the left-wing One Israel coalition
said on Wednesday that Barak would not insist on limiting the
number of the religious students who would be exempted from the
service in the army, and a special committee including members
from the religious parties would make the decision over the
issue.

<HEADLINE> World Energy Demand Down Slightly in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 16 (Xinhua) -- World energy demand fell by 0.
1 percent in 1998, the first fall since 1982, according to a
review report released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"After almost a decade of relative stability in global energy
markets, 1998 saw a number of other adverse changes," said the BP
Amoco Statistical Review of World Energy 1999. BP Amoco group is
the result of a merger earlier this year between British Petroleum
and Amoco of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Energy demand from the Asian economies was hit by their
economic downturn, declining by 1.5 percent overall, with falls of
more than 6 percent seen in South Korea and Thailand, and
additional declines in both Indonesia and Japan, the review said.
</P>
<P>
In China's energy market, the review said, the year saw
exceptional change, with demand sliding by 3.2 percent --
equivalent to a 0.3 percent global drop -- despite an increasing
gross domestic product. "This may suggest structural changes in
the Chinese market toward lower energy intensity and a move away
from coal," the review said.
</P>
<P>
Demand from the former Soviet Union fell by only 0.3 percent.
But by 1998 demand from these countries had fallen 36 percent from
its 1990 peak -- a drop equivalent to 6 percent of current global
demand.
</P>
<P>
According to the BP Amoco review, the world oil markets
suffered severe disruption in 1998. Oil demand was weak, growing
by only 0.1 percent, while oil production rose by 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The world gas market was also weak, with demand up just 1.3
percent, largely due to a 3 percent fall in gas demand from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
A 6 percent fall in production of coal in China, the world's
largest producer, contributed to the 2.4 percent fall in global
production. Weak demand from China and Europe's continuing move
away from coal were reflected in the 2.1 percent fall in global
consumption.
</P>
<P>
A 7.2 percent rise in consumption of nuclear power in the U.S.
contributed to a global rise of 1.6 percent. Use of hydroelectric
power rose 1.1 percent, rising for the sixth successive year, the
review said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Telephone Company Seeks Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A Sri Lankan telephone company is
seeking a 120 million U.S. dollar loan for network expansion to
boost its depressed business, financial sources here said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lanka Bell's Chief Executive Officer Vijay Watson said the
money was needed for their second phase of expansion. It has
invested 140 million dollars to date.
</P>
<P>
Equipment vendor Nortel of Canada, which owns a 6 percent stake
in Lanka Bell, is willing to contribute 60 million dollars for the
expansion, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
While the balance has to be sourced through debt financing from
overseas, investor sentiment remains low both due to the East
Asian financial crisis and the regulatory environment in Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Several funding agencies including the International Finance
Corporation have conducted a study on Lanka Bell but have not
taken a decision yet on committing funds.
</P>
<P>
Lanka Bell so far provides 33,000 connections while its
immediate competitor Suntel provides nearly 50,000 connections.
</P>
<P>
Both companies have been given specific targets such as
geographical reach and connections in rural areas by year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Allow Local Language Subtitling of Foreign Videos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will allow captioning of
Myanmar subtitles or dubbing in Myanmar language of imported
foreign feature videos, The New Light of Myanmar Thursday quoted
the Ministry of Information as saying.
</P>
<P>
The undertakings will be allowed if the copy-right owner
permits, according to the Myanmar Motion Picture Enterprise of the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The foreign videos and tapes must have already been approved
for public and family show, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, there have been foreign feature films telecast
by two Myanmar state-run television stations with Myanmar
subtitles on them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, production of local video films grows rapidly
because of high demand.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, 547 local video films were
produced in 1998, much more than motion pictures which were only
15.
</P>
<P>
In order to properly control and manage the video industry, the
ministry revised last December some rules under the existing 1996
Television and Video Law, revoking some television and video
procedures.
</P>
<P>
The Video Censor Board was also established to check films and
videos in accordance with concerned policies, rules and standards
to make sure they are suitable to be shown to the public.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Boost Exports with New Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Thai ministers from finance,
industry, agriculture, commerce and related government agencies
will gather together and discuss the way to keep exports levels as
high as possible in the second half of this year, The Nation said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The second so-called "Export Summit" will be organized by the
Export Development Committee in late July, which aimed at closely
monitoring progress of exports, the newspaper quoted Deputy Prime
Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government holds the summit to bolster exports as it is
worried that exports could plunge during the rest of the year,
dragging the economy with it, Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
In March, the government held its first summit meeting,
implementing many export-friendly measures, such as cash flow
supports and import tariff exemptions.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Thailand's exports appeared to have recovered from
declines in three consecutive months in 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics of the Customs Department, the
country's export value in revenue in U.S. dollar terms in April
grew 4.7 percent to 4.53 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Supachai predicted Wednesday that the exports in May will
increase by least 6 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said he believed that Thailand's exports can grow by 4
percent to 56.6 billion dollars throughout the year as targeted.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Thailand's exports shrank 9 percent, when the total
gross domestic product contracted 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said after monitoring for several months the movements
of 13 important export products such as integrated circuits,
vehicles, plastic products, computers, values were found to have
increased sharply.
</P>
<P>
Those products accounted for 68 percent of Thailand's total
exports.

<HEADLINE> Experts Discuss Protection on Migrant Women's Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Legal experts and women's
federation workers are calling for more specific laws and special
organizations to guarantee adequate care for the growing number of
migrant women workers.
</P>
<P>
They made the proposal in Beijing Wednesday during the first
day of a three-day national symposium organized by China Women's
News for examining ways of protecting migrant women worker's
rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
Participants from 20 provinces are discussing issues relating
to migrant women workers' rights and interests, their education
levels, training and marriages.
</P>
<P>
The term "migrant women workers" usually refers to rural girls
who move to cities to find work. They are commonly employed as
housekeepers, waitresses or by toy or textile factories.
</P>
<P>
"These women are vulnerable to infringements upon their rights
and interests, due to their low education levels and insufficient
awareness of their rights," said Zhou Wanling, an official with
the Legal Consultancy Division of the All-China Federation of
Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
They are likely, due to the same reason, to find themselves in
unfavorable positions with their employers.
</P>
<P>
"To help these women protect themselves, lawyers and women's
federation workers should teach them about their rights, and how
they can effectively safeguard these rights,' Miao Zhennan, vice-
director of the Women Studies Institute under the Sichuan
Federation of Women, said, quoted by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Training courses should be offered regularly to migrant women
workers, she added.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's State Firms Making Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- While state-owned enterprises in
most parts of China are suffering deficits, their counterparts in
the Tibet Autonomous Region are beginning to become profitable as
a whole.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, local government has helped state companies
deal with management problems, backward technology and lack of
information, and has, meanwhile, issued favorable policies to help
them improve operations.
</P>
<P>
So far, five Tibet-headquartered state firms have been listed,
while many other companies have experienced changes and reforms of
various types, including rebuilding of managerial mechanism and
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the state sector generated 17 million yuan worth of
profits as a whole, with only 10 percent of state-owned
enterprises still in the red.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, a number of locally produced name-brand products sell
well throughout the country, such as Zhufeng motorcycles and
Qizheng Tibetan medicine.
</P>
<P>
Some state companies in Tibet have cooperated with inland firms.
The Lhasa Brewery was once trapped in a loss of 27 million yuan,
but its fate was changed in 1995, when a company from neighboring
Sichuan Province took over part of its stocks by investing 36
million yuan in the brewery.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the brewery, the largest in the autonomous region,
achieved a sales income of more than 50 million yuan, with its
profits and taxes exceeding 10 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Cycling Body Seeks Sponsors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Cycling Association
(ISSI) is seeking sponsors to help its cyclists obtain sports
equipment and finance trips to overseas events, The Jakarta Post
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
ISSI's deputy secretary-general Sofyan Ruziat said that donors
were badly needed because the association was short of funds,
particularly to prepare the cyclists for the 20th Southeast Asia (
SEA) Games in Brunei in August.
</P>
<P>
"We sent proposals to the TIKI group (a courier service company)
to contribute some money to buy the cycling equipment, but there
has been no reply," said Sofyan, who is also the cycling training
director.
</P>
<P>
He said 1.5 million rupiah (206 U.S. dollars) disbursed by the
National Sports Council (KONI) for the cyclists was insufficient
to send mountain bikers to an overseas tryout in Australia
scheduled for the second week in July.
</P>
<P>
Sofyan said each athlete would need at least 5 million rupiah
for the tryout.
</P>
<P>
"We want the cyclists to go to Australia, but we have to count
our savings first," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the association would need some 200 million rupiah
to buy bicycle equipment such as tires, chains and shock breakers.
</P>
<P>
"We have asked the SEA Games project manager for the money, but
we have not yet received the nod on our request. It will be OK if
we only receive half of the amount," he said.
</P>
<P>
ISSI is grooming eight road racers and nine mountain bikers for
the SEA Games, which is to be held for the first time in Brunei
from August 7 to 15.
</P>
<P>
The association has set a target of winning three of seven
golds at stake in this year's biennial event.
</P>
<P>
Gold is expected in the men's individual time trails and the
men's and women's mountain bike events.

<HEADLINE> Megawati Gets Military, Party Support for Presidential Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Armed Forces (TNI) and
the National Mandate Party (PAN) Wednesday both expressed their
support for Megawati Soekarnoputri, chairwoman of the Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) which continued its lead in
the vote count of the June 7 elections, to be the next president.
</P>
<P>
Controversy has arisen over the gender of the next president,
which the PDI-P claims is a maneuver to bar the party's chairwoman
from contesting the presidential race. The Muslim-based United
Development Party (PPP) has recommended that only a male Muslim
candidate be eligible for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
TNI Chief of Territorial Affairs Lt. Gen. Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono reiterated that the TNI was hoping that the best citizen
in the state, "either a man or a woman," would be elected
president.
</P>
<P>
TNI high command has not issued any order to its faction in the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) to throw its support behind
any particular presidential candidate, national newspapers
Thursday quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under Indonesia's constitution, it is the MPR that is empowered
to choose the president. The MPR is scheduled to meet in November.
</P>
<P>
The MPR, the country's supreme legislative body, will comprise
the House of Representatives (DPR) members plus 200 appointed
regional and interest groups' representatives. The House itself
will have 500 members, 462 of whom will come from the 48 political
parties that contested the June 7 general election. The remaining
38 members will be military and policemen appointed by the TNI
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, TNI deputy spokesman Brig. Gen. Sudrajat
said, "We do not discriminate between men and women in terms of
leadership, as long as the people agree to elect her and as long
as the election is democratic, transparent, free and fair."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the military would use its political weight to
push democracy and protect the unity of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PAN General Chairman Amien Rais Rais said that he
had buried his dreams of becoming president and implied that the
president's gender was not of concern to PAN.
</P>
<P>
"According to the Holy Qur'an, which I believe as absolutely
right because it was revealed from the Almighty, both men and
women are on an equal footing," Rais said.
</P>
<P>
Enjoying a lion's share of votes in provisional tallies, the
PDI-P is widely expected to maintain its lead until the completion
of the vote counting process and the formal declaration of the
polls.
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday morning, according to the General Elections
Commission (KPU), the PDI-P was leading with 18 million votes,
followed by the National Awakening Party (PKB) with 9.2 million
votes, ruling Golkar Party with 8 million, PPP with 4.6 million
and PAN with 3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial results from the Joint Operation Media
Center which had counted over 70 million votes, the PDI-P was also
on top, but Golkar was in second place, trailed by PKB, PPP and
PAN.
</P>
<P>
General Chairman of Golkar Akbar Tanjung Wednesday admitted
that there appeared to be little chance that his party would catch
up with the PDI-P in the collection of votes.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said that second place was still respectable.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the final results of the election will be
issued by the KPU on June 21.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Hubei Province in Central China
will use 15 million U.S. dollars in World Bank loans for
afforestation and poverty reduction this year, according to a
provincial official.
</P>
<P>
The loans, the third batch from the international financial
institution, will enable the Chinese province to plant various
trees in an area of 38,000 hectares, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Total investment in the poverty relief-oriented afforestation
project is estimated at 226 million yuan (about 27 million U.S.
dollars), he said, adding that all the World Bank money will be
directed to 15 poverty-stricken counties.
</P>
<P>
The previous two batches of World Bank loans and their
counterpart funds for the specially designed projects, with a
combined value of more than 600 million yuan (some 72 million U.S.
dollars), have been used to plant trees on more than 100,000
hectares of land, the official said.

<P>
WELLINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley will visit northeast Asia from July 17 to 25 to
continue her talks with leaders of members of Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC).
</P>
<P>
In a media release issued by the Prime Minister's Office here
Thursday, Shipley said that this will be her second trip to
northeast Asia and follows her visits to north and south America
this year in advance of the informal meeting of APEC leaders in
September in Auckland, the largest city of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"As chair of APEC, I've made it my objective to talk to as many
APEC leaders as possible to ensure this year's meeting is
successful," she said in the media release.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said that during her next month's trip, she will meet
with leaders, ministers and senior business representatives in
China, the Republic of Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
So far this year she has met the leaders of Canada, the United
States, Australia, Peru, Chile and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that as well as advancing New Zealand's
APEC aims, she will review bilateral relations during the visit.
</P>
<P>
"These are hugely important markets for New Zealand. It is
therefore encouraging that they are beginning to show signs of
recovery from the recent economic downturn in the region. We now
need work for achieving sustainable growth as a region," Shipley
said.
</P>
<P>
"Such growth is tremendously important for New Zealand
exporters and I'll be working on behalf of New Zealand to help
open up more trade opportunities," she added.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's GDP Grows By 2.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's gross domestic product
(GDP) in real terms grew by 2.7 percent during the first quarter
of this year compared to 5.7 percent in the corresponding period
of 1998, according to the latest figures issued by the Central
Bank.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1999, production increased by 3.3
percent in manufacturing, 5 percent in construction, 2.9 percent
in services and 0.8 percent in agriculture, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The services sector contributed 56 percent to the overall GDP
growth while the manufacturing sector contributed 18 percent, the
construction sector 14 percent and the agriculture and fishing
sector 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Due to a decline in foreign demand as a result of the depressed
world economic situation, growth in factory industry was lower
than last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the food, beverages and tobacco industries grew by 3.2
percent supported by a rise in domestic demand. The
export-oriented apparel industry grew by 4.2 percent due to
greater diversification.
</P>
<P>
The output of chemical products, rubber goods and petroleum
declined by 2.1 percent while tea, rubber and coconut kernel
products rose by 10.5 percent, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector grew by 5 percent and the
communications sector expanded by 49 percent with 73,641 new
telephones being provided.
</P>
<P>
The volume of containerized cargo handled declined by 2.6
percent while aviation services expanded by 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
The electricity, gas and water sector grew by 8 percent while
wholesale and retail trade showed a negative growth of 2.6 percent
as a result of a decline in import and slower export and domestic
trade, the bank added.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Innwa Bank Ltd., a financial
institution of the semi-official Myanmar Economic Corporation, has
opened a branch in Mandalay, the country's second largest city in
the north, to provide financial backing to the local industrial
zone, one of the 18 being established in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Mandalay branch, which was inaugurated on Wednesday, is
aimed at boosting industrial productivity on a commercial scale,
and ensuring safety for investment and property of local and
foreign companies and rapid accumulation and circulation of money
for global investors and local and foreign bank branches, said
Myanmar Deputy Prime Minister Lieutenant-General Tin Hla at the
inaugural ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Innwa Bank was established with a special purpose to serve
as a strong financial center for the country's industrial zones,
industries of the cooperative and private sectors, export
enterprises and farming industries.
</P>
<P>
The Innwa Bank has earlier opened one branch each in Yangon,
Taunggyi and Mongshu, and is planning to open more in other states
and divisions.
</P>
<P>
Apart from providing local services, the bank will also act as
a correspondent bank of international banks with strong financial
power.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, there are 17 private banks
and three state-owned banks providing commercial banking services

<HEADLINE> Asian Countries Discuss Social Impact of Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Delegates from Asian economies and
international organizations gathered here Thursday to assess the
social impact of the region's two-year-old financial crisis and
find ways to strengthen social protection systems in the region.
</P>
<P>
Country reports on six Asian countries -- Indonesia, South
Korea, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand -- will be
presented during the two-day conference.
</P>
<P>
The meeting aims to assist in devising policy responses to the
social crisis and identifying measures that would improve social
protection systems in the longer term, according to the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), organizer of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting Thursday morning, ADB President Tadao Chino
said that the Asian crisis appears to be bottoming out and the
crisis-hit economies are starting to show signs of revival.
</P>
<P>
"Full recovery is likely to take longer, however," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the crisis is impacting the social sectors via
labor markets, prices, assets, credit and government budget.
</P>
<P>
"Unemployment represents the most direct impact of the crisis
on human well-being. At the same time, high inflation ignited by
the currency depreciation has eroded real incomes," Chino said.
</P>
<P>
Besides these immediate costs, he said, the crisis has
potentially longer social consequences.
</P>
<P>
But the inadequacy of social safety nets is common in
developing Asia and even worse in the poorer economies of the
region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty reduction, indeed, continues to be the major challenge
to the region, despite significant improvements made possible by
dynamic economic growth in many of the region's countries over two
decades or so," the ADB president said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Asian economies to redouble efforts to reduce
poverty and improve social protection systems so that the poor
groups can better weather social shocks.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Number 10 on List of Global Coal Producers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has been placed as the
10th biggest coal producer in the world with a production of 57
million tons which is expected to increase to 81 million tons in
the year 2000 and 102 million tons in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has a big chance to grab more opportunities in the
international market which is growing at 10 percent a year, chief
executive of London-based World Coal Institute Ron Knapp said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"As one of the major suppliers of steam coal, Indonesia has the
potential markets in Japan, South Korea, Germany, the Netherlands,
Denmark and the United Kingdom with total demand recorded at 321
million tons last year," he said.
</P>
<P>
In steam coal exports, Indonesia ranks as the fourth biggest
exporter after the United States, South Africa and Australia.
</P>
<P>
According to Knapp, the market for thermal coal is also big
with demand expected to reach 345 million tons in 2000 in Japan,
other Asian countries and Europe.
</P>
<P>
"However, Indonesia has tough competitors from new entries,
namely Colombia and Venezuela," The Indonesian Observer Thursday
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The production of Colombian coal reached 32.7 million tons in
1997 and is expected to increase to 43 million tons in 2000 and 51
million tons in 2003, while Venezuela's production reached 5.3
million tons in 1997 with expectation to increase to 11 million
tons in 2000 and 22 million tons in 2003.

<HEADLINE> Mercosur to Establish Association With EU Before 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The South American Common
Market (Mercosur) countries and Bolivia and Chile have decided to
form an "Inter-regional Association" with the European Union (EU)
before the year 2005, a report from Asuncion, capital of Paraguay,
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision became official in a declaration signed by heads
of state of Bolivia, Chile and the four Mercosur countries --
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay -- who attended the 16th
Mercosur summit ending in Asuncion on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Formal talks with the European organization must begin as soon
as possible, and finish before the year 2005, the document urged.
</P>
<P>
The South American heads of state reaffirmed their vow to
continue to strengthen ties with the EU.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the two regional blocs signed a Treaty of Cooperation
to step up relations between them; one year later a similar accord
was reached between Chile and the EU.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-regional Association should be based on rules
established by the World Trade Organization, while taking into
account the viability and need to trade in certain products, and
it should be fortified by a progressively mutual liberalization of
trade, the document said.

<HEADLINE> China's Guangdong Spurs Spending to Ensure Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Banks in this southern Chinese
province of Guangdong have been offering loans to individual
consumers for education, travel, interior remodeling of housing
and purchase of major durable consumer commodities since the
beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
In Guangzhou, the provincial capital, a dozen major general
merchandise stores have signed agreements with local banks to
provide customers with loans to buy major consumer commodities.
</P>
<P>
An Xuesong, who recently signed an agreement with the Bank of
China (BOC) Guangdong Branch to obtain a loan for supporting his
MBA studies at Jinan University, said: "the loan makes it possible
for me to concentrate on study, and I can easily repay the loan
after I go to work."
</P>
<P>
Previously, An had to rely on aids from relatives and part-time
job pay for tuition fees and living expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Banks in the southern Chinese province also offer loans to
individuals for purchase of apartments and cars. In the first
quarter of the year, the BOC Guangdong Branch provided mortgage
loans worth 400 million yuan for housing and issued another 12
million yuan worth of loans for car purchase.
</P>
<P>
The measures demonstrate the provincial government's
determination to accelerate local economic development by spurring
individual consumption, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is set to achieve an economic growth rate of nine
percent this year. It reported a ten-percent growth last year in
spite of the adverse impact of the Asian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Hosts International Meteorological Seminar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 300 meteorologists around the
world attending a seminar in Beijing seek to put forward new
climate-changing predicting models with the help of worldwide
experiments.
</P>
<P>
The four-day seminar, composed of the Third International
Scientific Conference on Global Energy and the Water Cycle (GEWEX)
and the Fourth Study Conference on GEWEX Asian Monsoon Experiment
(GAME), is the first and largest of its kind ever held in Asia,
said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
GEWEX began in 1989 and is the largest climate and
environmental project in the World Weather Research Program, whose
major task is to observe, learn and simulate the exchange and
cycles of water vapor from the atmosphere, the land and oceans and
their related heat energies.
</P>
<P>
The experiments are to play an important role in raising
predictability of the global precipitation and evaporation, and
accurately evaluating radiation processes within the atmosphere
and the susceptibility of climate changes caused by clouds, the
report quoted the experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
The experiments are expected to help people make sensible
utilization of the globe's shrinking water resources and deal with
worsening water pollution resulted from various environmental
problems in the world today.
</P>
<P>
China has, since 1998, sponsored four large-scale
meteorological experiments, the largest in China's meteorological
history, with the participation of some 6,000 technicians and 600
meteorologists, said officials with the China Meteorological
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Data observed through the experiments in the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, the South China Sea, the Huaihe River and the Taiwan
Straits have push forward studies of monsoons in Asia and East
Asia and the disastrous weather in China.

<P>
ROME, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini on Wednesday urged the Kosovar Liberation Army (KLA) to lay
down its arms and become a "political force."
</P>
<P>
In a statement to a joint session of the senate and lower house
foreign affairs committees, Dini noted that NATO and the KLA are
currently negotiating such terms and conditions as abstaining from
acts of aggression, turning over heavy weaponry, and giving up
their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
Dini's remarks coincided with renewed appeals and warnings from
other sources regarding the same matter.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema called on the
Kosovar leaders to cooperate in disarming the KLA, adding that the
reconstruction of peace in the war-ridden Balkans was facing many
difficulties and the international community was required to make
a "very serious commitment."
</P>
<P>
Dini held that the KLA, which has been unwilling to lay down
its arms so far, must be "re-orientated from the logic of armed
confrontation" to one of peaceful cooperation.

<HEADLINE> State-Owned Enterprises in NE China Concentrating on Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- State-owned enterprises in
Liaoning Province, northeast China, are now increasingly
separating services like schools and hospitals from themselves in
a bid to sharp their competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
The most important 60 provincial enterprises have turned 398
affiliated schools, hospitals, and canteens over to local
governments or made them independent units.
</P>
<P>
There were some 22 firms and social service departments that
were separated last year from the Benxi Iron and Steel Company,
one of the largest state-owned enterprises in the province.
</P>
<P>
Most state-owned enterprises in China used to have their own
schools, hospitals, kindergartens, and canteens, which added a
heavy financial burden.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Boost Ties with Russia, NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine will endeavor to develop
close ties with Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) simultaneously, President Leonid Kuchma said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting with officials from the interior
authorities, Kuchma said that Ukraine and Russia share the same
history and enjoy traditional links in all spheres. Ukraine will
adhere to the stand of always regarding Russia as one of its most
important partners, he declared.
</P>
<P>
The president said both countries should make, as the top
priority, coordinated efforts to raise their economic cooperation
to the corresponding levels. The Ukraine-Russia trade volume
reportedly slumped by about 75 percent at the beginning of this
year in the aftermath of last year's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Ukraine's relations with NATO, Kuchma said NATO is
one of the largest and most influential international
organizations in the world today. Ukraine will keep in contact
with NATO within the framework of the Ukraine-NATO Special
Partnership Charter, but is not prepared to join the alliance.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Ukraine-NATO cooperation is not directed
against any other nation. Reaffirming the fact that Ukraine is a
non-aligned nation, Kuchma said it is crucial for Ukraine to
safeguard its national independence, territorial integrity and
national interests.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Coffee Exports Recover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's coffee exports
have increased sharply, allowing it to resume its traditional
position as the world's largest coffee bean supplier.
</P>
<P>
For the period of July 1998 to June 1999, the South American
country exported 19.59 million sacks of coffee (60 kilos per sack),
the greatest amount in the last eight years, for 2.3 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Brazil produced 35 million sacks of coffee this year, the
highest amount in the last 11 years and almost a third of the
world's total.
</P>
<P>
However, during the past few years, Brazil had been overtaken
by their main rivals, Colombia and the Central American countries,
Brazilian exporters were quoted as saying by Wednesday's "
Mercantile Gazette."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Brazil, the world's largest producer and
exporter of coffee, has produced 27 percent of the coffee being
offered on the international markets this year, up from 21 percent
over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The recovery is due to the fact that Brazil is the top-seller
of coffee in the United States, which is the world's largest
market.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar-Japan Bilateral Trade Slightly Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar-Japan bilateral trade
reached 44.71 million U.S. dollars in the first two months of this
year, slightly increasing by 2.35 percent over the 43.68 million
dollars registered in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures published by Myanmar's Central
Statistical Organization, Myanmar's import from Japan was 36.55
million dollars during the two-month period, dropping by 2.76
million dollars from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Myanmar's export to Japan during the period increased
to 8.16 million dollars from 4.37 million dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show that the balance of trade in the period
was considerably in favor of Japan since Japan's export to
Myanmar accounted for a high percentage of 81.7 of the total
bilateral trade, while its import from Myanmar represented just a
percentage of 18.3.
</P>
<P>
Japan is one of Myanmar's major trading partners in Asia. Japan
mainly exports to Myanmar machinery, chemical materials, rubber
manufactures and motor vehicles, while importing from it
agricultural, forest and marine products.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in 1998, Japan's export to
Myanmar amounted to 346.8 million dollars, while its import from
Myanmar was only 42.69 million dollars, a huge trade deficit
occurring in Myanmar's balance of trade with Japan.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the trade deficit, Myanmar is trying to restrict its
import from Japan and stepping up exploration of unexploited
export sectors of the country.

<HEADLINE> Australian Scientists Discover Anti-AIDS Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian National University
researchers have discovered a drug which, in laboratory testing,
has been shown to be able to stop AIDS virus in its tracks, the
Canberra Times said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers were quoted as saying that independent laboratory
tests, conducted on mammalian cells in test tubes, have shown that
the drug stopped the AIDS virus replicating.
</P>
<P>
Parallel work was also being done on viral fevers, such as
dengue, Ross River and Barnah Forest fevers, and there were also
applications for the new drug in helping stroke and heart-attack
sufferers, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The work focused on ion channels, proteins that sit on a cell
membrane and provide pathways for the transmission of charged
particles and viruses into the cell, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The drug, developed with technology which the researchers have
been working on for 15 years, has been shown to be able to "block"
a virus into the cell, it said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Peter Gage, one of the researchers, said that "by
finding the precise location and form of a disorder at the
molecular level, it is possible to identify or design a drug to
lock on to the site and interact with ion flow to stop the
pathological condition."
</P>
<P>
"The benefit of this targeted approach is that the effect of
the disorder is arrested, and there are no, or minimal, side
effects," he said.

MEXICO CITY, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from an
earthquake that hit south-central Mexico rose to 20 Wednesday,
with some 600 people left homeless and 4,000 displaced, an
official report said.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake, measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale and lasting
about 40 seconds on Tuesday mid-afternoon, was the strongest on
record over the last 14 years in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter was in Huajuapan de Leon, the state of Puebla,
about 100 kilometers southeast of the capital. The seismic wave
was felt in the states of Chiapas, Guerrero, Mexico, Michoacan,
Morelos, Tlaxcala and Veracruz.
</P>
<P>
The report said 15 people were killed in Puebla, which
sustained the worst damage, two in Mexico City, two in Veracruz
and one in Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 buildings were damaged and at least 125 homes were
affected in Puebla, a colonial city known for its facades of hand-
painted ceramic tiles of the 17th century and declared by the U.N.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as a place of "
humanity heritage."
</P>
<P>
President Ernesto Zedillo ordered care for the victims
immediately after the quake and, accompanied by General in command
of the area Enrique Cervantes, made a quick tour of the affected

<HEADLINE> Progress Made in U.S.-Russia Talks on Peacekeeping in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Senior U.S. and Russian officials
said early Thursday that progress has been made in their talks on
settling a dispute concerning peacekeeping in the troubled
Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a first round of talks with Russian
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev that ended here just before
midnight on Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said,
"It has been a very productive day. I was pleased with the
atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
"We had a long, productive afternoon and evening, but we have
more to go," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We've had some agreements in some areas, but until the entire
package as such is resolved, there can be no agreement," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking to reporters, Sergeyev said that "we didn't waste
our time" in the talks. He expressed agreement with Cohen that
progress had been made and that the talks would continue for
reaching a formal agreement on Russian participation in the
peacekeeping force known as KFOR.
</P>
<P>
In remarks released by Russia's Itar-Tass news agency, Sergeyev
said, "We have reached an agreement on the structure of command of
the peacekeeping operation with the participation of the Russian
military contingent."
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned that all of the issues concerned are very
complex and "we cannot resolve them just right away."
</P>
<P>
Neither side would reveal further details of the talks or
agreement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov were also to hold talks on the issue in
Helsinki on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the U.S.-led NATO have been in a dispute over Russia
's role in Kosovo peacekeeping after the deployment of 200 Russian
troops to Kosovo on Saturday where they took control of Pristina
airport and were in a standoff with NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
The crux of the dispute is NATO's demand that all countries
participating in Kosovo peacekeeping operate under a unified
command led by NATO. Russia is opposed to such a demand.
</P>
<P>
Russia demands that it play an independent role in the
peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
One possible compromise option might be to include a senior
Russian officer in the KFOR command structure, Russian media
reports said.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. officials have also said NATO is trying to
create a "zone of responsibility" for Russian peacekeepers that
would perhaps be part of the five NATO sectors.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks started, both the U.S. and Russia expressed
confidence that an agreement could be reached on a compromise
under which Russian troops would serve in the 50,000-member KFOR.
</P>
<P>
NATO has set up five military sectors in Kosovo under U.S.,
British, French, German and Italian control.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China is pouring huge amount of
money into railway projects in the southwest in a bid to boost
local development by easing the traffic bottleneck in this
mountainous region densely populated by ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), China plans
to invest 250 billion yuan in railway construction projects, with
27 percent, or 68 billion yuan, of the total going to the
southwest.
</P>
<P>
The huge investment is aimed to improve the southwestern
railway network and its links with other parts of the country,
according to a senior official of the Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, a number of railway projects have been completed in
southwest China, including the first one in the region that leads
to the sea.
</P>
<P>
In the coming few years, 10 other projects are going to be
built to link up major cities in the region.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited railways to Tibet have once again drawn people
's attention recently, said the official, adding that one of the
routes is expected to start from Yunnan Province.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's coffee
production in 1999-2000 is expected to drop after the main crop
areas were hit by heavy rains at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian coffee harvest is going through one of its worst
moments, due to the heavy rains caused by "La Nina" towards the
end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The downpours caused a 20.9 percent fall in the production,
cutting the harvest to 3.5 million sacks in the first five months
of this year, compared with 4.4 million in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
According to the director of FEDECAFE, the national federation
of coffee growers, the crisis could worsen during the second half
of this year and at the beginning of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The authorities predict that coffee production in the 1998-1999
period will be 11 million sacks, lower than their original
prediction of 12.5 million sacks and the 1997-1998 production of
12.1 million.
</P>
<P>
As the second largest coffee supplier in the world after Brazil,
Colombia exports around two billion U.S. dollars worth of coffee
on an annual basis.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria virtually turned down
Russia's request Wednesday for permission to use a flight path or
corridor to maintain its peacekeeping forces in Kosovo, stating
that Moscow should seek permission from the KFOR commander first.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria made the decision only hours after receiving Moscow's
request for airspace to transport -- via Russian aircraft --
technical equipment, medicines and food for the Russian
peacekeepers in Kosovo, according to government spokeswoman
Stoyana Georgieva.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian position has been coordinated with Romania and
Hungary to which a similar Russian request was also addressed, she
said.
</P>
<P>
"Any entry of persons or equipment into Kosovo should occur
only with the permission of KFOR (U.N. peacekeeping forces in
Kosovo) Commander General Michael Jackson," Georgieva said.
</P>
<P>
She also denied Russian reports which quoted Russia's Balkans
envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin as saying that "the question of flights
of Russian military aircraft over Bulgaria has been settled. It is
expected that corridors will (also) be provided by Hungary and
Romania."
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives voted Wednesday 282-146 to reject proposed curbs
on youth access to explicit sexual or violent material in video
games, movies and other art and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers expressed concern that
the proposed restrictions violated the Constitution's free speech
guarantee.
</P>
<P>
Republican lawmaker Henry Hyde, who proposed the curbs on
sexual and violent material for minors, said they were designed to
be "the slow flood of toxic waste into our kids' minds."
</P>
<P>
"Parents need our help. Let's stand with them. Nothing we do
in this life is more important than how we raise our children,"
said Henry, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, but his
proposal was not responded positively by most lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
At the same time the house voted 249-181 to toughen law
enforcement against juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
The law enforcement measures include a requirement that all U.S.
Attorneys designate prosecutors to specialize in firearms cases so
that more such cases can be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Stricter penalties are also required for numerous crimes,
including illegal possession of a gun with the intent to take it
into a school zone.
</P>

VIENNA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien and his Austrian counterpart Viktor Klima underlined here
Wednesday the necessity of working out a stability plan to achieve
a lasting peace in the Balkan region.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Greg Rusedski of Britain edged Jan-
Michael Gambill 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 to move into the quarter-finals of
the Nottingham open tennis tournament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The British number two, one of the favourites for the Wimbledon
title this year, displayed problems with his return of serve and
often erratic backhand. When the frustration got the better of him,
he threw his racket to the ground on a couple of occasions.
</P>
<P>
Gambill, the American ranked 50 in the world, broke Rusesdki in
the ninth game of the first set and also held a break point again
midway through the second after Rusedski double-faulted three
times in succession.
</P>
<P>
But Rusedski hauled himself out of trouble and victory was
clinched when Gambill made one mistake too many on his own serve.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski now meets 18-year-old Australian Lleyton Hewitt, who
eased past Guillermo Canas of Argentina 6-2, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Number two seed Jerome Golmard of France withdrew from the
tournament with a knee injury as a precaution with Wimbledon only
five days away.

<HEADLINE> Top Seeds Eliminated in Eastbourne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Top seeds Monica Seles and Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario were crashed out of the Eastbourne International
Challenge women's tennis tournament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Seles, first seed, lost to Anne Kremer of Luxembourg 6-4, 6-4
while second seeded Spaniard Sanchez Vicario was beaten by 20-year-
old French player Nathalie Dechy 7-5, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The defeats are major setbacks for the world numbers four and
seven as they prepare for the grasscourt Grand Slam event in five
days' time.
</P>
<P>
Seles, Eastbourne champion in 1996, and Sanchez Vicario, a
finalist here in each of her last three appearances, both expected
to do well.
</P>
<P>
But neither produced the form they are capable of as the
youngsters grasped their opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"Well, at least it's better that it happened here and not at
Wimbledon," Sanchez Vicario said afterwards.
</P>
<P>
"Every time I got an opportunity I just missed it. She attacked
better than me, she played better than me and she deserved to win.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously I would have liked to have stayed in the tournament
a little longer to get good match practice but now I am going to
go to London tomorrow and start practicing there."
</P>
<P>
Seles, like Sanchez Vicario, received a bye in the first round
and so was playing for the first time on grass this year.
</P>
<P>
"I was making far too many errors but it is just very hard to
understand what happened today," she said.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a tragedy but I must try and learn from what happened.
I've had a couple of matches this year where my game has just
collapsed, and that was the case out there."
</P>
<P>
The American former world number one's game did collapse on
Devonshire Park's centre court as Kremer moved her from side to
side.
</P>
<P>
The 40th-ranked Kremer, making her first appearance in the main
draw, began to produce the sort of angles her more famous opponent
is known for and Seles simply sprayed balls long and wide.
</P>
<P>
It is a result that Kremer will not forget. "She was my
favourite player growing up," the 23-year-old beamed afterwards.
</P>
<P>
"I always loved her fast game so it is so good to go out and
beat her playing like that."
</P>
<P>
Third seed and 1998 Wimbledon finalist Nathalie Tauziat showed
the top two how it should be done by dismissing Austria's Sylvia
Plischke 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Fourth seed Amanda Coetzer also got her campaign off to a solid
start. The South African beat qualifier Elena Tatarkova
comfortably 6-3, 6-4. She meets compatriot Mariaan De Swardt in
the quarters after De Swardt dismissed seventh seed Irina Spirlea
6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Sixth seed Natasha Zvereva followed up Tuesday's victory over
Tara Snyder by beating 17-year-old Mirjana Lucic 7-5, 6-1. She
meets Kremer in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Fifth seed Anna Kournikova eased past American Lisa Raymond
after a tricky start in their second round match.
</P>
<P>
Raymond forced Kournikova to a tiebreak in the opening set
which the young Russian won 7-4 before taking control and winning
the second set 6-4, earning a quarter-final against Dechy.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Enhance Computer Network Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial and
commercial city of Shanghai will slice off 10 to 15 percent of its
computer network development funds for network security purposes,
according to Deputy Mayor Chen Liangyu.
</P>
<P>
Chen said his city will replace all imported network security
products with homemade ones to ensure maximum safety.
</P>
<P>
Measures will be taken to tighten control of the quality of
products that are used to protect the networks from intruders,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
A municipal information security testing evaluation and
certification center is set to be established soon to ensure
thorough testing on the quality and performance of such products.
</P>
<P>
As information networks are present in nearly all segments of
society, Chen stressed, it is of vital importance to guarantee the
security of the networks.
</P>
<P>
To date, 86 percent of Shanghai's information networks have had
security products mounted, but a recent survey showed a lack of
security knowledge among network professionals, with less than two
percent of them knowing how to protect their networks from
intruders. Most of the security products are imported.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Islamabad Hopes Diplomacy to Prevail Over War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 17 (Xinhua) -- As clouds of a widening armed
conflict between Pakistan and India following the recent flare-up
in the disputed Kashmir area hover over the South Asian horizon,
Islamabad still hopes diplomacy to prevail over war.
</P>
<P>
Despite the latest conflict, Pakistan still hopes that the
tension along the Line of Control (LoC), which has lasted for
more than one and a half month, would be de-escalated by
diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in his telephone conversation with
his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee last Sunday reiterated
Pakistan's desire to defuse the current tension on LoC.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who had earlier made a telephone call to Vajpayee on
May 28, expressed his hope that India would join Pakistan in
devising mutually acceptable approaches to preserve peace and
prevent the South Asian region from descending into chaos and
conflagration.
</P>
<P>
"If diplomacy fails, war is inevitable. But we will persist
with our diplomatic efforts because in this world the costs of
failure of diplomacy were huge and unbearable," Foreign Office
spokesman Tariq Altaf said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz and his Indian
counterpart Jaswant Singh in their meeting held last weekend in
New Delhi agreed to disagree on how to de-escalate the situation
following India's air strikes to flush out Kashmiri militants from
the strategic heights of Kashmir's Kargil sector.
</P>
<P>
India insisted that Pakistan withdraw the alleged Muslim
infiltrators from Kargil heights to pave the way for further
talks. But Pakistan denied the charges and urged India to halt
air raids and artillery duels to create a congenial atmosphere for
more talks.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that Pakistan has proposed international
monitoring of the 720-kilometer-long LoC, which divides Kashmir
between the two South Asian rivals, to verify the allegations of
infiltration.
</P>
<P>
"We want a great role of UNMOGIP (United Nations Military
Observer Group for India and Pakistan) which should be allowed to
monitor and report any violations (of LoC) from any side," said
Shraf Jehangir Qazi, Pakistan's ambassador to India, who was also
a member of Aziz's negotiating team in India.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that despite the uncompromising stands
by the two sides and continued tension on LoC, a fourth Indo-Pak
full-fledged war is not very likely, at least in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Nasim Zehra, a leading columnist, said that "with bilateral
talks deadlocked, the Kargil crisis may take the two countries
towards only a limited war."
</P>
<P>
However, she was of the view that for India, to open fronts
along the international borders "is a very remote possibility."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sharif has been holding intense discussions with
the army's top brass and close aides to review the deteriorating
situation and evolve Islamabad's operational strategy to deal with
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Military officials are warning against escalation of tensions
between the two uneasy neighbors which have fought three wars, two
of which on Kashmir, since their respective inception in 1947.
</P>
<P>
As the deafening rattle of artillery and mortar fire
continuously reverberates in the sparsely populated areas near the
LoC, the threat of a widening conflict between Pakistan and India
seems to be heightening.
</P>
<P>
There are reports that most of the villages near the Pakistani
side of LoC have been vacated and their inhabitants have moved to
safer places.
</P>
<P>
"There is now a growing and widespread concern that, what has
so far remained a limited military engagement-- confined to Kargil
-- can now spill over and create other theaters of conflict,"
Islamabad-based major English daily The News said editorially.
</P>
<P>
"This must be avoided. A wider conflict is in neither country's
interest," it urged.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here are of the view that in the nuclearized
environment, even a prolonged limited war also held out great
peril.
</P>
<P>
As Prime Minister Sharif said, "it is incumbent on the
leadership to avert any further aggravation which will be
detrimental to the economic development efforts in both
countries."
</P>
<P>
The international community has also urged the two South Asian
nations to restraint and make their best efforts to promote peace
and security through dialogue in pursuance of the Lahore
Declaration signed by the two countries in February this year.
</P>
<P>
One official here said that "statesmanship demands immediate
action to step back from the brink. The consequences of going over
this dangerous precipice are too calamitous to be even
contemplated."

<HEADLINE> ADB Loan Used for Tropical Crop Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zhanjiang State Farm and
Land Reclamation Zone Administration in Guangdong Province, south
China, has completed the building and expansion of two lucrative
sugarcane processing factories and one sisal hemp processing mill
thanks to an Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the ADB signed an agreement with
the Chinese Government in September of 1992 to provide Guangdong
with 55 million U.S. dollars worth of support for tropical crop
development, 25 million dollars of which went to the Zhanjiang
administration.
</P>
<P>
The technological improvement project at the sisal hemp mill
was finished in 1995 and the mill can produce 2,000 tons of yarn
made of sisal fiber annually.
</P>
<P>
The two sugarcane processing factories have a combined
processing capacity of 8,000 tons a year.
</P>
<P>
An appraisal panel of more than 40 specialists from the
Ministry of Agriculture and elsewhere concluded that the three ADB-
financed projects have been a success in the social and economic
benefits during trial operations.

<P>
LIMA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Peru on Wednesday suspended imports
of poultry, pork, beef and all meal products, as well as all types
of sausages and milk of Belgian origin, for a 90 day period in
order to prevent dioxin contamination.
</P>
<P>
A resolution from the National Service of Agricultural
Sanitation (SENASA) said on Wednesday that as the cancer-causing
dioxin had been evidently found in the aforementioned products
coming from Belgium, it was necessary to impose an import ban on
them to safeguard the nation.
</P>
<P>
During the restrictive period, SENASA will conduct evaluation
studies on the possible risks, to decide whether the restriction
should be lifted or extended at the end of the 90 days.
</P>
<P>
Peru prohibited imports of powdered milk from Belgium on June
11, after reports of dioxin contamination, a highly carcinogenic
chemical.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Rises Only 0.2 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve said
Wednesday that industrial production, making a fragile recovery
from a slump in global demand, edged up 0.2 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said the modest production gain at the nation's
factories, mines and utilities reflects a big increase in output
of automotive products, which partially offset a large decline
in the production of appliances.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the beige book, released by the Fed at the same
day, said that consumers are continuing a buying spree,
manufacturing is recovering from a slump in demand overseas and
prices generally remain "well-behaved." But it said with
unemployment at a 29-year low, labor markets remain tight and more
regions are reporting wage pressures that can eventually lead to
inflation.
</P>
<P>
According to the book, the 12 regional Fed banks, while
surveying their areas, reported that the "U.S. economy remains
strong, with gains in activity widespread."

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Release of 520 Million Dollars to Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) approved on Wednesday the completion of the seventh review
under Thailand's stand-by arrangement and the disbursement of an
additional 520 million U.S. dollars to Thailand from bilateral and
multilateral sources.
</P>
<P>
This will bring the international community's financial support
for Thailand to 14.1 billion dollars, or more than 80 percent of
the 17.2-billion-dollar financing package approved by the IMF in
August 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Directors (of the IMF) welcomed the continued financial
stability and growing signs of economic recovery in Thailand,"
Shigemitsu Sugisaki, Deputy Managing Director of the IMF, said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's economic growth in 1999 is expected to exceed
projected levels, thanks to the rebounded manufacturing production,
and improved confidence in financial markets, reflected in lower
interest rates, increasing equity values, as well as the return of
capital inflows.
</P>
<P>
The IMF urged the Thai government to fully implement its
stimulus package to underpin the emerging recovery.
</P>
<P>
"Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to implement
fiscal policy flexibly, taking into account the strength of the
recovery. They recommended that spending to bolster the social
safety net should receive an especially high priority, while
maintaining the overall efficiency of budgetary spending,"
Sugisaki said.
</P>
<P>
"Directors emphasized that continued progress in restructuring
corporate debt and in recapitalizing banks remains central to
sustaining economic recovery over the medium term," he added.

<HEADLINE> Women Hold Key to Halting Desertification, Says UNDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Desertification correlates
with poverty and the burden of poverty falls most heavily on
women, said a high-ranking U.N. official on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is especially appropriate that this year's observance of the
World Day to Combat Desertification takes women's role as its
theme, according to United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
Administrator James Gustave Speth.
</P>
<P>
U.N. data show that an estimated 70 percent of the world's poor
are women.
</P>
<P>
Speth said poverty and its side effects are taking an
increasing toll on the world's drylands, with more than one-third
of world's population living in drylands, which comprise arid,
semiarid and dry subhumid areas.
</P>
<P>
Many of these areas are under siege by environmentally
inadequate farming, urban sprawl, and worsening water shortages.
</P>
<P>
Dryland degradation is vicious circle as poverty drives people
to exploit fragile natural resources for their survival, and the
ensuing environmental decay hurts the poor the most.
</P>
<P>
The poor typically live in marginal areas, which are especially
vulnerable to drought, floods and other calamities.
</P>
<P>
World Day to Combat Desertification, June 17, was proclaimed by
the U.N. General Assembly in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose
sharply Wednesday as investors lessened their worries about
inflation after the government report said U.S. consumer prices
held steady in May.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 189.96 or by 1.7
percent at 10,784.95. The index rose 31.66 points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The technology
heavy Nasdaq index rose 103.16 or 4.2 percent at 2,517.83,
surpassing the previous record for a one-day point gain of
96.05, set February 11 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose
29.25 at 1,330.41.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index,
excluding the volatile energy and food categories, rose 0.1
percent in May, triggering a buying spree on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
A surge of 0.7 percent in April Consumer Price Index sparked
fears about inflation and the Federal Reserve warned it would
raise interest rates to cool off the economy if inflation was
building up in the economy, thus dragging the stock market down.
</P>
<P>
But some economists said the low consumer prices in May
did not quell speculation about higher interest rates because
the Federal Reserve may consider other developments such as
higher global demand for U.S. goods following the economic
recovery overseas, which could push up prices in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 9.89 at 632.17 and the
American Stock Exchange index rose 1.00 at 764.92. The Russell
2000 index of smaller companies rose 7.19 at 441.20.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-7 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,998 up, 1,055 down and
510 unchanged.

NYSE volume increased to 796.86 million shares from 693.10

<HEADLINE> Russia Sees KLA Status in Kosovo Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian diplomat
said here Wednesday that the 15-nation U.N. Security Council
needed to deal with the refusal of the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA) to disarm, an obvious violation of a key U.N.
resolution on the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Lavrov, Russian permanent representative to the United
Nations, told reporters after a closed-door Security Council
meeting that NATO troops stood by as KLA guerrillas moved into
positions, contrary to an omnibus resolution approving a Kosovo
peace plan last week.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the KLA reported movement is confirmed, "it is
a violation of the resolution and something must be done about
it."
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned by the media reports that as Serbs withdraw
according to schedule and to everybody's satisfaction, the KLA
moves in and takes positions and refuses to demilitarize and
basically makes statement publicly that they would be running the
area and not anybody else," Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted on June 10, approved an international
force to ensure the safe return of nearly a million ethnic
Albanian refugees and listed as its duties the "demilitarization"
of the KLA, ethnic Albanian guerrillas who have been fighting for
independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
KLA leaders have said that they would not disarm until the
Russian troops, who have taken position in the airport in
Pristina, capital of Kosovo Province, join a unified NATO
command.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Russian officials are meeting in Helsinki to try and
break a deadlock over Moscow's role in the Kosovo peacekeeping
force, knows as KFOR. Russia, who helps mediate an end to the NATO
air strikes, is seeking its own separate sector in Kosovo
peacekeeping operations, rather than work under NATO command and
send some 200 soldiers over the weekend to occupy Pristina
airport.

<HEADLINE> U.S. High School Students Say "No" to Teaching Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 16 (Xinhua) -- High school students in the United
States may not help ease the country's projected shortage of 2.2
million teachers over the next decade, according to a report released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide poll sponsored by the Milken Family Foundation, 55
percent of the students say that they have "little' or "no interest at
all" in a career in teaching, citing school safety as the main
drawback, followed closely by the poor image and lack of respect for
teachers and low salaries.
</P>
<P>
"These findings underscore the daunting challenge the nation faces
in meeting the projected teacher shortage," said Santa Monica,
California-based foundation.
</P>
<P>
The lack of interest in teaching was particularly pronounced among
African-Americans and boys, respectively 68 percent and 62 percent of
whom expressed little or no interest. Only 14 percent of students
overall expressed "a great deal of interest" in teaching.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 42 percent of older Americans nearing retirement age
might consider a teaching career if certification and training
barriers were eased, according to a separate survey also sponsored by
the foundation.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of tragic shootings in Colorado and Georgia, 70
percent of the high school students and 76 percent of older
Americans cite school safety as a major drawback.

<HEADLINE> Ireland To Scrap Alcohol-free "Holy Hour" - Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Ireland looks ready to scrap its
traditionally dry "Holy Hour" with the announcement of a
government-backed Intoxicating Liquor Bill, a Reuters report said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bill would scrap Sunday afternoon closing rules in a
country which is better known for alcohol consumption than
abstinence. It was expected that the bill would lift a bar on
extended drinking hours on a Saturday night and allow once-off
all-night opening for New Year's Eve to mark the millennium.
</P>
<P>
Irish Justice Minister John O'Donoghue said in a statement he
hoped to bring the bill before parliament very soon so it could be
approved before the summer recess.
</P>
<P>
The short Bill was being drafted immediately to facilitate the
tourist industry over this summer's tourist and holiday season,
the report quoted the department as saying.
</P>
<P>
