MAYCOBA, Mexico _ Here in the bosom of the Sierra Madre in
northwestern Mexico, scientists working with the Pima Indians have
found proof that diet and intense exercise offer protection from
diabe tes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pimas who live here come from the same genetic stock as the
Pimas who live in central Arizona. Yet while the Gila River
community south of Phoenix is being decimated by the ``Pima
Plague,'' diabetes has barely touched this Mexican village.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the eve of the new millen nium, the Pimas here are
following a lifestyle that disappeared from Gila River generations
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Television and newspapers do not reach this pine-rimmed valley,
where the native Pimas have endured ages of rough-hewn living.
Grueling labor and subsistence farming so far have shielded the
Mexican Pimas from the diabetes that has ravaged their Ari zona
cousins.
</P>
<P>
   A rural people, the Mexican Pimas tend their fields without
machinery, hoeing rows by hand or with a plow and ox. Fires for
cooking and warmth are stoked with wood cut from the surrounding
forests.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than one in 15 of the adult Pimas in Maycoba has diabetes.
By contrast, one of every two adults on Gila River has the disease.
Among those 55 to 65, the rate is 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson shown by the Mexican Pima is that in a population
suscepti ble to diabetes, heavy physical activ ity and a simple
diet have served to protect the people from the disease,'' says Dr.
Mauro Valencia, a Mexican researcher who has studied the Indi ans
in Maycoba.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists comparing the village of Maycoba with the Gila River
com munity believe they have found proof that lifestyle can make
a &UR; dramatic difference in the battle to prevent diabetes, not only
among the Pimas, but in other communities throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   In Maycoba, the average Pima man spends 29 hours per week at
moder ate to heavy labor, while the Arizona Pima averages two,
according to a study by Mexican and U.S. research ers working for
the National Insti tutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not eating much less than the Arizona Pima in terms of
calo ries, but of course they're burning a lot more with all this
exercise. There is the secret to why they're so much thinner,''
says Dr. Peter Bennett, chief of the NIH Pima studies.
</P>
<P>
   Robust activity is a means of sur vival in Maycoba.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Luz Lao Aguilar's life.
</P>
<P>
   Most days, the 64-year-old grand father works from dawn to dusk.
The moon is rising over the craggy hillsides when he gets home this
crisp fall evening, leading his burro to the two-room wooden cabin
he built.
</P>
<P>
   He has finished clearing his fields, bringing home the remains
of the late harvest, a burlap sack filled with corn. His wife will
strip the cobs of kernels that she grinds into meal used for the
stacks of tortillas she makes twice daily.
</P>
<P>
   Lao grows enough corn and beans for his family to eat; but to
make ends meet, he has to do more. Tomorrow, he'll be a lumberjack.
He's organized a group of Pima men to saw down pine trees. The men
plan to collect a truckload of wood they can sell for lumber. In
between farming and cutting trees, he earns money by working at the
sawmill.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot of hard work, but typical of the load carried by Pima
men here.
</P>
<P>
   Without modern conveniences, women, too, bear heavy burdens for
the household.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m. on a weekday, Maria Dolores Coyote Duarte is already
five hours into her daily routine.
</P>
<P>
   Having walked to the community store about two miles from her
house, the 58-year-old matriarch is going home with a big sack of
flour slung over her back. Her daughter, Trinidad Rascon Coyote,
27, walks beside her, carrying a cardboard tray of eggs in one hand
and a plastic woven bag full of groceries in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the unflagging grandmother will lead a group of four
women from her household on a trek to fetch water.
</P>
<P>
   Chattering and laughing, the women walk about a mile through
rolling hills of tall, dry grass to a freshwater spring where each
fills two buckets or bottles to be hauled home. Below the source,
water flows into small pools where the family bathes. The rocky
banks are strewn with ashes from fires used to heat the cold water.
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologists believe the Mexican and Gila River Pimas were
once the same tribe, but a group of the Mexican Pimas broke off and
mi grated north. Historians and anthro pologists are unsure how
long ago the split took place. Even today, the elders of both
groups still speak roughly the same language.
</P>
<P>
   But there are marked differences between the two tribes.
</P>
<P>
   The Maycoba Pimas are protected not only by their hard labor,
but by their food _ high-fiber, low-fat meals that help prevent
obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple and boring'' is how the scientists describe the Mexican
Pima diet.
</P>
<P>
   Beans and corn tortillas are eaten at most meals. Several times
per week, eggs and potatoes are added. Fruits and vegetables are
eaten occasion ally, when in season. Chicken or other meat is a
rare treat.
</P>
<P>
   A laboratory analysis of the May coba diet showed the Pimas
there consume about 26 percent fat, while the typical Gila River
diet is more than 35 percent fat.
</P>
<P>
   A 1992 study showed the Arizona Pima diet, though unhealthful,
was no worse than what the rest of America is eating.
</P>
<P>
   Although it would be difficult to persuade U.S. residents, Pimas
or not, to adopt the monotonous diet and hard activities of the
Mexican Pimas, researchers think there are lessons to be learned
from this traditional tribe.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican Pimas show that even among people genetically predis
posed to diabetes, exercise, combined with eating more fiber and
less fat, prevents the weight gain that in creases the risk of
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Making similar changes ``may help to reduce the diabetes
epidemic that affects many developing countries as well as the
underprivileged in indus trialized nations,'' the scientists con
cluded in the 1994 Maycoba study.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't mean that Anglo people in Washington or China
should stop working with tractors and go back to using mules, but
it's clear that strong exercise is benefi cial,'' says Julian
Esparza, a Mexican scientist who is worked closely with the Pima in
Maycoba.
</P>
<P>
   As for changing one's eating habits, researcher Valencia notes
that Amer icans have taken to other healthful trends like eating
more fruits and vegetables. People can boost their fiber
consumption substantially, he says, simply by adding beans, a
staple of the Mexican diet, to more meals.
</P>
<P>
   But even in Maycoba, there are ominous signs of change. The new
two-lane ``highway'' that winds for hour after hour of hairpin
curves leads straight to their upland Indian village, where
Pepsi-Cola is all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   Since the paved road opened in 1992, the new world has pushed up
against the old. Junk treats are delivered regularly, and people
are finding the sodas, chips and candy irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, along the U.S. border, rising rates of obesity
and the diabetes it spurs are being reported in Mexican towns
taking up the fast-food and sedentary habits of their American
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are now watching May coba to see whether the Pimas
will likewise be affected by environmental creep.
</P>
<P>
   CONASUPO, a chain of basic-goods grocery stores subsidized by
the Mexican government, arrived in Maycoba 15 years ago, bringing
snack food, candy and soda. But until the road was paved in 1992,
supplies were low and infrequent. Now, Maycoba is on regular
delivery routes.
</P>
<P>
   The CONASUPO used most fre quently by the Pima is at the lumber
mill not far from a Pima elementary school. At recess, children
who've scraped together a few coins rush to the tiny wooden store
to buy good ies. The chocolate and corn chips are gobbled up with
smiles before the teacher calls them back to class.
</P>
<P>
   On weekdays, customer traffic at the CONASUPO hits high gear at
the lunch hour.
</P>
<P>
   Men who work at the lumber mill line up along with schoolkids
and women who've come to bring lunch to their husbands, brothers or
fa thers.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Perez Rascon, the store man ager, and her two boys buzz
from counter to window dispensing cool, sweaty glass bottles of
Pepsi hand over fist until they run out and begin offering orange
or other flavored sodas.
</P>
<P>
   In less than an hour, two 24-bottle crates of sodas are sold.
``Some days, I sell up to three crates,'' Perez says. ``It's
nothing but soda that sells here at midday.'`
</P>
<P>
   Around the globe, as traditional cultures swallow Western ways,
dia betes cases are skyrocketing to epi demic proportions. Like
other traditional peoples, the Mexican Pi mas are at risk of being
absorbed by the same Westernization that set off the explosion of
diabetes among the Arizona tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Mexican scientists believe occasional junk snacks
will not pro duce the drastic unhealthful changes that came
suddenly to Gila River. Researchers believe the Mexican Pi mas'
timeless ways offer hope for curbing the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Maycoba, they are still living off the land,'' Valencia
says. ``They continue to live without modern conveniences, without
running water, electricity, and without cars they still walk great
distances.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sodas they drink and the chips they eat won't hurt them
because they continue to work hard,'' Es parza says.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia agrees, observing, ``I don't think change will come
rapidly be cause they have no other way to make a living. As long
as they maintain the same levels of physical activity, they will be
protected.'' &QL;

A 100 YEARS LATER, CAN FREUD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (THIS ARTICLE ALSO MOVED IN ``K'' and ``L'' CATEGORIES) One
hundred years ago this month, Sigmund Freud began an enterprise
that would turn us all inside out.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Interpretation of Dreams,'' published in November 1899,
the 43-year-old Viennese doctor theorized that dreams present us
with repressed desires. All dreams are wish fulfillment, Freud
claimed, and it is possible to read our dreams and to know things
felt long ago in childhood that were driven into the unconscious
under the weight of social norms and parental expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Using free association, dream interpretation and long-term
interaction with an analyst, neurotic behavior could be understood
as the result of repressed memories of childhood trauma.
Consciousness could dispel those unconscious urges that rule us
from below.
</P>
<P>
   Freud wrote many other books over the next four decades,
developing his theory of psychoanalysis into a comprehensive view
of human experience. By knowing the dark sources of its everyday
behavior, he averred, humanity could be made healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone has agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After untold millions of hours have been spent by thousands upon
hundreds of thousands of patients on couches talking about potty
training and relationships with their moms, it seems scarcely
possible to assert in 1999 that humans are generally happier than
they were in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Freud's theory is not so life-altering as originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's not even tenable.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Greeks, in the myth of Orpheus and the Underworld,
seem to have anticipated Freud and found his theory wanting.
</P>
<P>
   According to the myth, the great musician Orpheus loved the
nymph Eurydice with a passion that transcended all. When, on their
wedding day, she died of a snake bite, Orpheus would not let death
part them. Orpheus strode into the Underworld and requested of
Pluto, its King, to let Eurydice leave with him when he returned to
the sunshine. Pluto granted Orpheus' request on one condition:
Orpheus must not look back at Eurydice as they left, but keep his
gaze directed at the road ahead, the path out of the Underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus began the journey back with Eurydice following. But as
he neared the exit from the kingdom of shades, he could not resist
a glance back at his beloved. Instantly, he realized his mistake,
as Eurydice slipped back helplessly into the darkness. Orpheus
emerged into the light alone, and for the rest of his days roamed
the land, heartbroken, singing his tragic songs.
</P>
<P>
   In the myth, the Underworld _ the Greeks' symbol for the
unconscious _ could not be successfully breached by Orpheus/Reason
without losing the object of its quest. The contents of the
unconscious could not be pulled out into the sunshine and
comprehended in conscious, rational terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Freud asserted that they could, and he has convinced most of
the rest of us that he was right. His theories, once radical, are
now everyday. His observation of the stages of infant development
today seem obvious to any observant parent: the oral stage,
dominated by feeding; the anal stage, with attention shifted to
endless diaper changes; and the genital stage, signalling the first
hints of sexual awareness. After the mindless destruction of World
War I seemed to deny the life force itself, Freud put forth the
idea, in ``Beyond the Pleasure Principle,'' that humans struggle
daily with two opposing forces: Eros, the life force, and Thanatos,
the death force. Whenever we talk about someone having a death
wish, Freud is there.
</P>
<P>
   He's also there when we say something sexual where a sexual
reference was not intended _ we call it a ``Freudian slip.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's there whenever his grossest generalization, the Oedipus
complex, is taken seriously. Generalizing from the results of his
own self-analysis, in which he found himself attracted to his own
mother in childhood, Freud asserted it to be true of all children,
male and female alike (which has recently found him favor in
lesbian circles). The actual story of Oedipus in Greek mythology
probably points to something far less sexually specific: that a man
is likely to follow the pattern set out for him in youth, to
attempt to duplicate the home he was raised in and to replace (to
``kill'') his father. But the myth is now so wrapped up with Freud
that it is hard to disentangle it.
</P>
<P>
   Freud's reputation crested sometime midcentury and has since
been under sustained attack. Where once Freud was a hero of popular
culture _ the 1962 Hollywood howler ``Freud'' cast Montgomery Clift
as the bearded cigar-smoker and featured the oracular tones of
director-narrator John Huston comparing Freud to Christ _ he is now
passe, a name with little resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, the scholarly world, too, has tended more to
Freud-bashing than to Freud hagiography. In ``The Memory Wars:
Freud's Legacy in Dispute (New York Review, 1995),'' author and
former Freudian Frederick Crews dismissed Freud as ``the discoverer
of vague general truths about human deviousness.'' E. Fuller
Torrey, in ``Freudian Fraud (Harper Collins, 1992),'' made a case
that there is no scientific basis whatsoever for Freud's theories.
</P>
<P>
   Long before either book was published, no less a figure than
Ludwig Wittgenstein, one of the century's greatest philosophers,
pointed out perhaps the single greatest flaw in Freudian theory. If
Freud had indeed discovered dark things in the unconscious, how
could he possibly prove they were things of meaning? A cause is not
a meaning. Event A may cause Behavior B without imbuing B with a
particular meaning.
</P>
<P>
   A child may learn to repress sexual urges that do not correspond
to parental expectations, but, well . . . so what? Nothing
scientific can be drawn from such an observation. An additional
element is needed, Wittgenstein observed, to give the event and its
repression meaning: the very unscientific one of mythology.
(Wittgenstein's observations about Freud, scattered throughout his
career in essays and lectures, are gathered in ``Wittgenstein Reads
Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious,'' by Jacques Bouveresse,
translated by Carol Cosman (Princeton University Press, 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   So, Freud's power depends, not on any factual, scientific
observation about humanity, but on the skills he had as a writer
and self-promoter to convince us that looking at life his way _ at
every neurosis as a repressed desire, at every dream as wish
fulfillment, etc. _ is the right way to look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Psychoanalysis is a myth without hard scientific basis.
Paradoxically, it's a myth that loses potency when stripped of its
supposed factual basis, becoming then just one possibility among
many others. Freud himself was adamant that his theories be
considered ``correct.'' In ``The Ego and the Id (1923)'' he wrote:
``The fact that in the technique of psychoanalysis a means has been
found by which the opposing force (repression) can be removed and
the ideas in question made conscious renders the theory
IRREFUTABLE.(ITAL)''
</P>
<P>
   The claim to irrefutability was part of Freud's myth.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Orpheus and Eurydice was a myth about the
exploration of the unconscious. Its moral was that knowing the dark
side of ourselves is not possible except in the symbols of art _
Orpheus' music.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of Freud was a modern version of same in which knowing
our unconscious selves in rational terms is not only possible, but
factually verifiable according to the theories of psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the old myth, and not the new one, more accurately
represents the human condition? Not all myths are equal. Some got
there first because they state a truth that lies at the center of
our existence.
</P>
<P>
   If the story of Orpheus is truer than the story of Freud, then
our conscious and unconscious selves are not meant to communicate
in the way Freud wanted them to. In psychoanalysis, the language of
the conscious self dominates the unconscious; the unconscious is
invaded. The Orpheus myth would lead us rather to leave the
unconscious alone on its own terms, and content our conscious
selves with meditating on the symbols of art and spirituality that
are the universal language of the unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   In very general terms, this is what Carl Jung did. The Swiss
student of Freud trumped his teacher's belief in the unconscious by
giving the unconscious its due, developing a whole new branch of
psychology that diverged from Freud by dwelling not on repressed
sexual urges but on the meaning of symbols from the unconscious. He
let the unconscious speak in its own language.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of plumbing the darkness inside ourselves, sexual or
otherwise, may have begun to pale. The latest trend in therapy is
philosophical therapy, which is an exact denial of psychological
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   According to philosophical therapists, our duties as people are
to develop conscious discernment and leave what cannot be discerned
to dreams, art and religion. In a time when Freudian theories have
decayed to the point that respect is given to every smirking sexual
reference on daytime television talk shows, it's a refreshing
concept. &QL;

FLORES' BIG YEAR IS NO SMOOTH RIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Listening to David Flores speak enthusiastically
about the horses he'll ride in Saturday's Breeders' Cup at
Gulfstream Park in Florida, it's hard to believe that two months
ago he said he didn't want to go back on a racetrack ever again.
</P>
<P>
   In the crushing emotion the day J.C. Gonzalez was killed in a
two-horse accident at Fairplex Park in Pomona, Flores told a friend
on the phone, ``I don't want to ride anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a brother for me,'' Flores said over the weekend
at his stall in the Santa Anita jockeys' room.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, who is 31, and Gonzalez, who was 23, used to drive to
Flores' native Tijuana to watch midnight rooster fights (which are
legal in Mexico). Flores was a mentor to the young rider, just as
he had been helped 15 years ago at Caliente racetrack by a veteran
jockey, Federico Ruiz, killed in a fall Flores said was similar to
Gonzalez's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just me. We all try to help riders when they start,''
Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   Flores heard of Gonzalez's death on a car phone as he traveled
from Del Mar to ride on opening day at Fairplex on Sept. 9. Among
the most visibly saddened jockeys that afternoon, Flores wound up
sitting out the Los Angeles County Fair season _ during which he'd
planned to ride sparingly _ before returning to action at Bay
Meadows in San Mateo the weekend before the Oak Tree meet opened at
Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Flores was dealing with the illness of his
father (since recovered) and separated from his wife (they're still
apart); they have three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Gonzalez's death) made me think about a lot of things,''
Flores said. He wondered about his career choice but decided ``it's
what we (jockeys) do for a living, this is what we like to do, and
things happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just got to be grateful for (each) day and pray for my
family. We're all here for only a short time. I try not to think
about it in a negative way. There's a better place somewhere up
there, and he (Gonzalez) is watching us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has watched Flores continue a breakthrough year by
taking the lead over Alex Solis in the Oak Tree jockeys' race.
Flores won his first major-track titles earlier in 1999 at Santa
Anita and Del Mar, having become the No. 1 rider for dominant
trainer Bob Baffert when Gary Stevens briefly moved his tack to
England.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday Gonzalez will watch Flores ride in five of the eight
Breeders' Cup races on what could be the greatest day of his _ or
any jockey's _ career.
</P>
<P>
   Flores has ridden in only six Breeders' Cup races in his life.
None of those horses commanded odds lower than 11-1 (Track Gal in
the 1997 Sprint at Hollywood Park), and none finished better than
fifth (Johnbill in the 1997 Juvenile).
</P>
<P>
   But this time he'll be aboard favorites Chilukki (Juvenile
Fillies) and Forest Camp (Juvenile), contender General Challenge
(Classic) and longshot Tuzla (Mile) for Baffert, as well as
longshot Enjoy the Moment (Sprint) for trainer Bill Spawr. More
than $8 million in purses will be at stake in those races.
</P>
<P>
   The one Flores most looks forward to riding at Gulfstream seems
to be Chilukki. He guided the 2-year-old owned by Houston pro
football's Bob McNair to three of her six victories without a
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an unbelievable filly,'' Flores said, unworried about
Chilukki's less-than-impressive victory in Santa Anita's recent Oak
Leaf, her first attempt to race beyond the sprint distances her
pedigree suggests. ``I believe Bob (Baffert) knows what he's doing.
He's focusing just to get the horses ready for the Breeders' Cup
(even if) they get beat (in their preps).''
</P>
<P>
   Flores said the same confidence in Baffert's big-race
preparations applies to Forest Camp (beaten by Dixie Union in the
Norfolk) and General Challenge (outgamed by Budroyale in the
Goodwood).
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to know I have a chance in a few races next
Saturday,'' Flores said. ``It could be one of the biggest moments
of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   A day to be grateful for.

PAYTON DIES OF CANCER AT AGE 45 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN McCLAIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Chicago Bears running back Walter Payton, the National
Football League's career rushing leader and a member of the Pro
Football Hall of Fame, died Monday at the age of 45.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, who rushed for 16,726 yards during a 13-year NFL career,
died of bile-duct cancer that was discovered during treatment for
primary sclerosing cholangitis, a rare liver disease. He died at
his suburban home in Barrington, Ill. His family was with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a person, Walter was a bright spot for any darkness that
appeared,'' said former Bears linebacker Mike Singletary, a
teammate who read scriptures with Payton before he died. ``He
refused to think, `Why me? Why now?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter continued to look forward right up until the end. When
I left him this morning, I saw a peace that I hadn't seen all
year.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, Payton disclosed that he was suffering from the
liver disease and was seeking a liver transplant. But after the
diagnosis of cancer of the bile duct, a vessel that carries
digestive fluids from the liver to the small intestine, the liver
transplant would not have helped, according to Dr. Greg Gores of
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The malignancy was very advanced and progressed very
rapidly,'' said Gores, who had been treating Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Because the cancer had spread outside his liver, Gores said a
transplant ``was no longer tenable.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports surfaced last week that Payton was close to death. When
his son, Jarrett, who plays football for the University of Miami,
left school to return home Wednesday, Payton's friends and fans
were put on alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the day in February when my dad told the world of his
liver disease, the outpouring of love, support and prayers from
around the world astounded even him,'' Jarrett Payton said at a
news conference at the Bears' training facility.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Columbia, Miss., Payton played at Jackson State and
was drafted in the first round by the Bears in 1975. He played for
bad teams during the early part of his career, when his smooth
running style and easygoing personality earned him the nickname
``Sweetness.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton had a rare combination of quickness, power and toughness.
He also used the best stiff-arm in the NFL. Not only was he a
sensational runner; he blocked like a lineman and had hands as soft
as those of some receivers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, his second season, Payton began a string of 10
consecutive seasons with at least 1,000 yards rushing. In 1977, he
rushed for a career-high 1,852 yards and set the NFL single-game
record with 275 yards against Minnesota. He earned the first of his
two Most Valuable Player awards.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Payton broke the league's career rushing record of
12,312 set by former Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was, without a doubt, one of the greatest players in the
history of the sport,'' NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said.
``Walter exemplified class, and all of us in sports should honor
him by striving to perpetuate his standard of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter was an inspiration in everything he did. The tremendous
grace and dignity he displayed in his final months reminded us
again why Sweetness was the perfect nickname.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first part of his career, Payton received a lot of
sympathy for being such an outstanding player on such average
teams. But when Mike Ditka became the Bears' coach in 1982, they
became a powerhouse that finished 15-1 in 1985 and beat New England
46-10 in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad to me because he had a lot greater impact on my life
than I had on his,'' said Ditka, who now coaches the New Orleans
Saints. ``He was the best football player I've ever seen and one of
the best people I've ever met.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have been too good for a lot of years without
Walter. He was the catalyst for making the offense what it was. He
was the one guy that really worked hard at pulling the team
together in the '80s when it could have come apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got as much pleasure out of watching him block somebody as
watching him run for a touchdown or watching him catch a pass,
throw a pass or kick the ball. He was just a talented guy, but he
was also the hardest-working guy we had. He was the first guy there
and the last guy to leave. He came to camp in the best shape of
anybody I've ever seen. He was a machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Cubs' Ernie Banks before him and the Bulls' Michael
Jordan after him, Payton was worshipped in Chicago and recognized
around the country as the best at what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter was a Chicago icon long before I arrived,'' Jordan
said. ``He was a great man off the field, and his on-the-field
accomplishments speak for themselves. I spent a lot of time with
Walter, and I truly feel that we have lost a great man.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton retired after the 1987 season, and the Bears retired his
No. 34. In the first year he was eligible for the Pro Football Hall
of Fame, he was a unanimous selection.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Payton made a lot of money and invested wisely. He was a member of
the Bears' board of directors, was a popular speaker around the
country, and he attempted to become part-owner of an NFL franchise.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement, Payton did become part-owner of an Arena Football
League franchise. He also became interested in auto racing and
bought a piece of a CART team.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Other than his son, Payton is survived by his wife, Connie, and his
daughter, Brittney.

GAILEY SAYS BREAKDOWNS CAUSING SECOND-HALF MISERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys could be 6-0-1, not 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   If NFL games were 30 minutes long.
</P>
<P>
   Throw out the fourth quarter, and the Cowboys would be virtually
unbeatable this season. The only game in which the Cowboys have
trailed going into the fourth quarter _ Sept. 12 at Washington _
they came back and won in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   They have had double-digit leads in all but one of their games
and have been outscored 51-14 in the second half of their three
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Cowboys can't stand their own prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey says this squandering leads and blowing games
is more closely related to execution breakdowns than a change in
mindset after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are predetermined mindsets going into a
game. I think things happen during the course of a game,'' said
Gailey, citing a third-quarter sack/fumble by Troy Aikman that gave
the Colts an easy touchdown, and a narrowly missed completion on a
deep route to Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail early in the fourth quarter
that would have answered a 40-yard Colts touchdown pass with an
80-yard bomb of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Too conservative, no killer instinct, unable to play as well
with a lead as when under the gun of desperation ... Gailey has
heard all the theories after these losses, which total three in the
Cowboys' past four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think things happen during the course of a game, and then
all of a sudden you have to make some plays,'' Gailey said. ``We
didn't make them, and \Rthe Colts\S did.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Cowboys gave up too many big plays, mostly in
the second half. Offensively, they failed to come up with enough of
their own big plays once the lead started to evaporate in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Everything the Colts tried in the second half worked. And once
again, the Cowboys let a winnable road game slip-slide away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went more to three wide \Rreceivers\S in the second half,
which really did more to open up running creases for them,'' Gailey
said. ``They had maximum protection and hit some guys downfield off
run fakes... That's what got us the most.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts had nine plays of 16 or more yards, including six in
the second half. Two of those six plays came on third down.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had their worst game of the season in third-down
situations, allowing the Colts to convert 38.5 percent after
holding three of its previous six opponents to less than 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Cowboys have experience a sharp reduction in
the ground game over the second half, especially in the fourth
quarter, in the games they lost, although Gailey would only say,
``That's part of the problem ... not the total'' problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' yards-per-carry average went from 4.8 to 3.1 at
Philadelphia and from 4.6 to 3.0 after halftime against
Indianapolis. The Giants threw up eight- and nine-man fronts and
held Smith to 1.2 yards per carry overall.
</P>
<P>
   But not only do the Cowboys run less frequently after
squandering leads, as one might expect, but they also run the ball
less effectively.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial miss on third-and-one came on the first possession of
the second half. Emmitt Smith tried to go off-tackle on the right
side and was stopped in his tracks. The Cowboys punted and the
Colts scored on each of their next five possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can be a better team than we are right now,'' Cowboys owner
Jerry Jones said. ``If you get up like we did, you've got to learn
how to stay up.'' nn

AIKMAN BOTHERED BY HEADACHES, TO HAVE MRI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys aren't calling quarterback
Troy Aikman's condition a concussion, but he was still bothered by
headaches Monday and is scheduled to undergo a
magnetic-resonance-imaging exam Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was sidelined for a series in the fourth quarter of
Sunday's 34-24 loss to Indianapolis after a helmet-to-helmet hit
from Colts defensive back Jeff Burris.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman experienced headaches, blurred vision and dizziness on
the sideline and complained of headaches after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer said the MRI is precautionary; Aikman
has had five concussions in his 11-year career with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a concussion,'' Maurer said. ``We want to take every
precaution to make sure nothing is wrong. He is our quarterback. I
don't anticipate finding anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said the doctors want to compare the MRI to the previous
tests on him to see if there are any changes.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's ``not anticipating not being able to play'' Monday
against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman is the second Cowboys player in as many weeks to
experience a head injury in a game and return to action. Cornerback
Deion Sanders suffered a concussion against the Redskins two weeks
ago and returned to the game against doctors' orders. GAILEY ON
GAILEY Despite growing criticism of the Cowboys seemingly
conservative play calling, Chan Gailey the head coach has no
problems with Chan Gailey the offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, however, acknowledged that an offensive coordinator
thinks more about the offense and tends to be more wide-open. As a
head coach, he said he can't think just about the offense, but
about the whole team and situations.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what Gailey was doing at the end of the first half
Sunday. The Cowboys got the ball with 1 minute, 11 seconds left at
their 23-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Considering they had a 17-6 lead, it could have a been a good
time to score again and perhaps demoralize the young Colts. Gailey,
however, called two running plays and ran out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Another call that was even more conservative was the
third-and-seven play at the Colts' 9 on the Cowboys' second drive
of the game. Instead of going for the touchdown to make the score
14-0, Gailey called a draw play to set up a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging the Cowboys offense under Gailey is probably
a little more conservative than it has been in the past, Aikman
said he has no problems with Gailey as head coach or coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm being negative in my response and I don't want
that to happen,'' Aikman said. ``It's easy to lose and say I wish I
would have done this differently or that differently. That's part
of losing. When that happens you get critiqued.'' INJURY REPORT

IN WALTER PAYTON'S CASE, NICKNAME TRULY FIT THE SUPERSTAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heaven is assembling quite a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   In Walter Payton's final days, his old friend and teammate Mike
Singletary said that ``a peace that surpassed all understanding''
had overtaken the great running back.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's son had been summoned home from college. Payton's most
treasured friends, among them Singletary and Matt Suhey, had been
there to talk and pray with him. And he had no less than the Mayo
Clinic searching day and night for the miracle that might have kept
him alive.
</P>
<P>
   But heaven claimed another superstar Monday. As basketball
legend Wilt Chamberlain's passing had done three weeks ago, and
golf champion Payne Stewart's tragic death had done last week, the
notion of anything, even cancer, overtaking Walter Payton both
shocks and saddens us.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best football player I've ever seen, and probably
one of the best people I ever met,'' said Mike Ditka, who coached
Payton for six seasons with the Chicago Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka's eyes were red and his voice subdued, media members in
New Orleans reported. And how appropriate _ in the end, the
gracious Payton even calmed the volcanic Ditka.
</P>
<P>
   But as his nickname suggested, Payton was sweetness. He was the
sweetest runner most of us ever saw, and he was the humblest,
sweetest superstar that a crowd ever stood and cheered for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this,'' Ditka said. ``He had a lot greater impact on my
life than I had on his.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton was only 45. He had informed the world of his illness in
February, calling a news conference because he reportedly could no
longer explain why he kept losing weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pray for me,'' Payton said back then, and an entire city got
down on its knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our greatest thanks go out to the people of Chicago,''
Walter's son, Jarrett, said Monday, speaking for the family. ``You
adopted my dad and made him yours. He loved you all. We are proud
to be among you.''
</P>
<P>
   For 13 seasons, Walter Payton was the Bears, even when they
couldn't muster a growl. But even while toiling behind dismal Bears
lines, Payton never let his own luster dim. He gained 1,000 yards
or more in 10 separate seasons. He posted a record 77 games of
rushing for 100 or more yards.
</P>
<P>
   A city of big shoulders, Chicago saw its heart taken by a gentle
man who was, at most, 5 feet, 10 inches, and weighed 208 pounds.
The world came to better know Payton in that autumn of 1985, when
the Bears steamrolled their way to Super Bowl XX.
</P>
<P>
   It was a team of strong personalities _ Ditka, defensive
coordinator Buddy Ryan and quarterback Jim McMahon, among them. But
the soul of the '85 Bears, we discovered that Super Bowl week, was
Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Brian Piccolo died, my husband and I promised that we
wouldn't again become so personally involved with any of the
players,'' said Virginia McCaskey, daughter of the late Bears owner
George Halas. ``We were able to follow that promise until Walter
Payton came into our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   He became the superstar who never acted like a superstar. When
the Bears trumpeted their arrival that 1985 season with a 44-0 rout
of the Cowboys in Texas Stadium, Payton gave all the credit to the
coaches and the defense.
</P>
<P>
   The late Bears president, Jim Finks, once said of Walter, ``He
let his work speak for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brown. Gale Sayers. O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's consistency and his ability to lift the Bears surpassed
them all. His rushing statistics support that. He broke Brown's
career rushing record in 1984. In 13 seasons, Payton remarkably
missed only one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the hardest working guy we had,'' Ditka recalled. ``He
came to camp in the best shape of anyone I've ever seen, and he did
it all on his own _ running the hills, lifting the weights. He was
a machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditka said he last saw him last summer, when the coach was
invited to sing at the seventh-inning stretch of a Chicago Cubs
game. Payton threw out the first pitch that day, and the effort
tired him so much that he had to cancel the rest of the week's
engagements.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayo Clinic doctors had hoped to make Walter a spokesman for
organ donor awareness. But from his failing liver, the cancer
spread.
</P>
<P>
   It seems so ironic, so tragic, so unfair. We live in a time when
professional athletes have never been wealthier. But for all the
billions spent on both sports and medical research, cancer remains
the demon that always seems to exact its price. Nearly every family
has felt its cruel grip.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven claimed the sweetest of running backs Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For sports fans, it's been a cruel month. nn

SEAHAWKS CRUSH PACKERS, 27-7 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ There is a street near Lambeau Field called
Mike Holmgren Way. It was named after Holmgren for his seven years
of service as the Green Bay head coach in which he won a Super Bowl
and helped restore the Packers' legend and luster.
</P>
<P>
   Well, on Monday night Mike Holmgren had his way.
</P>
<P>
   He brought his new team, the Seattle Seahawks, into this
hallowed place and helped to place them in prime position to
ridicule Packers quarterback Brett Favre, punch the Packers'
defense and, in the end, torment the 59,869 Packers fans who
arrived hoping Holmgren's homecoming would be a Packers feast.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Holmgren and the Seahawks who did the toasting,
winning, 27-7, in a game in which the Packers crumbled in a variety
of ways, never getting in sync, spinning in their own mess, falling
to 4-3 and being humbled by Holmgren, their coach from 1992 to
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very emotional night for me,'' Holmgren said. ``To come
in and play the Packers this way, it's hard to put into words. I'm
happy for the guys in this locker room. They really earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle improved to 5-2 and remained in a first-place tie with
Kansas City for the American Football Conference West lead. The
Seahawks forced seven turnovers, got two touchdown passes from Jon
Kitna and 125 yards rushing from Ricky Watters.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay suffered only its second loss in its past 35 games at
Lambeau Field. By the end, Favre had four interceptions, two
fumbles and a headache, not to mention a heavy heart. He left the
game with 6 minutes 25 seconds remaining, replaced by Matt
Hasselbeck.
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be nothing wrong with Favre except for the
burden of the night. Kitna outplayed Favre, making fewer mistakes
and helping to keep Seattle poised.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle led, 14-7, at halftime and made the Packers look even
more confused and dazed in the second half. Four events occurred in
the third quarter that made the night a lost one for Green Bay:
</P>
<P>
   _ At the start, Kitna and Watters drove the ball through the
nucleus of the Green Bay defense, with Kitna completing a
nine-play, 73-yard drive with a 2-yard scoring toss to receiver
Sean Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
   _ During the drive, Green Bay linebacker Brian Williams injured
a knee and was lost for the game.
</P>
<P>
   _ With 8:08 left, Green Bay offensive tackle Earl Dotson was
ejected and slapped with two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties for
fighting, forcing Green Bay to absorb 30 yards of penalties in one
play.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the closing seconds, with Green Bay trailing by 21-7 and
threatening at the Seattle 5, Favre fumbled when hit by Seattle
tackle Cortez Kennedy. End Michael Sinclair returned the ball 13
yards to the Seattle 36.
</P>
<P>
   The few times the Packers appeared close to making it a game,
they wound up spending more time backpedaling, creating their own
chaos. Favre's final numbers: 14 of 35 passing for 180 yards. It
was only the second time in his career that he threw four
interceptions in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle and Green Bay opened the game as if both were fighting
for first place in their divisions, as if both were tense and
uptight under the glow of Monday night football and as if both
defenses were far better prepared than the offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The first half featured six turnovers, four by Green Bay. Twice
in the half, the teams offered turnovers on consecutive plays.
There were 19 possessions in the half, five of them producing three
plays and a punt.
</P>
<P>
   A blocked field goal attempt opened the game's scoring.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly five minutes left in the first quarter, Green Bay
attempted a 50-yard field goal. Seattle defensive end Lamar King
strode through the middle and blocked it, and cornerback Shawn
Springs scooped up the ball. He strode 61 yards into the end zone
for a 7-0 Seattle edge.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the half, Seattle employed a defense against Favre
that was resilient and effective. It kept its safeties deep, always
as a last line of defense, preventing even the notion of a Green
Bay bomb. It double-teamed Favre's favorite target, receiver
Antonio Freeman. Seattle kept Favre contained, occasionally
blitzing safety Brian Walker from the right edge. Favre was forced
to be patient, and he struggled.
</P>
<P>
   He was hyper and off target at the start, completing only 12 of
26 passes for 162 yards in the first half. He was intercepted
twice. Only once did Favre hit a groove .
</P>
<P>
   On a second-and-11 play from the Green Bay 26, Favre looked for
receiver Corey Bradford running a slant from the left. For one of
the few times in the half, Seattle was impatient, especially safety
Jay Bellamy. He read Favre's eyes, took a hard inside move toward
Bradford and the ball but missed both. Bradford caught it 12 yards
upfield and split the defense, racing 74 yards for a touchdown that
tied the score at 7-7 with 10:17 left before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The most meticulous drive of the half began with 8:19 left and
ended with 5:48 remaining. Seattle created it, starting at its 48
and ending in the end zone. It took six plays and was spiced with
Kitna passes of 8, 21, 2 and 10 yards. The 21-yard pass was a
one-handed grab by Watters to the Green Bay 23. The 10-yard
reception was a leaping and eventual one-handed stab by receiver
Derrick Mayes. It gave Seattle its halftime lead.

officials say. The U.S. trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky,
announced Monday that she expected formal negotiations with China
to resume this month on its entry into the World Trade
Organization, and some officials said she may travel to China
before a trade meeting in Seattle at the end of the month if there
is enough progress that President Clinton could announce a deal in
Seattle. But in public, Ms. Barshefsky _ once burned when the
president turned down her advice to take the April deal _ is being
quite cautious. ``We have got to see,'' she said Monday, when asked
about the possibility of a deal. ``There is quite a bit of work to
go.'' Exclusive. By David E. Sanger.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HE earned his living and his legend in a sport known for its
violence and macho culture, and perhaps this is why his nickname
rang so true and seemed so perfectly coined. Can you imagine a
construction worker or a lumberjack or a truck driver named
Sweetness?
</P>
<P>
   For Walter Payton, the reference applied not only to his nature
but to his style and his moves as a runner _ eye candy.
</P>
<P>
   He played 13 seasons, all with a team that reveled in its
long-ago reputation for making mayhem, the Chicago Bears, the
Monsters of the Midway. When he retired in 1987, Payton was the
National Football League's career leader in rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most popular players the game has known ran out
of clock Monday. At 45, he died in his suburban Chicago home of
cancer complications from a liver disease.
</P>
<P>
   You thought about golf's Payne Stewart, who perished a week
earlier in a private plane that burrowed into the earth through
nearly nine miles of sky, and Greg Moore, a 24-year-old race driver
whose car careened into a concrete wall Sunday at 220 mph. Payton
died in his own bed, quietly, touched by his family and friends. He
was no longer the tightly muscled physical specimen of his prime.
He asked for no favors in his medical care, and his vigil was
hardly shared with the public.
</P>
<P>
   One finds no comparisons to be drawn, no points to be made, no
dots to be connected. Athletes tend to live forever on the sports
page. But it was a ghastly week for everybody they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read scriptures with him,'' said fellow Pro Football Hall of
Famer Mike Singletary, who had been Payton's teammate for so many
years. ``I told my wife there was a peace there that passeth
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Your mind drifted back to the most important game of this Hall
of Fame career, the 1986 Super Bowl against the New England
Patriots in New Orleans. When the season began, the Chicago Bears
were a Cinderella team. They were descended from George Halas, the
Papa Bear. Their coach, Mike Ditka, had been a Bear right out of
college. And there were all the cute baby Bears _ Payton, Jim
McMahon and William Perry, the hottest thing in refrigerators since
Betty Furness.
</P>
<P>
   All week, McMahon had worn dark glasses and practiced his dance
steps while looking like one of the Blues Brothers. In fact, there
was a suspicion the Bears did not actually exist but were simply a
skit conceived by the original cast of Saturday Night Live.
</P>
<P>
   What brought us back to reality was the presence of the one
called Sweetness. Payton was playing in a championship game for the
first time, adding a sentimental touch to an event not always noted
for its soft human drama. And while the Bears were winning by what
was then the most lopsided score in Super Bowl history, 46-10, the
script somehow went awry.
</P>
<P>
   On the second play of the game, Payton fumbled at his own
19-yard line, leading to a Patriots field goal. New England led 3-0
after a minute and 19 seconds, and no team had ever scored earlier
in the Super Bowl. In the original colonies, the fans were
celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears had to come from behind to win, and they spent the
rest of the day doing so. On the goal line, McMahon punched the
ball in twice and Refrigerator Perry once. Chicago had dedicated
the game to Payton, but it forgot to give him the ball for a
symbolic score. Ah, sweet mysteries of life. The Bears were 18-1
that year, and you know a team is awesome when the only quibble is
over who gets the spoils.
</P>
<P>
   Walter did not dwell on this slight, and he did not take it
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most disappointing thing,'' said Ditka, ``was Payton not
getting a touchdown. I don't have to apologize to anybody. If I had
it to do over, no question I would have given it to him. But when
it's all over, with all he has accomplished, if his scoring a
gimmie touchdown at the end of a Super Bowl is important, then I'm
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was a somber Ditka on Monday, a clip of his reaction
repeated over and over on television: ``He was a Bear. That was
what he was meant to be, and he was the best of them all. He was
the best player I ever saw, period. At any position, period. And he
was probably the best person I ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   His name had been mentioned at least twice in connection with
black groups bidding to buy an NFL franchise. The teams, as irony
would have it, were the Bears and the Patriots, the Super Bowl XX
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing came of it. Imagine, a sports owner called
Sweetness.

PAYTON, MAN OF GRACE, SHUNNED SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What behemoths in cleats couldn't accomplish,
pencil-necked geeks did. Walter Payton eluded linebackers and
defensive backs with breathtaking ease during his glorious 13-year
NFL career, but he had a much harder time shaking off the pesky
press.
</P>
<P>
   Payton never intended to reveal more of himself than the
graceful, joyful, powerful image he presented on football Sundays.
Noah Jackson, who opened holes for Payton in Chicago, once said of
the league's all-time leading rusher, ``He won't let you get to
know anything about him.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a superstar who ran away from the limelight. But as
strong and smart and shifty as Payton was, the spotlight managed to
catch him from behind and drag him down in the last few yards of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Payton was diagnosed in January with the liver-ravaging disease
that hastened his death Monday at the age of 45. He meant to keep
the news to himself. ``I'm like my father was,'' he once said. ``I
deal with things on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he appeared at a press conference in February for his
son Jarrett, who announced he would attend Miami on a football
scholarship, looking so gaunt it set off an avalanche of rumors
rumbling through the media.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, however awful, was less jarring than the many
falsehoods. So Payton reversed field and a week later fed the media
the cold, hard facts concerning his health. He was suffering from a
rare disease that caused the bile ducts of his liver to become
blocked.
</P>
<P>
   He had lost 40 pounds from his once robust 210-pound frame.
Without a liver transplant, he likely would die within two years.
The median waiting period for liver transplant patients in Illinois
was 127 days, roughly the length of an NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, who habitually carried a Bible with him in his
briefcase, said he was hopeful of a full recovery but he also
admitted that day to feeling something else. ``Yeah, I'm scared,''
he said. ``Wouldn't you be?''
</P>
<P>
   It was tough for Superman to admit he wasn't bulletproof.
</P>
<P>
   Though reluctant to have his medical dossier become a matter of
public record, Payton quickly came to realize he had been given a
new ball, so to speak, to carry in those huge hands of his.
</P>
<P>
   His office was inundated with letters from people of all ages
who wanted to share their own experiences or simply wish him well.
Interest in organ donations swelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess during the time I've been (in Chicago) I've touched a
lot of people,'' Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   How wonderful that he realized that before he died. How horrible
it would have been had Payton gone to his grave never fully
understanding how far and wide his impact spread.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Adamle, a Chicago sportscaster who played behind Payton in
the 1970s, said the legacy his good friend forged in the last few
months of his life arguably exceeded anything he did on the
football field. It was as if his life played out like one of his
football games, with Payton at his absolute strongest in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The quintessential Bear missed only one game in his 13 years in
Chicago and that was during his rookie season. Adamle, playing in
his place, gained 100 yards to become the answer to a trivia
question.
</P>
<P>
   In his final season (1987), Payton, who had long since
supplanted Jim Brown as the NFL's most prolific runner, voluntarily
moved to fullback so Neal Anderson would have a chance to get his
cleats wet.
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much summed up Payton as both a player and a person.
</P>
<P>
   He was a man of few words, preferring to let his actions speak
more loudly than that endearingly squeaky voice of his.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a whole lot to say in May, when Payton found out
the beeper he was due to receive _ the one that would have notified
him as soon as a compatible liver was found _ wouldn't be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had discovered a malignancy in his bile ducts and the
cancer had spread. It was too late for a new liver to save Payton,
too late for chemotherapy and radiation to matter much.
</P>
<P>
   Payton knew he was dying but hoped to live out his last days in
peace, on his own terms. But members of the media, in their thirst
to be first with a big story, couldn't leave Payton well enough
alone.
</P>
<P>
   They poked and prodded his inner circle and Sunday, two radio
stations _ one in Philadelphia and the other in New York _
prematurely reported his death.
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst kind of personal foul. In the future, the hope
here is the media will play by the rules of common decency. Payton
was proof that such simple grace is possible.

ON FIRST DAY, STONEMAN HAS NEWS FOR CRITICS
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels got their man, although it
took longer than they had hoped. Bill Stoneman was named general
manager of the team during a news conference Monday afternoon at
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman, 55, received a four-year deal. Financial terms were
not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman's area of expertise _ working well with a limited
budget and crunching numbers _ is also a criticism of him because
it implies he doesn't know baseball. But Stoneman said it isn't
fair to label him as a non-baseball person. He pitched eight
seasons in the majors, threw two no-hitters and made one All-Star
team before joining the Montreal Expos' front office in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think I'm an accountant. I'm not,'' he said.
``A lot of people think I'm a lawyer. I'm not. I'm really a
baseball guy. I had an opportunity to work with general managers
and had involvement in player personnel decisions without having to
be the guy to pull the trigger.... I have a player's background and
a business background. This is the marriage of those two things
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman also said it would be exciting to work with a budget
significantly greater than that of the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, coming from a $15 million payroll to whatever it's
going to be here is going to be very different from what I'm used
to,'' he said. ``And very welcomed.... I know small payrolls and
the Angels don't have a small payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman was named GM exactly one month to the day after former
GM Bill Bavasi announced his resignation, concluding what team
president Tony Tavares called an ``exhaustive'' search.
</P>
<P>
   Tavares decided on Stoneman almost two weeks ago and was ready
to announce the move on the day before the World Series. But that's
when Walt Disney Co. chairman and CEO Michael Eisner got involved
with the interview process, recalling other candidates and delaying
the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take some blame,'' Tavares said. ``I did a lot of
research and I made one candidate available to Michael. I was
thinking they would hit it off instantly. But Michael, being the
thorough guy he is, wanted the opportunity to look at the others.''
</P>
<P>
   So Eisner recalled Bob Watson, Jim Duquette and Omar Minaya, and
gave a first interview to Dan Evans, though Stoneman never lost his
standing as Tavares' top choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stayed in touch and I told him don't take this
personally,'' Tavares said. ``He was still No. 1 in my mind. Of
more concern to me was being forced to make decisions GMs would
have to make.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those decisions is hiring a manager, and Tavares did make
a ``substantial'' offer to Don Baylor. But Baylor took the Cubs'
managerial position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I focused early on Bill and the specific skills necessary to
do the job,'' Tavares said. ``And I never wavered on that. Bill has
uncanny knowledge to concisely state and envision the problem.
Everyone in baseball had good things to say about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization over time to a degree has kidded itself that
it was right there. Add one more player and we'll win one for the
Cowboy (Gene Autry). That's admirable but in reality they weren't
absolutely candid with themselves and where they stood
talent-wise.... Bill brings a fresh approach and an honest, outside
look.''

McCANN MOVES UP TO NO. 2 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA reserve quarterback Ryan McCann walked off
the Rose Bowl field Saturday night excited about his 3-of-6
performance against Arizona. What he didn't know, though, was if
anyone noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `I hope I showed enough to impress
somebody,''' McCann said.
</P>
<P>
   Validation arrived Monday _ wrapped in a promotion.
</P>
<P>
   McCann, a redshirt freshman from Agoura High, is now the Bruins'
second-string quarterback. Reserve Scott McEwan, of Thousand Oaks,
has dropped to third string after going 0 of 4 against Arizona, and
Drew Bennett has returned to receiver after one game as Cory Paus'
backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``(McCann's) pocket presence has improved,'' UCLA coach Bob
Toledo said. ``He still doesn't know where everybody is. But he has
the next-most ability of the quarterbacks (behind starter Paus),
and we need to get him ready to go for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   After watching his offense score 14 points in three games,
Toledo questioned for the first time Paus' long-term hold on the
starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the game, I was concerned,'' Toledo said. ``But after
looking at the film, I feel better. It's not his fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also believe McCann has some ability. It might be a
thing where we get through the season, then open it up (for
competition) in the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Where there's hope: When the Bruins broke training camp, McCann
was the fourth-string quarterback with little chance to play this
season. Two months later, he's No. 2 and closing ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been real tough, especially on Saturdays when I see the
guys out there,'' McCann said. ``I'm just excited to practice the
plays we run in the games. I've been with the scout team all season
(running the opposition's plays).''
</P>
<P>
   One small step: Paus completed 13 of 27 passes for 230 yards
Saturday in his best game in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He missed a couple balls, but he made better decisions,''
Toledo said. ``His drop was better. He stayed in the pocket. He did
a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Tight end Bryan Fletcher and defensive tackle Ken
Kocher are doubtful for the Washington game; both have sprained
left ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Robert Thomas, who missed the Arizona game
because of a concussion, is expected to play next week.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Danny Farmer (strained groin) and tailback DeShaun
Foster (sprained ankle), who have played sparingly in recent weeks,
should be at full strength for the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Note: The Nov. 13 Washington game will start at 12:30 p.m. and
be televised on Channel 7.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
GREEN BAY, Wis. _ Seattle coach Mike Holmgren's Green Bay
homecoming could not have been more exciting and satisfying if he
had been named homecoming king and circled Lambeau Field in a
vintage convertible.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Holmgren, who brought the title back to Titletown during seven
years as the Packers' coach, returned to Green Bay like an exiled
dictator and left with a stunning 27-7 victory Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Fans, who showed their appreciation for Holmgren by giving him a
rousing ovation before the game, hung signs all over Lambeau Field.
They were directed at the coach who guided the Packers to
back-to-back Super Bowls, including the 1997 championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very special time for me,'' Holmgren said. ``It was
an emotional time. I hope I handled the pressure pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be less than honest if I said this is just another game.
It wasn't. You can't help but get goose bumps coming into a game
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks were so ecstatic after the game, they probably
didn't need a jet to fly back to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how happy I am for my players and coaches,''
Holmgren said. ``The guys on the other sideline meant so much to me
for seven years, but now these guys mean a lot to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that (pre-game hype), I was just glad to play the game.
Coming away with a win in such a difficult place to play, well,
it's just hard for me to describe the feeling right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks forced the Packers into seven turnovers, including
four interceptions and two fumbles by quarterback Brett Favre, the
most in his career. It was the second time Favre, who has been
playing with a sore right hand, has thrown four interceptions in a
game. The first was in 1994, his third season with Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play against a great player like Brett, you have to
hold on for dear life,'' Holmgren said. ``He's too good to use one
thing against him. He'll just pick you apart. We tried to mix
things up against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defensive coaches did a great job. My only contribution to
the defensive performance was talking to them about the Packers
players I know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially Favre, who finished 14-of-35 for 180 yards passing.
His 26.8 passer rating was the worst of his career. Favre has
thrown 12 interceptions and is on a pace to break his career high
of 24 set in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We preached all week about protecting the ball, but we didn't
do a good job of it,'' Green Bay coach Ray Rhodes said. ``In a game
like this, you can't afford to commit turnovers like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle committed a couple in the first half, but we didn't
capitalize like they did. I just told Brett to keep his head up.
He's too good a player to let a game like this get him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (5-2) stayed tied with Kansas City for first place in
the AFC West. In being held to their lowest point total since 1996,
when they lost 21-6 to Dallas, the Packers (4-3) fell a game behind
Detroit in the NFC Central.
</P>
<P>
   There were several stars on the Seahawks' side of the field.
Cornerback Sean Springs intercepted two passes and returned a
blocked field goal 61 yards for a touchdown. Defensive tackle
Cortez Kennedy had three sacks and forced a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Ricky Watters carried 31 times for 126 yards and a
touchdown. Quarterback Jon Kitna was 12-of-19 for 107 yards and
touchdown passes to Derrick Mayes and Sean Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to throw the ball a lot early in the game, but when
we got the good lead, I got pretty conservative,'' Holmgren said.
``That might not be the style of play Jon wants, but it helped us
win, and that's what it's all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a young team, and for young players to come into
Lambeau Field and win should do wonders for their confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Packers looked tentative on offense, and no one more so than
Favre, who played his second terrible game in three weeks. He was
replaced in the fourth quarter when the Seahawks built a commanding
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Springs' touchdown and Mayes' 10-yard scoring catch from Kitna
gave Seattle a 14-7 lead. Green Bay's touchdown came when Corey
Bradford turned a quick slant into a 74-yard catch-and-run play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a great game defensively,'' Seattle free safety
Merton Hanks said. ``We worked hard last week. Coach Holmgren
handled the situation well, and we handled it well, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Packers didn't handle the situation well. They committed 10
penalties for 103 yards. Offensive tackle Earl Dotson was ejected
for shoving Kennedy twice, resulting in a pair of 15-yard
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Seattle took a 21-7 advantage on its
opening drive, going 73 yards and scoring on Kitna's two-yard pass
to Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers had a chance to get back in the game when they
reached Seattle's seven, but Kennedy sacked Favre, forcing a fumble
that defensive end Michael Sinclair recovered and returned to the
35 to get the Seahawks out of trouble.

HORRY AMONG THREE PUT ON INJURED LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the time arrived for the Los Angeles Lakers
to make final roster cuts Monday, the real surprise was that they
chose not to cut anyone at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers reduced the roster to 12 players by placing three on
the injured list: Kobe Bryant (broken right hand), Robert Horry
(sore left knee) and John Celestand (left knee tendinitis).
</P>
<P>
   That means forward Travis Knight, who hasn't played since
spraining his ankle three weeks ago, could be pressed into service
immediately, especially with Horry unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   It also means Horry, who has played despite chronic knee
problems, might have slipped a notch on the depth chart. He's been
playing every day, and his last-minute trip to the injured list was
a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The moves also mean Celestand, a rookie guard who wasn't
expected to make the team, will stick. That the Lakers stashed him
on the injured list is a clear sign the 6-foot-3 Villanova product
has earned a longer look.
</P>
<P>
   All three players were left in Los Angeles on Monday when the
Lakers flew to Salt Lake City for tonight's season opener against
the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   With Horry out, coach Phil Jackson apparently will start A.C.
Green at power forward. The two had been rotating starts. John
Salley, Rick Fox and Knight will provide relief help.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days ago, Jackson figured Knight would start the
season on injured reserve, where he'd have to sit for five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we feel good about where (Knight) is going towards and
we'd rather not sacrifice him for five games, that's for sure,''
Jackson said Monday. ``We saw how quickly he was progressing and
what our team really needed, what we had to have as far as team
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   More to come: Monday's roster moves won't be the last. Bryant
will return by the end of the month and Horry makes too much to
leave inactive. Unless someone else is injured, the Lakers will
have to cut or trade away two players.
</P>
<P>
   A deal for Detroit's Bison Dele is a possibility, but the Lakers
also are scanning the waiver wires for potential help in the
frontcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few names out there that have hit the wire, and
there's some teams that have expressed some interest in
possibilities,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jazzed: Ready or not, the Lakers spring the triangle offense on
the league tonight, for the first time in a game that matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're as ready as we can be at this point,'' Derek
Fisher said. `We're looking forward to it. It semed like October
lasted forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers aren't placing much pressure on themselves to win
immediately, but with early tests against the Jazz tonight and
Portland on Saturday, they are hoping to make an impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't win a championship now, but setting the tone early
is important,'' Fisher said. ``It's not necessarily about winning
games or what the scores are, but making sure we get better each
time we step out on the floor.''

FOR FOX, SATISFACTION AND REGRET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC quarterback John Fox might be the Trojans' man
of the moment, but he remains his own toughest critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to be,'' Fox said. ``No one can be as hard on
you as you are on yourself. To succeed, you need to be hard on
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who passed for 226 yards against California on Saturday,
feels he let USC down because the offense scored just seven points
in a 17-7 loss to the Golden Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't as sharp as I should have been,'' Fox said. ``My job
is to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox did acknowledge that he feels some satisfaction getting a
chance to play quarterback again after stints at tight end and
linebacker the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``For myself, I was really happy,'' Fox said. ``I showed myself
a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Although USC coach Paul Hackett hinted that Fox will start this
week against Arizona State, he also said he still could use junior
Mike Van Raaphorst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of two guys is not out of the realm of possibility,''
Hackett said. ``I think at this point we'll just go by feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he never intended to play Fox against Cal, until
Van Raaphorst struggled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way we sat down and said we'll play John Fox,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Hue Jackson suggested the change at
halftime, and Hackett decided to give Van Raaphorst one series in
the second half before making the switch.
</P>
<P>
   Not ready to give up: Despite USC's four-game losing streak,
Hackett said he is not going to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I disappointed as hell? Yes,'' Hackett said. ``Am I going
to just throw up my hands? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast fact: Three of Van Raaphorst's seven interceptions have
been returned for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Easy schedule: Unless something unexpected happens, USC will not
play a team ranked in the Associated Press Top 25 for only the
second time since the poll began in 1936. The last time USC did not
play any ranked teams was 1956.
</P>
<P>
   End result: Hackett said the Trojans' final four games will
eventually determine the Trojans' identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot's going to show in the next four weeks,'' Hackett said.
``What is this team's legacy?''

RECENT DEATHS OF CHILDREN WEAR DOWN MEDICAL EXAMINER 
</HEADLINE>
 DEATHS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In the quiet of an autopsy room, Sam Gulino
hears the faded screams of dead children.
</P>
<P>
   Broken ribs, head trauma, ruptured organs, old scars from
whippings, burns _ all can help tell tortured tales to Gulino,
deputy medical examiner for Jackson County, when he performs an
autopsy on a child killed by abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The work is long and grueling. Missing something can botch an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 12, Gulino performed an autopsy on E'Lexis Crawford. The
2-year-old girl had been beaten and thrown to the floor in her baby
sitter's house, police say. Cause of death: liver laceration.
</P>
<P>
   As he worked, Gulino knew another young victim would soon
arrive. He'd heard about an 11-month-old boy with severe head
trauma who lay dying at Children's Mercy Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I'm off tomorrow,'' Gulino said to himself.
</P>
<P>
   He had no idea about the storm headed toward his office _ and to
all of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The little boy came the following day. Then five more children
in the next 10 days. The string was unprecedented in the memories
of those who work at the medical examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Five children died of abuse or neglect in Jackson County during
that span, more than in some entire years. Two more children died
in other homicides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty awful two weeks to be a child in Jackson
County,'' Gulino said.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a frustrating two weeks for Jackson County Prosecutor
Bob Beaird.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and law enforcers have little ability to prevent abuse
that takes place behind closed doors to victims too young to speak
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people just don't seem to be equipped to handle the harsh
complexities of life _ kids being one of those complexities,''
Beaird said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, a perpetrator can be punished after the fact. But by then,
a child is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's what a prosecutor does _ deals with life's
failures,'' Beaird said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a child death epidemic that broke down the emotional
firewalls at the medical examiner's office at 660 E. 24th St. on
Hospital Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Employees there had always seen what Gulino called ``the easy
part of death.'' The office is isolated, down a sloped hallway and
through double doors. That last one is locked.
</P>
<P>
   So there is no family to deal with and no suspect to confront.
Emotions can be suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   But this chain of tragedy penetrated the insulation.
</P>
<P>
   E'Lexis Crawford, Luis Graber, Pamela Butler, Jacob Dube, Larry
Bass, Gary Bass and a 19-month-old girl whose name has not been
released.
</P>
<P>
   Beaten, drowned, shot, kidnapped, starved, burned _ they came
too fast.
</P>
<P>
   And because news coverage had told some of their stories, these
bodies came with children's faces.
</P>
<P>
   Chief investigator Ron Brasfield had always been able to keep
separate his brain from his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do that with one child, maybe two,'' he said. ``But
not with the string we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Alinda Dennis, chairwoman of the Jackson County Child Fatality
Review Panel, said: ``We're going to break a very horrible
record.''
</P>
<P>
   She was talking about the deaths of children from abuse and
neglect.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, from 1994 to 1998, the numbers ranged
from four to seven annually.
</P>
<P>
   The recent surge will probably carry 1999 into double digits,
Dennis said.
</P>
<P>
   And those numbers don't even include other homicides such as
Pamela Butler, 10, who was abducted and killed by a stranger, and
Jacob Dube, 16, who was shot by his stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis doesn't claim to have the solution. Child abuse is
complex _ often a fallout from substance abuse, poverty, domestic
violence and living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But Gulino thinks the recent epidemic could have been prevented.
</P>
<P>
   Most child abuse deaths have warning signs, he said. Boyfriend
in the home, drug and alcohol use, domestic violence, other
children abused and earlier hot-line calls to state welfare
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   When a combination of those exist, social agencies should
intervene, said Gulino, who is chairman of a Missouri task force
that soon will recommend home visitations for high-risk mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to say, `Even though we don't have a dead child
yet...conditions are present where something could happen,' ''
Gulino said.
</P>
<P>
   Such intervention could cut down on his workload, which would be
fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sobering to find those broken ribs because you know they
can't speak for themselves so they cry and scream,'' Gulino said.
``And that leads to more beatings.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Mahoney, an assistant Jackson County prosecutor who
handles many abuse cases, agrees with Gulino. She thinks visiting
nurses could go to high-risk homes and talk to parents about child
abuse and to check on the welfare of children.
</P>
<P>
   She also supports two legislative recommendations. One would
open Division of Family Services records once a child dies of
abuse. The other would remove the ``120-day callback,'' which is
sometimes used to reduce prison time for parents convicted in child
abuse deaths.
</P>
<P>
   After serving 120 days of so-called ``shock time,'' a parent is
sometimes released and put on probation because, as the theory
goes, they have already been punished by losing the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to pay for this crime, (and) not just with their
child's life,'' Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   E'Lexis Crawford was the first to die.
</P>
<P>
   E'Liza Castellano, the 2-year-old's baby sitter, has been
charged with second-degree murder and two counts of child abuse.
Court documents allege Castellano, 41, repeatedly beat and threw
the girl to the floor when E'Lexis cried because she wanted her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   E'Lexis died early on Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, police were called to a house and they found
Luis Graber, 11 months old, unconscious and being worked on by
paramedics.
</P>
<P>
   Luis was pronounced dead the next day at Children's Mercy
Hospital. Cause of death: blunt trauma to the head. His mother's
boyfriend, Curtis Yeager, 22, who was tending Luis, has been
charged with second-degree murder and child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The same day that Luis died, Pamela Butler was abducted while
she played in front of her home in Kansas City, Kan. Her body was
found Oct. 15 near a church in Grain Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury indicted Keith D. Nelson, 24, with
kidnapping and killing her.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 20, the same day Pamela was buried, police were
dispatched to a home where they found Larry Bass, 8, unconscious on
the living room floor. They also found his triplet brother, Gary
Bass, in an upstairs bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Both boys suffered severe burns and were malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   Larry was pronounced dead at the scene in what one investigator
said was the worst case of child abuse he'd ever seen. The boy
weighed only 30 pounds, and ribs poked through his sagging skin.
Gary Bass died Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear how much and how long they suffered,'' said
Brasfield, chief investigator for the medical examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' mother, Mary Bass, 31, was charged with 10 counts of
various child abuse charges. Larry and Gary were buried Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bass' live-in boyfriend, Tony Dixon, 36, was charged with
six counts of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Dube died the afternoon of Oct. 22 when he was shot by his
stepfather. Police say the stepfather, Michael Sherrell, also shot
Jacob's mother and brother before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   The last in the string of child deaths occurred later that
evening, Oct. 22, when a 19-month-old girl drowned in a bathtub at
a home. Authorities say the death was accidental, but a neglect
charge is possible pending the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the last death, Brasfield was exhausted,
physically and emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can explain kids who die in car accidents and even the
drug killings,'' said Brasfield, a former military policeman. ``But
child abuse is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so intentionally cruel and unfair...and we had so much of
it all at once.''

CHOOSING MANAGER STONEMAN'S TOP PRIORITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Probably no one was more relieved the Anaheim Angels
hired Bill Stoneman as the club's general manager Monday than team
president Tony Tavares.
</P>
<P>
   Tavares said he worried that he'd have to make decisions that
would normally be that of the general manager. But now that
Stoneman is in place, Tavares can hand off the duties to Stoneman.
And there is no priority greater than that of hiring a manager.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman said he has a list of about six candidates, but would
not say who is on the list.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is believed that former Rangers and Red Sox manager
Kevin Kennedy, now an analyst for Fox Sports Net West, is at the
top of that list. Kennedy is interested in managing again and has
ties to Stoneman.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy worked with Stoneman with the Expos in 1991 and '92.
Kennedy was hired as the organization's director of minor league
field operations at the end of the 1991 season. He joined manager
Felipe Alou's staff as a bench coach for the 1992 season. He left
the Expos to take the Rangers' managerial job in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want somebody who can manage people,'' Stoneman said.
``There are a lot of people who know when to bunt, when to
hit-and-run, things like that. I want someone who communicates
well, who can bring the coaches and the players together, pulling
in the same direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also is close to Angels first baseman Mo Vaughn, whom
Kennedy managed in Boston in 1995 and '96.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Kennedy, other possible managerial candidates include
Chris Chambliss, Willie Randolph, Davey Lopes and Mike Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Collins resigned under duress on Sept. 3 and bench coach
Joe Maddon served as interim manager for the rest of the season.

Barkley's final campaign should be something to savor
<TEXT>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   This time next year, we will stare into the void and ponder the
huge empty space. We will listen for the music and try to
understand why we hear only one long, flat tone. We will wonder
just what is missing.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   He has told us before that he was leaving, but this time,
evidently, he means it. Which, after 16 seasons of toiling
relentlessly and passionately like no other man his size in the
history of the NBA, will be good for him. But too bad for us. And
for the game.
</P>
<P>
   This year Charles. Next year Hakeem. An era is closing.
</P>
<P>
   So while the Rockets season that begins tonight will be an
intriguing one to watch for the changing cast of characters and the
shimmering potential of new athleticism brought by Steve Francis,
Shandon Anderson and Kelvin Cato, it is just as importantly a last
chance to file snapshots in our memory banks of a player as unique
in his own way as Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan was the otherworldly rocket who lifted the NBA to new
heights in terms of marketing and promotion throughout the '90s,
then Barkley has been the trail of fire and billowing smoke off the
launching pad, providing the down-to-earth thrust.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other shooters, other scorers, other rebounders,
others who have run their mouths as if they were being paid by the
syllable. There have been others who've made us laugh, others
who've made us angry, others who've made us frustrated, others
who've left us awe-struck with something they have done on the
basketball court or off it.
</P>
<P>
   But none, in this game, at least, who have ever rolled it all
together in one hurricane-wind-of-fury package.
</P>
<P>
   Like Muhammad Ali in his prime, Barkley is extremely bright and
innovative. His words ring with the truth. He can make people
laugh, put them at ease or put them down. He will speak seriously
and boldly on almost any topic. He can clown with the best and poke
fun at himself.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of his NBA career, he has changed from the Round
Mound of Rebound to Sir Charles to just Chuck, and he has also
transformed into the conscience of professional basketball. He says
what many others think but won't say. His consequences-be-damned
honesty is nearly the lone source of Tabasco in David Stern's
corporate vanilla kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   When an Allen Iverson comes dissing and screaming into the NBA,
it is Barkley who tells him to shut up and respect his elders. When
salaries go through the roof, it is Barkley who wonders out loud
how the teachers and factory workers feel. If the NBA's nonstop
hype machine tries to convince every fan in the world that the
emperor has new clothes _ and you, too, ought to buy a matching
outfit for $39.95 _ it is Barkley who would be the first to point
out that his royal highness is naked.
</P>
<P>
   We need voices who will challenge the party line. We need
dissidents. We should understand that, because if it weren't for
them we might still be a British colony.
</P>
<P>
   He says so many things, and it is our job to figure out which
ones he really means. For in these best times of his life, it seems
everybody wants to know the real Charles Barkley. Trouble is, the
answer is a whole lot more complicated than the question.
</P>
<P>
   Is he the nit-picking critic who finds fault in every single
thing done wrong by his teammates? Or the selfless, ideal team
player who turns around and charms the socks off everybody in the
locker room?
</P>
<P>
   Is he the fun-loving fellow who likes to joke and cajole his way
through encounters with the media? Or the guy who'll take the bully
pulpit and tackle the tough issues of race and child-rearing with
his whip of a tongue?
</P>
<P>
   Is he the ugly American who elbowed an Angolan in the throat at
the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona? Or the smiling Dream Teamer who led
the crowds at Atlanta in 1996 in dancing and singing to YMCA?
</P>
<P>
   Is he the snarling grizzly who'll toss an ice-throwing lout
through a barroom window? Or the lovable bear who'll call a shy
young autograph-seeker to come sit on his lap in a crowded
restaurant?
</P>
<P>
   Somebody very smart once said that while most pro athletes are
jerks trying to convince us they're nice guys, Barkley is actually
a nice guy trying to convince us he's a jerk.
</P>
<P>
   The critics will point to the rings. They always do, because he
has none. Just ask them this: Is Steve Kerr four times the player
Dr. J was? That's what the rings say.
</P>
<P>
   You don't measure a man by his jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   He's profane and profound, enraging and engaging, unapologetic
and unpretentious.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley, in his own world and in our face, one more
time.
</P>
<P>
   This time next year, the silence will be deafening.

FANNIE MAE WILL PROVIDE BOOST TO HOME BUYING IN KC AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Buying a home or renting an affordable
apartment will become $4 billion easier in the 11-county
metropolitan area in the next five years, the largest provider of
U.S. mortgage money said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae, a federally chartered, publicly traded financial
services giant that links Wall Street to hometown mortgage lenders,
said the money would be aimed at helping provide affordable homes
and apartments for 43,000 low- to middle-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at a formal announcement, just north of downtown
Kansas City, Kan., also revealed a plan to reduce homebuying costs
for buyers with spotty credit histories. And, on the Missouri side,
there will be a test program to reduce required down payments to as
low as 1 percent of the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Potential borrowers need to visit a participating lender if they
are interested in the program. Fannie Mae provides money for those
lenders by dealing on Wall Street in what's called the secondary
mortgage market.
</P>
<P>
   The pledge is thought to be the largest of its kind in the
Kansas City area's history.
</P>
<P>
   To put things into perspective, 43,000 homes represents more
than 5 percent of the 762,500 homes in the metropolitan area,
calculates Manny Trillo, research data manager at Mid-America
Regional Council.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three thousand also is more homes than exist in all but
three of the 11 counties where the pledged money will be available.
And, according to estimates from the Johnson County Appraisers
Office, it's almost as many as exist in Overland Park and Prairie
Village combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statistically, it is a whole heck of a lot of houses,'' Trillo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Gorelick, vice chairwoman at Fannie Mae, said the $4
billion pledge is an outgrowth of a similar, smaller strategic
partnership program, called House Kansas City, that Fannie Mae and
local leaders organized three years ago, committing $650 million to
help 9,500 families.
</P>
<P>
   That program worked better than expected because the
participants were able to help almost 11,000 families afford homes
and to accomplish that in three years instead of an expected five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the demand is here, and Kansas City knows how to
partner,'' Gorelick said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorelick, some of the area's national lawmakers and Mayors Kay
Barnes of Kansas City and Carol Marinovich of the Unified
Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kan., announced the
huge pledge at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Turtle Hill, site of the announcement, is one of the first
neighborhoods in the two Kansas Citys where officials from several
organizations _ in this case the neighborhood, City Vision
Ministries and Fannie Mae _ forged a partnership that sparked a
turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a grant that, in part, helped one neighborhood
redevelopment, some dilapidated houses have been torn down, 10
Victorian homes have been saved and 30 homes will be built by the
time the redevelopment project is completed in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of existing homes received improvement grants and
interest-free loans. New homeowners received affordable housing
incentives, such as mortgage payment subsidies. planners thought
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of nervous at the beginning, when we were talking
development in the urban core,'' said Joy McClain, an associate
director for City Vision Ministries, a development agency started
by a local pastor. ``But there is a lot of demand. Demand is very
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae officials think demand is equally strong in other
places the additional money will be available, said Sandra Goodwin,
deputy director of the concern's Kansas City office.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 counties are Johnson, Leavenworth, Miami and Wyandotte
counties in Kansas and Cass, Clay, Clinton, Jackson, Lafayette,
Platte and Ray counties in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Presuming that area housing trends continue their current
long-term trend and that demand for the housing money unfolds as
Fannie Mae officials project, about $3.6 billion will be used to
finance the purchase of 28,000 houses and $400 million will finance
an expected 15,000 rental apartments, Goodwin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That also shows we are going to be working very hard the next
few years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Underwood, executive director of the Home Builders
Association of Greater Kansas City, said it was too soon to tell
how the infusion of mortgage money would affect the demand for home
construction in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the homes bought with the new money undoubtedly will be
existing

CAMPAIGN TO FREE PELTIER OPENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A monthlong campaign in Washington to free Leonard
Peltier from federal prison in Leavenworth opened Monday, but some
of his supporters and Peltier did not sound optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Peltier was convicted in 1977 for shooting two FBI agents to
death on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. About
100 people gathered Monday in Lafayette Park in front of the White
House to ask for Peltier's clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get Leonard Peltier out of prison before it's too
late to achieve justice,'' Jennifer Harbury, a lawyer who is
director of the Human Rights Project for the California-based
Global Exchange, told the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Peltier, 55, has been treated for illnesses related to a tetanus
infection and has sparred with prison officials over his treatment.
In an audiotaped address delivered Monday, Peltier said he is weary
and knows his plight has worn on his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my friends, family and supporters are growing tired of
this battle to win my freedom,'' Peltier said. ``I guess it would
not be so bad if we could see a light at the end of the
tunnel...but as of late there is no such light so I cannot
truthfully say I will be seeing you soon.''
</P>
<P>
   He closed by saying he will not give up and is confident he will
someday win his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The month of speeches, ceremonies and demonstrations in
Washington will center on Peltier, but some days are devoted to the
perceived injustices inflicted upon other American Indians as well
as natives of countries such as Guatemala, Mexico and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leonard Peltier is typical of the abuse of other native
people,'' Harbury said. ``He is a symbol of the campaigns of
oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   Peltier supporters have submitted petitions with hundreds of
thousands of signatures seeking clemency. A White House spokesman
referred questions about the clemency to the Justice Department,
which handled the petitions. The department declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous famous people have come to Peltier's side, including
Jesse Jackson, actors Danny Glover and Susan Sarandon, and retired
boxer Muhammad Ali. One of his lawyers is former U.S. Attorney
General Ramsey Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said parole or clemency is warranted in that there is no
proof Peltier fired the shots that killed the agents. At trial,
witnesses said they saw Peltier carrying a rifle toward the wounded
agents. Peltier fled the scene and was apprehended eight months
later in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   One Peltier supporter Monday said he doesn't expect the
monthlong events to bring clemency or parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the federal government is using this as an example of
what could happen to us if we are out of line,'' said Coki Tree
Spirit, an Alexandria, Va., member of a group called Biaraku, which
defends people it says are political prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous people from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation are in
Washington to support Peltier. Fedelia Cross said tearfully that
she wants President Clinton to know they won't quit. ``We're alive
and we're still fighting...,'' she said.

NUMBER OF AMERICANS VOTING HEADED DOWNWARD, AUTHORS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ History tells us that today's elections will draw
fewer than one out of five eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
   It has become the American way _ not voting. And that isn't just
the trend in off-year elections such as this trip to the polls to
decide Kansas City sales tax measures and other ballot issues.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 presidential election turnout was only 49 percent, the
lowest since 1924. Presidential contests traditionally are the
biggest draw but have been on a general decline since peaking at
62.8 percent in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``The non-voting habit is becoming more and more ingrained,''
said Ellen Shearer, who with a fellow Northwestern University
journalism professor wrote a new book called Non-Voters: America's
No-Shows.
</P>
<P>
   Shearer and co-author Jack Doppelt oversaw a university survey
of 1,001 people who said they did not plan to vote in the 1996
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The authors found that non-voters tend to be more alienated,
less affluent, less educated, younger and more likely to be members
of minority groups than are voters.
</P>
<P>
   But the authors also found that 18 percent earned more than
$50,000 a year, 44 percent had at least some college and 25 percent
were at least 45 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to dig deeper, the authors interviewed 30 of the
non-voters, including Jason Caldwell, a 27-year-old ironworker,
husband and father of two from Belton in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell voted for Bill Clinton in 1992 but stayed home four
years later because he said he soured on Clinton's policies, such
as his support for the Brady Bill on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't trust any politician,'' Caldwell said in an
interview last week with The Kansas City Star. ``They tell you
about half of what they are going to do and they do about half of
what they promise.''
</P>
<P>
   But Caldwell said he likely would have to back a candidate next
year because he was a member of a labor union, which will have a
stake in who is chosen president.
</P>
<P>
   Shearer and Doppelt put Caldwell in a category of non-voters
they call ``do-ers' _ people who follow politics closely, are
active in their communities and inclined to vote but see a no-vote
as a statement of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Do-ers make up the largest group of non-voters at 29 percent of
the 1,001 surveyed. Next is a group called ``unpluggeds,'' at 27
percent. They are generally young, uneducated people who do not
follow politics.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ``unpluggeds'' is Steve Gordon, 33, who has never
voted. The Sparta, Wis., resident only watches news if he
channel-flips to it out of boredom with other shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't going to change if I don't vote or I do vote,''
Gordon told the authors.
</P>
<P>
   The third-largest group is the ``irritables,'' better educated
and more well-off than the other two groups. Although well-read,
they are cynical and find all candidates unworthy of their vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians say they make an effort but they don't really
listen,'' said Michael Keegan, an upstate New Yorker interviewed in
the book.
</P>
<P>
   The other people in the survey are the ``don't knows,'' who know
very little about issues or candidates and think voting is a waste
of time, and the ``alienateds,'' the oldest, poorest and most
pessimistic group.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the
American Electorate, said the decline in interest reflects
fundamental changes in American lifestyles, such as busy two-income
couples, youngsters growing up in more non-voting households, and
an emphasis in schools on job skills rather than on civic
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation is into making its own life better,'' Gans
said.
</P>
<P>
   The erosion in voter turnout is especially strong among the
young. Only 32 percent of Americans age 24 and under voted in 1996,
down from almost 52 percent in 1972, according to the National
Association of Secretaries of State.
</P>
<P>
   The study found 40 percent of young people whose parents
regularly vote went to the polls in November 1998, compared to 20
percent of youths whose parents do not vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is in danger of developing a permanent non-voting
class,'' authors of the study wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer people follow politics because so much else competes for
their attention, said Kenneth Sherrill, a political science
professor at Hunter College in New York.
</P>
<P>
   People who years ago found it hard to avoid coverage of
campaigns on television now have dozens of entertainment cable
channels, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are much more free not to be interested in politics
simply because of the sheer range of choices they have for leisure
time,'' Sherrill said.
</P>
<P>
   Gans and Shearer said reversing the trend won't be easy because
reasons for not voting were diverse. Doppelt said he couldn't
imagine a turnout of better than 50 percent in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Five states bucked that trend with better than 60 percent in
1996, thanks in part to lively state campaigns and candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get to the fall of 2000 and we have serious, credible
candidates who turn people on and not off,'' said Evans Witt,
president of Princeton Survey Research in Washington, ``it will
make a huge difference.''

TWA-TROUBLES HIGH RANKINGS, LABOR PEACE NOT TRANSLATING INTO
EARNINGS FOR TWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trans World Airlines has labor peace for now after securing
contracts with all its employee groups. So is TWA, perhaps the most
recognized name in 20th century commercial aviation, ready to soar
into the new millennium?
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. Although TWA's operations have improved sharply in
the past two years _ it consistently ranks high in on-time
performance and customer satisfaction surveys _ its financial
performance has not followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier has been in the red for five consecutive quarters,
including a $53.7 million net loss for the 1999 third quarter that
ended Sept. 30. More than half the third-quarter loss was
attributed to costs related to the ratification of the contract
with the Machinists union, which represents 16,000 TWA employees.
Analysts have estimated that the contract will cost TWA between
$150 million and $200 million over the life of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its financial problems, TWA also faces challenges
at its Kansas City overhaul base and internal dissatisfaction among
some workers with the Machinists union.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some airline analysts say TWA is moving in the
right direction by modernizing its fleet, trying to attract
business travelers and focusing on new markets to generate new
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not great to have a loss, but I still believe (TWA) is
going to turn things around,'' said Michael Boyd, president of the
Boyd Group, an aviation consulting firm in Evergreen, Colo. ``It's
just going to take a while.''
</P>
<P>
   TWA isn't the only U.S. airline that struggled in the third
quarter. US Airways also posted a loss, and the industry generally
is less profitable than last year. Analysts say higher fuel costs
and overcapacity have hurt carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in previous years this decade, TWA officials are not
worried about the company's cash position as it heads into the
winter months. So there is time for the airline to return to
profitability. But some factors have created a sense of urgency for
TWA to move quickly to right its ship.
</P>
<P>
   The largest issue in Kansas City is TWA's renewal of its lease
at the city-owned overhaul base. The lease expires at the end of
May 2000, and negotiations are expected to heat up in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis-based TWA employs about 3,500 people in Kansas City,
including about 2,300 at the maintenance base.
</P>
<P>
   TWA's contract with the union's mechanics group, which expires
in January 2001, calls for the airline to try to secure a new lease
for the Kansas City overhaul base. However, many issues have to be
resolved, including the future size of TWA's maintenance operations
there and how to pay for needed capital improvements at the base.
</P>
<P>
   William F. Compton, TWA's president and chief executive officer,
was in Kansas City last week, meeting with Kansas City Mayor Kay
Barnes. Compton also met later with the aviation committee of the
Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Officials familiar with the meetings described Compton's visit
as introductory in nature, adding that he explained to city and
business leaders TWA's current status and business plan. The
overhaul base also was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a sooner-than-later time line in consummating a
lease extension,'' said Jerry Fogel, aviation committee chairman of
the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce. ``We're going to watch
that, because the economic impact of TWA is more on their jobs than
on the air service.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said neither she nor Compton was directly involved in
lease negotiations on the overhaul base, but the two talked in
general terms about the airline and its plans for the maintenance
facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``TWA is important to the local economy. ... It's extremely
important that we retain that facility,'' she said. ``I'm also
strongly encouraging the full utilization of that facility.''
</P>
<P>
   The amount of work at TWA's overhaul base has dwindled in the
past few years. The airline no longer does maintenance on other
carriers, as it has in the past. In addition, TWA's fleet
modernization program is rapidly eliminating the older aircraft
that required the most maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   TWA recently has said it could not compete for third-party work
because of the airline's high costs. However, Compton seemed open
to the possibility of resuming outside maintenance work once a new
lease is signed, city and business officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That was encouraging news for city leaders, who also are talking
to Vanguard Airlines, a discount carrier desperately seeking hangar
space for its maintenance operations.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard, based in Kansas City, has talked to Chicago's Midway
Airport officials about doing its maintenance there. Such a deal
could prompt Vanguard to move its corporate headquarters to Chicago
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you from the City Council's standpoint that we want
that overhaul base fully utilized,'' said Teresa Loar, chairwoman
of the council's aviation committee. ``We do have airlines in need
of hangars, like Vanguard, that haven't been able to use the
base.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard in the past has hired TWA to do some of its
maintenance, but the carrier eventually decided the labor costs
were too high. Any future arrangement in which Vanguard would
operate its own maintenance department at the overhaul base most
likely would not be well received by TWA's union employees.

TWA-TROUBLES HIGH RANKINGS, LABOR PEACE NOT TRANSLATING INTO
EARNINGS FOR TWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I can tell you from the City Council's standpoint that we want
that overhaul base fully utilized,'' said Teresa Loar, chairwoman
of the council's aviation committee. ``We do have airlines in need
of hangars, like Vanguard, that haven't been able to use the
base.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard in the past has hired TWA to do some of its
maintenance, but the carrier eventually decided the labor costs
were too high. Any future arrangement in which Vanguard would
operate its own maintenance department at the overhaul base most
likely would not be well received by TWA's union employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The position of our union is, we want to operate the entire
overhaul base and we want the potential to go after third-party
work,'' said Keith Nelson, president of Machinists Local 1650.
</P>
<P>
   Another lease issue would be the cost to renovate the overhaul
base, which workers say is sorely needed.
</P>
<P>
   Fogel said making capital improvements to the base could be a
key in whether TWA decides to resume third-party work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a 45-year-old building,'' Fogel said. ``I'm sure
that's one of the negotiating items right now.''
</P>
<P>
   One study commissioned by the Kansas City Aviation Department
suggested that renovations and improvements at the overhaul base
would cost at least $240 million. How to pay for such improvements
probably will be a key aspect of TWA's negotiations with the city.
</P>
<P>
   Another internal issue beginning to surface at TWA concerns its
union employees and their leadership. Last week, a group of flight
attendants announced it formed a bargaining unit intended to
replace the Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition of Professional Flight Attendants has begun
collecting cards from TWA's 4,200 flight attendants in an effort to
hold a representational election. The group says the latest
contract negotiated by Machinists union leaders cost the flight
attendants 13.5 percent in additional wages that were supposed to
be coming to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the flight attendants who know TWA flight attendant
issues,'' said Flip Becker, one of the group's organizers. ``We can
best represent ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Steffen, president of Machinists Local 1997, resigned
her position to join the coalition. Other officers of Local 1997,
which represents all of TWA's flight attendants, have followed
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Cooper, general chairwoman of Machinists District 142,
said the flight attendants needed to stay within the Machinists
union because of TWA's precarious financial condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``An independent union is no longer a viable option for any
airline contract,'' she said in a message to members.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, the flight attendants abandoned the
Independent Federation of Flight Attendants and joined the
Machinists. At the time, Cooper urged the switch, saying flight
attendants would not have negotiating power without joining a
bigger union.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some mechanics at TWA also are contemplating a switch
in union affiliation. A group of mechanics in St. Louis last month
said they were in the midst of a campaign urging their TWA peers to
join the Airline Mechanics Fraternal Association.
</P>
<P>
   Many mechanics were upset by conditions of the new contract when
union leaders were unable to bring them up to industry-standard
wages. Most Machinists-represented TWA employees received an 8.5
percent raise in August and will get a 3 percent raise next August.
</P>
<P>
   Despite accepting wages for their members that were short of the
industry standard, union leaders argued that the short length of
the agreement would allow them to seek more pay increases in the
next round of bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Because TWA has most of its mechanics at Kansas City's overhaul
base, any change in their representation would require a majority
of mechanics in Kansas City to vote in favor of the Airline
Mechanics Fraternal Association, said Nelson of Machinists Local
1650.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a group that thinks the grass is greener on the other
side,'' he said. ``We weren't able to get everything our members
deserve, but we got everything we could possibly get. This is a
group of opportunists who feed off the frustration of the
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he did not know how much support the Airline
Mechanics Fraternal Association had among mechanics in Kansas City.
However, some TWA mechanics have said they have seen more
co-workers wearing association buttons since the latest contract
was ratified.

STATION'S ST. CHARLES CASINO TO BECOME ONE BOAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Station Casinos Inc. will spend about $3 million on its gambling
and entertainment facility in St. Charles, Mo., that by spring will
convert the complex to a one-boat operation.
</P>
<P>
   Station Casino Kansas City may be headed in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``With open boarding, we don't see a need to have two boats,''
said John V. Finamore, Station's Midwest president.
</P>
<P>
   About 23,000 square feet of the St. Charles facility's cluttered
and dingy main lobby area is to be converted to gambling space that
will flow into the larger of its two floating casinos. When the new
area opens, the smaller Station Casino Belle riverboat will be
removed from service.
</P>
<P>
   Finamore said long-term plans called for completion of the
partly built but fiscally stalled $130 million casino, restaurant
and entertainment structure that eventually would replace all
existing operations in St. Charles except the parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   The costly upgrade in St. Charles is aimed at capturing market
share from the trendy and spacious Riverport casino, dining and
hotel complex owned in part by Harrah's Entertainment Inc. that
dominates the St. Louis gambling marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Station's Las Vegas-based corporate executives this
week are expected to make decisions on other proposed capital
spending projects in Missouri in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Finamore said those proposals included a parking garage at
Station Casino Kansas City and significant remodeling and expansion
at the Flamingo Hilton Casino _ if state and local authorities
allow Station to purchase and operate the facility.
</P>
<P>
   With open boarding scheduled to begin in Kansas City on Nov. 15,
Station executives will be watching closely to decide whether to
spend relative pennies to tear down the thin wall separating the
mirror-image River Queen and River King casinos that were designed
from the outset as one huge gambling floor.
</P>
<P>
   If open boarding in Kansas City runs as smoothly as hoped,
Finamore said the permanent structure for St. Charles probably
would undergo some design changes and become a clone of the Kansas
City operation.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park Inc. is out as a potential partner in a proposed
Wyandotte Nation tribal casino at The Woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's shares in the three-way Huron Gaming Inc.
partnership were bought out by Florida-based North American Sports
Management Inc. As part of the deal, Hollywood Park gets North
American's share of a gambling facility in Yakima, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood Park's interest in Kansas is waning,'' said Bob
Inderman, a spokesman for the group.
</P>
<P>
   Principals at Hollywood were key partners in the group that
built the Kansas City, Kan., track in 1989 and later lost it in a
bitter bankruptcy fight to a group controlled by St. Joseph
businessman and casino operator Bill Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Hollywood did not return a call.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's absence immediately made the Huron group's
collective heart a little fonder of The Woodlands, which in recent
months had not necessarily been the group's preferred casino site
in Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release announcing the Hollywood buyout, however,
North American said the deal allowed it and the tribe ``to proceed
with plans to open a facility at The Woodlands.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing happens, however, until either the Kansas Legislature
relaxes its opposition to expanded gambling in the state or
Congress passes special legislation for the Oklahoma-based tribe
that legalizes its tribal casino in Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   Portland, Ore., brothers Eric and Craig Barnes hope to strike it
rich with their new casino parlor game, ``Casinopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Play money and familiar board game strategies are combined with
a special die in a game that has players competing along the way in
slots, blackjack, craps and roulette. Eric Barnes said that he and
his brother grew up playing board games and that it was inevitable
they would invent one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casinopoly'' is their first effort. A CD-ROM version is in the
works for next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tropicana Resort and Casino in Las Vegas last week became
the first real casino company to order games with its logo
custom-printed on the game board and box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casinopoly,'' patent pending, is available for $24.95 through
the Web site www.casinopoly.com.

YOU'VE GOT TO HAND IT TO HOLMGREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ Sometime during the week leading up to Monday
night's game, Mike Holmgren asked how many Seahawks had played in a
Monday night game.
</P>
<P>
   A few hands went up.
</P>
<P>
   He asked how many had played at Lambeau Field.
</P>
<P>
   Again, just a few hands.
</P>
<P>
   As if he needed more evidence that his relatively young and
historically underachieving team was in for fright night, albeit a
day after Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, experience can be overrated. Especially when the
substitute virtues are a plan and a belief.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren knew his Seattle team, he knew Green Bay's team, he
knew himself and his staff and he knew the Seahawks could win,
despite all the froth and foment about his return to the place of
his greatest professional achievements.
</P>
<P>
   But 27-7? At wind-raked Lambeau? Against the game's best
quarterback? In front of the most committed fans in football, as
well as a nation of skeptics?
</P>
<P>
   He might have been the only one who knew it was coming.
</P>
<P>
   That why Paul Allen pays the man the large coin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you what _ is he something else?'' said Ricky Watters,
who rushed for a season-high 125 yards. ``For him to handle this
thing the way he did, it's unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us all week long that there was absolutely no doubt in
his mind that we could win.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how some coaches go into a game kinda wondering? Not
for a minute did that happen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Holmgren undersold the task. In fact, it was probably
harder than he wanted to allow, even to himself. For seven years,
he was the leading figure in this unique community, really the head
of its first family. He gave them everything they could have
dreamed, except for one thing _ permanence.
</P>
<P>
   And for that, he feared, for perhaps one of the rare times in
his enormously successful life, rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he received respect and affection. His two pre-game
walks onto the field were greeted with an overwhelmingly positive
response from the fans. There were a few critical signs _ ``Forget
the Turkey/Feast on Seahawks'' _ but his history here and the
well-bred grace of a town where football is much more than a game,
made the return a splendid statement of sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he knew it, exactly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a little bit of a zone coming out there,'' he said of
his almost stilted walks into a swarming battery of perhaps 30
video and print photographers. ``I didn't know how people would
react. We have a lot of friends here. I kind of blocked out the
noise and the cheering and whatever was happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I'm pleased the game is over. I told Ray (Rhodes,
his Packers successor) the same thing. Now we can get back to
playing and coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   The hype quickly evaporated into a hurricane of turnovers,
penalties and general slapstick play from both sides. But rather
than the Seahawks in a road game full of hostiles, it was the
Packers who were the more frightened outfit, apparently pressing to
show Holmgren they could win without him.
</P>
<P>
   That still may be true, but Monday night the Packers fell to
their own self-imposed pressure, particularly Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren's master project in his seven years here, and
three-time NFL MVP, appeared to be a physical and emotional mess.
The frequently damaged thumb on his throwing hand obviously limited
his passing. And excitement obviously overcame his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   He threw four interceptions, and probably would have had two or
three more except for drops by Seahawks defenders. In a year in
which he has already had multiple bad games, thanks largely to the
thumb and partly to the absence of his guru, he was a mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to guard against his pushing too hard,'' said Rhodes.
``I don't know if he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was quick to exploit Favre's weaknesses in the game,
Holmgren was quick to defend him afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play a great player like Brett, you hold on for dear
life,'' he said. ``All you can do is mix up defenses, otherwise
he'll pick you apart. Our defensive coaches did a great job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make a single defensive call.''
</P>
<P>
   His defenders, however, repeatedly came up with big plays to
stifle an offense that looked little like the one that went to two
Super Bowls in the last three years. The six turnovers were
underscored by misplays and rowdy behavior, including a bizarre
third quarter episode in which Packers tackle Earl Dotson was
ejected after twice shoving Seahawks linebacker Chad Brown during a
dead-ball situation.
</P>
<P>
   A nuclear-lunged Packers fan just below the press box put it
best: ``This,'' he bellowed, ``is bad football!''
</P>
<P>
   That was a phrase almost never heard in the regime of Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night, there were many things seen and heard that
were not expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a step forward,'' Holmgren said. ``A giant step? I'm
not going to say that.''
</P>
<P>
   He can afford to dwell in his coaching conservatism. For a
Seahawks fan base so long denied, it was more than a step. It was a
Lambeau leap.

SEAHAWKS WORK MONDAY NIGHT MAGIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ Mike Holmgren's magic touch at Lambeau Field
continues.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren brought his underdog Seahawks into their Monday Night
Football matchup with the Green Bay Packers Monday night and
emerged with a stunning 27-7 victory before a startled
green-and-gold clad crowd of 59,869.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was only the second in the past 4{ seasons at home for
the Packers, who were coached the past seven season by Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight was focused on Holmgren in this game, but it was
his new players who stole it _ not his former team.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people got caught up in the hype of Holmgren and
(Brett) Favre and forgot about our defense,'' said defensive tackle
Cortez Kennedy, who tied a career high with three sacks.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case after this game, which left the Seahawks
5-2 and tied for the AFC West lead with Kansas City. The Hawks meet
the 1-6 Cincinnati Bengals at the Kingdome on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks intercepted four of Favre's passes, sacked the
Packers' beleaguered quarterback three times and also recovered two
fumbles to hold Green Bay to its lowest point total since it scored
only six in a 1996 loss to the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exciting,'' Seahawks linebacker Darrin Smith said. ``I
looked at this as a hump game for us. Now we can say we're for
real. We knew we had a lot of talent. We knew we had players with a
lot of ability. But we wanted to beat a good team to prove it to
ourselves and (to) everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, it seems, got into the act.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Shawn Springs returned a field-goal attempt blocked
by Lamar King 61 yards for a touchdown and also intercepted two
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Brown finished with 12 tackles, sparking the Seahawks'
spirited defensive effort by making tackles from sideline to
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's biggest sack came late in the third quarter, when the
Packers were threatening to make a game of it. He got to Favre and
forced a fumble that was recovered by defensive end Michael
Sinclair after the Packers had reached the Seattle 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a special game and a special night, and when you win
something like this, it's, it's ... really something,'' Holmgren
said, almost at a loss for words as he searched for the right ones
to describe this emotional evening. ``Once we got over the
excitement, we really settled down, especially on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks offense had its problems moving against the
Packers' defense as well as with winds that swirled around Lambeau
in gusts of up to 30 mph. However, they made plays when it counted
most.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Kitna threw touchdown passes of 10 yards to former Packer
Derrick Mayes and 2 yards to Sean Dawkins. Ricky Watters ran for a
season-best 125 yards on 31 carries. Todd Peterson kicked a pair of
fourth-quarter field goals to complete the rout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started kind of slow, but we just kept plugging away and
eventually we were able to put some points on the board,'' guard
Brian Habib said. ``But I really didn't expect anything like this.
I thought it was going to go all the way down to the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Seahawks led from wire to wire.
</P>
<P>
   The play that got them rolling was King's block of Ryan
Longwell's 50-yard field-goal attempt in the first quarter. Springs
scooped up the ball and returned it 61 yards to give the Seahawks a
7-0 lead with 4:45 left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the ball with my whole hand,'' said King, this year's
first-round draft choice who had yet to make a play to match his
lofty status. ``I got good penetration through the line and
(Anthony) Simmons gave me a push to make sure I got through.''
</P>
<P>
   Springs was so open once he picked up the ball that he was able
to strut the final 25 yards into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the easy part,'' Springs said. ``Once Lamar made the
block, the ball was just there. I just picked it up and started
running.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the type of play the Seahawks were going to need to pull
off the upset at Lambeau, where the Packers had won 33 of their
previous 34 regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the defense that continued to make plays to ensure
the lead would hold up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle played well, but we couldn't beat anybody the way we
played tonight,'' said Favre, who seemed bothered by his
troublesome right thumb as well as the Seahawks' defense in
completing just 14 of 35 passes for 180 yards before being pulled
from the game late in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Favre did hook up with Corey Bradford on a 74-yard touchdown
pass, but it was the four interceptions that helped decide this
game _ two by Springs and one each from Willie Williams and Merton
Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistakes we made, turning the ball over, we had costly
penalties, we didn't capitalize on the chances we had,'' Favre
said. ``It is as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks made this one look simple, and the players gave
credit to Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that this has even sunk in yet,'' Watters said.
``The whole week, Holmgren made us think that we could come in here
and win. At no time did he talk about if we could just play a great
game we might have a chance. He was never like that. He was always
like, we can come in and win.''

   HONG KONG _ The Nasdaq index has hit another record. Alan
Greenspan is in low-inflation, high-productivity heaven. The 70th
anniversary of the 1929 crash has passed peacefully. And that
Depression-era relic, the Glass-Steagall Act, is finally dead,
opening the way for ever bigger financial combines.
</P>
<P>
   So it is time to ask not when Wall Street's latest house of
cards comes tumbling down but who is going to get the blame when it
does.
</P>
<P>
   That a huge issue is looming, there is no doubt. The politically
important, long-spoiled baby boomer generation will be faced with
unpleasant alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a crash, much of their (never large) personal
savings will be wiped out. If there is not a crash, many with
defined-contribution pension plans will find that although they may
feel rich, the income from a million dollars in S&AMP;P 500 stocks is a
mere $13,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on mutual funds are negligible after expenses. The
assumption that capital values will continue to grow is just the
trap that the Japanese fell into.
</P>
<P>
   Glass-Steagall is testimony to where the politicians of the
Depression era sought to place the blame _ on inappropriate links
between commercial and investment banking activities.
</P>
<P>
   We can leave aside whether this really was the root of the
problem. Today the commercial banks account for less than a quarter
of financial assets, compared with more than half in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems reasonable to suppose that it takes an informal
coalition of interests, not just investor naivete or central bank
misjudgment, to generate a boom of 1929 and 1999 proportions.
</P>
<P>
   In no particular order, here is a list of some of the potential
targets of blame:
</P>
<P>
   Investment banks and other hugely profitable promoters of stock
offerings based on ludicrously exaggerated estimates of corporate
earnings potential and careful management of news and issue size.
</P>
<P>
   The stockbrokers, mostly owned by the investment banks, who have
tailored their so-called analysis not to the needs of their private
and institutional investor clients but to the primary issue
business. Some analysis is doctored to keep corporate clients of
investment banks happy. Much else is just regurgitation, under the
guise of independent research, of news management by corporate
public relations executives.
</P>
<P>
   A mutual fund industry which claims to be concerned with
long-term investor interests but is run in a way which emphasizes
short-term returns, and rewards managers accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate executives whose stock options induce them to
maximize short-term share price performance and not long-term
shareholder value _ for example, by borrowing money at 8 percent to
buy back shares yielding 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The banks which have both financed mega-mergers and helped
households leverage their stock portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Mammoth accounting/consultancy firms whose dwindling number and
internal conflicts of interest make them prone to represent the
managements which appoint them rather than the shareholder and
public interests they are supposed to guard.
</P>
<P>
   The media, which also have a dwindling number of major players,
several of them linked to telecom and multimedia industries that
they assiduously promote, some directly involved in stock trading.
</P>
<P>
   Uncritical hyping of tech stocks is everywhere, and the Internet
and computer industries are accorded vastly more attention than
their contribution to U.S. business warrants.
</P>
<P>
   The list is not exhaustive. But the links, formal and informal,
among the villains-to-be are clear enough. The only winners will be
the lawyers behind the rash of billion-dollar class action suits
sure to hound some of the above. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ This Tuesday next year, Americans will be going to
the polls to elect a new president in the first ``open'' election _
with neither candidate an incumbent _ since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   After an unusually early ``phony'' campaign through this spring
and summer, the race between the two main parties is starting to
settle down _ and not in a way that was anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced for months that the best they could hope for was to
regain control of the House of Representatives, Democrats are now
starting to think that the White House may not be a lost cause
after all.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans meanwhile are starting to contemplate just the sort
of messy contest they had hoped to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats' earlier pessimism was understandable. Bill Clinton's
indiscretions in the White House, they felt, had cast a blight on a
Democrat's chances of succeeding him.
</P>
<P>
   With former basketball star Bill Bradley running a plausible
campaign, their party seemed to face a potentially divisive contest
that could last until the party convention next summer.
</P>
<P>
   In George W. Bush, meanwhile, the Republicans appeared to have a
candidate with the lineage, the personality and perhaps even the
record, to unite the right and take the presidential nomination by
acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   The past two weeks of frenetic political activity, much of it
concentrated in New Hampshire _ the state whose primary election
follows the ``first in the nation'' Iowa caucuses in the new year _
has done much to change the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats came away from watching the first direct confrontation
between their two presidential candidates, Vice-President Al Gore
and Bill Bradley, at Dartmouth College last week greatly cheered.
</P>
<P>
   It was not that they felt the contest would be decided anytime
soon, but that the party had two candidates who were qualified and
worthy of the job.
</P>
<P>
   A survey conducted after the forum, and just released, confirmed
that while a majority of those asked expressed a preference for one
or the other candidate, they also professed themselves content with
either _ and so unlikely to flee into the Republican, or
non-voting, camp.
</P>
<P>
   They sensed that the two-man contest that they had so feared
might just foster a productive exchange of competing ideas and
individuals rather than the internecine struggle they had so
feared.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the odd spoke has started to stick in the
hitherto well-oiled wheels of the Bush machine.
</P>
<P>
   George W.'s non-appearance at the Republican candidates' forum
in New Hampshire last week drew venomous jibes from local voters _
including ``chicken George'' and ``Bushbaby'' _ who turned in
droves to Senator John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire McCain's poll ratings are now within 12 points
of Bush's, a jump far greater than his inheritance of Elizabeth
Dole's disappointed supporters would account for. U.S. commentators
are treating him increasingly as a viable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Bush continues to dominate the poll ratings, but the
gap with McCain is starting to narrow. And if the publishing
millionaire, Steve Forbes, increases his ratings, even by a few
points, there could suddenly be the prospect of a real contest on
the right.
</P>
<P>
   The tenor of the campaign is also changing. Big social
questions, such as health care and education, are back on the
agenda; so long as the economy flourishes, the main issue will not
be, as it was for Bill Clinton eight years ago, ``the economy,
stupid.'' This does not necessarily help the Democrats, but it
certainly does not harm them either.
</P>
<P>
   Early questions about Bush's alleged drug use (still not fully
answered) are starting to be replaced by forward-looking concerns:
about his experience of office and his record as Governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   If, as many surveys indicate, voters' priorities are character
and competence, the Democrats' chances start to look better.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the better the ``outsiders,'' McCain and Bradley,
do in their respective primaries, especially in New Hampshire, the
better the odds for the ``establishment'' candidate of the other
party.
</P>
<P>
   Both will be competing for the same pool of ``independent''
voters. To win the nomination in a tight race with Bradley, Gore
would therefore do well not to oppose the rise of McCain, just as
Bush would have an interest in promoting Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The risk for either, but especially for Bush, would be that he
would then have to meet Bradley in the election proper _ a contest
that current polls suggest would be Bush and Gore. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Within minutes of confirmation that Egyptair flight
990 had crashed into the Atlantic off Nantucket Island Sunday
morning, the Internet was buzzing with speculation about a
so-called ``Nantucket Triangle,'' an accursed space in which planes
inexplicably fall out of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not require the wilder reaches of conspiracy-theory
to conclude that the area of the Atlantic off the northeastern
coast of the United States and Canada has seen an unusual number of
air crashes, even with the high density of transatlantic flights
taking that route.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptair 990 is the fourth fatal accident in a little more than
three years.
</P>
<P>
   TWA flight 800, a Boeing 747, crashed into the Atlantic off Long
Island, N.Y., on July 17, 1996, 12 minutes after takeoff for Paris,
killing all 229 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Swissair flight 111 plunged into the ocean off
Nova Scotia, Canada, after the McDonnell Douglas MD11 plane en
route from New York to Geneva was preparing for an emergency
landing at Halifax. There were no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   On July 16 this year, a Saratoga Piper aircraft piloted by John
F. Kennedy, Jr. crashed in thick fog off the island of Martha's
Vineyard, Mass., less than 50 miles from the site of the latest
crash. Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law all died.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, though, the only connection between the
accidents appears to be their location. Preliminary findings in the
three earlier crashes suggest quite different causes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite persistent rumors of sabotage or a stray missile, the
TWA 800 crash is provisionally blamed on a build-up of fumes that
caused the fuel tank to explode.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair 111 has been blamed on a catastrophic fire linked to
cockpit wiring and inflammable insulation material, while the most
current explanation for the JFK accident is pilot disorientation in
poor visibility. &QL;

<P>
   Two ``whistle blowers'' have accused Boeing of ignoring faults
during the production of the kind of aircraft which ditched off the
eastern seaboard of the USA early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Safety was sacrificed for the sake of productivity of the 767
among other aircraft, according to separate allegations by former
employees of Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Kerr, an ex-flight control rigger, says he saw defective
installations of cable, some bolts being over-tightened and
employees drilling the wrong size holes in the aircraft during the
eighties and early-nineties.
</P>
<P>
   George D. Wynalda, Jr., an ex-production inspector, said the
allegedly low standards continued as late as 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Both men, who have taken out lawsuits against the company, said
that employees were ``intimidated and harassed'' into keeping
production going.
</P>
<P>
   Independent investigations into the 47 Boeing 767s identified by
Kerr showed that none had been involved in crashes, but some had
been forced to make emergency landings because of mechanical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The wide-bodied 767 _ a mixture of the 757 short-haul aircraft
and the big 747 long-distance airliner _ first went into production
in 1979. They are used in large numbers by charter operators,
particularly for vacation companies for long-haul and short-haul
flights.
</P>
<P>
   One Boeing 767 crashed into the Thailand jungle in May 1991
killing 223 passengers and crew. Another 767 belonging to Air
Ethiopia was involved in a hijack after which only 52 of the 175
involved survived. The aircraft plummeted into the sea after
hijackers refused to let it land to refuel.
</P>
<P>
   In January last year a United Airlines 767 made an emergency
landing at Heathrow after the crew noticed smoke in the forward
galley. Passengers were evacuated by chute.
</P>
<P>
   Later a 7-inch section in a bundle of more than 100 wires was
seen to have melted and burned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 Boeing announced that hundreds of 747s and 767 jets had
improperly installed bolts on the engine straps. The company said
that there was no immediate danger to passenger safety and the
aircraft were all eventually repaired. &QL;

<P>
   Two ``whistle blowers'' have accused Boeing of ignoring faults
during the production of the kind of aircraft which ditched off the
eastern seaboard of the USA early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Safety was sacrificed for the sake of productivity of the 767
among other aircraft, according to separate allegations by former
employees of Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Kerr, an ex-flight control rigger, says he saw defective
installations of cable, some bolts being over-tightened and
employees drilling the wrong size holes in the aircraft during the
eighties and early-nineties.
</P>
<P>
   George D. Wynalda, Jr., an ex-production inspector, said the
allegedly low standards continued as late as 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Both men, who have taken out lawsuits against the company, said
that employees were ``intimidated and harassed'' into keeping
production going.
</P>
<P>
   Independent investigations into the 47 Boeing 767s identified by
Kerr showed that none had been involved in crashes, but some had
been forced to make emergency landings because of mechanical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The wide-bodied 767 _ a mixture of the 757 short-haul aircraft
and the big 747 long-distance airliner _ first went into production
in 1979. They are used in large numbers by charter operators,
particularly for vacation companies for long-haul and short-haul
flights.
</P>
<P>
   One Boeing 767 crashed into the Thailand jungle in May 1991
killing 223 passengers and crew. Another 767 belonging to Air
Ethiopia was involved in a hijack after which only 52 of the 175
involved survived. The aircraft plummeted into the sea after
hijackers refused to let it land to refuel.
</P>
<P>
   In January last year a United Airlines 767 made an emergency
landing at Heathrow after the crew noticed smoke in the forward
galley. Passengers were evacuated by chute.
</P>
<P>
   Later a 7-inch section in a bundle of more than 100 wires was
seen to have melted and burned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 Boeing announced that hundreds of 747s and 767 jets had
improperly installed bolts on the engine straps. The company said
that there was no immediate danger to passenger safety and the
aircraft were all eventually repaired. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The EgyptAir crash could not have come at a worse
time for Boeing, producer of the 767-300ER plane that went down off
Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   The company, once the undisputed market leader in commercial
aircraft, needs all the help it can find to avoid losing more
orders, particularly to the European consortium Airbus. A crash can
only focus embarrassing attention on its commercial and
manufacturing woes.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the crash, the company came in for sharp
criticism from U.S. safety regulators for its conduct after the
crash of TWA Flight 800 three years ago off Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The engine was a Boeing 747 and investigations excluded initial
theories that the plane was the victim of a terrorist bomb or shot
out of the sky by a stray missile from a nearby U.S. testing area.
</P>
<P>
   Experts now believe that the crash was caused by a catastrophic
explosion of the central fuel tanks, which had taken in heat from
air-conditioning units beneath them, although investigators have
not established exactly how the vapours ignited.
</P>
<P>
   What the U.S. federal investigators did not know was that an
internal Boeing inquiry had broached just such a possibility in
1980, 16 years before TWA Flight 800 crashed. They found this out
only in June this year, as was confirmed this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Commercially, latest statistics suggest that Airbus is
outselling Boeing by a 2-1 margin this year, the first time the
Europeans have managed to beat the Seattle-based giant so
significantly and only the fourth time that Boeing has been forced
to take second place in the commercial sales table.
</P>
<P>
   In the first nine months of 1999, Airbus signed orders for 343
aircraft, including 64 widebodied planes. Boeing had 154 signed
orders, 35 of them widebodies.
</P>
<P>
   The most disappointing aspect for Boeing was the performance of
its new long-range 777, which lost out to the Airbus 330-200 in a
major order placed by El Al, the Israeli airline, last week.
Another design, the Boeing 717, has also largely been overlooked in
favor of the Airbus A318.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago the company decided to emphasize profits rather than
market share. The company is reluctant to secure contracts by
offering big discounts and prefers to concentrate on accounts that
bring in the money.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy, when combined with a concerted program of job
cuts and cost-slashing, has improved the balance sheet _ net income
for the first six months of this year was $1.17 billion compared
with $308 million a year earlier _ but the moves have failed to
stem the loss of orders.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Boeing is still suffering from production lags from
1997. Although the backlog has now been cleared, the perception of
inefficiency remains.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is labor relations. Faced with a possible
machine operators' strike in September, the company simply caved in
on the main negotiating points, offering big pay rises and a
promise to restrict outsourcing to other companies. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ U.S. transport officials were Monday scouring the
records of aircraft similar to the EgyptAir plane which crashed off
the U.S. coast on Sunday, seeking clues to what might have gone
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One strange coincidence emerged: the aircraft was built within
days of another identical plane which crashed eight years ago,
killing all those on board.
</P>
<P>
   There were no indications at all of what might have caused the
Egyptair crash, or of whether sabotage might have been involved,
and officials underlined that many avenues of investigation were
open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we would do is look at the service record and
maintenance record of the airplane, and obviously we're going to
look at every possible scenario,'' said Boeing spokesman Doug Webb.
</P>
<P>
   A Lauda Air Boeing 767 crashed in the Thai jungle in 1991 after
a reverse thruster, used to slow the aircraft when it is on the
ground, accidentally came on when the aircraft was in the air.
</P>
<P>
   There were indications of problems with the aircraft earlier,
but once the thruster was deployed, the aircraft broke up in
midair, crashed and all 223 passengers and crew were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The EgyptAir plane was the 282nd 767 to be built at the
company's Everett plant in Washington State. The Lauda Air 767 was
plane No. 283 on the same assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   Both aircraft were built in 1989, just days before the company's
aircraft assemblers went on strike. They said that they were being
made to work too much overtime, amongst other issues.
</P>
<P>
   It was a difficult time for the company as orders piled up, and
some customers complained at the time of quality problems. These
were later resolved, however, and there is no indication of any
mechanical problems as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Both aircraft were equipped with Pratt &AMP; Whitney 4080 engines.
Boeing redesigned the reverse thruster device to incorporate a
locking mechanism to prevent deployment in flight, and Boeing and
the Federal Aviation Administration recommended that airlines
modify aircraft already in service.
</P>
<P>
   The company and investigators were trying to find the records
that would confirm if such modifications took place with the
EgyptAir plane.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Lauda Air crash, aircraft investigators had believed
that ``an inflight reversal was a controllable event,'' said the
official inquiry into the crash. The accident ``calls these
certification assumptions into question,'' it noted.
</P>
<P>
   The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued four
urgent action safety recommendations regarding the accident to the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on July 3, 1991, and the FAA
issued information on the accident in Sept. 11, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, the Lauda Air problem occurred just a couple of years
after the aircraft's delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The 767 has a good safety record. Only three have come to grief,
one of which was an Ethiopian Airlines jet which ditched in the sea
off the Comoros Islands in 1996 after being hijacked and running
out of fuel. &QL;

   BUDAPEST _ A California company is harnessing Hungarian software
and the Internet to help Turkey recover from the devastating
earthquake there in August.
</P>
<P>
   Simple Building Products, a San Diego-based developer that
produces modular building systems, is using computer-aided design
software created by Graphisoft NV of Budapest to help design and
build quake-proof structures and to train Turks in planning and
constructing their own.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, which began work in Turkey last week, was organized
by Servant Group International, a charity based in Nashville,
Tenn., along with U.S. government and international aid agencies.
The earthquake killed at least 14,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Naigle, the project architect, is not actually traveling to
Turkey but is instead directing the 40-member team of architects,
engineers and mechanics from his office in San Diego through
telephone and Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   Graphisoft's popular CAD software allows teams of architects to
work on the same project from different places.
</P>
<P>
   ``The method we're using is a low-tech building system that goes
up quickly and inexpensively,'' said Tony Ruiz, chief executive of
Simple Building Products. ``It's extremely durable and employs
common metal studs as framing, which is then clad with common
galvanized metal walls embedded into thin concrete. These
structures defy earthquakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Naigle said his design required each higher floor to be smaller
than the floor below it. ``The shape is very much like a mountain,
and mountains do not fall down during earthquakes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz's building team will teach their Turkish counterparts how
to build the structures after first working alongside them. They
plan to complete three relief centers in two weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The approximately 6-meter-by-30-meter (20-by-100-foot) buildings
will be used as clinics, soup kitchens and administrative offices
for trauma counseling in the Istanbul suburbs of Acvilar, Yalova
and Halidere. Housing is planned for the next phase of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz estimated the value of his company's donation at about
$80,000. &QL;

 CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT REAFFIRMS PRESS SHIELD  &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a major victory for the news media, the
California Supreme Court ruled Monday that reporters cannot be
thrown in jail for refusing to turn over unpublished material to
prosecutors in a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   By a unanimous vote, the high court said a Sacramento television
station does not have to give local prosecutors an unedited version
of a slaying suspect's videotaped confession.
</P>
<P>
   The decision reaffirms the wide reach of the state's Shield Law,
a 1980 voter-approved constitutional amendment that protects
journalists from being held in contempt for refusing to disclose
any unpublished information or a confidential news source.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also puts the brakes on a growing practice of issuing
subpoenas for unused portions of television news videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major step in freeing journalists to be journalists
rather than trial witnesses,'' said John Carne, an Oakland attorney
who filed a brief in support of the law on behalf of several major
news organizations, including California Newspapers Publishers
Association, Knight Ridder, The Chronicle and the Times Mirror Co.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also settles an issue that has been simmering for
almost a decade. In 1990, the court said the shield law does not
protect reporters in cases where it would infringe on a defendant's
right to a fair trial. But the court left unanswered whether
prosecutors also can penetrate the shield law.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the court left no doubt that the press has an absolute
protection from the reach of prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal prosecutor can pose ``a threat to the autonomy of the
press,'' wrote Justice Stanley Mosk in the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was good news for Ellen Miller, the former news
director at KOVR-TV in Sacramento who faced time behind bars for
refusing to turn over to prosecutors the unedited version of the
inmate's interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something that had to be done,'' said Miller, who now
is news director at WBTV, the CBS affiliate in Charlotte, N.C. ``We
couldn't roll over and let them take these rights away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about whether we are good citizens,'' she said.
``Every news director in America is constantly hit by subpoenas for
tapes from plaintiffs, defendants and prosecutors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Miller said prosecutors could have gotten the
information through other avenues.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Lee DeSoto had been charged with the March 1996 killing
of his cellmate at a California Youth Authority facility near
Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   Later that month, DeSoto, 18, confessed the slaying during a
jailhouse interview with a KOVR-TV reporter at the San Joaquin
County Jail. The station aired an edited version of the interview.
</P>
<P>
   When prosecutors demanded the complete videotape, the station
refused, invoking the Shield Law. The station noted that DeSoto had
already confessed to sheriff's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A trial judge ordered Miller to turn over the unedited interview
to prosecutors or face contempt charges. When she refused, the
judge ordered her jailed until she handed over the videotape. But
the judge agreed to hold the order in abeyance while the news
director filed her appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The state Court of Appeal relied on the same rules for
defendants as for prosecutors, ruling that the prosecutors were
entitled to the interview videotape because they showed that it was
important enough to their case.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the high court reversed that decision, saying a
prosecutor's due-process rights under Proposition 115, a 1990
voter-approved state initiative, does not carry the same weight as
the federal rights enjoyed by a criminal defendant.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter's protection ``is absolute and may be overcome only
by a countervailing federal constitutional right,'' Mosk wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The station's lawyer, Charity Kenyon, said roughly half of the
states have some type of shield law, but California is one of a few
that provide the media with unqualified protections.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision ``will put California in the forefront in
protecting the press,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The California District Attorneys Association filed a brief in
support of prosecutors obtaining unpublished material. ``We just
think that justice is on the side of relinquishing that sort of
information,'' said George Palmer, head of the appellate division
for the Los Angeles district attorney's office, which filed the
brief.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for the state attorney general's
office, which defended the prosecutors, said he was uncertain
whether the state would ask the high court to reconsider its
ruling.

   Two hundred years after New York state illegally bought _ and
underpaid for _ hundreds of thousands of acres of land from Indian
nations, taxpayers are on the hook for tens of millions of dollars
and could be forced to return entire communities to American
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of New York's liability is enormous, and settlement
negotiations are ongoing. Critics, however, say the administration
of Gov. George Pataki is drawing out talks by attempting to drag
unrelated issues, like casino gambling, to the bargaining table,
and possibly jeopardizing chances of an out-of-court agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The following stories by James M. Odato of the Albany Times
Union examine the confrontations over land deals that the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled were illegal.

   INDIAN-CLAIMS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Each year, New York honors
200-year-old land deals with American Indians by sending Iroquois
nations $29,034, plus a few tons of salt. The payment compensates
the Indians for the hundreds of thousands of acres that now make up
dozens of towns, villages and cities. But the land deals were
illegal, according to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the state faces a
turf war that could ultimately cost New York _ and possibly the
nation _ millions of dollars. By JAMES M. ODATO.
</P>
<P>
   INDIAN-ONONDAGA (Onondaga Nation) _ Irving Powless Jr., chief of
the Onondaga Indian Nation, longs to see the day when his people
enjoy economic stability and independence _ and not from the

NEW YORK FACES UNTOLD BILL TO COMPENSATE INDIAN TRIBES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Every year, New York honors 200-year-old land
deals with American Indians by sending Iroquois nations $29,034,
plus a few tons of salt. The payment compensates the Indians for
the hundreds of thousands of acres that now make up dozens of
towns, villages and cities across upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   But those land deals and many more like them were illegal,
according to the nation's highest court. And state taxpayers owe
the Iroquois millions of dollars _ or perhaps even billions _ in
cash and property.
</P>
<P>
   Indians argued for decades that they were terribly shortchanged,
and in 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in their favor, saying
that the state broke the law in taking Indian lands. No longer is
there any question that taxpayers in the state will have to atone
for the sins of their forefathers. Left unanswered is the cost.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to avoid court judgments that could run into the
billions of dollars, the state is trying to reach out-of-court
settlements with various Indian nations. Land that is now owned
privately, and in some cases has been in a family for generation
upon generation, is being claimed by Indians, armed with treaties
identifying the boundaries of their reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The modern dispute has its genesis in the late 18th and early
19th centuries, when the state illegally struck deals with the
Iroquois, taking millions of acres and then selling the land at a
profit or doling it out in lieu of pay to the men who fought the
Revolutionary War. In many cases, the deals were struck with chiefs
who didn't understand the European concept of land ownership. Some
tribal leaders thought they were simply sharing their vast
homelands.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to the heart of the matter, no one owns the
land,'' said James Ransom, land claim adviser and a Mohawk who
lives at the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation in Akwesasne. ``The whole
concept of selling te land, from our end, was a foreign concept.''
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, individuals without authorization to represent
Indian nations made pacts _ essentially selling property that
wasn't theirs to sell. And in others, the state preyed on Indians
who were willing to sell a few hundred thousand acres for a few
hundred dollars. Over time, those land masses became the towns,
cities and farms of much of upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   The state sends $23,972 annually to the Cayuga Indian Nation, a
now landless clan of about 500 American Indians. That's the payment
for 64,000 acres of prime real estate along the northern shores of
Cayuga Lake in the Finger Lakes region. New York also sends $2,430
a year _ plus 150 bushels of salt, worth $1,845 at current market
prices _ to the Onondaga Indian Nation, in payment for what is now
the city of Syracuse and some salt mines.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals and others, according to the 1985 Supreme Court
ruling, are void. A 1790 law _ the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act
_ enacted by Congress, and designed to protect the Indians from
land-grabbers, requires federal approval of all such transactions.
New York never bothered to get many approvals, perhaps, some
historians believe, because the state knew the federal government
would not condone such unfair transactions.
</P>
<P>
   After the Supreme Court decision gave them legal standing, two
Indian nations pressed their cases in court. Three others have
pending claims, and a fifth is developing a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only issue before the court now is how much money the
defendants (New York and county governments) owe to the tribes for
not being able to use the land for the last 200 years,'' said V.
Heather Sibbison, special assistant to Secretary of the Interior
Bruce Babbitt. ``If they were actually paid full value _ which they
won't be _ it would be billions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The state is already on the hook for reparations owed to the
Cayuga and Oneida nations, and is facing claims from the Onondagas,
Mohawks and Senecas. Those Indian nations represent five of the six
members of the Iroquois Confederacy, a once strong group of tribes
that controlled millions of acres of New York before the arrival of
European settlers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn of Syracuse has ordered the
state to find ways to resolve the Oneida and Cayuga claims, in
hopes that finding a way to settle those disputes will establish a
pattern for settling a rash of others.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. George Pataki also seeks to settle the claims in
party because the federal government, in an effort to encourage
out-of-court settlements of land-claim disputes, typically agrees
to help states shoulder the costs.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say negotiations have been stymied by the Pataki
administration's persistent efforts to bring unrelated issues to
the bargaining table, such as casino gambling and taxation of
Indian businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The administration will not comment on anything regarding
settlement negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   As the matter lingers, however, intense public controversy over
the issue has placed Indians and non-Indians at odds, particularly
around the casino-rich Oneida territory.
</P>
<P>
   At least 27,000 people in Oneida, Madison, Seneca and Cayuga
counties are targeted by Indians who threaten to evict them from
the land. Anger and bitterness are persistent themes in the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Indians) are just raping the state of New York for
hundreds of millions of dollars. But if we need to litigate, we
will,'' said Benjamin Carroll, a Cazenovia a lawyer representing
some property owners in Madison and Oneida counties. ``It's an
unbelievable travesty of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   It is only just, many American Indians say, for New York to be
penalized for breaking the law. Said Clint Halftown, a 27-year-old
Cayuga: ``New York state has just blatantly ignored federal law and
that is why they are in the situation that they are in. Why would
thieves get away with stealing for 200 years? I hope there is
closure to this in my lifetime.''

CHIEF GAMBLES ON LAND SETTLEMENT TO BUOY INDIAN NATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ONONDAGA NATION _ Irving Powless Jr., the 69-year-old chief of
the Onondaga Indian Nation, longs to see the day when his people
enjoy economic stability and independence _ and not from the
revenues of a casino or a bingo hall.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Powless, whose tribe opposes gambling, hopes that a
settlement with the state of New York over ancient land claims will
bring his brethren the assets they desperately need to upgrade
their 7,300-acre reservation south of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lived in this area for 1,200 years,'' said Powless, a
robust man who recalls with pride when, a generation ago, he
competed against football great Jim Brown in a lacrosse match and
knocked the powerful All-American and Hall of Fame fullback off his
feet. ``There was fresh water, fresh air, no pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Onondagas are neither financially wealthy nor land
rich. Pollution, from a dump and from a petroleum spill at a
cigarette shop, has fouled the Indian territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're considered poor,'' Powless said. ``How do you measure
that? ... How many homeless people do you have in your city? We
have zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the tribe have a right to live on the reservation,
but many survive on low-wage jobs and welfare _ the consequence of
a people ``living in abject poverty'' for 200 years, according to
Robert Coulter, a lawyer with the Indian Law Resource Center, a
nonprofit group that is helping the Onondagas on their proposed
claim.
</P>
<P>
   The Onondagas haven't yet gone to court to stake their land
claim, but the nation is building a case against the state of New
York that would follow suits filed by other Iroquois nations _ the
Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida and Seneca _ with the federal government as
co-plaintiff. Several Indian law and history experts believe the
Onondaga case would be very strong.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe has identified a 10-mile-square section of Onondaga
County as an area to which it lays claim. The land includes a mile
surrounding Onondaga Lake and most of Syracuse, a city of 163,000
in upstate New York. That represents a fraction of the acreage that
the Onondagas controlled more than two centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Powless said he has been hearing about land claims since he was
a boy growing up on the reservation, where his father, Irving
Powless Sr., also served as chief. Powless views the reservation as
an island representing the hundreds of thousands of acres
wrongfully taken by and poorly used by ``the Europeans'' who
obtained Indian properties illegally. He smiles as he talks about
his boyhood on the Onondaga territory, where he learned to fish,
hunt and play sports.
</P>
<P>
   One of the top three officers among the 14 chiefs of the
Onondagas, Powless has proven to have a tough side to him. And some
Onondaga members feel Powless is too powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can have anything unless you go through him,'' says
Alice Thompson, 64, who lives on the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, according to Powless, was part of an insurgent group
that wanted to overthrow his government.
</P>
<P>
   A land-claim settlement would be a way to ease some of the
tensions that remain. It could pump up the tribal government's
popularity, pay for toxic cleanups and help the Onondaga government
afford better educational, cultural and social programs. Powless
said the Onondaga people want to work with the community outside
the reservation to improve the economy of the region, perhaps
creating tourism destinations that might include Indian culture, or
setting up a free-trade zone at unused manufacturing sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Onondagas say they don't intend to threaten eviction of
property owners in whatever suit they file, unlike the Cayugas and
Oneidas. But they have not ruled out governmental and commercial
property holders as targets for eviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they should be subjected to some of the things we were
subjected to _ such as taking your land away from you for 200
years,'' Powless said.

INDIANS OPPOSE LINKING LAND COMPENSATION TALKS TO CASINOS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Land claim settlement talks with American Indians
in New York have presented Gov. George Pataki an opportunity to
link resolution of Indian concerns with casino gambling, and those
with knowledge of the discussions say the administration is doing
just that.
</P>
<P>
   Although the administration sidesteps questions of whether it is
attempting to sell casino rights if American Indians settle cheaply
on the land claims, Indian representatives say negotiations over
long-standing land disputes have been hindered by Pataki's efforts
to link what they view as unrelated matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already stated that the land claims issues would not be
part of discussions on gaming,'' said Seneca Nation President Duane
``Jim'' Ray, claiming he was perplexed when Pataki's chief
negotiator, John O'Mara, brought up casinos at an Aug. 11 meeting.
``We told him this is not the place to bring this up.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Mara, a former chairman of the state Public Service
Commission, would not respond to questions about the meeting.
Administration spokesman Michael McKeon would neither confirm nor
deny that Pataki wants to link casinos and land.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have items they want to talk about, we have items we want
to talk about. Everyone's free to bring up their items,'' McKeon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, leader of a progressive faction of the 7,000 Seneca
Indians, wants to join the Oneidas and Mohawks in the gambling
industry. The Senecas already have joined other Iroquois nations in
suing New York for trespassing on Indian property. But Pataki may
be holding an ace.
</P>
<P>
   Pending are land claims that could potentially cost New Yorkers
a fortune to compensate Indian nations for illegal transactions
some 200 years ago. The state wants to settle as cheaply as it can,
at a time when the Indian nations may be looking to the state for
leeway in operating casinos.
</P>
<P>
   In the private meeting with O'Mara, Ray said he planned to talk
about his tribe's interest in obtaining a state gambling compact
like those granted the Oneida and Mohawk nations. However, he said
the land claim issue was quickly brought up. Since then, O'Mara and
Pataki aides have assured the Senecas that the mixing of the two
issues was a misunderstanding, said Arlinda Locklear, a lawyer for
the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   But according to other sources close to settlement talks with
other nations, the administration has indicated a willingness to
trade the right to run a casino for a lighter cash settlement on
Oneida and Cayuga land claims. And Pataki's negotiators have raised
the issue with the Mohawks but don't seem to be doing that anymore,
said Hans Walker, their lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling is a highly controversial topic among Iroquois nations,
and efforts by the state to link casinos and land could lead to a
total collapse of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of gambling is such a flash point that Indians have
fought violently over whether their sacred traditions allow
wagering. Bingo halls have been set on fire. Roadblocks were set up
to stop patrons from going to an illegal casino. Two 1990 murders
at the Mohawk Reservation of Akwesasne are believed to be tied to
the gambling issue.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to gambling, insiders say the Pataki administration
is attempting to drag in other American Indian issues, such as the
taxing of cigarettes and gasoline sold on reservations to
non-Indians.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1994 said New York can collect
taxes on gasoline and cigarettes sold to non-Indians who buy those
products on a reservation. But Pataki backed off in 1997 after some
Senecas threatened to block the New York State Thruway during
Memorial Day weekend. The land settlement talks may give the
governor a chance to begin collecting those taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent commingling of issues is making it difficult to
resolve the land problem out of court. And that could prove costly
to New York taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a settlement, the federal government will help pay
whatever the Indians agree to accept for their land claims. If not,
New York may well be on the hook for whatever the court says is
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony of it is, from the state's perspective if they go to
trial and there's a judgment against the defendant they'll have to
pay it. If they settle it, we pay a lot of money'' said Heather
Sibbison, special assistant to the secretary of the Interior
Department.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some sources close to the settlement talks expect the case to go
to trial because the state may have more to lose if there is a
settlement. The reason: If the state settles, New Yorkers will have
to pay _ probably soon. However, if there is a court judgment, the
state can appeal for years.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of payments for compensation could prove staggering.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn, who is handling the cases of
the Cayuga and Oneida, has accepted the formula the Cayuga advanced
to compute damages _ and under that formula New York owes 204
years' worth of damages approaching $3 billion. In addition, New
York could end up returning land, some of it public and some of it
private, to the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   However, O'Mara has said that the state will not tolerate ``any
settlement that does not protect the landowners completely.'' He
also is insistent that the federal government pick up half the
costs of any settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Seneca County Board Chairman Patricia Amidon said homeowners in
her area are very concerned but letting the case go to court is too
risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's a no-win situation because neither side will be
a winner in this. If you have a settlement everybody has to give up
something,'' Amidon said.

FAILED DEAL, INACTION PROLONG DISPUTE OVER INDIAN LAND CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York's relationship with American Indians, at
least concerning ancient Indian land claims, is marred by
foot-dragging and procrastinating that may well prove immensely
expensive to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 original colonies, only New York has failed to resolve
land claims stemming from admittedly illegal transactions two
centuries ago. Now, taxpayers in the state are potentially on the
hook for millions _ maybe even billions _ of dollars in cash and
land.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has a long history of probably being more abusive of
Indian rights when it comes to federal law than any other state,''
said anthropologist William Starna, formerly of the State
University College at Oneonta.
</P>
<P>
   Starna said all the five pending Indian land claims in New York
could have been resolved years ago, and on various occasions, some
of them nearly were.
</P>
<P>
   The last near-resolution happened in the late 1970s, when Gov.
Hugh Carey, a Democrat, almost settled the Cayugas' claim.
</P>
<P>
   Carey's administration, the federal government and the Indians
worked out a deal that would have given the Cayugas $8 million and
some state land. But that deal fell through when Rep. Gary Lee, a
Republican from central New York, was pressured by constituents
afraid of losing their property and withdrew his support.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Hauptman, a history professor, author and Iroquois
specialist at the State University College at New Paltz, said the
Carey deal could have proved pivotal, could have ``set precedent
for all the other claims.'' But without the support of the
congressman for much of the affected area, it was a goner.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after Lee deep-sixed the agreement, the Cayugas
filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court, where in 1990 they won
their case. The only issue unresolved was compensation, and that
issue remains unresolved to this day as settlement talks have
repeatedly started and stalled, started and stalled. And as time
passes, the sum rises.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, the Cayugas were looking for $350 million,
plus 64,000 acres. Now, according to documents filed in federal
court, they are claiming about $3 billion based on a court-approved
formula for computing damages. A trial to formally set the damage
amount is scheduled for Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   American Indians, fully aware that a trial could be an
all-or-nothing proposition, have indicated a willingness to settle,
though not nearly as cheaply as they would have signed off two
decades ago. Instead of $8 million plus some state land, the latest
out-of-court settlement proposal calls for $120 million, plus
property. Under that proposal, half the money would be paid by the
federal government and the Cayugas would gain the rights to a
10,000-acre reserve, presumably by purchasing land from willing
sellers and perhaps from government land grants.
</P>
<P>
   A squabble over the size of the reservation is a key factor in
settling, with the Indians seeking closer to 13,000 acres and the
counties pressuring for a smaller reserve because of the potential
loss of property taxes, according to a source close to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The downfall of the Cayuga deal in the 1970s had broad
implications.
</P>
<P>
   After that deal fell through, governors were hesitant to expend
the political capital to work out an agreement that might, in the
end, fall through. Additionally, the Interior Department under
President Ronald Reagan seemed uninterested in Indian land claim
issues, according to some state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, there was no federal pressure for New York to act.
Finally, internal strife among some Indian nations further delayed
matters.
</P>
<P>
   But what happened in the Cayuga case is largely par for the
course in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Several professors who have studied Iroquois history say Indians
were essentially swindled and abused by the state as far back as
Gov. George Clinton. New York's first governor, who served from
1777 to 1795 and from 1801 to 1804, was in charge when many of the
illegal land purchases from Indians occurred. Several deals
violated the 1790 Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, which required
federal approval of Indian land transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Indians sold their land to the state, which in turn gave it to
Revolutionary War soldiers or sold it at a profit to land
investors. For instance, New York paid 50 cents an acre for Cayuga
land in the Finger Lakes and resold it at $1.50 per acre.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers included public officials and prominent speculators from
Philadelphia, New York City and Albany. ``Land was gold at the
time. Anybody with any political connections at the time was in
land speculation,'' Starna said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1922, a commission chaired by Assemblyman Edward A. Everett,
a Plattsburgh Republican, issued a report in which he said the
Iroquois were clearly shortchanged by New York and submitted that
``no nation or people can live and not settle their debts.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one New York lawmaker signed onto the report's
recommendations _ Everett himself.
</P>
<P>
   In more recent times, governors were warned of the potential
costs of the land claims. In 1967, when the state was preparing for
a constitutional convention, Attorney General Louis Lefkowitz
estimated the cost of settling the Oneida Indians' claim of 5
million acres in central New York could cost the state anywhere
from $6.2 million to $858 million. Thirty-two years later, little
has been done.
</P>
<P>
   New York's foot-dragging is in stark contrast to some other
states, especially Maine, that were in a similar position two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, like New York now, much of the state was targeted by
Indian land claims. However, unlike New York, Maine addressed those
concerns promptly and American Indians were compensated with cash
and land, paid for entirely by the federal government, not with
state tax dollars. New Yorkers most likely will not get off so
easily.

FARMER WITH DEEP ROOTS IN NEW YORK VOWS FIGHT TO KEEP LAND

   CHITTENANGO, N.Y. _ He is soft spoken, frail and polite. But
Daniel W. Gates is powerful stuff in his farming community.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being the former operator of a thriving specialty milk
production business that provided many jobs, he heads a citizens
group locked in a fierce fight with the biggest employer in these
parts _ the Oneida Indian Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Gates is the leader of Madison Oneida Landowners Inc. (MOLI), an
organization of about 2,500 people in the two rural counties east
of Syracuse. The landowners oppose the Oneidas' claim to a large
chunk of their region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no animosity toward anybody, including Mr.
Halbritter,'' said Gates, referring to Ray Halbritter, leader of
the Oneida Nation. ``But we are not going to give up our homes
without a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, spontaneously editing his remarks, he said, ``Let's change
that to `a struggle,' because there are a lot of people around here
talking about getting their gun out. ... There's got to be a better
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing before photographs of his ancestors, Gates, 75, sees
himself as a link in a chain of men bearing his last name who hired
local people in a series of prosperous agribusinesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1798 about half this land was purchased by my
great-great-great-great-grandfather, Zepheniah,'' Gates said at his
ranch home overlooking the 800 acres he owns at the line separating
Onondaga and Madison counties. Zepheniah Gates first bought more
than 250 acres from the Holland Land Co., a company of Dutch land
speculators. They had purchased property in the New World from New
York, which raises a question: Just where did New York get the
property that it sold to the speculators?
</P>
<P>
   ``They got it from the Indians,'' Gates said. The Indians, he
said, were compensated with annuities and thousands of acres of
land in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The argument used by Gates and other land-claim opponents is
both inaccurate and irrelevant, said Jack Campisi, an
anthropologist from Red Hook who has studied the Iroquois.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of New York had no right to buy that land. ... The
state made money from these illegal purchases and the state did not
provide money for the land in Wisconsin. The Oneidas purchased that
land themselves ... and in Canada,'' Campisi said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Oneidas, split into three bands in two states and one
Canadian province, want their original reservation back _ a
250,000-acre swath of central New York. Of the roughly 20,000
Oneida people, no more than 1,100 live in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Dan Gates' ancestors is that of one of the most
prominent families in the region. One Gates _ Francis H. _ served
as a state senator during Teddy Roosevelt's governorship. Gates now
owns eight farm houses and several outbuildings and barns along the
highway beneath his hilltop ranch. But he doesn't expect much of
the land passed down and added onto during seven generations of
Gates ownership to be available for the eighth generation _ his
children. He is trying to sell almost all of it, for $3 million, to
pay off tens of thousands of dollars in debt, though he said the
Oneidas' lawsuit seeking the land scares off potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you buy anything that you could not get clear title
to?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Oneida Nation's wealth has grown, thanks to
heightened interest in gambling at its Turning Stone Casino. Now,
Gates said, landowners are upset, and he shudders at some of the
things he hears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is getting so hot. I'm afraid. We're all holding our
breath that somebody doesn't'' lose control, he said. ``There are
90,000 families suffering like me,'' referring to the rough number
of people living in the land-claim region. All Gates wants, he
said, is to be able to sell his land, pay his debts and ``save 10
acres with my grandfather's house to die in.''

COCKFIGHTING FACING WHAT COULD TURN OUT TO BE A BLOODY LEGAL
BATTLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTWRIGHT, Okla. _ They strut, crow, preen and scratch in a
field behind James Talley's house, row after row of fighting birds
bred for a sport so widely despised it's been outlawed in all but
three states.
</P>
<P>
   Cockfighting is under fire but still legal in Oklahoma,
flourishing in 40 different commercial pits or ``game clubs''
around the state. Breeders such as Talley who raise and fight the
birds as a hobby are not uncommon in the rural areas that still
define the state.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents are trying to drive cockfighting out of Oklahoma
by referendum, gathering signatures to call a vote on the issue in
November 2000. The initiative would make fighting or training the
birds to fight a felony, and watching a cockfight a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   The game fowl enthusiasts, or ``cockers'' as they call
themselves, have gone on the offensive. They've hired a public
relations firm, filed a libel lawsuit against their detractors and
claim they'll open their private matches for inspection _ even
though they've delayed the start of cockfighting season this year
until December, after the petition drive is completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't just gather in an old barn _ a bunch of drunks with
roosters,'' said Tally, president of the Oklahoma Gamefowl Breeders
Association. ``There are rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in modern, air-conditioned gaming pits, the bottom line
is the same: The birds are fitted with metal gaffs or knives
attached to their legs and fight to the death. Opponents say it's
sadistic, a form of animal cruelty that most states outlawed in the
1800s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people feel that way about boxing,'' Tally countered.
``It's not for everybody. We know that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Humane Society of the United States has been lobbying to
make cockfighting illegal in every state, and it is the guiding
force behind the Oklahoma measure. Arizona and Missouri were the
most recent states to ban the rooster fights, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinary bird that survives three fights,'' said
Janet Halliburton, chairwoman of the Oklahoma Coalition Against
Cockfighting. ``There are many things about (cockfights) that
disturb me, but overall it is abject cruelty. It is inflicting pain
and suffering on animals for the entertainment of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Talley said he doesn't understand the concern for chickens among
a population that eats so many of them. On the other hand, he
thinks dog fighting is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a bird sleep in the bed with me before,'' Tally
said. ``You're talking about two different species with me. I
wouldn't want my kids to go into boxing, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't agree with dog fighting, but I think
there's a difference in the species. I'm talking about the way
people in general look at it,'' Tally said. ``When was the last
time you went to a restaurant and saw a dog on the menu?''
</P>
<P>
   Tally's birds are either caged or tethered to the ground, their
shelters spaced far enough apart that they can't get at each other.
Because if they are turned loose, they will kill each other.
</P>
<P>
   Tally thinks Oklahoma voters can be persuaded to keep
cockfighting legal if they can be made to understand how naturally
aggressive the birds are. ``They were intended to fight,'' Tally
said. ``Can you imagine the mess we'd have if I turned 'em all
loose?''
</P>
<P>
   Tally strolls among his 300 or so birds in various stages of
molt, an annual process of shedding and growing feathers.
</P>
<P>
   He removes one young bird from the cage it's been isolated in
since it began picking fights with other roosters. He shows where
the rooster's comb, as well as similar loose skin around the ears
and beak, will be trimmed away before he begins fighting,
eliminating what can be an easily bloodied target.
</P>
<P>
   The birds have sharp spurs on their legs of various sizes, which
they would fight with in the barnyard, but these will be clipped
down to inoffensive nubs. The birds will wear muffs over their
sawed-down spurs when they practice or ``spar.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the birds are entered in derbies, the razor-sharp
knives and gaffs are attached to their legs with leather straps.
Death comes quicker that way _ a more humane ending for the losing
birds, say the cockers.
</P>
<P>
   But Humane Society members argue that a quick death means more
matches per derby and more money for the participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, on a particular evening they can kill more chickens
and have more gambling,'' Halliburton said. ``The cockfighters
themselves admit that gambling is rampant, and what they call
`gentlemanly wagers' are misdemeanors in Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   Tally said his organization is having to rethink the way
entrants pool their money (an average of $100 per entrant) toward a
pot for the winning birds _ a practice the attorney general has
recently declared illegal in raccoon hunts. Tally even says he
thinks the organization would be amenable to regulating the fights
(the state agriculture department already inspects the birds for
diseases).
</P>
<P>
   ``But these people, they want it stopped,'' Tally said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was to become illegal, I'd quit. But I'm telling you,
there's probably not a state in the United States where they don't
fight 'em,'' Tally said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Tally says he breeds his birds for pleasure, it's a
lucrative business for many others. The Internet provides a
platform for Oklahoma breeders and others who want to sell their
fighting stock to overseas buyers, who routinely pay hundreds of
dollars apiece for fighting and breeding birds.
</P>
<P>
   Tally claims cockfighting is a $100 million a year industry (a
figure cockfighting opponents dispute) in Oklahoma, connecting pit
owners, commercial breeders, grain manufacturers, and restaurants
and motels that cater to the cockfighters traveling into Oklahoma
for the derbies.
</P>
<P>
   At the Mid-America ring in Muldrow, near the Oklahoma-Arkansas
border, two motels advertise their rates for cockfighters at
ringside. In the little towns around Lake Texoma, cockfighting pits
bring in business for motels and restaurants after the lake's
tourist season comes to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Hamilton has owned the Texoma Gamefowl Club in Kingston for
11 years, a large, air-conditioned facility with stadium seating.
During the season, which usually runs November through August,
Hamilton says she holds one derby every two weeks, attracting an
average crowd of about 300. The entrants in her derbies come from
Hawaii, Guam, the Philippines, New York, Washington _ all over the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's lots of people here that do it, and there's people in
Kingston that don't like it, or I should say, would never attend
one,'' Hamilton said. ``However, they know what it brings in to the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton countered, ``Right now in Oklahoma, the chambers of
commerce and the governor's office are working diligently to bring
new industry into Oklahoma. The image of being a haven for
cockfighters certainly doesn't help us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma Coalition Against Cockfighting says it has
collected about 50,000 signatures toward their mid-December
deadline for the required 69,888 verified signatures. Halliburton
and other coalition members encourage signatures by describing the
fights and describing the derbies as havens for criminal activity
such as drug dealing and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma breeders association and two of its members filed a
defamation suit against Halliburton and the Coalition Against
Cockfighting shortly after they began circulating the petitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to stop it, stop it on the basis of what you see
when two birds are fighting,'' Tally said. ``They can't come in and
accuse us of being drug dealers and prostitutes.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the allegations of criminal activity surrounding
cockfighting are widespread. Police executives in many large cities
across the country are supporting a bill pending in Congress that
would make it illegal to transport fighting birds across state
lines for the purpose of fighting them where the derbies are still
legal _ in Oklahoma, Louisiana and parts of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But on the southern border of Oklahoma, the sheriff of Love
County says he hasn't had any trouble with the two commercial
cockfighting pits that operate in his jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take our drug dogs down there and run 'em around the place
(for nearly every derby),'' said Sheriff Wesley Liddell. ``We've
caught some (drugs) out in the cars, but not in the place. They try
to keep it as clean as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I just know, the people I've been associated with,
some of the guys who work down there, they're good people. After
all, the pits are legal in Oklahoma right now.''

TEXAS CHANGES PROVIDER OF HEPATITIS TREATMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE SNYDER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In a move that could save millions of dollars,
health-care contractors for the Texas prison system are purchasing
a drug used to treat hepatitis C from a small Pennsylvania pharmacy
rather than from a pharmaceutical company whose marketing of the
drug has been controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this week, the prison system's health maintenance
organization will purchase the drug, called Ribavirin, from
Fisher's Specialty Pharmacy Services in Pittsburgh, said Dr. Jason
Calhoun, the HMO's medical director.
</P>
<P>
   Ribavirin is one of two components of a combination therapy
approved last year by the Food and Drug Administration for
treatment of hepatitis C. Prison system health-care officials
decided in June to begin treating prisoners with the combination
therapy after a study showed that 29 percent of the state's
inmates, or about 42,000 prisoners, were infected with the
potentially lethal liver virus.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of those prisoners would not be candidates for
treatment for various reasons, officials have expressed concern
that the high costs of the two drugs could have a serious impact on
the prison health-care budget.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Ribavirin was available for treatment of
hepatitis C only as part of a kit marketed by Schering-Plough
Corp., a drug manufacturer based in Madison, N.J. The other drug in
the kit is Schering-Plough's brand of alpha interferon. For a
standard one-year course of treatment, the retail cost of the two
drugs is almost $18,000 per patient, although Calhoun said the
prison system was purchasing Rebetron for about $14,700.
</P>
<P>
   By obtaining the Ribavirin from Fisher's and the interferon from
another supplier, the prison system will reduce the cost of the
combination therapy to about $5,000 per patient, Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means we can treat more than twice as many patients for
the same cost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors and patient groups have criticized Schering-Plough
for refusing to ``unbundle'' the two drugs, marketed as a product
called Rebetron, so that patients could use Ribavirin with another
brand of interferon.
</P>
<P>
   Schering-Plough responded that the drug had been tested for this
purpose only with its brand of interferon.
</P>
<P>
   Then in July, Fisher's began ``compounding'' Ribavirin _
obtaining it from an overseas supplier and packing it into
capsules, then selling it to patients based on a doctor's
prescription. The pharmacy is charging $225 for a month's supply,
compared to $1,040 per month when the drug is purchased as part of
the Schering-Plough kit.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun said only about 20 Texas prison inmates are receiving
combination therapy, but that the lower costs will make it possible
to provide the treatment to many more.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Consalvo, a spokesman for Schering-Plough, said the
compounded Ribavirin that Fisher's is selling has not been
subjected to the rigorous tests necessary to demonstrate that it is
safe and effective in combination with interferon.
</P>
<P>
   An FDA spokeswoman said the agency could not comment on its
response to Schering-Plough's complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun said liver specialists at the University of Texas
Medical Branch in Galveston, one of the partners in the prison
system's managed health-care contract, said tests have established
that the drug supplied by Fisher's is identical to
Schering-Plough's version of Ribavirin.
</P>
<P>
   Don Kerrish, a co-owner of Fisher's, said the pharmacy began
looking for alternative ways to supply patients with Ribavirin
after realizing that many patients, including some with health
insurance, were unable to afford the Rebetron kit.
</P>
<P>
   After the patent for Ribavirin expired recently, he said, the
pharmacy's lawyers did some research and concluded that compounding
the drug would be legal.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrish also said he was contacted recently by an attorney in
the Texas attorney general's office, who told him that the office
was ``looking at investigating Schering-Plough'' for possible
violations of anti-trust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrish said the attorney asked him questions about the drugs
used to treat hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   In an Oct. 17 article, The Newark (N.J.) Star-Ledger quoted an
unnamed spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general's office as
saying that an investigation of Schering-Plough was in the
``initial stages.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Delisi, a spokesman for the attorney general's office, said
that the office's policy is never to confirm or deny
investigations.

 &HT;    I won't panic over Y2K, but I'll be cautious
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The worst part about Y2K is that nobody really knows how bad the
computer glitches/irritations/disasters are going to be.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of experts to explain it, but they don't agree.
Worse yet, some of those ``experts'' are salespeople or con
artists.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of us ordinary people have figured out by now that we
can't make an intelligent judgment about how to guard our money and
our financial futures against upsets, large or small.
</P>
<P>
   We have two choices: caution or panic.
</P>
<P>
   I choose caution. I'm not arming myself, or filling the hall
closet with army field rations and charcoal briquets, or hiding my
retirement money under the bed.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the end of the millennium, but it's not the end of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   I'm taking the advice that Harold Evensky, a senior guru among
financial planners, offers to anyone who will listen: ``They should
prepare, not panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is what I am doing, and I commend these ideas to you:
</P>
<P>
   _ Leaving my investments alone.
</P>
<P>
   I know that many people think that a lot of us are going to sell
our stocks in coming weeks _ maybe solely because we think all
those other guys are going to sell.
</P>
<P>
   I won't do it. I do not plan to spend a single dollar from my
stock investments on Jan. 2. I'll let the money ride. The
alternative is to pay sales commissions, incur income taxes and, in
all likelihood, pay more commissions on purchases later on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market might go down, but it will go right back up after
the fright is past,'' said Bill Kring, a certified financial
planner in Atlanta. ``The market always overreacts.''
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out that the stock market is famous for
anticipating problems. He believes that any Y2K fears are probably
reflected in lower stock prices right now.
</P>
<P>
   _ Looking for investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   I won't sell stocks, but I'm not buying any, either. I'm willing
to wait and see if any good companies do, indeed, get hurt by a
year-end stampede.
</P>
<P>
   In a perverse and skeptical way, I share the hopes of Billy
Williams, a leader among Atlanta-area investment club officers and
a long-time stalker of good companies at modest or even depressed
prices. ``A lot of people between now and the end of the year will
just get out for heck of it,'' Williams believes. ``They're scared.
They would rather take little or no profit now and be sure they
have the money in their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, he expects such sellers will be right back in
the stock market in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Making paper trails.
</P>
<P>
   I'm saving every statement from banks, credit card companies,
stockbrokers, mutual funds, pension plans and the bank that holds
my mortgage. I am also holding on to ATM and credit card receipts.
</P>
<P>
   All of those bits of paper go into a file at home. The folder
will keep growing through February. In all likelihood I will file
away or toss out those records early in 2000. But if there is a
problem, I want an indisputable record of how things were before
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   _ Backing up my computer files.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I use Macs rather than Windows, backups are always a
good practice.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days of December, I'll put all my financial
records on backup disks. I will also print out paper copies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gathering some cash.
</P>
<P>
   A September survey by Atlanta-based Brittain Associates suggests
that 33 percent of American households will set aside an average of
$1,015 to cover any problems.
</P>
<P>
   President Bruce Brittain says Y2K anxiety seems to be declining.
``But Americans are pragmatic people,'' he said. ``The number
saying they will keep extra money on hand, just in case, has stayed
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   I won't meet the average, but I'll have some folding money _ or
traveler's checks _ stashed away. It's a cost-free precaution.
</P>
<P>
   _ Staying home New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   That's a matter for personal rather than financial preservation.
``New Year's Eve,'' a friend of mine once said, ``is the one night
of the year when all the amateur drunks are out.''

have the money in their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, he expects such sellers will be right back in
the stock market in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Making paper trails.
</P>
<P>
   I'm saving every statement from banks, credit card companies,
stockbrokers, mutual funds, pension plans and the bank that holds
my mortgage. I am also holding on to ATM and credit card receipts.
</P>
<P>
   All of those bits of paper go into a file at home. The folder
will keep growing through February. In all likelihood I will file
away or toss out those records early in 2000. But if there is a
problem, I want an indisputable record of how things were before
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   _ Backing up my computer files.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I use Macs rather than Windows, backups are always a
good practice.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days of December, I'll put all my financial
records on backup disks. I will also print out paper copies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gathering some cash.
</P>
<P>
   A September survey by Atlanta-based Brittain Associates suggests
that 33 percent of American households will set aside an average of
$1,015 to cover any problems.
</P>
<P>
   President Bruce Brittain says Y2K anxiety seems to be declining.
``But Americans are pragmatic people,'' he said. ``The number
saying they will keep extra money on hand, just in case, has stayed
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   I won't meet the average, but I'll have some folding money _ or
traveler's checks _ stashed away. It's a cost-free precaution.
</P>
<P>
   _ Staying home New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   That's a matter for personal rather than financial preservation.
``New Year's Eve,'' a friend of mine once said, ``is the one night
of the year when all the amateur drunks are out.''

FARMER WITH DEEP ROOTS IN NEW YORK VOWS FIGHT TO KEEP LAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 7)   (EDS: CORRECTS name in lead.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHITTENANGO, N.Y. _ He is soft spoken, frail and polite. But
Daniel F. Gates is powerful stuff in his farming community.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being the former operator of a thriving specialty milk
production business that provided many jobs, he heads a citizens
group locked in a fierce fight with the biggest employer in these
parts _ the Oneida Indian Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Gates is the leader of Madison Oneida Landowners Inc. (MOLI), an
organization of about 2,500 people in the two rural counties east
of Syracuse. The landowners oppose the Oneidas' claim to a large
chunk of their region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no animosity toward anybody, including Mr.
Halbritter,'' said Gates, referring to Ray Halbritter, leader of
the Oneida Nation. ``But we are not going to give up our homes
without a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, spontaneously editing his remarks, he said, ``Let's change
that to `a struggle,' because there are a lot of people around here
talking about getting their gun out. ... There's got to be a better
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing before photographs of his ancestors, Gates, 75, sees
himself as a link in a chain of men bearing his last name who hired
local people in a series of prosperous agribusinesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1798 about half this land was purchased by my
great-great-great-great-grandfather, Zepheniah,'' Gates said at his
ranch home overlooking the 800 acres he owns at the line separating
Onondaga and Madison counties. Zepheniah Gates first bought more
than 250 acres from the Holland Land Co., a company of Dutch land
speculators. They had purchased property in the New World from New
York, which raises a question: Just where did New York get the
property that it sold to the speculators?
</P>
<P>
   ``They got it from the Indians,'' Gates said. The Indians, he
said, were compensated with annuities and thousands of acres of
land in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The argument used by Gates and other land-claim opponents is
both inaccurate and irrelevant, said Jack Campisi, an
anthropologist from Red Hook who has studied the Iroquois.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of New York had no right to buy that land. ... The
state made money from these illegal purchases and the state did not
provide money for the land in Wisconsin. The Oneidas purchased that
land themselves ... and in Canada,'' Campisi said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Oneidas, split into three bands in two states and one
Canadian province, want their original reservation back _ a
250,000-acre swath of central New York. Of the roughly 20,000
Oneida people, no more than 1,100 live in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Dan Gates' ancestors is that of one of the most
prominent families in the region. One Gates _ Francis H. _ served
as a state senator during Teddy Roosevelt's governorship. Gates now
owns eight farm houses and several outbuildings and barns along the
highway beneath his hilltop ranch. But he doesn't expect much of
the land passed down and added onto during seven generations of
Gates ownership to be available for the eighth generation _ his
children. He is trying to sell almost all of it, for $3 million, to
pay off tens of thousands of dollars in debt, though he said the
Oneidas' lawsuit seeking the land scares off potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you buy anything that you could not get clear title
to?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Oneida Nation's wealth has grown, thanks to
heightened interest in gambling at its Turning Stone Casino. Now,
Gates said, landowners are upset, and he shudders at some of the
things he hears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is getting so hot. I'm afraid. We're all holding our
breath that somebody doesn't'' lose control, he said. ``There are
90,000 families suffering like me,'' referring to the rough number
of people living in the land-claim region. All Gates wants, he
said, is to be able to sell his land, pay his debts and ``save 10
acres with my grandfather's house to die in.''

 &HT;    Get used to frightening science
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that Halloween is safely behind us, some people will no
doubt go back to letting themselves be frightened by underarm
antiperspirants, irradiated food and spiders in the toilet. Those
are only a few of the popular health scares that are actually no
more dangerous than a skeleton mask.
</P>
<P>
   There will be bogus health scares as long as there is money to
be made off frightened people by removing their dental fillings or
selling them gizmos to eradicate dust mites, and the Internet
circulates those scares faster than ever. Other groundless alarms
will always be motivated less by greed than by ignorance,
gullibility or the sheer enjoyment of seeing people become
hysterical.
</P>
<P>
   That second category includes sincere phobias that power lines
and antiperspirants cause cancer, which science has refuted
repeatedly. And of eating genetically modified food, which prompts
DNA co-discoverer James Watson to say, ``I am worried about a lot
of things, but not about modified food.'' And of food irradiation,
which is proven to substantially reduce such foodborne infections
as E. coli without raising radiation levels.
</P>
<P>
   And of pesticides for fruit and vegetables, which three of four
Americans believe increase their chances of cancer. The American
Institute for Cancer Research not only has found no evidence to
that effect but also has warned that the fear is causing people to
avoid fruits and vegetables that can reduce their chances of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Science doesn't know everything, certainly, but frights often
distract us from real risks that we can avoid. There's evidence to
suspect cell phones might cause brain tumors, for example, but no
conclusive proof. Using headsets is a sensible precaution. But an
even better argument for headsets is there's no doubt about the
connection between cell phones and car accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the outright hoaxes so easily circulated by
e-mail. Waterproof sunscreens do not cause blindness, the sodium
laureth sulfate in shampoo does not cause cancer and three women in
Chicago did not die mysteriously after being bitten by spiders in a
public restroom, according to the authoritative Internet hoax Web
site, urbanlegends.about.com _ which currently is stressing that
Mountain Dew is not an effective contraceptive for males who drink
it.
</P>
<P>
   David Emery of About.com points out how the spider hoax e-mail
typically debunks itself. It refers to the nonexistent United
Medical Association and Blare Airport and Big Chappies restaurant
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Deceptive sales pitches are harder to spot, but it helps to ask
what's in it for whoever is spreading the news. As soon as word
came out that chocolate contains cancer-fighting antioxidants
similar to vitamins C and E, the Mars company promoted a Web site
dedicated to timely information ``on chocolate and health.''
</P>
<P>
   As consumer scams go, that was hardly more deceptive than ending
price tags with ``.99.'' The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
announced this summer that after one day's research, it told 800
Web sites their false or unsubstantiated health claims broke
federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   Beware, says the FTC, of broad claims, big words, testimonials
instead of scientific research, products available from only one
source and the terms ``scientific breakthrough'' or ``ancient
remedy.'' When you hear something can't hurt you because it's
natural, remember arsenic is natural.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says the most fertile
fields for health fraud are products to treat arthritis, cancer and
AIDS; to help people lose weight quickly or improve their sex
lives, and to reverse baldness, eliminate wrinkles and enlarge
breasts.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site www.quackwatch.com is the most comprehensive
resource on health frauds and how to spot them, although it tends
to give all alternative remedies the dismissal that only most of
them deserve.
</P>
<P>
   WellnessWeb.com is more open-minded about classical medicine
without opening its arms in embrace, pointing out that just because
something is not proven doesn't mean it can't be true. It wasn't
long ago, after all, that mainstream medicine was sure heart
disease had nothing to do with diet.
</P>
<P>
   People want to believe in miracle cures and short cuts to good
health, and it only confounds us that some people really do feel
better after having their mercury amalgam fillings replaced, and
some who live near power plants die of leukemia. But preceding
something isn't the same as causing it, no more than alarm clocks
cause sunlight. Don't forget: Practically anything will cure a cold
within two weeks.

 &HT;    No Gray area: Interview was poorly timed
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Florida autumns are hard. No red maple
leaves. Humid Halloweens. Then the World Series comes and goes and
_ can I be dramatic just this once? _ we are left behind, empty and
lost, counting the minutes and the hours and the days until
pitchers report for spring training.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I thank God today for television, small men and
America's obsession with quick judgment.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, none of it had happened. The Braves still stood a
chance. Boredom hadn't thrust me into slumber four World Series
games in a row. And a television guy named Jim Gray hadn't made us
uncomfortable when he stood on national TV and demonstrated the
self-important attitude reporters sometimes use to get the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   He was standing, wasn't he?
</P>
<P>
   Gray created quite a little stir when he asked Pete Rose whether
he had bet on baseball. Well, actually he used a little more muscle
in his wording than that. NBC affiliates around the country were
flooded with calls from angry baseball lovers who didn't want their
Sunday night World Series game ruined with Gray's persistence about
Pete's Past.
</P>
<P>
   Game Two and the introduction of Major League Baseball's
All-Century Team was supposed to be a warm and fuzzy night. NBC
viewers, MasterCard users every last one of us, were supposed to be
weak-kneed and smiling as we listened to the melody of Joe Morgan's
voice and watched the young stars help the old ones onto the field.
We were supposed to be enjoying ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gray, meanwhile, was working.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting is a curious job, curious because people hate how we
do what we do, yet they want us to do it. Should Gray have backed
off a little? Probably. Should he have brought it up at all? I
might not have had the nerve. But he works for a network, makes six
figures and doesn't get stories modeling himself after Debra
Norville. Look where niceness landed her.
</P>
<P>
   No, the real problem isn't that Jim Gray asked Pete Rose if he'd
bet on baseball. The real problem is that we were forced to watch,
taken by surprise, frozen on our comfy couches, our October smiles
transformed into quiet grimaces. ``Whoa,'' we said to all our nice
baseball-fan friends the next day. ``That was intense.''
</P>
<P>
   It was awful to watch. Uncomfortable as hell. Awkward.
Embarrassing. It practically made me jump up and go fold everything
in the hall linen closet. That interview was a lot like finding out
how they make sausage. Sausage is good, but spare me the details of
how it lands on my plate.
</P>
<P>
   I have a feeling Jim Gray's days as Mr. World Series are over.
It's awfully hard to forgive someone for embarrassing a sports star
on national television. And believe me, some people love their
Charlie Hustle. Gray probably would have done better if he'd bought
himself a bad toupee, changed his name to Marv, tied up his
favorite lover, then bit her. Now, that's something America would
have loved to watch. If you know what I mean.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: From jukeboxes to candy cigarettes
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG _ Ohio _ My friend Sally is an Internet junkie _ even
half-a-dozen disabling lightning strikes have failed to dampen her
enthusiasm for the medium. She argues politics in one chat room,
swaps news with her mother and sister in another, and keeps in
touch with a friend in Mexico in a third.
</P>
<P>
   If Sally isn't teaching a Spanish class in Toledo, or visiting
her grandchildren in Cincinnati, she's on the Net. That's where she
gets all of the goofy stuff she's always sending me. Sometimes it's
jokes, sometimes it's a cause she wants me to write about. This
morning it was a list of 25 things titled: How many do you
remember?
</P>
<P>
   Blackjack chewing gum: Austin Benditz used to stick it in my
hair. He was the meanest kid in first grade and he always wore
black high-top sneakers and horizontal-striped polo shirts - bad
boy gear when I was a kid.
</P>
<P>
   Wax Coke-shaped bottles with colored sugar water: Three for a
penny at the corner candy store but we weren't allowed to chew the
wax in school.
</P>
<P>
   Candy cigarettes: Loved them. Moved on to the real thing and
spent 15 years kicking the habit.
</P>
<P>
   Soda pop machines that dispensed bottles: Nothing tasted better
than Coke in a little bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Hamburg joints with tableside jukeboxes: WW2, Jacksonville
Beach. My mom gave me a nickel and I played Maria Elena. A couple
of sailors danced with their girls.
</P>
<P>
   Home milk delivery in glass bottles with cardboard stoppers: A
wad of cream was always stuck to a new stopper. I held it for the
cat to lick.
</P>
<P>
   Party lines: The girl next door was on mine. Once I listened and
she was saying something rotten about me.
</P>
<P>
   Newsreels before the movie: I remember watching Howard Hughes'
flying boat almost fly and listening to the glass break on the
theater floor. Wednesday night was dish night.
</P>
<P>
   Slingshots: Girls didn't own them.
</P>
<P>
   Butch wax: That either.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone numbers with a word prefix: Mine was SHadyside 2190.
My friend Carol was FLorida 1830, and Daddy's office was CHerry
3113. But don't ask my social security number.
</P>
<P>
   Peashooters: Not girl stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Howdy Doody: After my time.
</P>
<P>
   45 RPM records: 78s were my speed.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;H Greenstamps: My mother saved a bunch of them and was real
unhappy the
</P>
<P>
   day she discovered I'd taken them outside and pasted them on the
corner mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   Hi-fi: Had a beauty in an early-American maple cabinet that
played 78s. My favorite was Saber Dance until Barbara Dean sat on
it.
</P>
<P>
   Metal ice trays with levers: Came with our new Westinghouse in
'46. I used to
</P>
<P>
   make green and blue ice cubes in them until the levers broke.
</P>
<P>
   Mimeograph paper: A messy business.
</P>
<P>
   Blue flashbulbs: Why?
</P>
<P>
   Amos and Andy: My grandfather's favorite radio show. The house
had to drop dead when they were on.
</P>
<P>
   Roller skate keys: Always losing mine until my mother tied it
onto a spare shoestring and hung it around my neck.
</P>
<P>
   Cork popguns: Boy stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Drive-ins: Ahh, yes. I remember them well. Mosquitoes in the
summer and steamed windows in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Studebakers: My first car. I bought it used. It was a black
convertible with a red leather interior. The starter was under the
clutch and the overdrive was electric. Once I had the top down and
a giant cockroach flew in. I jumped out and the car kept going _
right through the window of Shrader's Drug Emporium. It didn't hurt
the car.
</P>
<P>
   Wash tub wringers: One came on our Norge washer. I can still
smell the Fels-Naptha soap my mother used to shave from a supersize
bar with a paring knife.
</P>
<P>
   So, Sally, the answer to your question is: I remember all of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks. It was fun.

   Solara a step up for Camry
</P>
<P>
   By Russ DeVault
</P>
<P>
   The Toyota Camry faithful _ and sales figures prove they are
legion _ hankering for a bit more luxury and performance now have
an appealing alternative that doesn't require moving up to Lexus or
switching to another marque: the Solara coupe.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Camry variant with some characteristics and features that
seem borrowed from Toyota's upscale Lexus cars. Prices start at
$21,648 and peak at $25,400 for the maximum-optioned SLE with V-6
engine. The test Solara SE totaled $26,237, with the major addition
being a $3,655 package that included leather seats, a moonroof and
upgraded tires and wheels.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a sporty Camry with an exceptionally smooth ride and
cabin ambience _ i.e., quiet _ really akin to that of a Lexus.
Equipped with a five-speed manual transmission, the Solara SE was
easy enough to drive in traffic and had just enough performance to
distinguish itself from ordinary Camrys.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pumped-up performance and an exterior set off by a
mild rear spoiler, the cabin is what grabs attention. It's totally
functional and friendly, as long as you're not trying to get to the
rear seats. It's also rather attractive despite the vista of
plastic common to coupes and sedans in this size class and price
range.
</P>
<P>
   The podded, white-face instrumentation is Lexus-like, and
there's a nice band of wood circling the cabin at a mid-dash
height. The front and rear pillars can cut into visibility, but the
rounded top they support makes for good headroom (38.3 inches) for
the front while suggesting the rear is for kids and cargo (36.3
inches). Legroom's great in the front (43.3 inches) and confining
in the rear (35.2 inches).
</P>
<P>
   But Toyota doesn't figure to have many Solara buyers looking for
family transportation, even though the Solara is a car an actively
parenting dad might relish driving. It's viewed as a car for empty
nesters who don't want a cushy sedan or an econo-coupe and feel
they deserve what Don Esmond, Toyota general manager for the
American market, calls a ``justifiable indulgence.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Solara hardly qualifies as a car for conspicuous
consumers. The only heads it'll turn are those not familiar with
the Camry line _ the front is decidedly Camry _ for a couple of
reasons:
</P>
<P>
   -- The nonaggressive exterior doesn't indicate that the
powertrains _ with five-speed manual or four-speed automatic _ will
pull the front-driving, 3,300-pound Solara to 60 mph in seven-plus
seconds (with power anti-locks discs that'll stop it in a
respectable 141 feet). So it's a sleeper of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   The interior, even with leather and wood trim, isn't so rich
that it indicates just how luxo-smooth and silent is the Solara's
ride. Strip away the badging, and this impressive Toyota could
easily pass for a baby Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Toyota Camry Solara SE coupe
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $26,237 (base: $21,648)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 3.0-liter V-6 engine with 24 valves (200
horsepower), five-speed manual transmission
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front air bags, optional side air bags
($250), power anti-lock disc brakes
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: package with 16-inch tires and
aluminum alloy wheels, leather and wood interior trim, power
driver's seat, JBL stereo with CD/cassette players and eight
speakers, power tilt/slide moon roof, rear spoiler, $3,655;
color-keyed mudguards, $80
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 20 mpg premium unleaded city, 28 mpg highway

   Solara a step up for Camry
</P>
<P>
   By Russ DeVault
</P>
<P>
   The Toyota Camry faithful _ and sales figures prove they are
legion _ hankering for a bit more luxury and performance now have
an appealing alternative that doesn't require moving up to Lexus or
switching to another marque: the Solara coupe.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Camry variant with some characteristics and features that
seem borrowed from Toyota's upscale Lexus cars. Prices start at
$21,648 and peak at $25,400 for the maximum-optioned SLE with V-6
engine. The test Solara SE totaled $26,237, with the major addition
being a $3,655 package that included leather seats, a moonroof and
upgraded tires and wheels.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a sporty Camry with an exceptionally smooth ride and
cabin ambience _ i.e., quiet _ really akin to that of a Lexus.
Equipped with a five-speed manual transmission, the Solara SE was
easy enough to drive in traffic and had just enough performance to
distinguish itself from ordinary Camrys.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pumped-up performance and an exterior set off by a
mild rear spoiler, the cabin is what grabs attention. It's totally
functional and friendly, as long as you're not trying to get to the
rear seats. It's also rather attractive despite the vista of
plastic common to coupes and sedans in this size class and price
range.
</P>
<P>
   The podded, white-face instrumentation is Lexus-like, and
there's a nice band of wood circling the cabin at a mid-dash
height. The front and rear pillars can cut into visibility, but the
rounded top they support makes for good headroom (38.3 inches) for
the front while suggesting the rear is for kids and cargo (36.3
inches). Legroom's great in the front (43.3 inches) and confining
in the rear (35.2 inches).
</P>
<P>
   But Toyota doesn't figure to have many Solara buyers looking for
family transportation, even though the Solara is a car an actively
parenting dad might relish driving. It's viewed as a car for empty
nesters who don't want a cushy sedan or an econo-coupe and feel
they deserve what Don Esmond, Toyota general manager for the
American market, calls a ``justifiable indulgence.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Solara hardly qualifies as a car for conspicuous
consumers. The only heads it'll turn are those not familiar with
the Camry line _ the front is decidedly Camry _ for a couple of
reasons:
</P>
<P>
   -- The nonaggressive exterior doesn't indicate that the
powertrains _ with five-speed manual or four-speed automatic _ will
pull the front-driving, 3,300-pound Solara to 60 mph in seven-plus
seconds (with power anti-locks discs that'll stop it in a
respectable 141 feet). So it's a sleeper of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   The interior, even with leather and wood trim, isn't so rich
that it indicates just how luxo-smooth and silent is the Solara's
ride. Strip away the badging, and this impressive Toyota could
easily pass for a baby Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Toyota Camry Solara SE coupe
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $26,237 (base: $21,648)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 3.0-liter V-6 engine with 24 valves (200
horsepower), five-speed manual transmission
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front air bags, optional side air bags
($250), power anti-lock disc brakes
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: package with 16-inch tires and
aluminum alloy wheels, leather and wood interior trim, power
driver's seat, JBL stereo with CD/cassette players and eight
speakers, power tilt/slide moon roof, rear spoiler, $3,655;
color-keyed mudguards, $80
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 20 mpg premium unleaded city, 28 mpg highway

 &HT;    It's a guy thing! Comic Jimmy Kimmel appeals to 'common man'
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jimmy Kimmel's wife gets mad at him _ a lot.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as co-host of ``The Man Show,'' Comedy Central's
shamelessly naughty series, he pokes fun at her incessantly and is
constantly drooling over scantily clad chicks bouncing on
trampolines.
</P>
<P>
   A ho-hum Kimmel just shrugs. ``I march her around my large house
in the Hollywood Hills and say, 'You see this house? This is from
me making fun of you!' She'd have more of a problem if I was ogling
women at dinner parties with our friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The pudgy, beer-guzzling Kimmel can afford to thump his chest a
bit. The guy is quickly becoming the hardest working man in show
business. The former radio jock and self-described ``champion of
the common man,'' is juggling three television gigs. Kimmel
co-hosts ``The Man Show'' and ``Win Ben Stein's Money'' on Comedy
Central. On Sundays, he dons his football prognosticator persona on
``Fox NFL Sunday,'' the network's testosterone-heavy pregame show.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very driven, very focused and very dedicated guy, and
it's basically like a dictatorship working with him,'' says Adam
Carolla, Kimmel's partner-in-crime on ``The Man Show.'' ``He's not
scared to tell you that your idea sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   That's apparent on ``Fox NFL Sunday,'' where the acid-tongued
Kimmel does a lot more than pick the week's winners. He often picks
on Terry Bradshaw and Howie Long _ two ex-football players who are
a lot bigger than the 5-foot-7 Kimmel.
</P>
<P>
   He's worn hats that said ``Terry Is Bald,'' and ``Howie Can't
Act.'' He called Bradshaw a ``cue ball'' and cracked that his
claymation puppet made him look like Ed Asner. He referred to Long
as Frankenstein.
</P>
<P>
   Does Kimmel have a death wish? He admits Bradshaw wasn't too
amused at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks it's funny now, because he knows I mean him no
harm,'' says Kimmel, 31. ``But sports and comedy are completely
different worlds. When they get together, it causes some friction.
In sports, when they're going to rip someone, they call the team
and tell 'em beforehand. It's weird. There's a real courtesy
involved. So, to him, when I just showed up wearing a ``Terry is
Bald'' hat, and I didn't call to OK it with him, it was such a
breach of his ethics. It was shocking, but I think they've gotten
used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has, however. The Chicago Tribune begged Fox to
``lose'' Kimmel. USA Today called Kimmel's addition ``the worst
move in the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty extreme,'' says NFL on Sunday's coordinating
producer Scott Ackerson. ``There's a lot of decade to choose from.
I just look at the ratings, and the ratings are up in the first
half hour and our male demographics in the 18-34 group is up 25
percent. You either like Jimmy or you hate him. There's really
isn't a lot of middle ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers definitely seem to love him on The Man Show., which
Kimmel created with good pal Carolla. ``More chicks dig us now than
they did in high school,'' Carolla cracks. ``But that's not a hard
number to surpass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Man Show'' was originally pitched to ABC. Not
surprisingly, the Disney-owned network passed. When the zany series
debuted in June, it was the highest-rated premiere of any show in
Comedy Central's history. ``The Man Show'' is an unapologetic
celebration of all the things most men like: women, beer and more
women. The series boasts hilarious, yet sexist, bits such as
``Household Hints From Adult Film Stars'' (see two porn stars show
the difficulties of keeping fitted satin sheets on the bed!) and
``Movies Men Don't Want To See'' (Charles Durning as an auctioneer
battling Alzheimer's in Going, Going ... Gone.)
</P>
<P>
   But isn't all of Kimmel's macho posturing just an act? Well, not
really.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not an act, because I wouldn't say something I
didn't believe,'' he says. ``It's definitely an exaggerated version
of me. It's the super me.''
</P>
<P>
   Being funny comes as natural to Kimmel as breathing. Before
getting his TV jobs, he first got noticed on L.A. radio. And before
that, the Brooklyn, N.Y., native was raised in Las Vegas amid a
family of cut-ups _ including his 92-year-old grandfather. So, it's
no surprise that Kimmel started making people laugh at an early
age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably in the womb lighting off stink bombs,'' he
says. ``I always knew it was fun to make people laugh and to be the
clown in class. I was told over and over again by various teachers
that if you keep screwing around, you're not going anywhere. They
said, 'You're too smart to fool around.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out they were all wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has three shows _ and that large Hollywood Hills house _
to prove it.

 &HT;    Technology makes treatment easier
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Technology breakthroughs are making it easier to
diagnose and treat gum disease and oral cancers, according to
several reports released in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Dayton Dental Hygienists Association points out, it
all starts with an exam and cleaning every six months. Dental
hygienists are the only licensed dental professionals besides
dentists and focus on preventing and stopping the progress of
periodontal, or gum, disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dentists now can detect periodontal disease in earlier stages by
analyzing fluid from a person's mouth for the activity of bacteria
and enzymes that signals gum disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such breakthrough diagnostic techniques allow earlier
diagnosis (and) less costly treatment and minimize invasive
treatment,'' Dr. Jon B. Suzuki, dean of the University of
Pittsburgh's dental school, reported last month at the American
Dental Association's conference.
</P>
<P>
   New treatment strategies include regenerating tissue and placing
specific molecules or membranes strategically around the teeth to
promote bone growth, Suzuki said.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing research shows connections between periodontal
disease and higher incidences of heart disease, diabetes, low
birth-weight pregnancies and other disorders. More obviously, the
destruction of bone and gum tissue in the mouth can cause teeth to
fall out.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics, for example, are more likely to develop gum disease,
and gum disease in turn makes it more difficult for diabetics to
control their blood sugar. Yet research in the October issue of the
Journal of Periodontology showed a disturbing gap in health status
between what patients tell their dentists and what lab tests
reveal.
</P>
<P>
   Treating periodontal disease and infections of the mouth appear
to be ``reducing the risk for other systemic ailments,'' Dr.
Marjorie Jeffcoat of the University of Alabama at Birmingham told
the ADA conference.
</P>
<P>
   Another early detection technique uses computer-assisted
technology to identify pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions that can
be overlooked even by highly trained and experienced professionals,
according to the October Journal of the American Dental
Association. Earlier treatment prompted by the brush biopsy
scanning device could dramatically reduce deaths, the cover story
says.
</P>
<P>
   Oral cancer will be diagnosed about 30,000 times in the United
States this year, the American Cancer Society says. Half of
patients die within five years.

   COXNET WHEELS 1102 _ For years now, Pontiac has offered
performance in its Firebird models and various degrees of luxury in
its full- and midsize sedans. But the 2000 Bonneville combines
both, with the line-topping SSEi capable of going bumper-to-bumper

   BENSTEIN-KIMMEL _ Jimmy Kimmel's wife gets mad at him _ a lot.
After all, as co-host of ``The Man Show,'' Comedy Central's
shamelessly naughty series, he pokes fun at her incessantly and is
constantly drooling over scantily clad chicks bouncing on
trampolines. A ho-hum Kimmel just shrugs. ``I march her around my
large house in the Hollywood Hills and say, 'You see this house?
This is from me making fun of you!' She'd have more of a problem if
I was ogling women at dinner parties with our friends.'' Kimmel can
afford to thump his chest a bit. The former radio jock and
self-described ``champion of the common man,'' is juggling three
television gigs. Kimmel co-hosts ``The Man Show'' and ``Win Ben
Stein's Money'' on Comedy Central. On Sundays, he dons his football

cancers, according to several reports released in the last month.
But as the Dayton Dental Hygienists Association points out, it all
starts with an exam and cleaning every six months. Dental
hygienists are the only licensed dental professionals besides
dentists and focus on preventing and stopping the progress of
periodontal, or gum, disease. Increasing research shows connections
between periodontal disease and higher incidences of heart disease,
diabetes, low birth-weight pregnancies and other disorders. More
obviously, the destruction of bone and gum tissue in the mouth can
cause teeth to fall out. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

 &HT;    Survey: Bad habits come with job territory
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Admit it, says Ken Hakuta. Aren't we all guilty
of social stereotyping sometimes? When the guy ahead of you in the
checkout line is buying cigarettes, wouldn't you bet he's more
likely to be an auto mechanic or construction worker than a priest
or pediatrician?
</P>
<P>
   You'd be wrong, according to the unscientific survey Hakuta's
herbal-medicine company commissioned that correlated people's jobs
with their health habits. ``We did it more for fun than for
science,'' he says of canvassing 60 to 100 people in each of 17
jobs. But the results still make the point that it's hard to guess
a person's health habits from what he or she does for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy standing next to you at McDonald's is more likely to
be a doctor than a cop, and the guy at the salad bar could be a
Hell's Angels guy,'' Hakuta says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to break conventional wisdom,'' he says, a desire he
traces at least in part to ``a chain-smoking, overweight doctor
telling me I have to run every day when he probably has salami and
cheese every night with his drink.''
</P>
<P>
   He also likes to tweak conventional medicine, truth be told. He
is the founder and chief executive officer of AllHerb.com, a
Maryland-based Internet source for both learning about herbal
products and buying them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand from the e-mails we receive that a lot of poor
health habits are due to the work schedules people have, the amount
of time they have for exercise and the amount of stress people
face,'' Hakuta says. So he looked into that, ``of course choosing
some of the fun professions that people have misconceptions
about.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey suggested people in high-stress, high-income jobs _
``people you would think would have the income to take better care
of themselves'' _ don't always do so.
</P>
<P>
   Dentists, for example, were more likely than exotic dancers,
McDonald's managers and everyone else to ignore medical advice. And
auto mechanics were not only the group least likely to drink
heavily or order red meat at a restaurant, but they also were three
times more likely than investment bankers to make golf their
primary exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are not always what they seem,'' Hakuta says. In the
spirit of fun, we share his findings here.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Clergymen and doctors were the most likely to smoke, both more
than 60 percent. The least likely were stay-at-home moms and
construction workers, at less than a third of that rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Auto mechanics were the least likely to order red meat in a
restaurant and to say they drank excessively at least once in the
last month. Accountants were seven times more likely to order red
meat, and therapists were three times more likely to drink heavily.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More than two-thirds of doctors hadn't exercised in the last
year, compared to only one out of four McDonald's restaurant
managers. Stay-at-home moms and investment bankers were the next
most likely to exercise.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The doctors were visiting the McDonald's managers regularly.
Nearly three-fifths of them ate fast-food lunches three times a
week, a rate five times as high as that for computer programmers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Computer programmers didn't have many ulcers, either _ they
suffered at only one-third the rate of teachers. Nearly two in five
teachers said they ate chocolate after a stressful day, more than
triple the rate of investment bankers. But they're braver than
construction workers when it comes to getting shots, only half as
likely to lie to avoid one.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  College professors and exotic dancers had at least one thing
in common: They were three times as likely as doctors to believe in
an herbal health regimen.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Doctors and stay-at-home moms were most likely to believe
marijuana should be legalized, with at least 65 percent agreeing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Lawyers lie a lot. That's not a surprise,'' Hakuta said. But
three times more often than car salesmen to lie to doctors? They
were also by far the profession most likely to lie about their
weight to their spouses.

SCI-FI'S JUST A SETTING FOR AWARD-WINNING NOVELIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CALVIN WILSON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Art knows no boundaries for Jonathan Lethem. Nor should it.
</P>
<P>
   The novelist finds as much beauty in the populist art of
director John Ford's classic Western ``The Searchers'' as he does
in relatively obscure literature, such as John Barth's End of the
Road.
</P>
<P>
   That inclusive philosophy is reflected in his novels and
short-story collections, which have earned critical praise for
their imaginative story lines, vivid characters and
convention-defying originality.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lethem has been lumped with science-fiction writers,
his work has always been hard to classify. Indeed his latest novel,
Motherless Brooklyn (Doubleday), isn't science fiction at all,
although it is genre fiction of a sort. It's a mystery whose
central character has Tourette's syndrome, a neurological condition
that may manifest itself as tics, spasms or involuntary outbursts
of profanity.
</P>
<P>
   In the hands of another writer, private investigator Lionel
Essrog might have been a tasteless joke. But Lethem had a much
different motive in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was challenging myself to write a book where wordplay and a
sort of manic, free-associating voice was front and center,'' the
35-year-old novelist said by phone from his Brooklyn home. In
Motherless Brooklyn, that voice belongs to Essrog. His compulsive
verbal outpourings give the novel, which is told from his point of
view, its rhythmic edge. As the intricately plotted tale unfolds,
the detective emerges not as an offensive caricature, but as an
undeniable, albeit unconventional, hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' star Edward Norton has optioned the film rights.
</P>
<P>
   The same qualities that make it hard for Essrog to fit into
society, among them a compulsive attention to detail, make him an
ideal detective. Although Lethem researched the condition, he
allows that he took a few liberties. After all, Motherless Brooklyn
is a novel, not a textbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason I got away with it was I'm so loving toward
Lionel,'' Lethem said. ``That warmth and that affection, I think,
are what carry me through the questions of taste.''
</P>
<P>
   As was true of his earlier works, including his 1994 debut
novel, Gun, With Occasional Music, Lethem's prose is crisp, clear
and confident, as in this passage early in the book:
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in the library of St. Vincent's Home for Boys, in the
part of downtown Brooklyn no developer yet wishes to claim for some
upscale, renovated neighborhood; not quite Brooklyn Heights, nor
Cobble Hill, not even Boerum Hill ... I set out to read every book
in that tomblike library, every miserable dead donation ever
indexed and forgotten there _ a mark of my profound fear and
boredom at St. Vincent's and as well an early sign of my Tourettic
compulsions for counting, processing and inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Lethem's own early years were more conventional. He was born in
New York, but his family moved to Kansas City when he was a
toddler. His father was a professor of painting at the Kansas City
Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my first memories are of Kansas City, (Mo.),'' Lethem
said. His aunt was the late Kansas City children's writer and
teacher Wilma Yeo, whose books included Stranger at Winfield House
and Gypsy Summer. He particularly remembers spending a lot of time
in the sculpture gardens at the Art Institute. But by the time he
was 5, his family had moved to Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Motherless Brooklyn, Lethem's tribute to the city in Manhattan's
shadow, is his fifth novel. It follows the recent Girl in Landscape
(1998) and As She Climbed Across the Table (1997), vastly different
works that stood out as literate, visionary science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``His emblematic traits are a fertile imagination and a wry
sense of humor,'' said author David Brin, whose futuristic novel
The Postman was the basis for the 1997 film starring Kevin Costner.
``His works are very much in the tradition of high-end science
fiction, meaning that he loves to twist reality and explore the
plausible effects that change might wreak on people.''
</P>
<P>
   As She Climbed Across the Table is a love story in which a
university professor named Philip pursues a physicist named Alice.
It's Lethem's metaphysical play on Alice in Wonderland, with a
black hole standing in for the rabbit hole. The book ``was pretty
much an academic satire, or a kind of metaphysical fable, more than
it was science fiction,'' he said, adding that while writing it, he
was very much under the influence of Barth's End of the Road, which
also took academia as its subject.
</P>
<P>
   Girl in Landscape, which is darker in tone, is a coming-of-age
story about Pella Marsh, a teen-age girl whose family migrates from
Earth to a settlement on another, even stranger planet. The novel
was inspired by director Ford's ``The Searchers.'' In the classic
1956 Western, John Wayne delivered a layered, disturbing
performance as a man obsessed with saving his kidnapped niece, even
if it means killing her. The film, Lethem said, provoked in him ``a
powerful emotional response, and a very confused one at first.''
</P>
<P>
   Lethem shares with other American writers of his generation a
gift for transforming popular sources into personal expression. His
contemporaries include the novelists Mark Leyner (My Cousin, My
Gastroenterologist) and David Foster Wallace (Infinite Jest).
</P>
<P>
   ``Lethem has grown up immersed in this media-driven age that we
live in,'' said Larry McCaffery, author of Some Other Frequency:
Interviews with Innovative American Authors. ``He knows the
detective movies and Bogart and MTV and cyberpunk. He can use these
pop-fabulist materials and reconstruct them into something that's
going to be relevant to readers and to their experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   The conventions of genre fiction have long fascinated Lethem,
whose other books are the novel Amnesia Moon (1995) and the
short-story collection The Wall of the Sky, the Wall of the Eye
(1996).
</P>
<P>
   He once was enrolled in the prestigious writing program at
Bennington College in Vermont. Its alumni include Bret Easton Ellis
(American Psycho) and Donna Tartt (The Secret History). But
whatever virtues the program may have had, its emphasis on the
literary values of the academy was at odds with Lethem's more
inclusive tastes. In his sophomore year, he dropped out, supporting
himself by working in bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Lethem found success writing science fiction.
His short stories were published widely in anthologies and
magazines in the United States and England. In 1991 he was a
finalist for a Nebula Award, one of the genre's most prestigious
honors.
</P>
<P>
   His breakthrough to the mainstream came in 1994 with the
publication of Gun, With Occasional Music. The science
fiction//mystery hybrid took place in a near-future world of
talking, genetically altered animals and routine drug abuse, and
revolved around Conrad Metcalf, a fast-talking, metaphor-prone
``private inquisitor.''
</P>
<P>
   With Motherless Brooklyn, Lethem has seemingly come full circle,
with another detective driving his narrative. After years of living
in California he has also come home to Brooklyn, both on the page
and in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in some ways I was in a kind of denial about my
Brooklyn roots,'' he said. ``I was holding that material at bay,
and I wrote books that were set either in California or in that
kind of cartoonish anywhere that you've seen in the earlier work.
But when I got back to Brooklyn, I was sort of walking in my own
footsteps.''

AT AGE 45, CANCER CLAIMS PAYTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sweetness is gone from the world of football.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Payton died Monday. He was 45.
</P>
<P>
   His nickname might have been ``Sweetness'' because he ran like
flowing honey and his high-pitched voice along with the dignity of
his manner and the look he had of an R&AMP;B singer from a generation
back all were sweet indeed, but Walter Payton the football player
was the direct opposite of ``Sweetness.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Payton should have been nicknamed ``Toughness.'' Nobody
ever could remember his taking the easy step and running out of
bounds; no, Walter Payton ran over tacklers as much as he slithered
around tacklers.
</P>
<P>
   Always, but always, Walter Payton would fight for the extra
yard. Walter Payton would stiff-arm a defender one play and juke
the same defender silly the next. Whatever it took.
</P>
<P>
   He holds the NFL record of most yards gained in a career,
breaking Jim Brown's record of 12,312 in 1984 and then amassing a
total of 16,726 before retiring. But it is another record Payton
holds _ the 3,838 times he carried a football _ that is his truest
testament.
</P>
<P>
   The shelf life of running backs is short in the NFL _ four or
five years is the norm _ because of the horrific pounding they
take. But Walter Payton carried the ball 13 years. And, in those 13
years, he missed one game, that in his rookie season, and the story
is that a jealous assistant coach ignored Payton's pleas to play
and sat him on the bench. Unlike the running backs of today, Payton
would not signal to his coaches to take him out after a 25-yard
scamper. No oxygen breaks for Payton. No missed downs.
</P>
<P>
   For all those reasons, the shock surrounding the news of
Payton's death Monday in his suburban Chicago home from bile duct
cancer was immense. His body seemed to have been sculpted by the
gods and, even more, Payton's spirit never allowed him to quit.
Monday, body and spirit and sweetness and light gave out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best football player I've ever seen,'' said Mike
Ditka, who coached Payton and the Bears to their Super Bowl rout of
the Patriots in 1986. ``He was also probably one of the best people
I've ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   So say they all.
</P>
<P>
   No more so than in how Payton died. Payton, his sculpted body
now shockingly frail and gaunt, disclosed in February that he was
suffering from primary sclerosing cholangitis, an extraordinarily
rare (only 3 in 100,000) liver disease that could be cured only by
a liver transplant. When Payton disclosed his disease, he was the
12,136th in line for a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Mickey Mantle, who jumped over thousands to receive a
liver transplant two days after his diagnosis was publicized,
Payton never attempted such a celebrity leap.
</P>
<P>
   He would travel to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for
treatment, patiently waiting his turn as truck driver or child,
nurse or student, waitress or policeman received the death-to-life
transplant. It was thought Payton had two years to live and wait
for a new liver; in fact, he lived less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he had a previous life,'' Payton's brother Eddie once
said. ``He must be the reincarnation of a great white shark. If he
stops moving forward, he will die.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially on the football field. In the last half-century, only
Brown, Gale Sayers (another Chicago Bear, but one whose career was
cut short by injury), O.J. Simpson, and Barry Sanders could be
called in the same class of back as Payton. Yet, Payton so rarely
got the attention he deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Running back after running back in 1970s and 1980s _ his peers _
got the attention even as they came and went. While Payton stayed.
Duane Thomas, Chuck Muncie, Earl Campbell, Franco Harris, Tony
Dorsett, Billy Sims, Joe Cribbs, Curt Warner, Eric Dickerson, and
the rest of them; Dorsett was shiftier, Campbell was stronger,
Harris was more of a pile-driver, Sims was more complete.
</P>
<P>
   Hah! Payton, along with his running, threw a slew of
halfback-option passes, many for TDs, once even finding Brian
Bashnagel on his second read when Payton's primary receiver was
covered. The Bears at the time had many a sorry quarterback who
could not get past his first read when dropping back to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Bears safety Gary Fencik said: ``Walter does things a little kid
does.'' Or, as defensive teammate Dan Hampton said: ``Walter plays
with the enthusiasm of a 10th grader. You see a lot of players who
are jaded on the job, and he's still trying to be the best tailback
on the 10th-grade team.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton may have been Sweetness, but the Bears were sour for much
of Payton's first decade in Chicago. That the Bears were so putrid
made Payton's records all the more remarkable. That the Bears so
often were losers made Payton's fighting for the extra yard and his
unwillingness to miss a play or sit out a game even more so.
</P>
<P>
   Two memories stand out. In January 1985, as the Bears were on
the rise under Ditka, Chicago traveled out to San Francisco to play
the Joe Montana 49ers in an NFC playoff game. The 49ers were good
and the Bears were not, Chicago losing, 23-0. But, on the game's
last play, Chicago QB Steve Fuller handed off to Payton and he
gained 17 yards even though there was no need for extra effort,
23-0 being 23-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do,'' Payton said
at the time, leaving his locker two or three times to head for the
trainer's room. Where he cried and cried. ``It took me 10 years to
get this close (to the Super Bowl). I don't know if it'll take
another 10 years to get this close again.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it took only a year. The next January, the circus that was
the Chicago Bears, the circus with the traveling egos of Ditka,
defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan, QB Jim McMahon, and defensive
lineman William ``The Refrigerator'' Perry had crushed the NFC,
primarily because the Chicago Bears played defense for that one
season as well as or better than any team had played defense.
Chicago awaited the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   On Payton's first carry of the Super Bowl, the Patriots stripped
the ball and recovered deep in Chicago territory, raising the
falsest of hopes in New England fans. Some 46 points later, Patriot
fans and players were well humbled, and the Bears had their Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But Payton, as he had been all that season with the antics of
Ditka, Ryan, McMahon, and the strong defense, was virtually
unnoticed in the Super Bowl. Even worse, when the Bears had the
ball on the New England 1-yard line, Ditka chose to give the ball
to his pet creation _ the Refrigerator _ as the goal line closer.
</P>
<P>
   Perry steamrolled for the TD.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, who had done more for the Chicago Bears than any of the
clowns, never scored a TD in his one and only Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hurt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka later apologized to Payton.

   ACCRED: Day II of the federal district court hearing to
determine whether the state's move to unaccredit the Kansas City
School District stands. If the district fails in its quest to block
the state's action, the district will file an appeal in Jackson
County Circuit Court and possibly other legal action. U.S. District
Judge Dean Whipple could decide he has no standing in the case
because the state is no longer a party to the deseg case or he
could restore the state as a defendant in the case on the grounds
that a decision to withdraw accreditation could lead to a more
segregated school district. That could force the state to
compromise with the district. Photo. Phil O'Connor.

NATION'S PUBLIC BUILDINGS ARE TURNING INTO ARMED CAMPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Jack Ryan, retired public servant and prominent
citizen of Albany County, went to the county courthouse the other
day. He'd moved. He needed to get his new address on some records.
</P>
<P>
   To get into the courthouse, Jack Ryan had to pass through a
metal detector. He had to empty his pockets. He found himself eyed
carefully by wary guys in uniforms and packing heat on their hips,
just in case Jack Ryan was really Carlos the Jackal.
</P>
<P>
   The whole experience amazed him, Jack Ryan said, because he'd
worked for the State Office of General Services, doing estimating
on electrical contracting jobs. He'd been in and out of New York's
70 prisons for years. It was actually less hassle to get into a
prison, Jack Ryan said, that it was getting into the Albany County
courthouse the other day.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, though, that the Albany County courthouse is the
last one in the Albany metro area to be converted into a fortress
manned by armed guards and protected by sophisticated electronic
gear.
</P>
<P>
   Try to get into the federal courthouse in Albany or into Albany
Police Court or into any of the four county courthouses in nearby
Albany suburbs. It's the same drill everywhere. It's like going to
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, our public buildings are becoming places where citizens
can enter only at serious inconvenience and only under the
suspicious gaze of cops with guns. It's the same thing at New
York's state Capitol building.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing George Pataki did when he took office as
governor was to close off a huge portion of the building's second
floor and to position a big squad of cops at the entrance to keep
the public away. You can no longer enter the state Assembly chamber
without first going through a metal detector, although the State
Senate still resists such a high level of security.
</P>
<P>
   In lower Manhattan, Mayor Rudy Giuliani has declared City Hall's
plaza, an outdoor space, off limits to the unwashed masses.
Supposedly, allowing people to gather there for political
demonstrations _ a routine practice ever since City Hall was
erected _ is now a security risk.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor makes exceptions only for events of ``extraordinary
public interest'' _ meaning, apparently, occasions on which he can
get his own mug on TV, like the celebration last week outside City
Hall for the Yankees World Series victory.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, terrorists who want to show up to take part in a
protest against Giuliani's policies are banned in advance.
Terrorists who want to bomb a Yankees victory party are an
acceptable risk that nobody can avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, political looniness is a conspicuous sign of our times.
Even though the crime rate is down, we have more people lurching
around the world and the country. A nation that contained 180
million when John F. Kennedy was elected President now contains 276
million as the last presidential election of the millennium
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   More people, more violent political psychos. It's simple math.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that our fear of head cases is slowly turning
this society into an armed camp. Is security to such a radical
extent a reasonable response even to what's clearly a legitimate
problem?
</P>
<P>
   If you think so, then ponder this: About 42,000 people in this
country were killed last year in traffic accidents. We could cut
that figure to virtually zero tomorrow. Just make every auto
passenger wear a helmet and reduce the speed limit to 10 miles per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Would that be reasonable? After all, aren't we committed to
preserving human life at all costs?
</P>
<P>
   Remember also that the number of Americans killed by terrorists
annually is only a minute fraction of those killed on the
highway.So, now, people like Jack Ryan _ honest, law-abiding
citizens who represent a threat to nobody _ can't get into any
courthouse in the Albany metro area without essentially being
frisked.That does feel, somehow, like a classic overreaction.

ELECTRIC CHAIR TOO BARBARIC FOR OUR STANDARDS OF DECENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a surprise move last week, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to
review a Florida death penalty case (Bryan vs. Moore) to determine
whether that state's use of the electric chair constitutes cruel
and unusual punishment. The late U.S. Supreme Court Justice William
Brennan suggested that electrocution was ``nothing less than the
contemporary technological equivalent of burning people at the
stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there is hope that the high court will end the use of
the electric chair as barbaric and a violation of the Eighth
Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, this court
has been deaf to the idea of ``volving standards of decency that
mark the progress of a maturing society.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, we do not boil the condemned in oil or water, nor
burn people at the stake, nor behead them on a block or at a
guillotine. Fortunately, these former methods of execution are now
considered brutal and barbaric by our modern standards of human
dignity and decency.
</P>
<P>
   There have been three botched executions in Florida since 1990
using the electric chair _ long bolts of flame have been recorded
shooting out of the headpieces and the masks covering the faces of
the inmates. In the execution that took place on July 8 using
Florida's new electric chair, blood poured out of the inmate's
mouth and nose and covered his chest before he died.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the high court rules that electrocution can no longer be
used as a means of execution, Anthony Bryan will still face the
death penalty for shooting his victim in the face with a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Only four states authorize the use of the electric chair as the
sole means of execution: Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Nebraska.
The other six states that still use the electric chair _ Arkansas,
Kentucky, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia _ also
authorize another method of execution, usually lethal injection.
The high court's ruling will undoubtedly affect all these states in
some fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court first reviewed the constitutionality of
electrocution in the Kimmler case in 1890. William Kimmler was to
be the first person to be executed in New York's electric chair. He
appealed to the Supreme Court that this sentence constituted cruel
and unusual punishment. New York had previously used hanging as its
method of execution but had found that electrocution would be ``a
less barbarous manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court wrote: ``The legislature accordingly appointed a
commission to investigate and report `the most humane and practical
method known to modern science of carrying into effect the sentence
of death in capital cases.' This commission reported in favor of
execution by electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of its decision, the high court noted about
electrocution: ``the legislature of the state of New York
determined that it did not inflict cruel and unusual punishment,
and its courts have sustained that determination. We cannot
perceive that the state has thereby abridged the privileges or
immunities of the petitioner, or deprived him of due process of
law.'' Kimmler was electrocuted, but the execution was botched and
the executioner had to throw the switch on Kimmler several times
before he died.
</P>
<P>
   The Eighth Amendment states: ``Excessive bail shall not be
required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual
punishment inflicted.'' The prohibition against cruel and unusual
punishment must mean, at least, that the infliction of unnecessary
pain or torture is forbidden by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of the death penalty, that prohibition must mean,
at least, that the condemned must not suffer a lingering, painful
death.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the electric chair, too often death is not
instantaneous but lingering and painful.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal in Glass vs.
Louisiana (1985) wherein Jimmy Glass contended that ``electrocution
causes the gratuitous infliction of unnecessary pain and
suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the high court's denial of appeal, Justice
Brennan wrote a dissent which quotes those who have witnessed
electrocutions: ``when the switch is thrown, the condemned prisoner
`cringes,' `leaps,' and `fights the straps with amazing strength.'
The hands turn red, then white, and the cords of the neck stand out
like steel bands. The prisoner's limbs, fingers, toes, and face are
severely contorted. The force of the electrical current is so
powerful that the prisoner's eyeballs sometimes pop out and `rest
on his cheeks.' The prisoner often defecates, urinates, and vomits
blood and drool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the prisoner catches on fire, particularly if he
perspires excessively. Witnesses hear a loud and sustained sound
`like bacon frying' and `the sickly sweet smell of burning flesh'
permeates the chamber. This `smell of frying human flesh in the
immediate neighborhood of the chair is sometimes bad enough to
nauseate even the Press representatives who are present.' In the
meantime, the prisoner almost literally boils. ... The body
frequently is badly burned and disfigured.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan quotes renowned French electrical scientist L.G.V. Rota,
who concluded after researching the issue: ``in every case of
electrocution ... death inevitably supervenes but it may be very
long, and above all, excruciatingly painful. ... in particular
cases, the condemned person may be alive and even conscious for
several minutes without it being possible for a doctor to say
whether the victim is dead or not. This method of execution is a
form of torture.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan calls electrocution ``death by installments'' and
illustrates his point by examples when condemned prisoners had to
be given numerous charges of electricity in order to kill them. The
execution of John Louis Evans took 14 minutes and three separate
charges of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha Otis Stephens took more than eight minutes to die. The
doctors had to wait six minutes for the body to cool to determine
that he was still alive. A second two-minute charge of electricity
was then sent through his body.
</P>
<P>
   Whether one supports capital punishment or not, the electric
chair must be seen as a morally cruel device. Certainly, our sense
of human dignity and decency demands that this mode of execution be
abandoned to the past. Let it takes its place next to the
guillotine _ in the trash heap of the Dark Ages.

A WOLF IN EARTH-TONE CLOTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Any man who'd pay a pop feminist $15,000 a month
to tell him he's a subordinate male is a hopeless case. That's what
the institution of marriage is for, Al.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper should quit worrying about depression for a few days and
start thinking about how depressing her husband is.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore wants to be president of the United States,
commander-in-chief of the world's only superpower. Yet he's paying
feminist author Naomi Wolf 15 grand a month to hear he's a beta
male, and worse than that, he's following her advice to wear earth
tones.
</P>
<P>
   A real alpha male, a leader of the pack, would wear what he damn
pleases. Jerry Brown long ago shucked earth tones for macho black
shirts with black suits. Willie Brown definitely picks out his own
clothes, the only earth tone being the green it takes to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   According to Time magazine, Wolf advised Gore that earth tones
are more ``reassuring'' to audiences, more in line with the ``good
father role model'' she thinks Gore should be. He apparently
followed her advice, switching to brown, olive green and tan.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, if you want to be an alpha male, why would you
want to look reassuring in colors from the Dockers palette?
</P>
<P>
   Sorry to pick on Wolf's sartorial advice when it's her history
as a feminist writer of a book called ``Promiscuities,'' written in
``the first-person sexual,'' that will cause Gore the most grief
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the San Francisco area. We don't care what people do
naked.
</P>
<P>
   We care about their style when dressed. Above all, we care that
they have their own style of dress, and don't have to hire someone
to lay out their socks and ties.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Wolf's first book, ``The Beauty Myth,'' was about how
women's self-images are dictated by outside forces. Now she's an
outside force dictating a self-image to Gore _ although not that
outside a force, since she's married to former White House
speechwriter David Shipley.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf also advises Gore on how to reach young people in America
and matters pertaining to American culture. This is where the sex
comes in. Earth tones are one thing, but to tell the truth, I don't
see how anyone can object to Wolf's attitude toward sex.
</P>
<P>
   She came out in favor of teenage masturbation. That's like
coming out in favor of teenage breathing. Big deal. Shades of
Joycelyn Elders.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, who grew up in the Haight in the '60s, reacted against a
kind of free love that was mainly free for men. She describes
herself as a ``third-wave feminist,'' concerned that women have to
take back their power, take charge of their own desires, their own
bodies and not let men tell them how to use them.
</P>
<P>
   What's the controversy there? Wolf wants kids to find a route
between the joyless abstinence preached by one set of politicians
and the take-some-condoms fake freedom preached by another set of
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore is smart, he won't disown Wolf the way Clinton did
Elders. This is a woman whose attitudes toward sex seem absolutely
noncontroversial to anyone who was a teenager in the days of back
seats of Impala convertibles.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf is not just a third-wave feminist, she's a third-base
feminist.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The San Francisco Examiner's Cynthia Robins
two years ago, Wolf said, ``I would like to see a return to the
petting culture,'' of going from ``first base'' to ``third base''
without ``going all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``Today, kids are having intercourse immediately. And
it is a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The only problem I have with Wolf is that she's clothing the
sheep-like Al Gore, and advising him how to be a ``good father role
model'' _ quite unlike her own hippie father described in her book.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us don't want another father. We want a president.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it may not play well with the public that Gore has
hired someone described as a ``controversial feminist'' as a
consultant. On the other hand, feminists have a different image
than they used to.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, who blasted the cosmetic industry for exploiting women's
insecurities, is drop-dead gorgeous without any make-up.
</P>
<P>
   So is Susan Faludi, who just wrote a book sympathetic to the
poor, useless ``ornamental'' American male.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary feminists don't scare either beta or alpha males as
much as they used to, and maybe it's an advantage to have one on
staff in going after the vote of both women and men.
</P>
<P>
   Faludi could do well advising some presidential candidate who
struggles with the issue of being an ornamental male, like Jesse
Ventura, Donald Trump or George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she'd probably have to arm-wrestle Gloria Steinem for
a handsome rich guy like Trump.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative anti-feminist feminist Katie Roiphe could take up
the cause of Pat Buchanan, and with any luck she'll advise him of
the evils of mental masturbation.
</P>
<P>
   Camille Paglia can tell everyone to go to hell.
</P>
<P>
   Feminist consultants can do the world of male politics a lot of
good, but please tell me they're not stuck at the level of
shopping.

THOUSANDS OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS SUFFER THROUGH LATEX ALLERGIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Dr. Robert Pringle had his first hint of a latex
allergy in the late 1980s, as he was preparing for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the OR scrubbing, when something went through the air
and I became short of breath,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Glens Falls surgeon didn't think twice about the event until
his symptoms worsened. By 1994, he was using an asthma inhaler to
ward off attacks he thought were triggered by allergies to dust,
molds and cats.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he still felt bad, even after getting rid of his family's
two cats. In the middle of surgery, he'd have to use his inhaler to
breath. In the spring of 1995, he ended up in the hospital himself
after an asthma attack almost killed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still didn't know it was latex,'' said Pringle, 52. ``This
was so uncommon.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, as many as 16 percent of all health care workers suffer
from latex allergies. ``We have what I would call an epidemic,''
said Jocelyn Celestin, head of the Allergy, Asthma and Immunology
Center at Albany Medical Center Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Long considered one of the best barriers against infectious
diseases, latex has recently become a source of disability and
illness for people sensitive to proteins found in the natural
rubber from which surgical gloves and 30,000 other products,
including condoms, are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only seeing the tip of the iceberg,'' said Dr. Michael
Holland, an occupational health expert in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Made from the sap of a tree found in Africa and Southeast Asia,
latex has been used in health care for almost 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the number of latex allergy cases has risen most
dramatically in the 12 years since the Centers for Disease Control
first mandated universal precautions _ and the widespread use of
latex gloves _ to protect against diseases such as AIDS and
hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   According to some estimates, the use of latex gloves jumped from
12 billion pairs in 1987 to more than 200 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Problems have begun to surface because, as with allergies to cat
dander, peanuts and bee stings, people who are sensitive to latex
often become more sensitive with repeated exposure, Celestin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We completely changed the way we practice medicine,'' said
Celestin. ``We have been able to say with latex allergies, more
than any other type of allergy, that it's due to excessive exposure
to the latex allergen.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why latex allergies were first widely
recognized in the early 1990s among children with spina bifida, a
neural tube disorder that prevents the spine from properly forming.
</P>
<P>
   Kids with spina bifida usually have to undergo multiple surgical
procedures at a young age. In addition, they often must rely on
catheters to help them urinate. Health experts believe such
numerous exposures at a young age to the latex, both in the gloves
and the catheters, increases the risk for latex allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Others at risk include people who work in the manufacture of
latex products, and those with a history of hay fever or food
allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern have been powdered latex gloves, the
cheapest and most plentiful source of latex in the health
profession. Although the powder, usually corn starch, isn't a
problem by itself, it serves as a vehicle to make the latex
allergen airborne, Holland said. Once inhaled, those proteins are
quickly absorbed by the body.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, most large hospitals have tried to cut down on
latex exposure for patients and employees by switching to
powder-free gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Some latex manufacturers have also taken steps to cut down the
amount of natural plant protein found in their gloves. Although
such gloves tend to be more expensive, Holland said it's cheaper
for hospitals in the long-run. ``One disability case can buy 10
years worth of powder-free gloves,'' Holland said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Pringle acknowledges that latex gloves are still the glove
of choice for most physicians, especially surgeons who need
``exquisite tactile sense'' to perform delicate operations.
</P>
<P>
   And while there are some vinyl gloves on the market, they aren't
as effective as latex at preventing transmission of infectious
pathogens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no track record like the track record for latex
gloves,'' said Pringle, who lives in Saratoga Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his allergy, Pringle was forced in 1997 to give up
his 20-year career as a surgeon. He has since returned to Glens
Falls Hospital in Albany as the new medical director, an
administrative job which doesn't require him to don gloves. He is
also pursuing a master's degree in occupational health from McGill
University in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do miss my trade,'' he said of his surgical career. ``You
spend years training for it and I was at my peak. But I'm not one
of those people who dwell in the past. I haven't felt this good in
15 years. I can breathe.''

BRADLEY'S MILITARY SERVICE SCRUTINIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the spring of 1967, having decided to return
from his Rhodes scholarship years in England and get rich playing
pro basketball for the New York Knicks, Bill Bradley confronted the
moral issue faced by most young men of his generation: the war in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's studies at Oxford University, and his undergraduate
years at Princeton, had widened his perspective and sown doubts
about the wisdom of America's intervention in Southeast Asia. But
for the only child of a bank president from small-town Missouri,
``there were powerful psychological forces in me that gave people
in authority the benefit of the doubt,'' he recalled in his 1996
autobiography, ``Time Present, Time Past.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley explored his options with typical thoroughness. Then,
with the help of the Air Force ROTC commander at Princeton, he
enlisted in the Air Force Reserve at McGuire Air Force Base in New
Jersey on April 14. It was a middle course: a selection of
relatively low risk that let him honor his military obligation
while still pursuing a career as a professional athlete.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Bradley's choice was viewed in the New York media
as a laudable accommodation of career and duty. He was a golden boy
_ an All-American Ivy Leaguer whose return to the United States was
celebrated by sports fans from the moment he stepped before the
cameras at Leone's restaurant on West 48th Street in Manhattan on
April 27 to say he had signed one of the richest sports contracts
of the era.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's scholastic and physical talents would be ``wasted'' in
the Army at any rank lower than commanding general, wrote a New
York Post sportswriter.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Daley, the well-known New York Times sports columnist,
said Bradley was a mix of Sir Galahad, ``Jack Armstrong, the
All-American boy,'' and those sublime NBA all-stars: Oscar
Robertson and Jerry West. ``During their two decades of existence,
the New York Knicks have been desperately seeking a super star,''
Daley wrote. ``At last they have one.''
</P>
<P>
   In all the hoopla, one question was not asked. If Bradley did
not go to Vietnam, then what Missouri farm boy, playground star
from Harlem, or working-class son of South Boston would be drafted
for war instead?
</P>
<P>
   Bradley served for 11 years in the Air Force Reserve: five years
more than was required by the terms of his enlistment. He fulfilled
a five-month stint of active duty with the Air Force in the summer
and fall of 1967, most of which was taken up by basic training and
officer training school in Texas, and did not report to the Knicks
until midseason. By all available evidence, and the accounts of his
surviving commanding officers, he diligently met his obligation of
one weekend of duty per month and two weeks each summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always there,'' said then-Major Donald Rosencranz, the
wing personnel officer, who recalled how Bradley would take a
red-eye flight home from the West Coast after a Friday night game
and show up for duty on Saturday morning. ``He wasn't a
water-cooler type guy. He was a professional. I know of no one who
cut him any slack whatsoever, and he never asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley declined to discuss his wartime military record with the
Globe. In the past, he has insisted that he received no special
treatment in getting his slot in the reserve.
</P>
<P>
   After a rocky initiation to the pro game, Bradley became a key
component on two world championship teams _ in 1970 and 1973 _ and
went on to a career in politics that culminated in his presidential
campaign this year. His Vietnam-era service was not an issue when
he was elected to the Senate in 1978, or in two reelection
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   It was only in 1988, when Indiana Senator Dan Quayle was
selected as the Republican vice presidential candidate and
unmercifully grilled about his own Vietnam-era service in the
National Guard, that the query _ What did you do in the war? _
began to be asked of baby boom politicians, at times by members of
that generation who felt guilty about their own evasion of service.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam emerged as a crucible of character. Because it was not a
``good war'' like World War II _ a clear-cut reply to attacks by
fascist dictators _ the war gave young men moral choices, which
they made in varied, sometimes controversial, and often revealing
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton opposed the war, helped organize protests, worked
on the antiwar presidential campaign of Senator George McGovern in
1972 and was vilified by his critics as a draft dodger. John McCain
took up the mandate of his military family, flew bombing missions
over North Vietnam, then courageously endured torture and
imprisonment after his jet was shot down. Al Gore, a devoted son,
failed to help his embattled father, a dovish US senator from the
Volunteer State of Tennessee, by enlisting and serving in the Army
in Vietnam. George W. Bush, with a good word from family friends,
got training as a fighter pilot in the Air Force Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle believes that the parsing of candidates' military service
records is an empty exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``So in other words, you're going to say that if you didn't
participate in Vietnam, that you're not qualified to be president?
That's just ridiculous,'' Quayle said, in one hot exchange with a
TV host in August. ``Are you going to say that because Al Gore went
to Vietnam, that he's more qualified than Bill Bradley? Come on.
Give me a break. Move on. This is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   But some, recalling what Quayle faced in 1988, think Bradley
should be put to the same rough test. ``At best he was a famous
All-America basketball player applying for the reserves at an air
base just 21 miles from where he won his fame,'' wrote Paul
Mulshine, a columnist for the Newark Star-Ledger, last spring.
``Perhaps he would have gotten the same treatment if his name had
been Joe Blow, but it's unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To understand Bradley's response to the war in Vietnam, one must
start with his upbringing in Crystal City, Mo. He had a
conventional, 1950s childhood as the only son of the town's bank
president, a dignified Midwest Republican who was 43 when Bill was
born.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was raised in a community where the paramount values
were patriotism, politeness, respect for one's elders, hard work,
and humility. In addition to the fanatic discipline he showed in
the long hours spent honing his basketball skills, he had an
abiding interest in politics. He turned down 75 offers of athletic
scholarships to attend Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley traveled the world with the Princeton team, played in
the Olympics in 1964 and served as a college intern for a
Republican US senator and in the presidential campaign of GOP
Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania that year. He supported
the Vietnam War, and Princeton, in his college years of 1961
through 1965, was no hotbed of antiwar activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty sleepy campus,'' recalled Princeton teammate
Rick Wright. ``You had lots of people interested in public policy:
the Berlin wall, space, civil rights.'' There were a few all-night
bull sessions that touched upon the draft and Southeast Asia, said
Wright, ``but the anti-Vietnam stuff hadn't started at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in his early 20s, Bradley had political ambition. And in
those Princeton bull sessions it was conventional wisdom ``that if
you ever wanted to enter elective politics _ as it appeared a third
of the senior class contemplated _ then you had to be a veteran,
preferably a decorated veteran,'' he recalled in his autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   After Bradley took Princeton to the NCAA Final Four in 1965, the
Knicks made him the first pick in the NBA draft that year. They did
so, said former Knicks coach Dick McGuire, despite the fact that
Bradley would spend two years at Oxford and had offered no
assurance he would ever play pro basketball.
</P>
<P>
   It was well worth the risk. ``He was the best player in the
country,'' McGuire recalled. ``And one of the best attractions in
the world: being from Princeton, Oxford and a very good ballplayer.
He was a great attraction with the upper-income people.''
</P>
<P>
   His Selective Service records show that Bradley had a ``2-S''
student deferment throughout his years at Princeton and Oxford, a
classification he shared with millions of other US college
students. While at Oxford, Bradley played some professional
basketball with an Italian team and traveled throughout Europe, the
Soviet Union and the Middle East. He was not an early foe of the
war and would not declare his opposition until 1968. When British
critics complained about the war, Bradley defend his country's
actions. But with some of his fellow Americans at Oxford, he began
to wonder if the war was not a moral and strategic mistake.

   TAKE-BOS  
 WASHINGTON: ... strategic mistake.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After feeling the pressures of fame at Princeton, Bradley at
first cherished the anonymity of Oxford and even flirted with the
notion of abandoning basketball. His love for the game was
rekindled in his final year abroad, and he decided that he wanted
to play professionally, and cash in on his talent and celebrity,
while he could. Now personal factors began to dominate his thoughts
about the war. He had already cut short his career by two years by
taking the Rhodes scholarship, while military service carried with
it the risk of maiming or death, in training or in combat.
</P>
<P>
   In the early spring of 1967, Bradley called Major Stanley M.
Adelson, who ran the Air Force ROTC program at Princeton and was a
friend and neighbor of Bradley's college coach. ``I outlined the
options and the one I recommended,'' Adelson recalled. ``I
suggested that we look into him getting into the Air Force
Reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Adelson was a basketball fan who had attended Princeton road
games, knew Bradley well, and served as an informal adviser on the
military and the draft to the college's athletes and other
students. ``While Bill was still at Oxford I called McGuire Air
Force base to see if they had openings,'' said Adelson. ``As it
happened, they did.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was both fortunate and favored in landing a slot in the
Air Force Reserve _ but far from alone in escaping the danger of
combat.
</P>
<P>
   All told, there were some 27 million draft-aged men in the
Vietnam era, of whom 11 million served in some branch of the
military, 2 million went to Vietnam, roughly 400,000 were in
front-line combat units, about 150,000 were wounded, and some
60,000 died.
</P>
<P>
   Though reservists were activated for the Korean War and the
Persian Gulf War, comparatively few reservists and National Guard
members _ only 15,000 _ were sent to Vietnam, thus insulating the
middle class from the costs of war.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam war was a war fought largely by the working class.
Former Navy Secretary James Webb, a Vietnam veteran, found in
postwar research that of the 29,071 men who attended Harvard
University, MIT, and Princeton from 1962 through 1972, just 20 were
killed in action in Vietnam, a total exceeded by South Boston High
School alone, with one-10th the students. (Among the 8,108 of the
Princeton students in Webb's survey, six died in combat.)
</P>
<P>
   Bradley applied to the Air Force reserve at a sensitive time.
The reserves had become a haven for professional athletes, and
there was grumbling on Capitol Hill and elsewhere that the pro
football, basketball, and football teams were pulling strings or
dazzling reserve commanders with the fame of celebrity athletes to
get their players to the top of waiting lists. A Pentagon study in
the spring of 1967 found 360 pro players in the reserves and
National Guard. Red Sox pitcher Jim Lonborg, New York Mets pitchers
Tom Seaver and Nolan Ryan, and Knicks star Cazzie Russell were on
the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have a situation where people are complaining about
the unfairness of the draft _ that it takes more poor boys than
rich boys,'' said Representative Lucien Nedzi of Michigan, a
Democrat who served on the House Armed Service Committee.
Meanwhile, ``you have athletes getting preferred treatment that
undermines public confidence in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1966, Deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance wrote
to a congressional committee to announce a Pentagon directive to
address the situation. Vacancies in the reserves would be filled on
a first-come, first-serve basis, Vance said. ``Exceptions may be
made when, in the best judgment of those responsible for the
procurement of reserve personnel, the individual's prior military
service or significant civilian experience in the occupational
skill concerned is considered to warrant it,'' said Vance.
</P>
<P>
   The Army, Navy, and Air Force reserves were a popular option for
young men as the draft calls peaked in the late 1960s. The reserves
were oversubscribed in 1967, and the Army alone had a backlog of
130,000 potential recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Individual units, however, at times had vacancies in their ranks
as personnel with special skills like pilots, mechanics, and
doctors were transferred around the country or left the service.
</P>
<P>
   Adelson had just completed his own service in a reserve unit,
and knew the ins and outs of the system. ``I happened to know
something about the administration of the reserves at that time,''
he recalled. ``Bill was fortunate that he had somebody around . . .
that knew something about it and was able to give him counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``as a major, I can assure you that the amount of influence
I had was at best negligible,'' Adelson said. ``I did not know the
commander of the reserve unit. I knew no one in that unit.''
</P>
<P>
   When he phoned officers at McGuire Air Force Base in 1967,
Adleson said, he did not use Bradley's name but rather asked if
they could not find room for a ``very top flight'' Princeton
graduate for officer training school. When the reserve officers
told Adelson that they might welcome such a candidate, he alerted
Bradley, who applied and scored ``well into the 95th percentile''
on the recruitment tests, said Adelson.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force reserve was then operating under a quota system,
Adelson said, and the 514th Air Mobility Wing at McGuire had to get
approval from the Air Force Reserve headquarters to fill an
opening. ``They had to select a person and then get the quota,''
Adelson recalled. But ``if an organization has got a candidate that
did very well at Princeton and is a Rhodes Scholar and a well-known
athlete, he is going to do well.'' Bradley was accepted and sworn
in on April 14.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at McGuire Air Force base cannot confirm Adelson's
recollections. But a preliminary search by Air Force personnel has
unearthed unit histories that do show some vacancies in the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 514th was having recruitment problems,'' said Captain
David Kurle, a spokesman for the Air Force Reserve Command, and
``was particularly undermanned in the late 1960s.'' Its manpower
demands were high enough that the reserve wing at McGuire launched
public recruiting campaigns throughout New Jersey in the late
1960s, advertising on dozens of billboards and thousands of milk
cartons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we definitively say there was no waiting list? No. But it
puts doubts in my mind that he received preferential treatment,''
said Christie Dragan, the chief of public affairs for the 514th.
The commanding officer at the time is dead, but four of Bradley's
superior officers from the 514th Wing said Bradley received no
special breaks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's return to the Knicks was an electrifying jolt for the
team, and the league as a whole. The Times put the news of his
$500,000, four-year contract on its front page.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an exciting piece of merchandise,'' said Leonard Lewin,
a New York sportswriter and Knicks public relations executive, who
said Bradley increased attendance at Knicks games.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire, the Knicks coach at the time, said the team's
management sometimes helped its prize players find reserve or
National Guard openings in the Vietnam era, but that he had no
memory of the team helping Bradley. Marty Glickman, who was one of
Bradley's agents in 1967, said the ballplayer handled the
enlistment by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's first game, on Dec. 9, was sold out. He played 20
minutes and scored just 8 points, about what he would average in
his first year with the team, but was cheered every time he touched
the ball. The game took place on a Saturday night, and Bradley took
the bus from McGuire to New York, and then returned to the base for
Sunday duty.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's rough start in the league ``was my fault,'' said
McGuire. ``I played him as a guard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks changed coaches and Bradley moved to the small
forward position. There Bradley blossomed, and the Knicks won their
first championship in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   He was a superstar. As the Knicks visited each NBA city, the
team called a press conference to handle inquiries from the media.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Bradley's question session with reporters was
interrupted by the widow of a Princeton classmate who had been
killed in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``His wife, whom I had met twice, had read in the newspaper that
I was in town. She wanted to talk with somebody since things were
tough for her just then,'' Bradley wrote. ``There was not much to
say.''

A NEW WAY TO PLOT YOUR COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I plan a vacation, I like to do the legwork myself. Maps,
guidebooks, and brochures lay lie ankle-deep on the floor.
Libraries are scoured. Friends are besieged.
</P>
<P>
   One way to avoid all that, of course, is to use a travel agent.
But why would a control freak relinquish control? Another way
around the hassle, I've been thinking lately, is to use a
trip-planning computer software program, the kind whose packaging
promises to make pre-vacation life easier. But can such tripware
really take the place of all that work and clutter?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, I tried three well-known travel-planning programs.
I used each of them to plan a specific trip I'd already plotted the
old-fashioned way, with printed road maps and AAA TourBooks: a
1,600-mile drive with my wife and 12-year-old son from Seattle to
San Diego. The trip would last 15 days and would include stopovers
and sightseeing in seven other locales, including San Francisco and
Los Angeles. We would need routing, hotels, road food, and
suggestions for things to do.
</P>
<P>
   Would mouse-clicking beat the paper chase? I fired up the
ignition on my computer, so to speak, and set off along the digital
highway. All three programs have the ability to combine the use of
a laptop computer with a Global Positioning System, or GPS, and two
of them are able to transfer information to a designated type of
palm computing device. But my goal was to use them for the major
purpose for which they were designed: planning a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I found, with ratings based on a five-star scale _
one star for the lowest and five for the highest:
</P>
<P>
   AAA Map `n' Go 5.0 (for Windows 95/98 or Windows NT 4.0 or
later). Street price: $29.00. Delorme.

   David DeLorme began as a mapmaker in Maine nearly 25 years ago.
Today his company, located in Yarmouth, Mass., produces atlases,
navigation devices, and mapping software. Map `n' Go 5.0, released
in April, uses some 66,000 AAA TourBook listings covering the
United States, Mexico, Canada, and the Caribbean. In other words,
it's an elaborate digital version of the material I'd originally
used to plan my trip.
</P>
<P>
   After viewing a ``Test Drive'' segment, which took me down the
highway much too quickly, I was on my own. By selecting origin and
destination points, stops along the way, and specific routes, I was
able to produce a 1,566-mile itinerary, complete with driving
directions. This report also told me I should expect to spend
precisely 33 hours and 36 minutes on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The AAA descriptions and ratings are Map `N' Go's strength. I
was presented with descriptions of _ yipes! _ 1,799 selected
lodgings, restaurants, and attractions to be found along the way, a
list that would have been longer had I not been able to specify
budget considerations and other criteria in my ``personal user''
profile. When I finished my planning work _ the whole process took
about three hours _ Map `n' Go printed my directions on two pages.
It then printed details on my selected hotels and other stops, such
as the Monterey Aquarium and the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, in a
separate nine-page report. And I was able to print highlighted
route maps. Now all I had to do was get on the telephone and start
making reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Map `n' Go has some other useful features, including
descriptions of particularly scenic drives and an Internet
connection to related Web sites. (I was mysteriously unable to
download the updated construction and weather reports, however.)
But it's a program that requires a bit of practice. And 1,799
listings of potential stops is nice, but it's also enough to make
me pull over to the side of the digital highway for a rest.

<P>
   This elaborately-packaged three-CD-ROM set, released in April,
puts a heavy emphasis on national and state parklands. Its thorough
guidebook section features basic information on more than 300 of
the former and 500 of the latter. But TPP2000, which covers the
United States and Canada, is still mostly about driving from here
to there _ or from Seattle to San Diego in my case.
</P>
<P>
   It's a somewhat dense program, but it's made easier by a 56-page
print manual. I initially planned my journey with the aid of an
on-screen Trip Wizard, then did it again solo. Both came to the
same conclusion in their six-page printed itineraries with driving
instructions: 1,473.7 miles, 28:22 hours of motoring, and $3,193.73
in expenses based on my spending inclinations. (The different
programs came up with slightly different calculations for my trip
because each uses a somewhat different method. This one, for
instance, didn't include mileage to hotels, but only to the cities
and towns where those hotels are located.)
</P>
<P>
   TPP2000 offered an almost overwhelming choice of lodging,
restaurants, and other attractions for me to add to my itinerary _
931 alone within 10 miles of Seattle. But many of these entries
didn't include anything besides name, address, and telephone
number, although there were a number of Frommer descriptions, and
several hotels and restaurants were rated by an undisclosed source.
Mapping was sophisticated if a bit difficult to master, with
excellent zoom capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The program doesn't include maps by default in its printed
reports. I had to select and print them separately. That's annoying
at first, but allows for customization. The program also didn't
place the addresses of selected hotels and other attractions in my
printed itinerary, although I was able to add them on separate
printouts as ``comments.''
</P>
<P>
   Extras? The comprehensive guidebook is very helpful, and the
connection to the program's Web site provides generally good links
to weather and highway updates. However, the separate multimedia
disk of presentations of 27 attractions is flashy but superfluous,
and there's no capability to connect to a palm computer. But
there's a separate Street Locator disk that supposedly contains
every street in the United States. Alas, it's still in its case.
Maybe next time.

<P>
   Rand McNally, the atlas folks, released this latest version of
their trip-planning software _ the more elaborate of two existing
packages _ in September. Not surprisingly, the printed reports it
generates contain page references to the company's standard print
atlases. That's nice for us drivers who like to have a detailed map
in our hands.
</P>
<P>
   TripMaker Deluxe is fairly easy to learn and has a reasonably
friendly interface. There's a brief show-and-tell introduction, and
a batch of five printable text-and-graphics ``tutors.'' Like the
other packages, it required me to provide simple information in
order to do its work: origin, destination, stops along the way, and
routing preferences. It covers North America and uses Mobil Travel
Guide ratings for many of its restaurants and lodging facilities.
Its specifics are very good: It allowed me to inject such personal
preferences as travel dates, length of driving breaks, and favorite
brand of gas _ the latter so it could choose my exits to suit my
needs. It also calculated my trip cost ($3,552.86) based on my
spending preferences and limits.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed report I eventually printed after about three hours
told me to expect to drive 1,857 miles and spend 37 hours and 41
minutes behind the wheel. It went on (and on) for 24 pages, and
included routing, mileage, driving times, maps, and those atlas
references. TripMaker's zoom capability for maps is quite good,
although, like the mapping functions in the other programs, it
takes practice to master.
</P>
<P>
   There were a couple of annoyances, however. For one, the program
allowed me to laboriously add only one new stopover at a time to my
itinerary, rather than several. And the number of listings it
offered for accommodations and attractions seemed slim. Where's
that Oregon Shakespeare Festival?
</P>
<P>
   TripMaker connects to Rand McNally's Web site, and getting
on-line information related to hotels and other stopovers is easy.
The program's RoadSense feature alerted me to no fewer than 48
construction sites and other potential delays on my trip and added
them to my report. I'll be watching for that 22 miles of roadwork
on Route 29 near Calistoga, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK, end of the road: Would I replace my guidebooks, road maps,
and brochures with one of these programs? Unlikely. Especially my
maps. After all, I might still get lost despite the detailed texts
that trip-planning programs provide. And the maps that these
programs create, despite zoom capabilities, simply aren't as clear
and helpful as the unwieldy ones I'm used to.
</P>
<P>
   But having one of the packages on my PC would definitely help
the often-complex vacation-organizing process. It's simply a matter
of using it with all those traditional sources that still come up
to my ankles, not in place of them.

 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He had been here for nearly an hour, sitting next to a
window in his office but talking as if he were watching the world
from a chair on his front porch.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned his love for his hero, Vince Lombardi. He explained
why he believes Sports Illustrated is ``shallow'' and why he will
never talk to anyone from the magazine again. He said the old TV
show ``Hawaii Five-O'' made his first job, at the University of
Hawaii, even more attractive. He spoke of losing Ron Mercer and
eventually said, ``It's very, very difficult being an executive in
this organization.''
</P>
<P>
   But the words that best define what Rick Pitino now faces were
spoken near the bottom of the hour. He knows the Celtics must make
the playoffs this season. Must. If they don't, something about the
views in this suburban office, perched above a parquet floor, will
change. Either Pitino will not be able to look out the window and
see Antoine Walker working out, or Walker will not be able to look
up and see the coach, inches away from a glittering NCAA
championship trophy, frantically talking about basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The team begins Pitino's third season and Walker's fourth in
Toronto. The coach knows it could be their last season together.
Walker isn't so sure. After a strained summer, the men recently
shared some of their frustration with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Walker told the coach he didn't like having his name linked to
trade rumors or weight problems. Pitino listened and then had some
comments of his own. He repeated them as he sat at his office
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `You're going into your fourth season. If we don't
make the playoffs, you think Paul Gaston is going to be happy?' ''
Pitino said. ``And then I told him: `Antoine, if I don't make the
playoffs in the following season _ my fourth _ where do you think
Rick Pitino is going to be? So let's face reality. We're both being
paid a lot of money to produce. If you don't produce as the
highest-paid player and I don't produce as the high-paid coach, we
both know we're going to be out of jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point the coach is interrupted. Out of jobs? Does he
want to say that? He will have $29 million remaining on his
contract after this season. Walker's contract averages $12 million
a year over the next six seasons. Even Pitino acknowledged to
Walker that he was ``nearly untradeable'' last summer because of
his contract. If Walker is untradeable, does that not make Pitino
unfireable?
</P>
<P>
   ``That urgency and pressure is necessary for me to get this team
ready,'' the coach said. ``You have to think that way. You have to
think you're under the gun. If you think, `My contract is too long,
so they won't . . .,' you're a survivor, not a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker was asked about that urgency. He was asked if he thinks
about things changing if the team doesn't make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm young,'' he said. ``I'm 23 years old, man. I'm not worried
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino wants to be the coach that his hero was. He said his
hero's mix of discipline and compassion would be successful even
today. What he didn't say is that his hero would have hated this.
There are clear differences of opinion between Pitino and Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino on Walker's weight: ``By Dec. 1, he'll be in the shape we
need him to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker on his weight: ``I'm not talking about my weight. I play
basketball. My weight ain't never been a problem. What, is that an
excuse or something? I'm not even going to answer that. That is
(Pitino's) own personal thing.''
</P>
<P>
   They have to shorten the differences and make things work on the
court. More than that, they must make it work. Must. If they don't
make the playoffs, somebody will leave. Will it be Pitino?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I would never walk away,'' he said. ``That's just not me.
No, I would never walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino has coached for 26 seasons, making his living as a man
who is willing to travel to the site of a basketball wreck, piece
the discarded parts together, and drive it to the brink of a title.
He got Boston University to the NCAA tournament. He took Providence
College to the Final Four. He took the New York Knicks to the top
of the Atlantic Division. He won a title at the University of
Kentucky. He got the Celtics to . . . play hard?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was paying attention when he predicted the team would
make the playoffs this season. No team of his has ever failed to
make the playoffs in Year 2 and, he said, ``In my estimation, this
is my second year. I'll take full responsibility for last year, but
I am not, in my mind, going to consider that our second year.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happens if this season does not result in the playoffs?
The coach smiles before he gives this answer:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I guess you'll have to go back to my track record
because that has never happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pitino also hasn't had a boss like Gaston since the late 1980s.
That is, he hasn't had a boss who has constantly reminded him of
limitations. Gaston has done that with the team's finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd all like to be the New York Knicks, or New Jersey Nets,
or Miami Heat,'' said Pitino. ``We would all like to have
millionaire owners where you just spend as much as you want. Some
teams have it and some teams don't. That's a fact of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics don't have it. That is part of the reason Pitino
said life is difficult as a Celtics executive. Gaston could argue
that no one told Pitino to commit a combined $56 million to
marginal free agents Travis Knight and Chris Mills. Or to let David
Wesley walk when he could have been had for about $3 million.
Instead, Pitino drafted Chauncey Billups and eventually replaced
him with Kenny Anderson, who is on the Celtics' books until 2003 _
for twice as much money as it would have taken to sign Wesley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally understand where Paul Gaston is coming from.
Totally,'' said Pitino. ``He is not in this business to lose money.
If he was a billionaire, maybe he would be in the business to lose.
But he's not, so he runs it like a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Money also affected the makeup of this season's team. Paul
Pierce will be at shooting guard, taking the place of Mercer.
Pitino said he is friendly with the guard (now in Denver), and
Mercer agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wasn't going to be a Celtic as early as May (3), when
we were playing in New York,'' Mercer said last week. ``We had a
talk about the budget and Coach said what he had to offer me. I
don't think it was any secret that I was going to be traded. I
didn't know it was going to be Denver, but I respect Coach for not
putting me in a position where I would be shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   These are surprising words coming from Mercer, who seemed to be
in the circle of people who had problems with Pitino in the
offseason. The coach and Walker clashed. Larry Bird said that
Pitino asked him to be an assistant coach before Bird left town
(Pitino denies this). Chauncey Billups called him ``cold.''
Mercer's former agent, Tevester Scott, accused him of telling
Mercer he had a contract extension with the Nuggets, when in fact
the Nuggets hadn't planned such a deal (Mercer is now represented
by Edward Hawkins of No Limit Sports).
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a problem with Coach,'' Mercer said. ``The fact is
that I respect him.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is one of the elements in Pitino's favor this year:
He is always at the center of something unpredictable. He was
surprised three years ago when an illustration in Sports
Illustrated, in his opinion, ``was not only sexist in nature but
made me look like I was possessed from the devil. They had an
illustration of my wife tied to a backboard, looking like Joan of
Arc. I was dragging her from job to job. Tied to a backboard! I
took that as an affront to what I am all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said he asked the magazine editors to apologize, but no
one did, ``and I said, `Screw you. You'll never talk to me again.'
It would be easy to apologize, but they are too shallow for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Pitino's history of being close to surprises will
translate to the court; perhaps his tragically soft defensive team
will suddenly be able to rebound and defend at an exceptional
level. Maybe he and Walker will continue to get along. Maybe he
will talk to a reporter from SI. Maybe he will be more like his
hero, who was so good that he not only has a trophy named after him
but also a street and turnpike exit.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Pitino pulled his veterans aside and asked them,
``Aren't you guys tired of getting your ass kicked in?'' He was
talking about their absence from the playoffs. If things go the way
the coach thinks, the question will be irrelevant.

IN TRIBE, AN EXPLORATION OF HIP-HOP'S POTENTIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Tribe Called Quest never moved units like Biggie, never ripped
headlines like Tupac, or claimed ghetto fabulousness like Puffy.
They never had their own clothing line like the Wu-Tang Clan, never
had the longevity of the Beastie Boys, or had their rhymes chanted
at sporting events like Naughty By Nature.
</P>
<P>
   All this remarkable Queens, N.Y., trio did during their
all-too-brief life was become one of the best groups of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Recognize that I did not say one of the best hip-hop groups of
the '90s, although the members of the Tribe _ Q-Tip, Phife, and Ali
_ would certainly qualify as such. But greatness should not and
cannot be shackled by genre nor by the ways some seek to ghettoize
and minimize certain types of music. Hence, A Tribe Called Quest
should simply be remembered as one of the great groups of the
decade: as influential as Nirvana, as innovative as Nine Inch
Nails.
</P>
<P>
   What made Tribe so astonishing is recalled with last week's
release of ``The Anthology,'' an 19-song coda for the group which
disbanded late last year. It includes ``Vivrant Thing,'' Q-Tip's
too-funky-for-words solo hit, but everything else is pure Tribe _
from ``Bonita Applebum'' to ``Award Tour,'' from ``Can I Kick It?''
to ``Find A Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the group called it quits in August 1998 _ disenchantment
with the music industry was the official line _ they produced five
albums which gave the hip-hop nation something to think about
beyond misogyny and mindless gangsta poses. Tribe came along as
hip-hop was wrapping up its first decade, and proving itself more
than a passing fad. They were disciples of the Native Tongues, an
Afrocentric cabal of New York groups, including De La Soul and the
Jungle Brothers, which expoused the far-reaching musical and
cultural possibilities of hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe's 1990 debut, ``People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths
of Rhythm,'' arrived a year after N.W.A.'s ``Straight Outta
Compton,'' and it was as fresh and astonishing as a rainbow after a
storm. Like De La Soul, Tribe understood the wonders of hip-hop
beyond scratches, braggadocio, and played-out samples. They delved
into '70s rock, borrowing the bassline of Lou Reed's ``Walk on the
Wild Side'' for ``Can I Kick It'' and anchored ``I Left My Wallet
in El Segundo'' with the Chambers Brothers' ``Let's Get Funky.''
</P>
<P>
   The album was sexy but smart, challenging but fun, with
whipsmart wordplay about such subjects as the dangers of
cholesterol in ``Ham `n' Eggs'' or a certain brown billfold lost in
some South-of-the-Border dive. Their debut hinted at the jazzy
delights which would blossom on their follow-up, ``The Low End
Theory,'' still considered by many to be the greatest hip-hop album
ever. It was essentially a fusion album of jazz and rap, a
``Bitches Brew'' for the hip-hop nation. From ``Jazz (We Got)'' to
``Check the Rhime'', it sounded like the album Miles Davis might
have made if he'd wrapped his hands around a microphone instead of
a trumpet. This was music which could cold-rock a party, then
settle in for a set at the Village Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew people were sampling jazz musicians, but Q-Tip actually
knew who Charles Mingus was,'' Ron Carter, the acclaimed jazz
bassist, told Spin magazine. Carter, who has worked with such
luminaries as Davis and McCoy Tyner, played on ``The Low End
Theory'' cut, ``Verses from the Abstract.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tribe had a sense of what the music could mean,'' Carter said,
``and they were using it to make their poetry do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Spin included ``The Low End Theory'' on its recent ``90 Greatest
Albums of the '90s'' list, ranking Tribe's sophomore effort higher
than Metallica's so-called ``Black Album,'' Pearl Jam's ``Ten,''
R.E.M.'s ``Automatic for the People,'' and Neil Young's ``Ragged
Glory.'' Considering the album's influence, Chris Norris wrote that
it blazed ``a trail for enlightened, unapologetically musical
hip-hop from the Roots to the Fugees _ funky, raw, smart without
being soft, and full of banging possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Three more albums would follow _ ``Midnight Marauders'' (1993);
``Beats, Rhymes, and Life'' (1996); and their ``The Love Movement''
(1998). If they weren't as inspiring or relevatory, they were still
better than most of what was clogging the airwaves. Always, Tribe
wanted to do something different, to open the world to hip-hop, and
to open hip-hop to the rest of the world. With what Q-Tip called
``ill beats for the heads and all that,'' they broadened the scope
of their music, much the way Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, in
the 1940s, introduced be-bop and changed jazz forever.
</P>
<P>
   While others were content to tread the same well-worn path,
Tribe fearlessly walked their own walk, talked their own talk, and
never bowed to caprice or fashion. A lament to what's been lost and
a celebration of a lasting legacy, ``The Anthology,'' reminds all
why A Tribe Called Quest was, and always will be, a tribe apart.

HONG KONG HOPES DISNEY PARK CAN INVIGORATE ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Hong Kong has long been the destination where
Occident meets Orient, where chopsticks sit alongside English tea
and scones. But can it also be the place where Mickey Mouse meets
Chairman Mao?
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong government and Walt Disney Co. were to announce a
deal this week to build the first Disney theme park in China, here
in the former British colony that was returned to Chinese rule two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal goes through after months of intense and secret
negotiations, it could be a boon for both sides. Disney, famous for
bargaining ruthlessly for tax breaks and incentives, is expected to
win a multibillion-dollar land deal and access to the disposable
income of a growing mainland Chinese middle class hungry for US
culture and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong, meanwhile, is desperate for an economic boost after
two years of recession and rising unemployment brought on by the
Asian financial crisis. Government and tourism officials say a
Disney park would create jobs, restore confidence to a public
starved for good news, and reverse a severe downturn in tourism
that followed Hong Kong's handover to China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most of all, Hong Kong _ long dependent on its
East-meets-West mystique as a British enclave next to communist
China _ is struggling to reinvent itself, to create a post-colonial
identity separate from its former masters and its new ones. Hong
Kong is more than ever the key gateway for Westerners who want to
understand the culture of a rising superpower and penetrate the
market of the world's most-populous nation _ and for mainland
Chinese who want the same access to the West.
</P>
<P>
   But the dilemma facing the residents of Hong Kong is, plainly
stated, ``How do we face the reality of being a city in China, but
also an international city?'' said Ian Perkin, chief economist for
the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. He contends, ``Disney
fits the international image of Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   A few critics worry that Mickey and his friends will pollute or
weaken Chinese culture, but most here say that the incongruous mix
is what Hong Kong is all about. How prominently US popular culture
figures in the landscape of a new Hong Kong under Chinese rule
could also, over time, shape how people from the two vastly
different cultures view one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very unique history and identity _ 150 years of
colonial rule and 4,000 years as a settlement of south China. So we
need to look at Disney in a wider perspective,'' said Stanley Yip,
general manager of research and development for the Hong Kong
Tourism Association. ``What makes Hong Kong unique is the mixture.
. . . We need not worry that American culture will come to Hong
Kong and Chinese culture will disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, a problem unlikely to crop up here is the ardent public
opposition to perceived US cultural imperialism spawned by the
development of Disneyland Paris, which bled money at the start and
is still in deep debt despite recently profitable years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of France opposed Disney for cultural reasons, but
there are no such reasons in Hong Kong,'' said a Hong Kong
government official. ``There haven't been people saying, `We don't
want it because it's not Chinese.' Quite the contrary; they want it
because it's Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong and southern Chinese people do lap up US pop culture,
and locals are famously _ and inexplicably _ crazy about cartoon
characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else in the world,'' asked Perkin, ``do adults queue
around corners to get Snoopy dolls from McDonald's? Where else do
you see Hello Kitty and Batman credit cards? Where else would you
see a tycoon in a 500 SLE Mercedes with the Seven Dwarves lined up
across his back window?''
</P>
<P>
   But just because people here love cartoons and cuddly toys
doesn't mean Disney should become a defining aspect of Hong Kong's
new cultural landscape, say critics. Michelle Vosper, Hong Kong
representative of the Asian Cultural Council, says, ``It's
embarrassing to think that Mickey Mouse is going to be Hong Kong's
cultural icon. It shows very little interest in developing local
culture. Bringing in another Western import is not very
innovative.''
</P>
<P>
   Vosper suggests a marine zoo that would highlight Hong Kong's
unique biodiversity. John Ap, a professor of tourism management at
Hong Kong Polytechnic University, suggests a theme park based on
Hong Kong's successful film industry, with exhibits on Jackie Chan
and Bruce Lee.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials say few attractions could rival
Disney's international appeal, and they have hailed the world's
most famous mouse as the savior of a flagging economy. Hong Kong is
rumored to have offered Disney land worth $2.6 billion, but the
project will have to win approval from the local Legislature, and
that means the community must weigh the financial, environmental,
and cultural pluses and minuses.
</P>
<P>
   This past spring, the Hong Kong Tourism Association predicted a
Disney park could attract 5 million visitors a year, rising to 10
million and ultimately to 20 million. Tokyo Disneyland, the only
Disney park in Asia, attracts 17 million visitors a year, nearly
all of them Japanese. Hong Kong's visitors would probably be from
mainland China and southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   If estimates are correct, it would mean a huge boost for a key
industry. Tourism employs 331,000 people here and is the
territory's largest foreign currency earner, according to the
tourism association. Hong Kong is the single most popular Asian
destination for tourists. Yet in 1997 _ the year of the handover _
tourist arrivals fell 11 percent, continuing to drop until July
1998. Even now, tourism has not recovered to its earlier level.
</P>
<P>
   A $3 billion-plus building project could boost the sagging
property and construction industries now, and the service industry
later. Some economists estimate the park could create 95,000 jobs
and add 0.3 percent to annual growth, and that visitors could spend
$900 million on Disney souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   But others say the cost of taxpayer-funded incentives to one
company might not pay off as hoped. Perhaps only one in four park
visitors would be people who would not otherwise come to Hong Kong,
said Guonan Ma, a Merrill Lynch economist. Others say that even if
people spend money at Disneyland, they won't necessarily spend at
other retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   As for cultural pollution, Lau Kin-wai, a local art critic and
Chinese restaurateur, dismisses the danger. ``Hong Kong has always
been a city open to everything, in the past and the future. I don't
think Disneyland will have a big impact on Hong Kong culture. We've
already been watching Hollywood movies for 50 or 60 years.''

IF YOU NEED SOMETHING, CHANCES ARE IT'S AT CHARLSIE'S 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINERAL WELLS, Texas _ The snow skis were vexing to Charlsie
Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning at the front of her combination hair gallery and bargain
store they served as lonely, angular reminders that Sparks can sell
almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll buy anything and I've always been able to sell
anything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except those skis.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you can find just about anything in Charlsie's. Most
customers have their hair done by Sparks or one of her seven
stylists. If they want to carry self-improvement a step further,
however, there is a tanning machine in a back room.
</P>
<P>
   For shoppers there are candles, knickknacks, assorted antiques,
sheet music, a few used fur coats, junk and eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep,'' said Sparks. ``We've got eggs. They're fresh country
eggs. All brown. Just $1.25 a dozen.''
</P>
<P>
   If that isn't enough, there is a 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle that
everyone in the shop takes a turn at completing. There is coffee, a
slice of whatever Sparks felt like baking the night before and the
continuous patter from the proprietor.
</P>
<P>
   With her red curls bobbing over the heads of others as she clips
and trims, Sparks offers advice, observation and facts about
Charlsie Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fat and 54 now,'' she said. ``Been working since I was 15.
Done a little bit of everything. I've been a bartender, a junk
dealer, a hair stylist and I've done all right. I managed to raise
three kids by myself, even if it did mean working three jobs
sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've been lucky. I've sold everything from feminine
hygiene products to pacifiers and I never had anything stolen and
I've only been stuck with one bad check I couldn't collect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, that's not to say that I haven't had to go out and
collect a few myself. I've pounded on some doors and I've stuck my
foot in them until I got my money, but I always got paid on all of
them except that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks is a die-hard, a Mineral Wells native who has remained in
her hometown. Once a bustling little city with health spas and a
U.S. Army base, Mineral Wells received an economic blow when the
base closed in 1973 and the health spas followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here all my life and I've worked here since I was
15,'' said Sparks. ``I wasn't going anywhere when Fort Wolters
closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Her penchant for junk was inherited. Her father, J.W. Sparks,
has collected and sold other people's garage sale items for years.
The elder Sparks maintains an eclectic assortment, ranging from
baby furniture to an aging jail-cell urinal, purportedly from the
Idabel, Okla., cell where singer Merle Haggard spent Christmas Day
in 1960 on a public intoxication charge.
</P>
<P>
   Charlsie Sparks has never found an oddity as singular as that
urinal, but not because she hasn't tried. She began accumulating
junk as a girl. As an adult she found herself with a house crammed
with items she had purchased from others and she decided to sell
them from her beauty shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I started off with flowers,'' she said. ``Women will
buy flowers before they'll buy bread and I used to get them
wholesale and put them out front. That was before the grocery
stores started adding floral shops and ran me out of the flower
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, by then I was already selling other things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find just about anything here,'' said Buddy Willis,
whose wife, Carol, has had Sparks do her hair for 37 years.
``There's haircuts, used shoes, eggs and gossip.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sparks has little time for gossip when she isn't doing
hair. Her shop is open Tuesday through Saturday, and every weekend
she haunts garage sales, looking for merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she has started an investment club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called the Good Time Folks Investment Club, and it's just
20 old gals like myself who thought we could get together and play
the stock market,'' she said. ``We haven't been doing it long
enough to show a profit or loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that doesn't work out, I'll just keep selling. I can sell
anything if I keep it long enough, maybe even those skis.''
</P>
<P>
   The skis, a pair of Austrian racers, have been part of Sparks'
inventory for more than a year, longer than any other item she
offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the things really cheap,'' said Sparks. ``Trouble is, I
don't think there are many skiers in Mineral Wells, so I've still
got 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll sell 'em. I'll sell 'em cheap. Like everything else
in this store, they're available.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that includes me. I'm single and I'm lookin', but only if
he's got money.''

N.H. SCHOOL CRISIS MIRRORS PRESIDENTIAL ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; CONCORD, N.H. _ Forget Clinton Fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   It's Claremont Fatigue you need to know about to begin coming to
grips with the place where the first primaries will be held three
months hence.
</P>
<P>
   While the presidential candidates have been cruising New
Hampshire, the state for two years has been cruising through moods
ranging from denial to confusion to polarizing ideological fervor
and fever while grappling with the most basic questions about the
proper financing of its all-important public schools.
</P>
<P>
   It's not over yet, and in some ways may not be over for years,
but the banks of the Rubicon are at last at hand. The dreams of
left and right have been frustrated; the two parties have each been
split; but that shifting ground called the center has proved its
durability and its dynamism. On the surface, the relationship to
the presidential campaign is nonexistent; beneath it, it is deep.
</P>
<P>
   Claremont is the middle-class town that led a successful effort
to persuade the state's supreme court that New Hampshire's public
schools were financed in flagrant violation of all concepts of
fairness and equal opportunity _ town-by-town, city-by-city
property taxes that give new meaning to the word disparity.
</P>
<P>
   Such rulings have been handed down all over the country in
recent years. But responding to the one here in 1997 has posed a
unique dilemma for New Hampshire, famously lacking as it does a
sales and an income tax to fill the void necessary to provide at
least an adequate educational opportunity for each kid in a
vibrant, demanding economy light years removed from the
stuck-in-a-rut, high-unemployment place where Bill Clinton, Paul
Tsongas, Pat Buchanan, and George Bush tussled seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But for two years, the effort to do right by the schools has
ebbed, flowed, but never quite succeeded amidst a bewildering
cross-current of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Just for the record, this is the same kind of situation that
Governor George W. Bush tried and failed to resolve in Texas by
trying to use an income tax to level the tax playing field. Here,
Democratic Governor Jeanne Shaheen pursued the opposite course,
arguing from the beginning that the concept of ``solution'' must
not threaten public support for education and must nurture that
support in order to last.
</P>
<P>
   With the Legislature under the gun to put the last touches on a
plan this week (communities are running perilously short on funds),
it is her view (built on a foundation of a statewide property tax)
that has prevailed. It has been an astonishing feat of leadership
in a fractious, bitter atmosphere that teaches much about how
wrenching change is made and managed.
</P>
<P>
   The Claremont conundrum is usually highlighted with reference to
the long advocacy of an income tax by New Hampshire's liberals in
both parties. That route was once again closed off by its rejection
in the Republican-led lower house last week following its passage
by the Democrat-led Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But this approach neglects the right. People sometimes forget,
but in the immediate aftermath of the state court's ruling in 1997,
the response by conservatives was to try to organize a
constitutional amendment movement to abdicate the state's
responsibility for education, irresponsibly putting tax ideology
ahead of schooling. In his early campaigning, Steve Forbes even
tried to link up with it. Had an income tax been imposed, it could
easily have achieved serious traction.
</P>
<P>
   But because the long battle over an income tax resulted in its
defeat for now _ above all because of Shaheen's consistent refusal
to go back on her campaign pledges to veto one _ the conservatives
ended up split. The rejectionists fight on against everything, but
there are plenty of Republicans in the Legislature (House speaker
Donna Sytek is a powerful example) who are willing to work through
a property tax-based solution that at least avoids a short-term
money crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The state supreme court also needs to be kept in mind. Since its
ruling two years ago, the court has often appeared to be more of a
policy micro-manager than a judicial panel, ruling out various
approaches including an advisory referendum on an income tax, the
results of which could have been cathartic and by which Shaheen was
prepared to be guided. Three weeks ago, it was the court's judgment
against a transition mechanism for the property tax that produced
the latest crisis. This week, any means of easing the adjustment
for less well-off citizens (though the overwhelming majority will
get a tax cut) will have to be framed with the court in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The price of bipartisan compromise is likely to be some
shortfall in revenue compared to what is needed to adequately fund
the state share of education, which is about to shoot from a dime
on the dollar to well over 50 cents. Shaheen has consistently
favored additional measures _ from local option video gambling at
racetracks to a capital gains tax _ to complete a package. But
there will be other opportunities to do things like raise cigarette
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The best argument of those advocating an income tax has been
that a property tax is not sufficiently elastic to meet the
pressures of rising costs and more kids. But the best response is
that a once-doctrinaire state in transition like New Hampshire
needs time to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen's relentless but intentionally low-key advocacy of
consensus has done far more than buy time. The eventual package
could actually prove adequate, but for now most of the state has
accepted the all-important concept of its responsibility for
education under her leadership as well as the supreme court's
order.
</P>
<P>
   And having gone through all that _ seeing that bold is not
always wise, that perfect can indeed be the political enemy of
good, that progress beats gridlock _ New Hampshire can now turn
much more of its attention to a presidential campaign featuring
many of the same choices.

BUFFALO FANS STILL MOURN JUNE HOCKEY LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ In another city, it would have been just another
heartbreak for sports fans, a disappointment that would pass in a
week or two as the city went back to normal business.
</P>
<P>
   But this is Buffalo, and even though it has been more than four
months since the Buffalo Sabres lost the Stanley Cup on a highly
controversial goal, the city just won't let it go.
</P>
<P>
   Boston fans may live and die by their teams' fortunes and be
superstitious and hold long grudges. But Buffalo, a city battered
by both heavy snowstorms and athletic failures, is setting a new
standard for community misery over the loss to the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're mad, and we're going to stay mad about it,'' said
Jeffrey Spring, 30, who works in a bookstore. ``We'll never get
over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will Spring let it pass. Soon after the loss to the Stars,
Spring and his friend Brad McNamara, 26, started a Web site for
Sabres fans to gripe on line. The site is still active, as fans
decry the disputed goal with a passion normally reserved for world
tragedies or presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The site also has a countdown clock, precisely marking the
moment Wednesday when the puck will be dropped for the first
face-off between the Sabres and the Stars since their fateful June
game. A rousing protest party to mark the event and to watch the
game is planned at Kahunaville, an enormous bar in the
working-class suburb of Cheektowaga.
</P>
<P>
   There are people here who can't tell you who is running for
president but can describe in painful detail the NHL ruling that,
in their eyes, robbed Buffalo of its rightful glory.
</P>
<P>
   But as Buffalonians admit, it's not just about hockey; it's
about getting some respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffalo has a bridesmaid's mentality,'' said Sabres fan Robert
Vanderwerf, an insurance adjuster. ``To me, it's exactly like the
Yankees-Red Sox playoffs, and I'm a Yankees fan. There were at
least three calls (in the Yankees-Red Sox series) that were just
ridiculous. It's tainted.''
</P>
<P>
   A co-worker of Vanderwerf, Bob Dzimian, 34, sees some
differences with Boston: ``You always hear about Boston, `the curse
of the Bambino' and Bill Buckner'' (who let a grounder slip between
his legs in the 1986 World Series). ``But Buffalo is different.
Everybody's got the `we're being picked on' mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston has world-class universities and is a center of medical
research. Buffalo, Vanderwerf admitted, ``doesn't really have a lot
to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Its economic heyday long past, Buffalo clings to its sports
teams, and their performance palpably influences the mood of the
city. Any new recruit _ such as former Boston College star Doug
Flutie, who joined the Buffalo Bills in 1998 _ gives locals hope.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a city where entire aisles of supermarkets are dedicated
to Bills paraphernalia and the ``Flutie Flakes'' cereal and candy
bars sold to raise money for autistic children. such as Flutie's
son, Dougie.
</P>
<P>
   To many, Flutie defines Buffalo: small, underappreciated, and
yet able to get surprisingly far as an underdog.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo doesn't mind being an underdog. It's just tired of being
the loser.
</P>
<P>
   There are the four consecutive Super Bowl losses by the Bills,
the departure of the Buffalo Braves basketball team, and the fact
that small-market Buffalo _ the city has just 328,000 residents and
the metropolitan population is less than 1.2 million _ was passed
over for a Major League baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Working-class Buffalo never really recovered from the decline of
the steel industry. The winters are bleak and brutal. Its nicknames
are cruel: ``Mistake on the Lake'' and ``Armpit of the East.''
Jokes about the city are no more kind. ``Committing suicide in
Buffalo is redundant,'' goes a phrase from ``A Chorus Line.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss to Dallas underscored the move of wealth and success
from the industrial Northeast to the nation's South and West.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stars' winning goal was a sham, insist the Sabres and
their fans.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the Sabres really should have lost the
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In the wee hours of June 20, in triple overtime of Game Six of
the cup finals, the Stars' Brett Hull scored on the Sabres' star
goalie, Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   The winner was declared, and. with players and fans exhausted,
officials moved quickly to start the ceremonies awarding the
Stanley Cup to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But replays and photos show that Hull's skate was clearly in the
crease, the delineated area reserved for the goalie. On the theory
that it's not fair to get in the goalie's space when he's trying to
stop the puck, goals are disallowed if a player from the scoring
team enters the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials could have reviewed the goal on videotape,
they didn't review Hull's score.
</P>
<P>
   Sabres coach Lindy Ruff, speaking to tens of thousands who
rallied in downtown Buffalo two days after the game, had two words
for the league: ``No goal.'' It became a Buffalo mantra, and
spawned Spring's Web site, www.nogoal.com.
</P>
<P>
   Internet surfers from 67 countries have clicked on the site
nearly 50,000 times. ``Someone wrote in from the former (Yugoslav)
Republic of Macedonia,'' Spring said. ``I don't even know what that
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres organization does not officially sanction the site,
said Michael Gilbert, vice president of communications for the
team.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gilbert said: ``The Buffalo Sabres aren't going to tell
our fans not to be into the team. If this is a way to get their
frustration out, fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL was not amused by the Web site and sent a sternly worded
letter to Spring in August, charging him with copyright infringment
because the site included an image of the Stanley Cup, as well as
the logos of the two finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Spring's response? He put the letter on his Web site, drawing
yet more comments from sports fans. ``The response was just
overwhelming,'' Spring said. The NHL threat only fueled interest in
the site and the NOGOAL bumper stickers, T-shirts, and sweatshirts
he sells, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Spring did remove the team insignias from the T-shirts he sells
and print them in black and white, so the team colors weren't
clear. He said a copyright attorney assured him that using an image
of the Stanley Cup inside a red circle with a line through it is
considered criticism or parody and protected as free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they figured that the threat would make me go away,''
Spring said. ``But when you're committed to something like this,
you don't quit until you get what you want. And what we want is an
apology'' from the league.
</P>
<P>
   An apology isn't likely, and the Stars will certainly keep the
Cup. ``As an organization, we know that history can't be changed,''
said the Sabres' Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   But the fans, watching the Sabres' disappointing performance so
far this season, can't stop anguishing over the championship that
got away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may have been our only chance,'' said Matt Dill, 24, a
computer technician.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a bitter town,'' explained Michael Brady, chief of staff
to US Representative Thomas M. Reynolds, a Buffalo-area Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderwerf, the insurance adjuster, said he's trying to get past
it. But he still keeps a ``No Goal'' plaque on his desk at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it every day,'' Vanderwerf said. ``I know we were
robbed.''

FOR DIVERS, CHALLENGES ARE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL

<P>
   Many of the divers who are preparing to search for wreckage of
EgyptAir Flight 990 may have a weary sense of deja vu after the
rash of plane crashes off the Northeast coast since 1996. But there
is one key difference that makes the job much tougher this time:
</P>
<P>
   The water is about twice as deep.
</P>
<P>
   Divers will have to worry about dangerous decompression
sickness, sometimes called the bends, if they surface too quickly.
They will be at the mercy of powerful open ocean currents and more
dependent than ever on technology, from the remote cameras scanning
the bottom to the slender air hose that connects them to the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experienced divers say some of the toughest issues will
probably be emotional ones as the searchers come face to face with
the shattered remains of 217 lives, from briefcases to children's
shoes to the actual bodies. Like homicide detectives, the divers
must fall back on a cool professionalism to stay focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are completing a mission and the mission is to put closure
in for the people that are left behind,'' said Blake Gilmore, a
Massachusetts State Police diver who worked on the recovery of John
F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane in July. ``I'm hoping they can find
everybody and put closure to this whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even professionalism has its limits, however. After 15 weeks of
diving for the wreckage of TWA Flight 800 off New York in 1996,
sometimes-emotional divers memorialized the 230 victims by placing
a wreath and carnations in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go back to our work. We'll go back to our other cases.
But (the memory of Flight 800) will never go away completely,''
said FBI diver Michael Tyms at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Coast Guard Rear Admiral Richard Larrabee said he no
longer expected to find any survivors of the EgyptAir crash, which
occurred about 60 miles southeast of Nantucket, clearing the way
for the search and rescue operation to end and for the salvage
operations to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials said that the USS Grapple _ the same salvage ship
that recovered the remains of Swissair Flight 111 off Nova Scotia
in 1998 and a twin of the vessel that recovered Kennedy's plane off
Martha's Vineyard last summer _ should be in position off Nantucket
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A second Navy vessel, a tugboat called the USMS Mohawk, left
Philadelphia Monday morning. Meanwhile, divers from the
Virginia-based Mobile Salvage Diving Unit 2 will soon be available
to assist in recovery efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In the other salvage operations of the past three years, the
Navy turned to state police, the FBI, and other agencies to help
with the diving work. But this time, with water depth estimated at
270 feet, relatively few divers for other public agencies outside
of the Navy are trained in the special precautions needed for deep
sea diving.
</P>
<P>
   At such depths, the extreme water pressure actually changes
divers' blood chemistry. If they return to the surface too quickly,
the sudden reduction in pressure causes the release of nitrogen
bubbles into body tissues, causing nausea, paralysis, or even
death.
</P>
<P>
   To hedge against decompression sickness, sources familiar with
Navy procedures say divers working on the EgyptAir crash will
receive a special mix of air through hoses that contains 40 percent
helium to prevent their bodies from building up nitrogen. In
addition, they will ascend slowly, pausing for 15 minutes at
various checkpoints to let their bodies adjust to the reduced
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the divers emerge from the water, they must still
spend roughly two hours in a decompression chamber, meaning that it
will take nearly 4 hours to get 30 minutes of actual ``bottom
time'' searching for debris and bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore, of the Massachusetts State Police, said the working
conditions would not unnerve the Navy divers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have done this before. The Navy is very good at
these deep-water dives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The logistical difficulties of diving will force the EgyptAir
search team to rely far more on a remote-controlled,
camera-equipped vehicle on the Grapple. The box-like vehicle,
equipped with lights, camera, sonar, and a robotic arm, was
instrumental in finding Kennedy's plane off Martha's Vineyard last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The machine, made by Benthos Inc. of Falmouth, will do initial
investigations of sonar readings from the ocean bottom, even
retrieving some objects itself.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials said it was too soon to predict how long or how
difficult the EgyptAir search would be. Unlike the 15-week TWA
debris search, the salvage teams begin with a much smaller debris
field where the plane went down. But North Atlantic weather may
slow the search.
</P>
<P>
   What Navy officials do know is that emotionally challenging
times lay ahead as the divers encounter personal items and bodies,
and, sometimes, loved ones desperate for information waiting on
shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Divers are a very tight, close-knit community. They want to be
tight and they want to be strong,'' said one longtime salvage diver
who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the emotional power of finding childrens' remains;
at least two infants were reportedly aboard EgyptAir Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really affects you more than an adult,'' he said.
``Sometimes you have to take a break and talk about it before you
move on.''

CARROLL: TEAM IS FOCUS, NOT INDIVIDUALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ With an offense based on timing and tight
end Ben Coates sounding out of sync, coach Pete Carroll Monday
tried unsuccessfully to focus on the Patriots' victory over the
Arizona Cardinals Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But at Carroll's weekly media conference, questions about the
disgruntled player persisted. Finally, when the group interview
seemed as if it would be dominated by talk about the tight end,
Carroll asked that reporters come back to that topic after the game
was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Following New England's 27-3 victory, which improved its record
to 6-2, the five-time Pro Bowl participant charged that he has been
excluded from the game plan and challenged the team to release him.
The game against the Cardinals marked the second time this season
that Coates did not have a reception. He does not want to serve as
a decoy in offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese's plans.
</P>
<P>
   During what should have been an upbeat press conference heading
into the Patriots' off week, Carroll was left dealing with an
unhappy player and defending his coaching philosophy. Instead of
making Coates's complaints an internal matter, the coach openly
discussed the situation at the beginning and end of the press
conference. Carroll did not betray any anger in the tone of his
responses, but he felt a need to deal with the matter thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just addressing the issue of guys talking, I would say this:
We're about team,'' said Carroll. ``We're about doing everything we
can possibly do to help this team win a championship. Our decisions
are made and the way we approach our games are totally centered on
that fact. I wish guys, if they have something to voice, would come
to us and speak to us first and not speak to the media, at all
times. We're always available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me in the slightest, not one bit, that guys
are concerned. I just wish that when we have concerns like that
that guys would voice them directly to us. Then we could avoid you
asking all these questions. I'd really like to talk about having a
big day in Phoenix and getting a big win for us. So that's what I'm
ready to do. Who wants to ask about the game?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, wide receiver Vincent Brisby voiced his
discontent when left off the active roster. But beyond the
similarities of both players taking their frustration to the media,
the two situations are different. Brisby requested more
opportunities to play. Coates wants the ball more.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran tight end often keeps his postgame comments to a
minimum. But he chose a particularly inopportune time (and, Carroll
argued, an inappropriate forum) to voice his concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Coates could not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By following the Patriots' victory with his contentious remarks,
it appeared he was placing his personal accomplishments ahead of
team achievements. Coates ranks third among NFL tight ends for
career touchdown receptions with 50. He needs two to tie Dave
Casper for second and 11 to pass Jerry Smith and move into first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll explained that the game plan is designed solely to win
games and all of the players cannot be featured. Against Arizona,
Drew Bledsoe and his receiving corps had success with the long
ball, which highlighted the efforts of Shawn Jefferson and Terry
Glenn. Carroll noted that Bledsoe tried to get the ball to Coates
and was sacked once while trying to do so. The tight end had two
balls thrown to him into double coverage, both incomplete. And when
the win was secure, backup Rod Rutledge replaced Coates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben has been a very big part of this offense and continues to
be,'' said Carroll. ``Whether he gets the football or not, he's a
big part of our offense just as Terry Glenn is, as Drew is, as
Terry Allen is becoming. Guys who are a big part of our offense
don't always have to get the ball to be a factor in helping us win.
It's frustrating and it's hard and all that, but it's a team
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach understands that players occasionally will be
disappointed with the role they have. In the future, he hopes to
avoid having players go to the media with their frustration by
setting up better lines of communication. But Carroll and his staff
will not call certain plays to make a player happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Zampese) has featured the tight end,'' said Carroll. ``The
tight end has continued to be a featured aspect of how we prepare
and how we do things, but right now we're getting a lot out of our
wide receivers. They're averaging a bunch a catch. But it's all
going to come back around. It's just a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the receivers made big gains playing Arizona, the running
backs also had reason to celebrate. For the second game in a row,
the Patriots established an aggressive rushing game, which Carroll
believes has made a turn in the right direction. Carroll didn't
want to overhype his rushing attack, but said the team ``was
gaining a feeling for it, an attitude.'' . . . On the defensive
end, Carroll singled out end Willie McGinest and linebacker Chris
Slade for praise. Carroll said Slade ``looks as good as he's ever
looked for us in the last three years. He's very quick off the
football, very aggressive with his rushing style, and he's improved
some in a few subtle areas. His inside rush in particular has
become very effective.'' . . . During the off week, Carroll plans
to self-scout to gain an understanding of how other teams view the
Patriots. After that, he wants to add ``a few new wrinkles'' on
offense and defense and ``iron some things out.'' The coach wants
the team to get rest but practice competitively when the time comes
to keep its game in shape. There will be competitive drills pitting
the offense against the defense so New England can maintain its
focus. ``It's a finely tuned thing we've got going here,'' said
Carroll. ``We don't want to lose an edge right now that we think
we're on a pretty good track.''

   Here's one word for Americans on vacation: Relax!
</P>
<P>
   In a survey by MotherNature.com, 74 percent of the 1,016 people
interviewed said they experienced some kind of disruption during
their 1999 summer vacations, including anxiety or low energy. Other
rest-related findings:
</P>
<P>
   --About 7 in 10 said the key to a restful vacation is seeing new
places (71 percent), being away from work (70 percent), and doing
new or different things (67 percent). In addition, 56 percent said
exercising on vacation gave them energy.
</P>
<P>
   --On the other hand, a mere 1 percent said vacationing with
parents is conducive to getting rest, and only 4 percent found a
vacation with the children to be restful.
</P>
<P>
   --Seventy percent of those surveyed said they need just one to
three days away to feel restored and relaxed. Only 2 percent said
they need more than 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   --And _ surprise! surprise! _ a minority of those surveyed said
that eating (38 percent) or sex (also 38 percent) gave them new
energy on vacation.

Floating Date.'' Princess Cruises of ``Love Boat'' fame and
Match.com, an on-line matchmaking service, will give 50 couples an
all-expense-paid trip to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where they will
meet onboard the new, 77,000-ton Ocean Princess cruise ship on
Valentine's Day 2000 for two days of special events. Singles should
register at www.match.com/oceanprincess, submit their profiles, and
search for matches. Once a participant finds a likely companion,
the couple submits a joint entry telling why they would like to

NOTHING SUPER EXCEPT TEAMS' OPPORTUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As distasteful a thought as it may be, the fact remains: Two of
these teams will meet in Atlanta on the final Sunday of January,
and one of them is going to win the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   How could things have flip-flopped so dramatically in just one
year? There are no Minnesotas and no Denvers, Superteams steaming
toward an apparently inevitable confrontation. The National
Football League this season is a monument to mediocrity. In this
land of the blind, an as-yet-unidentified one-eyed team will emerge
as its king.
</P>
<P>
   The battle cry for upward of 20 teams is: ``Why Not Us?''
</P>
<P>
   And why not, indeed? What possible guidelines have emerged that
would help us identify the powers of 1999?
</P>
<P>
   The chic thing at the moment is to say that home dominance is
key. That would make undefeated home squads Miami, Tennessee,
Kansas City, St. Louis, and Dallas the favorites.
</P>
<P>
   You comfortable with that?
</P>
<P>
   I didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   We are heading for an uncertain December in which you will hear
more about tiebreakers than you will about Rudolph and the Little
Drummer Boy. They may have to go down to what we used to refer to
on the Jersey playgrounds as ``Odds and Evens.'' As we speak, 18
teams are at or over .500, and two others are one under the
break-even point. The Jets, Bengals, Browns, and Saints are the
only teams that are absolutely, positively out of it (OK, there
isn't any sign of life in the Falcons or Eagles, either, but let's
allow them to lose one more game each before we summon the
coroner).
</P>
<P>
   Among the teams quite legitimately crooning ``Why Not Us?'' are
your beloved New England Patriots. They are 6-2 and could very
easily be 8-0. OK, let's settle for 7-1. They shoulda lost to the
Jets and they shoulda defeated the Chiefs. We'll concede the Miami
game, but even that one hurt, and hurt bad. Some teams can allow
Damon Huard to beat them, but the Patriots shouldn't be one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   As Whatshisname is so fond of saying, ``You are what your record
says you are,'' and in this case, in this context, he is 100
percent correct. However flawed the Patriots are, they do have some
obvious strengths, and those strengths have gotten them this
commendable 6-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the quarterback. Let's say we all agree that Brett
Favre is the unquestioned No. 1 quarterback in the league. So who's
next? Troy Aikman, when he isn't being awakened by smelling salts?
Probably. It amuses me that he is so taken for granted. This guy is
a truly great player who continually has proven himself by taking
charge in the big games. If I know he's healthy (or, at least, if
his oft-concussed head is clear), I'd want him more than I'd want
Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   But that's it. Steve Young is now out of the discussion. Dan
Marino has entered into the ``was'' category. Mark Brunell has yet
to take that next step. Kurt Warner? Perhaps we should wait a
while. Steve McNair? Very exciting. Our Man Doug? A Certified
Winner, but would you take him over Bledsoe? C'mon, who?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there's Peyton Manning, who quite clearly is the real
deal. But right now what Peyton Manning happens to be is Drew
Bledsoe on training wheels. Some day Manning might be Bledsoe, but
right now Bledsoe is someone for Manning to look up to, as Peyton
would be the first to tell you.
</P>
<P>
   So there it is. We have Drew Bledsoe in our midst, and we should
all appreciate him. He is 27 years old, in his seventh season, and
on his way to establishing many serious passing records. He is
settling into a prime that will establish him as one of the
greatest of all contemporary NFL players. He has the experience to
complement his talent. He has been through a full range of NFL
experiences, good and bad, and he now has emerged as a first-rate
quarterback. (Finger? What finger?)
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Drew Bledsoe, the Patriots have a chance in every game
they play. This is supposed to be the era of the mobile
quarterback, but Bledsoe writes his own rules. He gets it done
because he's big, strong, smart, and very courageous. Imagine what
he would be worth on the open market. Salute Bob Kraft for wrapping
him up years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The running game is an occasional pleasant diversion, and that's
all. The Patriots win because of Bledsoe, good receivers _ Earth to
Ben: Have you looked at the standings lately? Isn't winning
supposed to be your priority? _ good pass blockers, a couple of
killer DBs, and because after all this time these guys are used to
winning. Have you ever thought of that? They think of themselves as
winners. To them, winning is a natural state. This is not a team
plagued with self-doubt, and some of the credit for this must go to
their relentlessly upbeat coach.
</P>
<P>
   So they're 6-2 and the schedule continues to be an ally. I mean,
who gets a week off at the exact midpoint of the season? Three
lucky teams, that's who (the Giants and Raiders being the other
two). They have four home games left, and if they go 3-1 at home
and 2-2 on the road, that's 11-5.
</P>
<P>
   That puts them in the Super Bowl mix in a year lacking a
favorite, or even favorites. The Patriots against NFC Team X in
Atlanta? Why not? They're as good as anyone else you can think of.
</P>
<P>

SAN FRANCISCO SCRAMBLES TO GET RID OF ITS WASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As San Francisco approaches a 2001 deadline to
cut garbage dumping in landfills by half, it's scrambling for ways
to induce people to recycle.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with hefty fines if it can't meet the target, the city is
trying everything from public relations campaigns to compost made
from table scraps.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday at City Hall Plaza, as San Francisco Mayor Willie
Brown exhorted city officials to save paper, Recreation and Park
chief Joel Robinson and Treasurer Susan Leal pushed bins through an
obstacle course in a public relations stunt to see who could
collect the most recyclables.
</P>
<P>
   The city doles out recycling tips by calling 30,000 households
yearly and operating a trilingual hot line. It puts up posters
advertising pickup of Christmas trees and used phone books.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the latest scheme to keep garbage from going to the
dump: recycling food scraps from residents, restaurants and produce
markets to create compost.
</P>
<P>
   Since April 1998, Norcal Waste Systems Inc., San Francisco's
garbage collector, has been picking up coffee grounds, rice,
broccoli, ham fat and other organic material from sealed bins at
curb sides in the western Richmond District.
</P>
<P>
   The waste is hauled outside the city and composted into a
product called ``Urban Earth.'' In a year, much of San Francisco
will add its uneaten food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the pressure,'' said David Assmann, recycling program
manager for San Francisco. ``That 50 percent requirement is right
around the corner. It's only a year away, and we're at 40 percent
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1989 California Integrated Waste Management Act, every
city must cut disposal in landfills by half on Jan. 1, 2001, or
face $10,000-a-day fines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, San Francisco reported recycling 40 percent of its 1.5
million tons of residential and commercial waste. That compares to
Oakland's 40 percent, San Jose's 43 percent, Sacramento's 47
percent and Los Angeles' 46.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking at what was left in the waste stream,''
Assmann said. ``It became pretty obvious that organic material was
the next material we needed to go after.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the city plans to expand to the program from 2,800
households to all 12,000 homes in Richmond. Then, the program will
move into other neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Every family gets three bins: A blue bin for office paper, junk
mail, newspapers, cereal boxes, milk cartons, plastic jugs and
bottles, glass jars and bottles and cans.
</P>
<P>
   A green bin for fruit, vegetables, cheese, meat, tea bags,
coffee grounds, soiled napkins and plates, and paper bags to hold
the food.
</P>
<P>
   A black bin for nonrecyclable trash such as meat bones, animal
waste, diapers, wood and plastic bags, wrap, plastic foam and
packaging.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent scraps from being ravaged by animals, the bins have
sealed tops.
</P>
<P>
   Contents of the black bins go to a special landfill in
Livermore, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the program has been a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going very well,'' said Bob Besso, recycling program
manager for Sunset Scavenger Co., a Norcal subsidiary that picks up
in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Besso's trucks deliver the food scrapes to B&AMP;J Landfill Compost
Facility in Vacaville, which was set up started by Norcal three
years ago. The scrapes are mixed with food scraps from the
California Medical Facility, a hospital prison. The total is about
110 tons a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just looks like fruit _ melons, peaches, apples. You'll
find fish and chicken in it. We see pasta, all the lettuce
trimmings from supermarkets and cuttings from restaurant waste,''
said Chris Choate, B&AMP;J regional landfill manager.
</P>
<P>
   The food is ground and stuffed into 200-yard-long plastic
sausages that hold 200 tons. Air is blown through the container for
two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're selling all the compost that we're making,'' Choate
said. ``We have vendors that specifically request our product, and
we have to turn them away because we're not making enough.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco compost is higher than others in nitrogen _ which
makes plants grow _ because of the rich vegetable content.
</P>
<P>
   A normal compost is 2 percent nitrogen; Norcal's product has 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In several months, the nonprofit San Francisco League of Urban
Gardeners (SLUG) will begin selling ``Urban Earth'' at nurseries
and garden stores in San Francisco as a soil amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Prices will be equal to other composts: 1 cubic yard, about $9;
one- half cubic yard, $5; and one-quarter cubic yard, $3.50.

LEGENDARY SILENT MOVIE THEATER REBORN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
  
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST HOLLYWOOD _ The Silent Movie Theatre refuses to, well, go
silently into that good night.
</P>
<P>
   The movie house at 611 N. Fairfax Ave. is about to come back to
life, reopening Friday with an invitation-only screening of Charlie
Chaplin's classic ``Modern Times'' and, on Sunday, beginning its
regular public schedule with matinee and evening shows of the film.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the third incarnation of the only theater in the
country dedicated to our silent movie heritage. The original
operation was run by husband-and-wife team John and Dorothy Hampton
from 1942 through 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, following John's death from cancer, thought to be
caused by the chemicals he used to preserve his vast collection of
classic films, the theater was reopened by family friend Laurence
Austin. Austin was murdered at the theater on January 17, 1997, by
a man hired by his longtime companion, James Van Sickle. The venue
was immediately shuttered, and the 1,500-film collection it thrived
on was auctioned off in May of this year.
</P>
<P>
   That sale seemed to seal the institution's fate for good. And
that's probably what would have happened, except for the enthusiasm
of Charlie Lustman.
</P>
<P>
   A 34-year-old L.A. native who's spent most of his adult life
composing music in such far-flung locales as Costa Rica and
Copenhagen, he was on a visit back home _ and on his way to get a
falafel, actually _ when he noticed the dark theater's weathered
facade (which has since been replaced by a very snazzy,
neon-and-bulb art-deco marquee).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was heading down Fairfax and I saw this For Sale sign
outside,'' Lustman recalls. ``I thought, `Silent Movie _ that's
kind of interesting.' I walked through the doorway and saw all of
the pictures that were still on the walls, and immediately I was
taken. This was like a shrine for silent film. Now, I don't know
silent film, but of course I know the stars. Then it hit me that
this art form was this century's art form, and these people on the
walls were its pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought this would be so cool, to get involved in
something that was part of this early culture, and of the city of
L.A. So I called a few people who I knew had money and asked them
how they felt about investing in a silent movie theater. They'd go,
`You've got to be kidding me. How are you going to get people to go
see old silent movies?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I convinced them that this had a lot of versatility _ don't
ask me how, but I did _ and then started the renovation process to
bring it back to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been done to make the 222-seat theater a haven for film
lovers. A new screen and two lovingly restored, 500-watt Super
Simplex xenon projectors have been installed, as has a 20-by-6-foot
stage for live performances that can be removed to accommodate an
eight-piece music ensemble. There's now an upstairs cappucino bar
and a back patio, where fans will be able to meet and discuss the
evening's show, starting at 6 p.m. and going until midnight.
</P>
<P>
   But where will those 8 p.m. shows come from? When Butterfield's
auctioned off the Hampton collection in May, Lustman was able to
buy the Douglas Fairbanks action features, but little else.
Fortunately, major studios and such organizations as Ted Turner's
massive film library have been restoring prints for video and
broadcast in recent years; between those sources and supportive
private collectors, Lustman expects to be able to program an
ambitious series of retrospectives.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, he's sticking with the tried and true: Chaplin
features for the next couple of weekends, Fairbanks and Mary
Pickford on weekdays, a week of Buster Keaton comedies in December,
``King of Kings'' and ``The Bishop's Wife'' for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesdays will be regularly devoted to sound films released
before 1950: ``The Jazz Singer,'' Laurel &AMP; Hardy's ``Flying
Deuces,'' the Marx Brothers' ``Duck Soup'' and John Ford's World
War II classic ``They Were Expendable'' are the November entries.
</P>
<P>
   Some may consider the presence of recorded dialogue in the
silent movie shrine a tacit admission that the audience indeed may
not be that big for silent movies these days. Then again, that's
what investors told the Hamptons in 1942, and they made a go of it
for more than 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   And Lustman is confident that the same thing that happened to
him can happen to people his age and younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna get the audience that's left to come back and
we're going to create an entirely new audience,'' he says. ``I'm
young compared to most silent film fans. I never knew about this
and the more I learn about it, the more I love it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like the Van Gogh show at LACMA. Young and old went
to see the Old Master's art. Well, it's the same thing (with film),
and that's how we're marketing the theater. Come see the art, it's
a museum, they're movies! We all love movies _ come see the
originals.'' &QL;

IS `TALK' ALL TALKED OUT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Has Tina Brown lost her buzz?
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, she has climbed to the very peak of the
New York publishing scene, emerging as a superstar magazine editor.
She became known to the public not only by name but by her first
name and was heralded, even by her adversaries, as a sort of
miracle worker.
</P>
<P>
   She turned the frothy Vanity Fair into a spicy smorgasbord of
in-depth journalism, engaging profiles, and alluring design. She
moved on to the stately but sagging New Yorker and, whatever else
one thinks of her five years at the helm, she pumped it back to
life, making it again a magazine that had to be read.
</P>
<P>
   That was always her aim: to hire the hot writers, to own the hot
topics, to turn out the one publication that talked-about people
were talking about.
</P>
<P>
   So, last year, when she quit the New Yorker to start her own
monthly magazine under the auspices of Miramax, the hottest film
company, and Hearst, one of the biggest distributors, and then,
with unbridled self-confidence, called it Talk, the buzz rose to a
roar.
</P>
<P>
   Three issues have hit the newsstands, and the only question
among industry insiders is how far she has fallen short. For though
it is too early to render firm judgment, the consensus amounts to
what must be Brown's worst nightmare: Except for the article about
Hillary Rodham Clinton in the premiere issue, nobody is talking
about Talk.
</P>
<P>
   They are, however, talking about Tina.
</P>
<P>
   This is a town whose literati have tended to cluster in two
groups, those in awe of Brown and those who dreamed of the day she
would tumble off the high-wire of celebrity and success.
</P>
<P>
   And the troubles with Talk have drawn notice from both. The
editor with a sure sense of the cutting edge, featuring Liz Taylor
and Arnold Schwarzenegger on her covers? The editor who always gets
the writers she wants, losing bidding wars for the best? The editor
famed for her cadre of doting assistants, facing a wave of
desertions by top editors?
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be,'' speculated an editor at one magazine, who has
championed Brown in the past and is stunned by Talk's failure to
take the market by storm, ``that Tina's very good at jazzing up an
existing product, like the New Yorker or Vanity Fair, but she's at
sea when it comes to creating her own from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees from Talk trace the magazine's lack of focus and early
troubles to Brown's tempestuous management style.
</P>
<P>
   The words they use to describe the office atmosphere run from
``gloom'' to ``frenzy'' to ``misery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every article that came in had to be edited and laid
out in three ways, as a feature, a department, and a smaller story
in the front or the back of the magazine,'' a former Talk employee
said. ``She had to see it in layout form to figure out which it was
going to be. So it had to be edited to three different lengths,
illustrated or photographed in three different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was all very expensive, of course, and an incredible
amount of work for nothing,'' the former employee added. ``We
worked till 3:30 a.m. and on weekends, we were all like doctors on
call.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other former insiders confirmed this account. One added:
``She calls you Saturday at 7 p.m., she calls you Sunday at 7 a.m.,
you never feel you're free of her. And it's all so unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The former staff members spoke on condition of anonymity because
everyone who works at Talk must sign a nondisclosure form,
promising not to say what happens on the premises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked at a lot of magazines,'' one said, ``but I'd never
heard of that anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. But
Talk's publisher, Ronald Galotti, shrugged off the sniping at the
new magazine and its editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've substantially overdelivered in terms of revenue from
circulation and advertising,'' he said in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said 200,000 subscriptions have been ordered, and he expects
newsstand sales to reach a consistent level of 300,000, though the
numbers are not yet tabulated.
</P>
<P>
   Galotti's bullishness is not universally shared in the city's
magazine advertising world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disappointment is, there isn't a buzz for this magazine,''
said Lee Doyle, vice president and media director at Amarati,
Puris, Lintoff, a Madison Avenue firm that advses corporations on
where to place ads.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle encouraged his clients to place ads in Talk's first four
issues, as the magazine required all its advertisers to do. He has
not yet decided what to recommend for future issues, but said,
``We're not rushing to sign up for four more.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Doyle's competitors are more positive about Talk. Priya
Narang, senior vice president at DeWitt Media, said she is
``optimistic that Miramax will keep pumping money'' into it, and is
telling her clients to keep advertising. Paula Brooks, of
Margeotes, Fertitta &AMP; Partners, missed the first four issues for
budgetary reasons, but ``absolutely'' plans to place ads in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Narang added, ``All the hype in the world can't build
circulation,'' and, Brooks said, ``The buzz is not quite as strong
as it was for the first issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, much of the buzz since its debut, with the celebrity
party on Liberty Island, has been negative. Six top staff members
have quit, including the managing editor, features editor, and
production director.
</P>
<P>
   Big-name writers, with a few exceptions, have resisted the lure
that Brown cast so magnetically in her earlier ventures. An editor
at another magazine, who admires Brown, said: ``I've spent my whole
career competing with Tina for writers. In the past, I always lost.
Now, I'm always winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the ``synergy'' that was billed as the rationale for
the magazine's existence, the idea that Talk articles would be
turned into Miramax films, has barely begun to show signs of
promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writers who have ideas that might be turned into movies don't
want to write them for Tina,'' an agent said, ``because her
contract gives Talk all the ancillary rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's idea, as she spelled it out in interviews before the
magazine appeared, was to create an American version of a European
glossy, like Paris Match or Stern, with lots of photos, articles
both gossipy and serious, and a paper stock that can be rolled up
in a handbag.
</P>
<P>
   But many industry sources, other editors, publishers, literary
agents, and ad directors, have trouble putting their fingers on
what Talk is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say it's still in its infancy stage,'' said
Melissa Pordy, senior vice president and director of print services
for Zenith Media, another ad-placement firm, who advised her
clients not to advertise in the first four issues.
</P>
<P>
   Pordy said Brown's Euro look is not pleasing many advertisers
stateside. ``There is great disappointment in the whole package,''
she said, ``in the paper stock, the reproductions, how it's laid
out, the contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their cover choices are very strange,'' she continued.
``They're trying to go after a smart, hipper, young consumer. But
by putting Liz Taylor on the cover of the second issue and Arnold
Schwarzenegger on the third, that's not what you're going to
attract.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Brown's critics stop short of dismissing Talk or Tina
Brown. The troubles could stem from ``growing pains, common to all
start-ups,'' as one competing editor put it.
</P>
<P>
   One former Talk staff member added: ``She's a wound-up lady but
she's also very smart. . . . Talk is sufficiently different that,
if she stays with it and refines what's there, she could have
something fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Brown hired as her new executive editor Robert
Wallace, who days earlier had resigned as chief editor of St.
Martin's Press. Several industry sources voiced hope that he would
instill some discipline.
</P>
<P>
   And Galotti sees other promising signs, noting that Miramax has
optioned the movie rights from an article on Ghana in the first
issue. Another forthcoming movie, called ``Blow Dry,'' is being
``integrated'' with a Talk ad campaign by Tommy Hilfiger. And
Talk/Miramax Books recently paid $1 million for an autobiography by
Jordan's Queen Noor, and, at last week's Frankfurt Book Fair, sold
the German publication rights for $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been cooking on all fronts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it remains a question whether Brown's status as the
reigning queen of the magazine-editing world will survive the
troubles of her maiden voyage as magazine creator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson of Talk,'' an editor said, ``may be that prestige
is conveyed with the institution, not with an individual, certainly
not with an editor.''

BUFFALO FANS STILL MOURN JUNE HOCKEY LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ In another city, it would have been just another
heartbreak for sports fans, a disappointment that would pass in a
week or two as the city went back to normal business.
</P>
<P>
   But this is Buffalo, and even though it has been more than four
months since the Buffalo Sabres lost the Stanley Cup on a highly
controversial goal, the city just won't let it go.
</P>
<P>
   Boston fans may live and die by their teams' fortunes and be
superstitious and hold long grudges. But Buffalo, a city battered
by both heavy snowstorms and athletic failures, is setting a new
standard for community misery over the loss to the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're mad, and we're going to stay mad about it,'' said
Jeffrey Spring, 30, who works in a bookstore. ``We'll never get
over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will Spring let it pass. Soon after the loss to the Stars,
Spring and his friend Brad McNamara, 26, started a Web site for
Sabres fans to gripe on line. The site is still active, as fans
decry the disputed goal with a passion normally reserved for world
tragedies or presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The site also has a countdown clock, precisely marking the
moment Wednesday when the puck will be dropped for the first
face-off between the Sabres and the Stars since their fateful June
game. A rousing protest party to mark the event and to watch the
game is planned at Kahunaville, an enormous bar in the
working-class suburb of Cheektowaga.
</P>
<P>
   There are people here who can't tell you who is running for
president but can describe in painful detail the NHL ruling that,
in their eyes, robbed Buffalo of its rightful glory.
</P>
<P>
   But as Buffalonians admit, it's not just about hockey; it's
about getting some respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffalo has a bridesmaid's mentality,'' said Sabres fan Robert
Vanderwerf, an insurance adjuster. ``To me, it's exactly like the
Yankees-Red Sox playoffs, and I'm a Yankees fan. There were at
least three calls (in the Yankees-Red Sox series) that were just
ridiculous. It's tainted.''
</P>
<P>
   A co-worker of Vanderwerf, Bob Dzimian, 34, sees some
differences with Boston: ``You always hear about Boston, `the curse
of the Bambino' and Bill Buckner'' (who let a grounder slip between
his legs in the 1986 World Series). ``But Buffalo is different.
Everybody's got the `we're being picked on' mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston has world-class universities and is a center of medical
research. Buffalo, Vanderwerf admitted, ``doesn't really have a lot
to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Its economic heyday long past, Buffalo clings to its sports
teams, and their performance palpably influences the mood of the
city. Any new recruit _ such as former Boston College star Doug
Flutie, who joined the Buffalo Bills in 1998 _ gives locals hope.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a city where entire aisles of supermarkets are dedicated
to Bills paraphernalia and the ``Flutie Flakes'' cereal and candy
bars sold to raise money for autistic children. such as Flutie's
son, Dougie.
</P>
<P>
   To many, Flutie defines Buffalo: small, underappreciated, and
yet able to get surprisingly far as an underdog.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo doesn't mind being an underdog. It's just tired of being
the loser.
</P>
<P>
   There are the four consecutive Super Bowl losses by the Bills,
the departure of the Buffalo Braves basketball team, and the fact
that small-market Buffalo _ the city has just 328,000 residents and
the metropolitan population is less than 1.2 million _ was passed
over for a Major League baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Working-class Buffalo never really recovered from the decline of
the steel industry. The winters are bleak and brutal. Its nicknames
are cruel: ``Mistake on the Lake'' and ``Armpit of the East.''
Jokes about the city are no more kind. ``Committing suicide in
Buffalo is redundant,'' goes a phrase from ``A Chorus Line.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss to Dallas underscored the move of wealth and success
from the industrial Northeast to the nation's South and West.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stars' winning goal was a sham, insist the Sabres and
their fans.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the Sabres really should have lost the
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In the wee hours of June 20, in triple overtime of Game Six of
the cup finals, the Stars' Brett Hull scored on the Sabres' star
goalie, Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   The winner was declared, and. with players and fans exhausted,
officials moved quickly to start the ceremonies awarding the
Stanley Cup to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But replays and photos show that Hull's skate was clearly in the
crease, the delineated area reserved for the goalie. On the theory
that it's not fair to get in the goalie's space when he's trying to
stop the puck, goals are disallowed if a player from the scoring
team enters the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials could have reviewed the goal on videotape,
they didn't review Hull's score.
</P>
<P>
   Sabres coach Lindy Ruff, speaking to tens of thousands who
rallied in downtown Buffalo two days after the game, had two words
for the league: ``No goal.'' It became a Buffalo mantra, and
spawned Spring's Web site, www.nogoal.com.
</P>
<P>
   Internet surfers from 67 countries have clicked on the site
nearly 50,000 times. ``Someone wrote in from the former (Yugoslav)
Republic of Macedonia,'' Spring said. ``I don't even know what that
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres organization does not officially sanction the site,
said Michael Gilbert, vice president of communications for the
team.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gilbert said: ``The Buffalo Sabres aren't going to tell
our fans not to be into the team. If this is a way to get their
frustration out, fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL was not amused by the Web site and sent a sternly worded
letter to Spring in August, charging him with copyright infringment
because the site included an image of the Stanley Cup, as well as
the logos of the two finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Spring's response? He put the letter on his Web site, drawing
yet more comments from sports fans. ``The response was just
overwhelming,'' Spring said. The NHL threat only fueled interest in
the site and the NOGOAL bumper stickers, T-shirts, and sweatshirts
he sells, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Spring did remove the team insignias from the T-shirts he sells
and print them in black and white, so the team colors weren't
clear. He said a copyright attorney assured him that using an image
of the Stanley Cup inside a red circle with a line through it is
considered criticism or parody and protected as free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they figured that the threat would make me go away,''
Spring said. ``But when you're committed to something like this,
you don't quit until you get what you want. And what we want is an
apology'' from the league.
</P>
<P>
   An apology isn't likely, and the Stars will certainly keep the
Cup. ``As an organization, we know that history can't be changed,''
said the Sabres' Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   But the fans, watching the Sabres' disappointing performance so
far this season, can't stop anguishing over the championship that
got away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may have been our only chance,'' said Matt Dill, 24, a
computer technician.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a bitter town,'' explained Michael Brady, chief of staff
to US Representative Thomas M. Reynolds, a Buffalo-area Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderwerf, the insurance adjuster, said he's trying to get past
it. But he still keeps a ``No Goal'' plaque on his desk at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it every day,'' Vanderwerf said. ``I know we were
robbed.''

NEXT 
Trends for the Near Future 
By Ira Matathia and Marian Salzman 
Overlook, 414 pp., $26.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether they are based in our stars or in ourselves, it is folly
to put too much faith in predictions: They might be right, or they
might be wrong, so what's the use?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, as is underscored by ``Next: Trends for the Near
Future,'' lies in the predictions' entertainment value. They're fun
to contemplate, and even if they come from some street-corner
soothsayer, they could be right, right?
</P>
<P>
   Authors Ira Matathia and Marian Salzman, leaders in the ``Brand
Futures Group'' at the marketing giant Young &AMP; Rubicam, would argue
that they go beyond mere mysticism, that their glimpses into the
future are based on hard data combined with the insight it takes to
succeed in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   That's debatable, especially if you remember that a farmers'
almanac around the turn of the century predicted that the rapid
proliferation of buggies would soon clog city streets with horse
manure. But it's not a critical point: The authors start a
conversation anyone can join in on. Some of their ideas are clever,
almost obvious; others are laughably simple, or just laughable. On
balance, though, they're thought-provoking enough to be worth a
glance.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the it-ought-to-come-true category is their idea
for medical advocates, who the authors say will take up a role once
played by the family GP. The profession will be populated not by
doctors but by practitioners who will guide clients through the
growing morass of HMOs and alternative therapies.
</P>
<P>
   But as in many of the fields they cover, their bits of
brilliance are balanced by suggestions that are hard to imagine.
Take, for example, their take on cosmetic surgery, which Salzman
and Matathia expect to come to the masses. Private clinics will
become ``as accessible as gas stations are today'' and will feature
special promotions to lure patients from the competition, they say.
That seems to fit more in the manure category.
</P>
<P>
   When the authors turn toward culture, one of their first stops
is the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Director Malcolm Rogers is
quoted as saying that a key to his institution's survival is
getting the word out ``that you aren't a dowager,'' a notion
Salzman and Matathia illustrate with the Herb Ritts and ``Wallace
and Gromit'' shows, the two most appalling ``fine art'' exhibitions
from the MFA's recent past. And the trend will only worsen, it
seems: The Strong Museum in Rochester, for example, sent its guides
to train at a Disney school.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fun is where ``Next'' goes with trends that others
have already noted. For example, no one would argue that privacy
covers the ground it used to, but Matathia and Salzman see its
decline as a potential positive: ``Instead of being ashamed of what
we might consider our perversions or `unnatural' impulses, we'll
see more and more just how many people think and behave the way we
do. And once we realize that our indiscretions, big and small, are
never secret for very long, we'll be encouraged to let our wild
sides out of the closet a lot more often.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the same with ``convergence,'' a tired buzzword that most
often refers to electronics, where televisions become information
appliances. But Salzman and Matathia carry the synthesis further:
``True convergence is the genuine blurring of life and work, home
and office, family and friends, as well as the techie blurring of
PC and TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of their ideas spring from this notion, that lifestyle will
govern all: The death of the permanent employer is leading to an
increase in home offices, which will allow more people to live
where they choose, and many will choose to live in a ``new
urbanist'' setting that emphasizes community, in housing that is
flexible to the needs of the changing family, which may or may not
have two parents, one or more grandparents, or even ``co-parents''
who share the rearing of children.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their prophecies are painfully weak, such as when they
opine that the new ``Star Wars'' installment ``is expected to
dominate movie merchandising for weeks.'' The timing of book
publishing makes it easy to forgive being outdated; more often, the
impression is that they're pretty up-to-date. But one needn't have
been peering tirelessly into the future to figure this one out. And
that ``for weeks'' is awfully tepid.
</P>
<P>
   Other ``predictions'' somehow leave out the predicting part,
stopping at pallid recounting of recent history. Or they border on
the stupid, such as when the authors suggest bravely that Asia has
a lot of potential for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   If these writers are leading us into the future, it's doubtful
that elegant prose will experience a renewal. Terms such as
``multitainment,'' ``virtuality,'' and ``cognitive ergonomics''
abound in ``the world of Next'' (a particularly rankling phrase),
and when the authors say that ``trendtracking is becoming so trendy
that . . . '' it's tough to know whether to chuckle or wince.
Altogether, ``Next'' is a bit of a slog, but Matathia and Salzman
do seem to see enough to justify taking a look at their vision.

   COLD WAR: The end of the Cold War presented the United States
with infinite new possibilities. NATO began taking in former Soviet
satellites. U.S. defense outlays have been dramatically reduced.
And the State Department, with a few notable exceptions, has
literally redrawn the diplomatic map of the world as the United
States has pursued international relationships based on economic
interests rather than ideology. The Cold War's demise, though, has
also challenged the United States to four key imperatives: managing
the collapse of the Soviet Union; helping to negotiate the rise of
China; building a global trading order that provides equity and
opportunity to poor countries as well as rich; and reducing the
risk of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction.

<P>
   Halloween comes just once a year, but language monstrosities are
knocking at our doors day in and day out. Some of them, it's true,
will end up as welcome guests, no more scary than Casper the
Friendly Ghost _ but that's no reason you can't try to fend off the
ones that make your hair stand on end. Some of these
trick-or-treaters deserve sourballs, not sweets.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there's the PR writer who sent out seasonal
recipes from some local restaurants, promising ``a Halloween feast
St. Hallow would be proud of.'' We can't wait to see what they'll
serve up in honor of St. Veteran and St. Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   Close behind is the spirits marketer, hawking some
nutrient-enhanced beverages, whose press release describes him as
``infamous among his peers,'' which may be true but is nothing to
boast about.
</P>
<P>
   But even sourballs are too good for the owners who posted in
their Cambridge, Mass., parking lot a sign that read, ``Violators
will be towed perfunctorily.'' (Were they reaching, pretentiously,
for peremptorily, or trying to improve on promptly?) Soap their
windows, or even their mouths! And the same goes for people who say
supposably for supposedly, or all of the sudden (yes, it's been
seen in these very pages) for all of a sudden.
</P>
<P>
   To The New Yorker, a handful of Gummy Worms for its recent use
of suffice to say; the proper form of this ``fossilized''
subjunctive is suffice it to say, and the writers of the ABC comedy
``Sports Night,'' who got it right last week, go home with the
Hershey Kisses. As for the National Review writer who, in the
current issue, declares that Frost's ``Mending Wall'' is ``a
pro-wall poem'' _ perpetuating the notion that ``Good fences make
good neighbors'' is the moral of the story _ he shall have no treat
but cotton-candy-flavored jelly beans, a lifetime supply of them.
</P>
<P>
   No Baby Ruth bars, either, for the coiners of co-sleeping, the
new terminology for parents' sharing a bed with their infant. It's
our fault, of course _ now that we use sleeping with as a euphemism
for sexual congress, baby-snuggling needs a different phrase. But
did it have to be this one?
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a Three Musketeers salute goes to Scott
Shuger for spreading the word he used in Slate, the on-line
magazine, to describe a newspaper's recycled Monicagate facts:
desiccata, the mummified remains of once-juicy tidbits.
</P>
<P>
   Some treats are in order, too, for Elizabeth Webber and Mike
Feinsilber, compilers of the new Merriam-Webster Dictionary of
Allusions. A kind of Cliff's Notes of culture (and even the
culturally literate among us have our blank spots), the volume
explains the origins of alien corn and anal retentive, of Peck's
bad boy and Philadelphia lawyer. Even if you talk about gilded
youth, you may not know that the original jeunesse doree were rich
toughs who roamed the streets of Paris after the Reign of Terror.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the reward will have to be bite-size Butterfingers,
because there are some silly lapses here. Though a gratifying
number of the illustrative quotes come from the Globe, the bylines
of Lynda Gorov and the late Paul Hirshson are misspelled, as is
author Kurt Andersen's. Most Lewis Carroll fans would tell you
instantly that Alice fell down a rabbit hole to Wonderland, and
not, as the authors have it, a well. (``Very like a well,'' Carroll
calls it, but a well it is not.) Nobody expects perfection, but in
reference books, where credibility is everything, the gremlin count
should be kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   There will be debate, too, about the choices. If Hamlet's ``to
the manner born'' is included, why not ``more honored in the
breach,'' now so often used to mean ``left undone'' rather than
``better not done''?
</P>
<P>
   And along with ``Rosebud'' and ``round up the usual suspects,''
I'd nominate ``the stinkin' badges'' from ``Treasure of the Sierra
Madre.'' It's been in circulation since at least the '60s, and it's
not just the ``Car Talk'' guys who are keeping it alive. The
allusion popped up in US News &AMP; World Report earlier this month, in
a story about the debate over amplification in opera houses; one
troupe, the magazine reported, took the opportunity to boast,
``Amps? We don't need no stinking amps.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a reference book this good, there's always a chance to
get better. So we'll add some Junior Mints to the goody bag, in
honor of the next edition, and hope that benevolent spirits are
watching over the enterprise.

A WORK IN PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ This is where it all begins for the Celtics. It will
officially end April 19. But will that be the end or, as Rick
Pitino has promised, a new beginning?
</P>
<P>
   The season opener against the Raptors presented an interesting
test in that Toronto is deemed to be the team the Celtics had hoped
to be: on the rise with a supernova in waiting, grizzled veterans
to add stability and experience, and an enviable balance of power
and flash.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors are on most people's list to make the playoffs for
the first time. It's hard to make a convincing case for the
1999-2000 Celtics to join them, the coach's assertions to the
contrary as well as a schedule that should tell us most of what we
need to know by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't too long ago that making the playoffs was not even a
topic for conversation amoics fans. But with only one
playoff appearance in the last five years _ a first-round loss to
Orlando in 1995 _ the possibility of postseason play at the
FleetCenter is now the crucial carrot.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino is a master salesman, but his spiel has already worn thin
in town. He and his team were booed last year in the FleetCenter,
supposedly a hospitable environment, and there's no reason to think
it will stop unless the team starts to win. The initial enthusiasm
from 1997 is long gone.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999-2000 Celtics are undersized at key positions. They may
have depth, as the coach insists, but a couple of those players on
the depth chart have no NBA experience. They are young in a league
that devours its young. Their leader, Antoine Walker, is still
searching for league respect and acceptance. Their point guard,
Kenny Anderson, still needs to prove he's symaptico with the coach
and the system, and that he's not injury prone.
</P>
<P>
   Against that discouraging backdrop, Pitino will present a team
which, like all of his teams, works and works. The Celtics will
again be The Team No One Wants To Play, especially on the second
night of back-to-back games. They're like the service academies in
college football: they may not beat you, but they will take an
awful lot out of you. They will win some games they have no
business winning. They will lose some they have no business losing
_ and there are some of those. Chicago, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The press/trap will again be the most visible, distinguishing
feature of this team. How much Pitino uses it will depend on how
much he needs to use it. The inherent problem is that he doesn't
like the first team to work that hard, but the first team has the
players who decide the outcome of games.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to wonder if the novelty of the press has worn off.
In 1997-98, teams were blown away by the relentless pressure; it
had been a decade since anyone had presented it that way (Pitino,
New York) on a relatively consistent basis. Teams and coaches now
know what to expect and, more important, they've seen it and been
through it a few times.
</P>
<P>
   The press also disguises the team's main defensive problem: it
will have trouble defending in halfcourt, man-to-man situations.
That was true last year and it's going to be true this year. With
the new rules, Pitino may use more half-court traps and zones to
mask this shortcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the team has a chance to be decent. Anderson is
coming off an excellent exhibition season. Paul Pierce is already
more confident and assertive. Walker is making his free throws and
looking to pad his assist totals as much as his scoring totals.
</P>
<P>
   The team did pass the ball well in the exhibition season. But
outside of Walker (who is a historically poor percentage shooter)
and Pierce, where are the consistent points going to come from? The
Ron Mercer deal means there are 15 to 18 points that someone needs
to produce. Pitino doesn't feel that will be a major worry and, if
the exhibition season is any yardstick, he's right.
</P>
<P>
   But the Celtics want to run and you need to rebound to do that.
(First, you need to stop the other guy, which they had trouble
doing last season.) The loss of Danny Fortson is a big blow in this
area. He also was voracious on the offensive glass.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics have to know by now what they have in the middle.
Vitaly Potapenko is a tireless worker with a decent touch around
the basket and a wide, chiseled body to help him in post defense.
What he isn't is what they also need from the position: a rebounder
and a shot-blocker. He's going to need to stay on the floor _ no
small feat with the new rules _ and he has to average more than six
rebounds a game. How many starting centers average fewer?
</P>
<P>
   The other possibilities in the middle, Pervis Ellison and Tony
Battie, are essentially power forwards who can block shots and
rebound. But Ellison is habitually iffy and Battie is not a banger.
The Celtics had hoped not to get bullied anymore, but, without
Fortson, they basically have the same crew up front.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers are still unknown quantities. Calbert Cheaney is a
serviceable player and Adrian Griffin looks promising. Wayne Turner
is still learning and Eric Williams can score, but when will he get
on the floor?
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are no different from most teams: they have a lot of
questions that won't be answered for awhile. They have a slew of
new players who are getting accustomed to a new system. Even some
of the returnees occasionally struggle with the details.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino and his troops correctly see a wide-open race in the
East. They see themselves as good enough to be hanging around when
the playoff berths are up for grabs. That's been the goal since
last season went awry and the coach is comfortable with that. At
this point, he has no alternative.

SHORT SEASON WAS NO TURNOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year's NBA lockout-shortened season was good news for
Turner Sports _ ratings increased by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The games drew a 1.8 rating, and with a four-year $890 million
deal on the table, a decline in viewers could have spelled
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin O'Malley, Turner's vice president of programming, said the
lockout _ coupled with the retirement of Michael Jordan _ generated
a lot of resentment among fans, but the bad feelings didn't cause
the gate receipts or television ratings to drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of bad things that could have happened didn't,''
O'Malley said. ``The best thing about last year was that the fans
continued to watch the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner and Fox Sports Net air NBA games, and unlike the NFL, in
which television schedules are set in stone before the beginning of
each season, the NBA is flexible, allowing changes to give hot
teams maximum exposure.
</P>
<P>
   So if the Celtics improve on their mediocre status of the last
two years, the team may receive some national exposure. Most of the
Celtics games will be televised on Fox Sports New England with Mike
Gorman, Tommy Heinsohn, and ``Coach'' Willie Maye.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino guaranteed a playoff berth for his team this season.
Heinsohn said that Pitino has received ``unwarranted criticisms''
for his prediction. ``It was absolutely essential that Rick find
players that could play his style,'' Heinsohn said. ``Rick had to
disengage himself from the vestiges of a system built different
than the one he wanted. Some of the players worked out. Some
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinsohn said Pitino would have liked to have kept Ron Mercer,
but Mercer had become a financial burden. ``The team didn't want to
pay the price that Master P was asking for Mercer,'' Heinsohn said.
``But in the end they get Danny Fortson, a terrific addition to the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   He may be, but Fortson is out at least eight weeks with an
injured foot. But Heinsohn said Calbert Cheaney and Eric Williams
are good additions, as is rookie Adrian Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Celtics will be a fun team,'' Maye said. ``They might
surprise a few teams at the end of the season. The outside
consulting of Bill Russell and Dave Cowens has helped instill the
Celtics tradition of winning. And they have enough young guns to
definitely bring excitement to the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the lockout, last year's playoff sechedule crammed to
the point where Turner was running games on TBS and TNT
simultaneously. The ratings suffered as a result, but Turner still
averaged nearly 3 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But the playoffs are a long way away. The biggest obstacle for
viewers in the beginning will be the referees. The NBA instituted
new rules to prohibit defenders from impeding offensive players,
which will result in many added stoppages in play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expect to see lots of players in quick foul trouble as the
referees give their whistles a workout early in the season,'' said
CNN/SI's NBA insider, Phil Taylor. ``Good free throw- shooting
teams should have an advantage while defenders try to adjust to new
limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinsohn applauded the rule changes. ``I've been blowing the
bugle for change for a long time,'' Heinsohn said. ``Ever since the
Pistons won their championships, the game has been muscle-ball. The
Pistons and that style of play has taken all of the fluidity and
beauty out of the game. It was lineman football. The result was the
opposite of what the game is about. Players will have to play
defense with their feet and not their forearms and biceps.''
</P>
<P>
   Unimpeded movement could help an uptempo team like the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eastern Conference is so weak that a dark horse could make
it all the way to the conference final against either New York or
Miami,'' Taylor said.

HMOS SUFFER EROSION IN IMAGE, VALUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We live in a funny time. We have companies with no history at
all that are worth billions of dollars, and companies with a long
track record that are worth nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   The latter are called HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, New England's largest HMO, is
trying to unload its money-losing Rhode Island operations. Harvard
Pilgrim has 155,000 customers in Rhode Island who pay monthly
premiums. There are no takers for the business.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts Health Plan is leaving Maine. It too can find no buyers
for its customers. When Kaiser Permanente pulled out of New England
earlier this year, it transferred its members to other HMOs. Those
familiar with the deal say little or no money changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``HMOs are like nuclear power plants,'' says one gloomy HMO
executive. It is not a bad analogy. Just as nuclear power once was
considered the answer to our energy problems, HMOs were once seen
as the answer to our health care problems. As the public image of
both have faded _ fairly or unfairly _ their values have eroded
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Need some evidence?
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1992 when a Cambridge-based HMO called Bay State Health
Care failed, a number of its competitors, both locally and
nationally, expressed interest in buying it. Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of Massachusetts eventually purchased Bay State by assuming
its substantial debts. In today's climate, rivals are content to
wait for a weak competitor to die. Then they can move in and pick
up many of the customers for nothing. ``It is actually quite a
rational strategy,'' says Steven Tringale, a health care consultant
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, for-profit HMOs were acquiring each other at
prices that worked out to between $1,000 and $1,500 per member.
According to one investment banker, the current acquisition price
for healthy HMOs is probably no more than $300 per member.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices of the investor-owned HMOs tell much the same
story. In early 1996, United Healthcare, a large publicly-traded
HMO, sold for about $65 per share. Today it sells for just over
$50. Over the same time period the Dow Jones industrial average
doubled; the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index climbed more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Pacificare, a big California HMO, has fallen from $90 per share
to $40 since 1996. It currently trades at a price-to- earnings
ratio of 7. The stock market as a whole has a p/e ratio of 32. A
stock with a low p/e ratio is one that the market feels has no
future.
</P>
<P>
   How did the industry fall this far? Stephen Caulfield has one
answer. ``The arithmetic of this business is crummy,'' says
Caulfield, a health specialist with the Chickering Group in
Cambridge. By Caulfield's reckoning, in normal times the typical
HMO spends 11 cents on administrative costs and 84 cents on medical
bills. The remaining nickel is profit. Since you can make just as
much by sticking your money in Treasury bills, asks Caulfield,
``Why would you want to take the risk and be in managed care?''
</P>
<P>
   The math has been even worse for Massachusetts' big HMOs, all of
whom operate as nonprofits. Most of the local HMOs are currently in
the red, in large part, because they held prices down while medical
costs were rising.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the lawsuits. Some of the same lawyers that
sued the tobacco companies have filed class-action suits against
the major investor-owned HMOs. State law limits the liability of
Massachusetts' nonprofit HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so downbeat about prospects for managed care.
HMO stocks rebounded somewhat Monday after an analyst for
Prudential Securities recommended them. The pro-HMO case goes as
follows: HMOs may be at a low ebb, but nothing fundamentally has
changed with the business. Once rates go up _ a process that is
already underway _ profit margins will rise and the stocks will
follow them up. Using the same logic, Massachusetts' nonprofit HMOs
should recover too.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they will. But what if the world decides HMOs are
permanently damaged goods? ``HMOs don't seem to be the solution,''
says Stephen Weiner, a veteran health care lawyer at Boston's Mintz
Levin. ``We seem to have all the same old intractable problems that
we had before managed care.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Turnbull, a lecturer at the Harvard School of Public
Health, agrees that HMOs are facing a crucial test. ``Can they do
something about the tough issues like drug costs or the cost of new
technology? I don't know,'' says Turnbull.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does anyone else. They don't know how the lawsuits will
turn out either. Which is why investors _ and even people in the
HMO business _ are reluctant to put more money into HMOs at the
moment.

BOURQUE MAY BE DRAWING CLOSER TO A CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's been more than 20 seasons of excellence for Bruins
defenseman Ray Bourque, who teammate Kyle McLaren once said has
probably logged enough mileage on his skates to have circled the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But speculation continues to arise throughout the NHL regarding
how long Bourque will play. He is signed through this season, and
there are some close to him who feel this will be his last year.
</P>
<P>
   Two former Bruins, who declined to be identified, said they were
sure this would be Bourque's final year. Bourque has maintained he
won't make up his mind until later in the season, perhaps into next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't told me, but it wouldn't surprise me if it is his
last year,'' said Steve Freyer, Bourque's agent and close friend.
</P>
<P>
   Freyer said there were two schools of thought on the subject.
One revolves around the system Bourque plays under with coach Pat
Burns, which favors an extension of his career. The other is the
grind involved in making it through the season at the level Bourque
expects from himself. Bourque has said all along that if he felt he
wasn't playing to a level acceptable to him, he'd call it a career.
So far, there has been little to indicate that physically he
couldn't still do it. The mental part, though, is just as
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's his last year purely because of the mental
element of it,'' said Freyer. ``I think he also knows under (coach
Pat) Burns's system, he could play another four or five years if he
didn't have a catastrophic injury. It's just getting up. It's
mentally getting up game after game, especially three games in four
nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to diminish the physical part of it because it is
tough. (He says) it is tough to get up out of bed some mornings. I
think mentally he's burnt. If the team makes some kind of huge move
this year and ended up in the finals, maybe that would bring him
back. That might be a factor that would change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in his heart, and I'm not sure he's made it up yet, but if
in his heart, he's saying, `This is it,' the only thing that would
bring him back is the notion that next year they could win it all.
Who wouldn't want to win it all, win the Stanley Cup? It's so hard
to get up and satisfy himself that he's playing the way Ray Bourque
should play. In his 21st year, he's still one of the top six
defensemen in the game if not the top three.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter when Bourque decides he is done playing, whether he
won a championship shouldn't reflect on his Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are Hall of Fame stars who haven't won a championship,''
said Freyer. ``I don't think it's diminished them. All you have to
do is look across town at Ted Williams. I don't think it has
diminished his stature or Carl Yastrzemski. The astute sports
person understands that one player can't win a championship, as
great as he is.''
</P>
<P>
   As tremendous a career as Bourque has had with his five Norris
Trophies, his 12 first-team All-Star designations, and his scoring
records, those who know Bourque say his real strength lies in his
sterling character.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's absolutely rock solid, loyal, hard-working, dedicated and
sincere,'' said Freyer. ``All the good traits you would want to see
in another human being. I can't think of anyone else I'd rather
have a foxhole with me. Susan (Freyer's wife) and I, whenever we
travel, we leave the Bourque's names in case something happens to
our kids. We know they would look after them and take care of them
and make the right decision if something had to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren, whom Bourque took under his wing when McLaren was a
rookie in 1995, said he still looks at Bourque with tremendous awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``His life is in order,'' said McLaren. ``He knows what comes
first, and what means the most to him is his family. I respect him
a hundred percent for that. You look at what's going on in sports,
people dying in plane wrecks, everything is secondary to your
family. There's so much you can learn from him. He's upped my level
of hockey by tenfold or even 20 from what I knew before. Off ice,
it's just everything _ family, leadership, knowing when to push
myself. It's hard to describe what (he's learned from Bourque)
because it's a handful.''
</P>
<P>
   The running joke around the dressing room is that each coach who
has come in during Bourque's later years has vowed to reduce his
ice time in an effort not to burn him out. Burns was the first to
say, ``Why would I do that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when Steve Kasper came in; he said he was going to
try to cut back on Ray's ice time,'' said McLaren. ``The first
game, I think he played 25 minutes and the next game it was up to
32. I don't think anyone is playing as much as him at his age. Some
nights, I think I'm playing a lot and I look at his ice time and
think, `Whoa!' There's something about him that just keeps ticking.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not as if he's playing against the third and fourth
liners where he can go out and float around. It's going to be a
very sad day when we find out what's going on. It won't be that we
roll over and play dead. But it's going to be a big shock to
everybody. People have to know it's coming. I wish he could play
until he was 50. He's better than half the guys in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Sweeney said he could do nothing else but marvel at Bourque
last April during the Bruins' first-round playoff series against
Carolina when Bourque played 53 1/2 minutes of a double-overtime
contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember sitting in the locker room after that and he had
four bottles of the 20-ounce waters as soon as he was in the room
after he got off the ice,'' said Sweeney. ``When he got on the bus,
he had four more. He had four more when he got on the plane before
he had eaten. Other guys, there might have been a cry for
intravenous fluids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who said, before talking to the press, `Could you
give me one more minute (in order to rehydrate)? That's all he
asked for. Everybody has been very fortunate to play with him, to
watch him play, and to be a member of the community that he's given
so much to.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Heinze said the toughest part has been that Bourque's
measuring stick has been himself all these years. Those are pretty
high standards to live up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really look at it, he's probably played two careers
with the amount he plays vs. a normal player,'' said Heinze. ``It's
just amazing. If you just sit down and look at the stats _ the
amount of minutes played, the lack of games missed. He's playing
the most of everyone on the team. Every year since I've been here,
they say they're going to cut down his ice time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never do because (A) we need him and (B) he can do it and
he wants to do it. The argument was always was he tired for the
playoffs, but you look at the Carolina series, the answer is no.
Adrenaline takes over and passion and all those things he does with
the attitude he has, he's our best player in the playoffs, too.''
</P>
<P>

   President/general manager Harry Sinden said that rookie
defenseman Jonathan Girard will not be sent back to his team in the
Quebec Major Junior Hockey League and instead will remain with the
Bruins the entire season.

EXPECT A SLOW CHANGE IN THE NBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Get ready for ``NBA, the Director's Cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The implementation of new rules for the 1999-2000 season has
stirred a lot of debate on whether the game can free itself from
its shackles and let free-form basketball return. The theory is it
will, in time.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, as seen through the Celtics' exhibitions, is that
there's only one certainty: We will have longer, tedious games with
more fouls, more free throws, less flow, and overall ennui.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refs ain't gonna know what they want to do. We ain't gonna
know what we want to do,'' said Seattle's Gary Payton. ``We're
going to get fouled. Everybody's going to start fouling out. Y'all
ain't gonna like this game. So, they want to play that way? It's
going to be a long year.''
</P>
<P>
   It already has been a long exhibition season. The last quarter
of the Celtics' last game painted a horrifying portrait of what
these changes have wrought, however well-intentioned they may be.
It took a jaw-dropping 49 minutes to play that 12-minute period _
the game itself went 2 hours 36 minutes _ and referees Luis Grillo,
Hank Armstrong, and Mike Callahan called 25 fouls in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The longest stretch of uninterrupted play in the quarter was 42
seconds. The Celtics and Wizards combined for 38 free throws in the
quarter, a staggering 101 in the game. Seventy fouls were called.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Celtics averaged 24 fouls per game. In the
exhibition season, they averaged 32, a 33 percent increase. They
were fouled an average of 20 times a game last season. In the
exhibition season, that figure jumped to almost 30, Tommy
Heinsohn's shrieks notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The five regulation games for which time was kept (there was no
time for the game in Lexington, Ky.) averaged 2 hours 27 minutes,
with a high of 2:36. Last year, the Celtics played 47 regulation
games and only two went longer than 2:27. Can we next expect Kevin
Costner to be named the NBA's director of operations?
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson, the new Lakers coach, thinks the number of
timeouts, both coaches' and television, are to blame. Last season,
to give the TV folks some extra revenue for the lockout losses, the
NBA instituted TV timeouts early in the second and fourth quarters.
They remain, and Jackson said that was among the biggest surprises
of his return to coaching. (He really must have had the dish off in
Kalispell.) Coaches have seven timeouts in a game plus an addition
20-second one per half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The TV timeouts is what stops it,'' said Rick Pitino. ``I
think they could limit the coaches' timeouts. A 20-second before
the half is fine with me. I just want them at the end of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jackson, ``I think it's an unfortunate part of the game
that we don't have a consistent period of play in the game that's
not impeded by timeouts. There are now up to 16 to 20 timeouts that
can happen in a game, not counting the possibility for equipment or
blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a 48-minute game, we have a very little period of time in
which we play end-to-end, and I think that those disruptions really
change the flow of the game. I think that's an unfortunate thing
that the league is really going to have to address because we need
to have the ability to flow and play the game unimpeded. It makes
our game a pleasurable thing to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the NBA viewer-friendly, as opposed to the eye pollution
we've been witnessing the last several years, was supposed to be
the reason for the rules changes. The league decided it was time to
address the alarming decline in scoring, which is, after all, the
most exciting part of the sport. (Going at this through the rules
and not the muzzling of coaches was the only option.)
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change is supposed to allow players to move freely
across the lane without running into an elbow, arm, body, or other
impediment. Words like ``fluid'' were used to describe what the NBA
wanted. This rule took dead aim at the so-called thug teams, such
as Miami, New York, and even Utah. If called literally a decade
ago, there would be no championship banners hanging in the Palace
of Auburn Hills.
</P>
<P>
   This rule alone eliminated one of Pat Riley's famous practice
drills. Or should have. Riley would have one player stand alone, in
the key, and have two columns of players on either side.
Alternately, the players would run to the man in the key, whose job
was to physically forearm them out of the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was there a pad used in this?'' Marty Conlon, a two-year Heat
veteran, was asked?
</P>
<P>
   ``No pad. Just your arm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What percentage of Riley's practices do you think had to be
reconfigured with the rules changes?'' Conlon was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 50 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Riley isn't even interested in the changes as they might
benefit his offense. When the officials met to discuss possible
changes, there was one example of a player using a pick-and-roll to
get free for a 15-foot jump shot. ``My guys don't want to take that
shot,'' Riley said, apparently meaning they're either too bad to
take it or prefer the safer route of a dunk or layup.)
</P>
<P>
   But even with this supposed concentration on off-the-ball
maneuvering, Pitino said he watched in amazement during a game
against Atlanta when player after player would get stopped going
through the lane and nothing was called. In the meantime, touch
fouls on the perimeter that in no way affected play repeatedly were
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could cut out 10 little fouls this way and call a couple
for chucking and grabbing, we'd have it better,'' he said. ``I
think they want to get to that. But they call five touches a game
where we instead should have freedom of movement. We got stood up
on our cuts and they all should have been called. The way you (used
to) stop a screen, you would slide through or go over the top. Now,
you stop a screen by stopping it from occuring, by holding it up.
That stops freedom of movement and makes for ugly basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to get back to freedom of movement. If you're
going to keep the dimensions of the basketball court the same, you
have to have freedom of movement. If you don't, all you have is
football.''
</P>
<P>
   The other changes involve zone defenses, which no one, including
the referees, understands. It's supposed to encourage teams to find
open men instead of dumping it into the post. There's also the
Barkley/Jackson Rule, which prevents a player from backing his
opponent down into the post and holding the ball for five seconds
or more. Mark Jackson and Charles Barkley were masters at that.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a change in the resetting of the shot clock; in
certain situations, it will be reset to 14 seconds, not 24. This
may be the only new rule that shortens the game. Otherwise, if what
we've seen so far is any indication, we can expect longer games,
more fouls, more free throws, more yawns, and, initially, less of
what the rules are designed to promote.

COMING ATTRACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; This Friday, after the markets close, US District Court Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson is generally expected to issue his
``proposed findings of fact'' in the government antitrust case
against Microsoft Corp., the great case of the 1990s. The
Government Printing Office has created a special site for viewing
the lengthy document (http://usvms.gpo.gov)
</P>
<P>
   The findings will be a firm indication of how Jackson may be
expected to rule in his ``findings of law,'' which will constitute
the verdict in the case. If the court finds Microsoft guilty of
anticompetitive practices, the proceedings will move to an
elaborate remedy hearing. Thus the findings of fact will give the
first hints of whatever leverage the antitrust division of the
Justice Department might have in proposing a remedy.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fairly widespread expectation both among students of
law and analysts of public opinion that the case has gone badly for
Microsoft. The burden of the government's case has been that
Microsoft routinely has thrown its weight around against
competitors in the marketplaces large and small.
</P>
<P>
   The latest examples of Microsoft's conduct in the political
sphere does little to dispel the feeling it has lost its sense of
proportion. A September mailing to its 2 million shareholders urged
a grass-roots lobbying campaign directed to congressional
representatives against the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Systematic efforts by Microsoft to hobble the antitrust
division's budget in future years in the congressional
appropriations process have been disclosed. And who knows what form
the giant corporation's pleadings will take in the course of the
coming presidential campaign?
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that most of the action in the case will be resolved
before the election takes place. So the really interesting question
is: What measures will the antitrust division prescribe to limit
Microsoft's power in the quicklychanging world of information
services?
</P>
<P>
   The landscape has changed greatly since the government first
sought relief against Microsoft for monopolizing the market for
personal computer operating systems. The main difference is the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Almost overnight in 1993, the Internet seemed to render obsolete
shrink-wrapped software for individual computers. Instead, the
dependability and efficiency of the Internet offered a bright
future for subscription computing, especially after the easy-to-use
World Wide Web was introduced
</P>
<P>
   Subscription computing? There is nothing especially esoteric
about it; in fact, many people enjoy it now, in the form of
answering services offered by local telephone companies. Soon to
come are subscription games enjoyed by many players using
``information appliances,'' exemplified by Sega's Dreamcast and
Sony's Play Station.
</P>
<P>
   Forming now on the horizon are any number of application service
providers, or ASPs, whose business is to create specialized on-line
systems for individuals and, especially, businesses. Some, like
Micronpc.com, have even begun advertising on television their word
processing and spreadsheed services.
</P>
<P>
   In due course another tectonic shift looms, a re-intermediation
if you like. The armies of systems-integrators and tech-reps who
now maintain elaborate individual systems for corporations
gradually will be drawn off into ASPs; payroll services and health
records will be maintained centrally by large information utilities
and swung round the telecommunications grid, much as electricity is
generated and distributed now.
</P>
<P>
   It is this world that the Justice Department is thinking about
when it mulls measures that might be taken against Microsoft. The
aim is to prevent the company from using its enormous power to set
standards to build a monopoly even further reaching than the
operating systems corner it is said to enjoy today. Little is known
about what remedy the government might seek except that clearly it
sees the software drama being played out on a global, not a
national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Thus all eyes are on Joel Klein, chief of the antitrust
division. Not since William Baxter, antitrust chief for Ronald
Reagan, decided in 1982 to drop the case against IBM Corp. and
break up the Bell System instead, has so much depended on a
decision. Then it was American industrial competitiveness that was
at stake. Today, given Microsoft's enormous power as American's
biggest corporation, it is political democracy.

THE CASE FOR DOW 36 GAZILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: (equals) and (plus) represent the symbol for the word)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now, most cynics have had their way with a new book called
``Dow 36,000.'' Written by James Glassman, a former business
columnist at the Washington Post, and Kevin Hassett, a former
senior economist at the Federal Reserve Board, it postulates that
the Dow Jones Industrial Average should not be slumming in the
neighborhood of 10,000 but putting on the ritz at 36,000.
</P>
<P>
   One critic dared to challenge the math proposed by Glassman and
Hassett. Allan Sloan of Newsweek wrote, ``The authors plug in these
numbers: 5.5 percent Treasury yield (equals) Dow dividend yield
(plus) 5 percent growth.'' Then he explained how the authors were
playing ``fast and loose with numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The mathematical machinations of cynics never cease to amaze. I
have scrutinized the state of the market closely and have come up
with a theory that not only supports the optimism of Glassman and
Hassett but proves these two fine gentlemen have underestimated
seriously the potential of the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   My thesis, based on a simple mathematical equation, is this: A
perfectly reasonable price for the Dow Jones Industrial Average is
36 gazillion. Before I proceed any further I'd like to make clear
in raw numbers what I mean by 36 gazillion. As I mentioned earlier,
the Dow right now stands at about 10,000, expressed in high math as
(1 (plus) 5z). To reach my forecast, the index will have to climb a
tad further to 36,000,000,000,
000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, or (36 (plus)
48z). Any person with a shred of common sense knows that for the
Dow Industrials in today's world a level of 36 gazillion is in fact
a low-ball projection .
</P>
<P>
   I begin by disproving the dubious assumption that humans are by
nature given to bouts of financial euphoria that drive stock prices
up to unreasonable levels. I will show that the renowned economist
John Kenneth Galbraith was in a state of babbling delirium when he
wrote, ``And thus the rule, supported by the experience of
centuries: the speculative episode always ends not with a whimper
but with a bang.''
</P>
<P>
   My theorem rests on a refutation of this psychological flimflam.
First, I am able to discount the concept of financial euphoria
quite simply by dividing it in half. I express this mathematically
in the equation: euphoria 2 (equals) 1/2 euphoria. Having cut
euphoria in half, I will now eliminate the notion altogether. I
accomplish this by exposing 1/2 euphoria to a wickedly cold
temperature, roughly equal to my critics' frosty glares.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1/2 euphoria is frozen solid, represented
mathematically as (f) 1/2 euphoria, I climb 13 flights of stairs (8
(plus) 5 (equals) 13) and toss the thing from an open window. The
frozen 1/2 euphoria will hit the ground at a velocity of 43 miles
per hour, represented by (v) 43 mph, and will shatter to
smithereens, which in geologic terms is known as dust. The equation
looks like this: (f) 1/2 euphoria (at) (8 (plus) 5 (equals) 13) x
(v) 43 mph (equals) 0.
</P>
<P>
   This simple equation proves beyond a doubt that investors are
not afflicted by financial euphoria. By eliminating euphoria as the
scourge of the market, I remove the crucial obstruction to
long-term stock market optimism and demonstrate the viability of a
sustained bull run in the Dow Industrials to the level of 36
gazillion. Mathematically the conclusion is expressed thus: (f) 1/2
euphoria (at) (8 (plus) 5 (equals) 13) x (v) 43 mph (equals) 0
((plus) 36 gazillion) (equals) 36 gazillion.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers don't lie.

TRAVAILS OF A GOAL-DIGGER

<P>
   Gabriel Batistuta has demonstrated in the last week how
dramatically the fortunes of a goal scorer can change. Batistuta
converted a powerful and dramatic goal from a virtually impossible
angle to provide the difference in Fiorentina's 1-0 victory over
Arsenal last week.
</P>
<P>
   The victory qualified Fiorentina for the next round of the
Champion's League. But against Serie A opponent Torino Sunday,
Batistuta missed open goals, skied a penalty kick. Only a
90th-minute score by Abel Balbo allowed Fiorentina to tie, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Batistuta, the all-time leading goal scorer in Argentine
national team history, had scored 129 goals in Italy before this
season.

   Real Madrid is finding life difficult in the Spanish Liga. Real
and Porto have qualified for the next round of the Champions League
from Group E. But Real Madrid has not won since the second week of
the Liga season and fell to 12th place with 12 points after a 3-1
loss to Atletico Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Madrid's No. 3 team, Rayo Vallecano, is the surprise
leader after a 2-1 win at Valladolid, thanks in part to the
goalkeeping of Kasey Keller. Rayo plays host to Real Madrid
Saturday.

   Last week, Argentinian soccer took a backseat to presidential
elections and Velez Sarsfeld's Paraguayan goalkeeper Jose Luis
Chilavert urged newly elected Fernando de la Rua to deport the
``golpisa'' Gen. Lino Oviedo, who has been in exile near Tierra del
Fuego. Chilavert remained in the headlines this weekend by scoring
his 37th goal for Velez, a free kick in a 1-0 victory over Gimnasia
y Escrima. River Plate remained in first place as Eduardo Coudet
and Pablo Aimar converted in a 2-0 victory over Newell's Old Boys.
Javier Saviola, the 18-year-old star of River Plate, set up Aimar's
goal and will likely be the next mega-transfer to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And Diego Maradona celebrated his 39th birthday Saturday and
announced he wants to return to play for Boca Juniors in the Copa
Libertadores. But neither Mauricio Macri, president of the club,

return.

   Corinthians held first place in Brazil, but seemed unmotivated
in a 4-0 loss to Atletico-Minas Gerais, breaking a six-game
unbeaten streak. Corinthians has a 3-point lead over Vasco da Gama
and Cruzeiro and has already qualified for the next round of the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Oswaldo de Oliveira had a difficult act to follow when he
succeeded current national team coach Wanderley Luxemburgo. But de
Oliveira has kept the team intact, though goalkeeper Dida, Edilson,
and Vampeta have received huge offers from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to coach Corinthians,'' de Oliveira said. ``It's
very exhausting, consuming. It's adrenaline rushes, stomach aches,
pressure, sleepless nights. Nobody leaves Corinthians the same as
they entered. But it's greatly satisfying to work here.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmundo, who has been spending nights in jail after being
convicted of vehicular homicide, scored his 11th and 12th goals of
the season as Vasco edged Atletico-Paranaense, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Toninho Cerezo, coach of fourth-place Vitoria, has compensated
for the loss of Yugoslavian striker Petkovic to Venezia by bringing
in young, unproven players. Cerezo, formerly a star with Roma and
Sampdoria, is the only member of Brazil's 1982 World Cup team
currently achieving high-level success as a coach. Paulo Roberto
Falcao, Edinho, and Junior are working as commentators. Others such
as Socrates (Cabofriense) are with low-profile teams. ``Almost all
of the ex-players of '82 that tried a career in coaching are rich
and don't want to live with the instability of the coaching
profession in Brazil,'' said Cerezo, 44, who has maintained his
playing weight of 165 pounds.

<P>
   Many of the MLS's weaknesses are on display in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus presented a conservative lineup against D.C. United,
losing any chance to gain momentum by playing not to lose in the
opening game of the Eastern Conference finals. The Crew has enough
creative and dynamic players to challenge D.C. United, but not
enough of them were in the lineup until late in the game in a 2-1
defeat. The Crew entered the match with an 11-game winless streak
at RFK Stadium, coach Tom Fitzgerald should be secure with a
two-year contract, and there was no reason for the team not to have
performed freely, with a nothing-to-lose attitude. But, even with
Brian Maisonneuve out, Fitzgerald failed to use Andy Williams, who
would have thrived against the wide-open style of United,
especially without suspended Richie Williams to shut down the
midfield.
</P>
<P>
   In the Western Conference final, Dallas has performed
purposefully and seemed prepared to challenge Los Angeles. In fact,
Ariel Graziani's excellent finish off a fine overhead pass from
Paul Broome should have been enough for a regulation-time tie
Sunday. But Broome and goalkeeper Matt Jordan made fatal mistakes
on the deciding goal by Ezra Hendrickson in the final minute.
Broome failed to defend Hendrickson properly, allowing the shot,
which deflected off Dallas's Brian Haynes and inside the near post
for a 2-1 Galaxy victory. Jordan simply must defend the near post
in that situation.
</P>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the great Holy Grails in the world of telecommunications
today is known as ``convergence,'' the quest to get all your
communications needs _ local and long-distance, Internet and data _
served by a single company through a single connection into your
building.
</P>
<P>
   But a quip spreading in some telecom-analyst circles these days
holds that convergence is a lot like sex in high school: There are
far more people saying they're doing it, or talking about doing it,
than actually doing it.
</P>
<P>
   eptions are CTC Communications, a former Bell Atlantic
sales agency in Waltham, Mass. now bringing former Bell customers
onto its Powerpath network, and Winstar, a national pioneer in
fixed wireless connections to office towers.
</P>
<P>
   While many companies say they are moving toward converged
services or want to, CTC and Winstar are thought to be at the head
of the pack of telecom businesses that are serving Greater Boston
businesses with the one connection.
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Makris, a senior data communications analyst with Boston
consultants The Yankee Group, said companies such as CTC and
Winstar can tell business customers: ``We'll put a single box on
your premises, plug everything into this box, and we'll manage it
for you. That's a very compelling argument. Plus, you'll save 20 to
40 percent'' over the cost of dealing with multiple providers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides what some call ``the single throat-to-choke issue'' when
things break down, Makris said many companies also find they get
better, faster service from small, hungry telecom startups such as
CTC and Winstar. ``To them I'm a bigger person than I am with Bell
Atlantic, where I'm a nobody,'' Makris said.
</P>
<P>
   But while moving to a single, state-of-the-art connection can be
a way to save money and improve services compared to a traditional
company, such as Bell Atlantic, a number of customers remain
reluctant to cut themselves entirely off the Bell Atlantic network.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much it may offer, ``If that one wire goes down,
you're sunk,'' said Annabel Z. Dodd, author of ``The Essential
Guide to Telecommunications'' and an adjunct engineering professor
at Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   While CTC and Winstar are both providing all-in-one-pipe telecom
links to dozens of businesses, they are doing it in very different
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Winstar's system uses very-high-frequency radio to link rooftop
communications gear to dishes above the 24th floor of its switching
center in downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   CTC, on the other hand, typically uses fiber-optic T1
connections to and from a business site to link up to its $35
million fiber-optic network, which now extends from Portland,
Maine, to New Jersey and is to be built out further west and south
at a projected cost of another $65 million.
</P>
<P>
   In September, CTC installed its first 58 Powerpath connections.
It is hooking up another 150 over the next two months before a
full-scale commercial rollout next year. The company already has
contracts for more than 270 Powerpath connections, according to
company executive vice president David Mahan, who said customers
will save 10 percent to 40 percent on bills.
</P>
<P>
   DeWolfe Realty, with 101 offices in New England, is among the
first customers to sign up for a Powerpath, which has been
installed in 30 of its offices in Maine, eastern Massachusetts and
Rhode Island. The company is using the system for voice and data
calls and plans to use it soon for video-based training sessions
that now require agents to travel to a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are immense cost savings to be had,'' said Brian Lynch,
DeWolfe's director of information services. ``There is nobody else
out there from my perspective who has the infrastructure that CTC
has put into place.''
</P>
<P>
   Another CTC Powerpath customer, Dean LeClerc of Whalley Computer
Associates, said: ``I sell people CTC's product almost before I
sell my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Whalley designs and installs computer systems for small- and
medium-size businesses. LeClerc said half-jokingly that by
persuading customers to use CTC, ``It means they have that much
more money to spend with me.''
</P>
<P>
   CTC uses Cisco-made switching equipment, leases interstate fiber
capacity from Level 3 and Northeast Optical Networks, and currently
resells long-distance service from Frontier and Sprint. In time it
expects to move increasing amounts of long-distance calling to its
own network as it expands to cover the Boston-Washington corridor,
where an estimated 65 percent of all US data traffic starts or
terminates.
</P>
<P>
   CTC got into directly serving customers after more than a decade
acting as a top sales agent for Bell Atlantic to business
customers. Bell Atlantic won a temporary restraining order in
January 1998 blocking CTC from taking its former customers, but
last February the companies reached a secret settlement allowing
CTC to move ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 1998, CTC's total access line equivalents _ phone
numbers plus data bandwidth access measured as voice-line
equivalents _ has jumped from 17,600 to more than 226,000, as
revenues have more than quintupled. Almost all of those, however,
are local or data lines purchased from Bell Atlantic, but in time
the company expects a growing number will be Powerpath connections
as it moves businesses to CTC's network.
</P>
<P>
   CTC also cannot yet claim to offer total convergence, because
customers still must be provided with a Bell Atlantic connection
for local phone service (which CTC typically will buy on a
wholesale basis from the phone company and resell in a package
bill). Over the next year CTC plans to move local calling into its
network as well, Mahan said.
</P>
<P>
   One limitation to Winstar's service is that prospective
customers must be accessible through a line of sight to its
network. Also, because of snow and rain, Winstar connections are
considered reliable only up to 1.2 miles of transmission distance,
said Richard St. George, senior operations manager. ``We won't be a
ubiquitous carrier,'' acknowledged Johnson, who adds that Winstar
is years from offering residential service.
</P>
<P>
   By avoiding the huge labor costs of stringing fiber-optic
connections into buildings, Winstar can offer a T1 connection for
$699 a month, compared to $1,800 or more for a Bell Atlantic or
AT&AMP;T/Teleport line, Johnson said. Winstar offers customers who sign
up for fast Internet access a year of free local phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Some Winstar customers, however, have been reluctant to sever
themselves from Bell Atlantic or traditional providers. Larry
Stevens, office administrator for Peabody &AMP; Arnold, a law firm with
110 attorneys in Boston and about 15 more in Portland and
Providence, said Winstar access proved crucial last year when a Big
Dig construction accident flooded and destroyed the switch room at
their Rowes Wharf offices.
</P>
<P>
   But, Stevens said, ``I don't think of one as being the backup to
the other. I've had Bell service go down, and I've replaced them
with Winstar, and I've had Winstar service go down, and I've
replaced them with Bell. I doubt there will ever be a time when I
put all my eggs in one basket, because the technology changes so
rapidly and the costs change so rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My only job is to make sure when lawyers pick up the phone,
they get dial tone. If lawyers can't talk, they can't bill,''
Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Richard Spinelli, information technology manager for
Holland &AMP; Knight, an international law firm with a 110-lawyer
office in Boston, said Winstar seems to be ``on the cutting edge,
and they seem to be able to turn around an order or a request for
services a lot faster than traditional providers like Bell Atlantic
or AT&AMP;T.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``We're not going to bring everything off Bell
Atlantic or AT&AMP;T. We don't know how good Winstar will be over time
providing dial tone to us.''

O'Donnell, Zellweger remake 1925 Keaton classic 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By Bob Strauss 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The difference between classic cinema and modern movies doesn't
get much more evident than it does with ``The Bachelor.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening Friday, the romantic comedy starring Chris O'Donnell and
Renee Zellweger is definitely a creature of the '90s, full of talk
about how women and men don't understand each other but long for a
perfect union anyway. The story revolves around the efforts of
Jimmy Shannon (O'Donnell's character) to secure a bride in a
24-hour period after fumbling several attempted proposals to his
true love, Anne (Zellweger). If he doesn't wed in time, he'll
forfeit a $10 million inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that to its source material, Buster Keaton's 1925 comedy
``Seven Chances.'' Though it has virtually the same plot, the
silent classic _ actually, one of Keaton's second-rung works, but,
considering his genius, a classic compared to most other comedies _
is pretty much about setting up an outlandish series of sight gags
as Keaton is chased through town and country by hundreds of eager
would-be brides.
</P>
<P>
   A thousand brides inhabit the climax of ``Bachelor,'' too. But
the new movie is more about feelings than slapstick free-for-alls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't seen `Seven Chances' until I read (Steve Cohen's)
script for `The Bachelor,''' admits O'Donnell, whose company George
Street Pictures developed and co-produced the new film. ``It's a
neat movie; the silent films had to be so creative with visual gags
to make people laugh. And the chase sequence! They had a lot of
brides, lots of extras, boulders coming down the hill...
</P>
<P>
   ``But we wanted to emphasize the romance in our film,'' adds
O'Donnell, 29. ``It's a tough thing to balance the romance and the
comedy of it. So much of `Seven Chances' is the chase sequence. We
actually had more footage of our chase that we cut out, just
because the film really didn't need it.''
</P>
<P>
   British director Gary Sinyor, who makes his Hollywood debut with
``Bachelor,'' was equally unfamiliar with the Keaton original.
</P>
<P>
   ``The script was really very good, it had Chris attached and, in
that final act, it had something I'd never seen before on film,
which was the brides,'' Sinyor admits. ``It seemed to me a very
original take on romantic comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The director was eventually set straight. But after viewing
``Seven Chances,'' he had no trepidation about remaking the work of
one of cinema's greatest filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the set-piece bridal sequences were fantastic, they were
sort of written out of this movie,'' Sinyor confirms. ``What I hope
we have here is a film that people get more involved in, involved
in the characters and the romance and the tension between the two
of them. Test audiences' reactions seemed to be that they wanted to
see Chris and Renee get together, and not me showing off how many
brides I could get chasing through tunnels and stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading lady rounded out the class of film appreciation
flunkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know about the Buster Keaton movie; we never
talked about it,'' Zellweger confesses. ``I'm ignorant when it
comes to films. I haven't even seen it yet, but I'm trying to. I
can never remember the title; everybody just says, `Have you seen
the Buster Keaton thing?'
</P>
<P>
   ``This script just made me laugh,'' Zellweger adds. ``And you
know what? It fit my life at the time. I mean, I had just spent
three years playing really dark and emotionally challenging roles
(in `Deceiver,' `A Price Above Rubies' and `One True Thing'). I
loved it, and I read a lot of interesting material that had a
little more subtext or commentary to it, but this just felt right.
I wanted to laugh at work instead of doing intensive research and
concentration _ and wear pretty clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   For both O'Donnell and Sinyor, ``The Bachelor'' definitely had a
strong thematic subtext. Both men had recently married and could
thoroughly relate to Jimmy's conjugal jitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like this film is `Men Are From Mars, Women Are From
Venus,''' Sinyor explains. ``What this film maybe does is highlight
the idea of commitment as something that one needs to address
before you contemplate proposing. Every time I watch it, by the end
I just feel closer to my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy's utterly inept proposal _ the words ``you win'' are
involved _ certainly doesn't reflect O'Donnell's question popping
to his longtime fiancee Caroline Fentress. Not that the heroic star
of ``The Three Musketeers'' and ``Batman and Robin'' had a
stress-free courtship of his lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was on full alert because she knew it was coming,''
O'Donnell recalls. ``So the key thing was to surprise her. She was
teaching in D.C. at the time. I'd bought the ring and they were
going to set it or mount it or whatever they do, in New York. I
asked if they could get the ring down to Washington on the day I
wanted to propose, they said sure, no problem, but they called the
day before and said they couldn't get it there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That morning, Caroline went to work and I told her I was just
going to hang out in Washington. Then I flew up to New York, got
the ring, flew back, showed up at her dad's office, talked to him,
got permission, picked her up at school, got home and said, `Let's
sit on the couch.' I'd had the ring in my possession for, like, two
hours, and I just couldn't contain myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Guys just may find the whole proposal process a bigger deal than
women do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never thought about being proposed to in my whole life,''
Zellweger says in a sweet Texas drawl. ``I don't care. How about
that? The thing hasn't presented itself at all, not yet. I don't
know; too many other gifts, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The guys making ``The Bachelor'' had more to think about than
engagement traumas. For one, an essentially retrograde concept had
to be made palatable for the '90s. This included the portrayals of
old girlfriends Jimmy turns to in desperation, two of whom are
played by Mariah Carey and a chain-smoking Brooke Shields. It also
meant trying to make a generally sexist concept both benign and
sharp enough to generate laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will definitely be women who are turned off by it, think
it stereotypes them,'' O'Donnell acknowledges. ``But you know what?
It's just a movie, we're not making any statement about anything.
But blunting the misogyny was one of many things we worked on, just
trying to get the script right.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there was a bit of a logistic challenge. ``The
Bachelor'' may not be Buster Keaton at his elaborately engineered
best, but a lot goes into getting 1,000 extras into wedding gowns
and then moved about en masse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were budgetary constraints,'' Sinyor says of the
relatively cheap, $26 million production. ``So, at one point, we
thought we were going to have to computerize a lot of the brides. I
was very set against it; I wanted to have real people because the
reactions you get from them are more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   The director got lucky when costume designer Terry Dresbach got
in touch with Phyllis Kelley, a Connecticut consignment store owner
who just happened to have more than 800 wedding gowns cluttering up
her home. Anxious to sell the lot for a reasonable price, Kelley
and her husband drove the dresses to California themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Outfitting was one thing; wrangling all those brides around San
Francisco was another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The costume designers were up at 3 o'clock every morning,
dressing them and making them up,'' Sinyor recalls. ``You got
rather blase about that, but once you tried to do a shot, it was
complete chaos. There was a shot where they converge on Chris from
three different directions, and it took half-an-hour just to get
them all back to their starting points for each take. Luckily, we
got that on the third take, since I was just guessing on the timing
of the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, O'Donnell, who became a father for the first time in
September, feels that he's made a movie for our time _ or, at
least, for the time in life he's at right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it seems like the whole world's getting married,'' he
says. ``I got invited to 13 weddings this year; you'd have to look
at statistical records for the real story, but it feels like all of
my friends are getting married. I'm just at that age. And I love
being married, I really do.'' &QL;

LEGENDARY SILENT MOVIE THEATER REBORN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(eds: Dateline now reads HOLLYWOOD) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The Silent Movie Theatre refuses to, well, go
silently into that good night.
</P>
<P>
   The movie house at 611 N. Fairfax Ave. is about to come back to
life, reopening Friday with an invitation-only screening of Charlie
Chaplin's classic ``Modern Times'' and, on Sunday, beginning its
regular public schedule with matinee and evening shows of the film.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the third incarnation of the only theater in the
country dedicated to our silent movie heritage. The original
operation was run by husband-and-wife team John and Dorothy Hampton
from 1942 through 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, following John's death from cancer, thought to be
caused by the chemicals he used to preserve his vast collection of
classic films, the theater was reopened by family friend Laurence
Austin. Austin was murdered at the theater on January 17, 1997, by
a man hired by his longtime companion, James Van Sickle. The venue
was immediately shuttered, and the 1,500-film collection it thrived
on was auctioned off in May of this year.
</P>
<P>
   That sale seemed to seal the institution's fate for good. And
that's probably what would have happened, except for the enthusiasm
of Charlie Lustman.
</P>
<P>
   A 34-year-old L.A. native who's spent most of his adult life
composing music in such far-flung locales as Costa Rica and
Copenhagen, he was on a visit back home _ and on his way to get a
falafel, actually _ when he noticed the dark theater's weathered
facade (which has since been replaced by a very snazzy,
neon-and-bulb art-deco marquee).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was heading down Fairfax and I saw this For Sale sign
outside,'' Lustman recalls. ``I thought, `Silent Movie _ that's
kind of interesting.' I walked through the doorway and saw all of
the pictures that were still on the walls, and immediately I was
taken. This was like a shrine for silent film. Now, I don't know
silent film, but of course I know the stars. Then it hit me that
this art form was this century's art form, and these people on the
walls were its pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought this would be so cool, to get involved in
something that was part of this early culture, and of the city of
L.A. So I called a few people who I knew had money and asked them
how they felt about investing in a silent movie theater. They'd go,
`You've got to be kidding me. How are you going to get people to go
see old silent movies?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I convinced them that this had a lot of versatility _ don't
ask me how, but I did _ and then started the renovation process to
bring it back to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been done to make the 222-seat theater a haven for film
lovers. A new screen and two lovingly restored, 500-watt Super
Simplex xenon projectors have been installed, as has a 20-by-6-foot
stage for live performances that can be removed to accommodate an
eight-piece music ensemble. There's now an upstairs cappucino bar
and a back patio, where fans will be able to meet and discuss the
evening's show, starting at 6 p.m. and going until midnight.
</P>
<P>
   But where will those 8 p.m. shows come from? When Butterfield's
auctioned off the Hampton collection in May, Lustman was able to
buy the Douglas Fairbanks action features, but little else.
Fortunately, major studios and such organizations as Ted Turner's
massive film library have been restoring prints for video and
broadcast in recent years; between those sources and supportive
private collectors, Lustman expects to be able to program an
ambitious series of retrospectives.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, he's sticking with the tried and true: Chaplin
features for the next couple of weekends, Fairbanks and Mary
Pickford on weekdays, a week of Buster Keaton comedies in December,
``King of Kings'' and ``The Bishop's Wife'' for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesdays will be regularly devoted to sound films released
before 1950: ``The Jazz Singer,'' Laurel &AMP; Hardy's ``Flying
Deuces,'' the Marx Brothers' ``Duck Soup'' and John Ford's World
War II classic ``They Were Expendable'' are the November entries.
</P>
<P>
   Some may consider the presence of recorded dialogue in the
silent movie shrine a tacit admission that the audience indeed may
not be that big for silent movies these days. Then again, that's
what investors told the Hamptons in 1942, and they made a go of it
for more than 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   And Lustman is confident that the same thing that happened to
him can happen to people his age and younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna get the audience that's left to come back and
we're going to create an entirely new audience,'' he says. ``I'm
young compared to most silent film fans. I never knew about this
and the more I learn about it, the more I love it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like the Van Gogh show at LACMA. Young and old went
to see the Old Master's art. Well, it's the same thing (with film),
and that's how we're marketing the theater. Come see the art, it's
a museum, they're movies! We all love movies _ come see the
originals.'' &QL;

MEXICANS PITCH IN TO LEND A HAND IN DISASTER'S WAKE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ZACATLAN, Mexico _ Watching news reports of the flooding and
mudslides that ravaged the mountains north of his home in central
Mexico, physician Gerardo Jean decided to do what he had never done
before: volunteer to help.
</P>
<P>
   Aided first by a neighborhood association in his hometown and
then by the charity arm of one of Mexico's largest corporations,
Jean began collecting food, clothing and other items for people who
had lost almost everything they had in the country's latest natural
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than three weeks after the flooding began, Jean spends
long days overseeing the distribution of as much as 15 tons of
donated goods daily from a garage on a college campus in Zacatlan,
a market town of 60,000 in Puebla state's northern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that we are capable of operating like this,'' a
weary Jean said recently as he took a break from loading food,
bottled water, clothing and bedding on trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of satisfaction in seeing people trying to do
what they can to help,'' said Jean, whose hometown of Tepeaca,
about 100 miles to the south, was unaffected by the flooding.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government, which has refused to accept donated
goods from foreign countries, has scrambled to help the remote
villages hit hardest by the disaster. But mudslides and continued
bad weather have made for slow progress.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by what some complain is an inefficient and partial
government effort, individual Mexicans like Jean have jumped into
the breach.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Mexican government, flooding and mudslides
killed more than 400 people in the states of Puebla, Veracruz,
Tabasco and Hidalgo in October and left more than 400,000 others
homeless. The heavy rains that pounded the mountains and plains
along the Gulf of Mexico washed away homes, destroyed roads and
ruined crops.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, rivers surged in Tabasco, threatening to inundate the
state capital, Villahermosa, before slowly receding.
</P>
<P>
   Across Mexico, collection boxes for food and other goods have
been placed at supermarkets and gymnasiums. A Mexico City theater
chain has contributed proceeds to the relief effort. Roman Catholic
parishes throughout the country have sent aid to churches in the
flood-ravaged region.
</P>
<P>
   And people in communities unaffected by the disaster have called
on one another to beg food and other goods for those in stricken
towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that no help was arriving, so we started asking
neighbors, schools, everyone to donate whatever they could,'' said
Isabel Garcia, a Mexico City homemaker who collected donations for
Papantla, the town in Veracruz where she grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if we had the influence to knock on the doors
of the powerful to ask for help. But we don't,'' Garcia said. ``We
had to help one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers say that such grass-roots charity work is relatively
new to Mexico, where decades of one-party rule have conditioned
people to rely on the government for assistance, even if that help
is delayed or never arrives at all.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on self-help, many community activists say, began
with the government's haphazard response to the devastating Mexico
City earthquake in 1985. The trend toward self-reliance, they say,
has picked up momentum, as Mexican society has moved toward
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, relief operations in Mexico traditionally have been the
domain of government bureaucracies and the military.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred, perhaps, by the fear of losing face or political
control, Mexican government officials have long shunned offers of
foreign assistance in dealing with the natural disasters that
frequently plague this land.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the private international aid agencies, such as CARE and
Catholic Relief Services, that have become important players in
smaller and poorer Latin American countries have never operated in
Mexico. Nongovernmental organizations, which in much of the
developing world have taken on everything from education to health
to agricultural projects, have focused mostly on human rights and
clean elections here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with the very strong feeling among officials that
the government has to do the job, even if it can't do it,'' said
political scientist Sergio Aguayo, a founder of the Civic Alliance,
a citizens group that has become a watchdog of elections
nationwide. ``They are very jealous and try to inhibit external
help.''
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo said recently that Mexico could _ and
would _ handle the flood relief effort on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Later, amid criticism from opposition politicians and citizen
groups, the government announced that money from abroad would be
welcome, as long as it was funneled through Mexico's embassies or
officially sanctioned agencies, such as the Mexican Red Cross. But,
the government said, food and other items would not be accepted, at
least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience in other tragedies in Mexico and other
countries has shown that material help that is provided in a
disorderly manner can become an obstacle for the relief and
reconstruction efforts,'' the Mexican foreign ministry said in a
statement outlining the government's position.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the U.S. Agency for International Development has
donated just $100,000 to help victims of Mexico's recent floods. In
comparison, the U.S. government has pledged nearly $1 billion to
Central America's effort to recover from Hurricane Mitch, which
struck the region a year ago this weekend, causing as many as
10,000 deaths. International aid to Central America is expected to
total nearly $9 billion in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite setbacks in the relief effort, the Mexican government,
which also must contend with widespread damage in Oaxaca state
caused by a September earthquake, has managed to deliver help to
many flood victims.
</P>
<P>
   Workers have cleared mud and rocks from scores of roads.
Military helicopters have funneled food and other supplies to
remote villages. Medical teams have fanned out to prevent outbreaks
of cholera and other diseases.

ZACATLAN, Mexico: and other diseases.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But even some Mexican officials who insist that the government
can take care of the short-term relief effort admit that the
country could use help in the costly rebuilding process. The
government's transportation department estimated last week that
road repairs in Puebla state could cost more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of help coming, but we need a lot more,'' said
Saul Sanchez, who works in the Puebla mountains for Sedesol, a
federal agency that focuses on poverty. ``We lack help _ we can't
deny that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say that more than national pride is at stake in the
reluctance to accept foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
   If international aid agencies come into the mountains, ``they
are going to be witnesses to how Mexico really is,'' said Garcia,
the Mexico City woman who helped organize the grass-roots relief
effort for the flood-damaged town of Papantla.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what the government cannot permit,'' Garcia said.
``The truth is that Mexico is very bad off.''
</P>
<P>
   The mountains of northern Puebla state that were hit hard by
this month's mudslides and flooding rank among the most beautiful
in Mexico. Pine-covered slopes tumble into clear, swift rivers.
Waterfalls sluice sheer canyon walls.
</P>
<P>
   Villages of Totonaco Indians snuggle into emerald vales or cling
to breakneck inclines. Corn fields claw the ridge lines.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the rainy season, which is about to end, gray mist
envelops the sierra. Brisk even in clear weather, the air turns raw
whenever clouds obscure the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The recent downpours caused houses to collapse and washed many
crops from the mountainsides. Many villagers, poor before the
disaster, have been made destitute.
</P>
<P>
   The region's poverty long has reinforced a political culture
dominated by local bosses known as ``caciques.'' Usually aligned
with the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI,
many caciques wield power through intimidation, family ties and an
ability to channel government spending through themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Despite promises by Zedillo and other top leaders that aid would
be distributed fairly, many villagers in the Puebla mountains
complain that government relief goods have been hoarded by
``caciques'' and other local officials. Some also suspect that aid
is being used to influence the PRI's Nov. 7 primary, which will
determine the party's candidate for next summer's presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad thing is, there is a lot of discrimination in the
giving of aid,'' said Ismael Luis Olmedo, a Roman Catholic priest.
He added that ruling-party bosses in the area where he works, eight
hours by foot from Zacatlan, have denied help to people who don't
support them.
</P>
<P>
   Some state officials acknowledge that such maneuvering occurs.
Puebla authorities recently relieved two mayors of their duties
after they allegedly diverted aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The detouring of resources comes when they get to the
municipal level,'' acknowledged Francisco Barcena, an official with
the Puebla state finance department who belongs to the PRI. &UR;  &LR; He
denied, however, that political cronyism influences aid
distribution as a matter of policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't ask what party recipients are from,'' he said.
``There is no favoritism. We don't permit it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of concerns that relief supplies will be diverted, Jean
and some private relief workers in Zacatlan are trying to put food
and other supplies directly into flood victims' hands.
</P>
<P>
   Zacatlan, about 120 miles northeast of Mexico City, has become a
base for the flood relief effort. Along the town's narrow streets,
newly slaughtered cattle and hogs hang in butcher shops. Locally
grown fruits _ apples and berries, grapes and peaches _ fill the
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Working with managers from the Telmex Foundation, the
philanthropy arm of Mexico's monolithic telephone company, Jean has
sent loads of relief supplies into the mountains. Telmex has paid
for helicopter flights to ferry goods to the most remote areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to go from house to house and give people aid
personally,'' said Daniel Pineda, the Telmex manager in charge of
the civilian relief operation in Zacatlan. ``We are not going to
deal with any churches, any political parties, any authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is help in general. This is for the people,'' Pineda
said. ``This has nothing to do with the government, with politics
or with a church.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, goods donated by individuals as well as
Catholic parishes across Mexico jammed meeting rooms and a chapel
of a Zacatlan church. Garbage bags filled with used clothing formed
a mound 10 feet wide and 15 feet high. Bottles of water filled the
church yard.
</P>
<P>
   Across the small plaza, mountains of government relief supplies
_ corn meal and sugar, canned soup and bottled water _ occupied a
large patio at Zacatlan's colonial-era city hall.
</P>
<P>
   With many roads still blocked by mudslides and inclement weather
preventing some helicopter flights, a lot of the aid had become
bottlenecked in Zacatlan.
</P>
<P>
   The Telmex foundation _ like the Catholic Church's relief
branch, Caritas, and some Mexican federal agencies _ sent truck
loads of relief supplies each day to a site just short of a bridge
about 10 miles east of town. There, the road remained impassable
because of a mudslide.
</P>
<P>
   People from outlying villages, many of whom had walked for eight
or 10 hours in search of assistance, collected the goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little help has arrived,'' said Emiliano Hernandez, one of
120 people who hiked from the village of Zongozotla and then home
again with heavy loads of canned soup and corn flour.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, basically, we are on our own.''

   MUSIC: Before you even play the first cut, there are several
clues that ``Blassie: King of Men'' is no typical record. The first
would be the front cover, where the ``recording artist'' holds a
guitar while attempting to take a bite out of it. And on the bottom
is this disclaimer: ``Warning: The Geek General has determined that
listening to this record may be hazardous to your health.'' Those
who dare go further discover another clue: The four-song EP is cut
in blood-red vinyl, a nod to wrestler/manager Fred Blassie's
tendency to make his mat opponents bleed.

   &UR; FOCUS (Available by 2 p.m., Fri., Nov. 5) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COLD WAR: The end of the Cold War presented the United States
with infinite new possibilities. NATO began taking in former Soviet
satellites. U.S. defense outlays have been dramatically reduced.
And the State Department, with a few notable exceptions, has
literally redrawn the diplomatic map of the world as the United
States has pursued international relationships based on economic
interests rather than ideology. The Cold War's demise, though, has
also challenged the United States to four key imperatives: managing
the collapse of the Soviet Union; helping to negotiate the rise of
China; building a global trading order that provides equity and
opportunity to poor countries as well as rich; and reducing the
risk of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: GERMANY WALL: For some, the years following the razing of
the Berlin Wall have been a time of exploration and adventure. For
others, the decade has brought home the problems of living in a
market economy with all the perils that come with opportunity.

<P>
   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas

TEXAS CHILL BRINGS TALK OF TEXAS CHILI
</HEADLINE>
 
(DUPLICATION ALERT: Story also moving in ``d'' food category) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year about this time, when the cool weather begins to blow
up our pant legs, the discussion turns to Texas chili. Does it have
beans in it? Can cooks put tomatoes in their chili without being
ridiculed?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is a resounding, almost unqualified no. In some
places, using beans and tomatoes is punishable by fines, probably
jail time and certainly public humiliation. Rules are rules.
</P>
<P>
   Down in Terlingua, in far Southwest Texas, where searing hot
temperatures represent the milder part of the day, chili cooks from
all over the globe gather this month to reinforce these holy
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, both the Original Terlingua International
Championship Chili Cook-Off and the Terlingua International Chili
Championship will be held. There will be hundreds and hundreds of
chili pots simmering between hundreds and hundreds of recreational
vehicles. Thousands of cold beers will be used to put out the
fires.
</P>
<P>
   The Terlingua International Chili Championship is the largest of
the two cook-offs. It will be held at Rancho CASI de los Chisos, a
private reserve owned by the Chili Appreciation Society
International.
</P>
<P>
   More than 275 cooking teams from the United States and several
other countries will compete. There are also buffalo wings and
beans cook-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few miles down the road is the ``Original'' cook-off.
This one is also known as the Frank X. Tolbert-Wick Fowler Memorial
Cook-Off. This 33rd annual event will include a golf tournament and
brisket, beans and black-eyed peas cook-offs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are both on the same weekend and only about three to five
miles apart,'' said Don Tipps, a chili judge from North Richland
Hills outside Fort Worth. ``A lot of times, people will pull into
one of the events thinking they're at the other. They'll stay three
days before they know the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Tipps was heading down Tuesday to set up at his Lajitas hotel.
He booked the room when he left last year, and he'll book it again
for next year when this weekend is over.
</P>
<P>
   He's been doing it for the past 15 years. He's been to both
competitions and he diplomatically declines to rate one over the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started going down there, I thought it would be
just a can of Wolf Brand chili and some Mexican cheese,'' he said.
``But I found out that only the best of the best can compete there,
at either cook-off. The chili cooks have to collect points at other
contests to be able to compete there.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, both contests picked up unwanted reputations as
rowdy, drunken, brawling affairs. Tipps says he's never seen that
kind of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been going down there 15 years and I've seen just one
slight fight, and that was between two brothers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the chili is concerned, the rules are harsh and the
competition fierce. ``For some of these guys, it's a life or death
struggle,'' he said. ``There are lots of rules. You can't put
foreign objects in your chili. All those stories you hear about
antelope chili or rattlesnake chili are wrong. They use
high-quality beef or chuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use tomatoes or onions or peppers only if they have
been cooked down to the point where you can't see them. And you
never, never, never use beans.''

He booked the room when he left last year, and he'll book it again
for next year when this weekend is over.
</P>
<P>
   He's been doing it for the past 15 years. He's been to both
competitions and he diplomatically declines to rate one over the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started going down there, I thought it would be
just a can of Wolf Brand chili and some Mexican cheese,'' he said.
``But I found out that only the best of the best can compete there,
at either cook-off. The chili cooks have to collect points at other
contests to be able to compete there.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, both contests picked up unwanted reputations as
rowdy, drunken, brawling affairs. Tipps says he's never seen that
kind of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been going down there 15 years and I've seen just one
slight fight, and that was between two brothers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the chili is concerned, the rules are harsh and the
competition fierce. ``For some of these guys, it's a life or death
struggle,'' he said. ``There are lots of rules. You can't put
foreign objects in your chili. All those stories you hear about
antelope chili or rattlesnake chili are wrong. They use
high-quality beef or chuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use tomatoes or onions or peppers only if they have
been cooked down to the point where you can't see them. And you
never, never, never use beans.''

CREATIONISTS REPEAL THE LAW OF GRAVITY! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ever since a majority of the Kansas Board of
Education sided with Christian Creationists and voted to eliminate
evolution from the state's required K-12 teaching standards,
educators across the country have looked to the future with
trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   If a small but increasingly powerful minority of fundamentalist
Christians could successfully nullify a universe of hard scientific
data by arguing, ``You can't prove it absolutely,'' what other
accepted teachings are vulnerable?
</P>
<P>
   John W. Bacon, one of six board members who voted with the
Creationists, explained the prevailing view when he defended the
board's decision to also eliminate required teaching of the Big
Bang theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't here, and neither were they (physicists),'' said
Bacon. ``Based on that, whatever explanation they may arrive at is
a theory, and it should be taught that way.''
</P>
<P>
   With that as the measuring stick, how hard is it to imagine the
following news reports from any of a dozen U.S. public education
agencies?
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to pressure from Bible-citing parents, the state Board of
Education today voted to eliminate all requirements to teach the
laws of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The parents had argued that, because Jesus reportedly walked on
water while on the Earth, any laws of gravity _ be they
Aristotle's, Galileo's, Newton's or Einstein's _ were ``only four
guys' guesses.''
</P>
<P>
   When challenged that Jesus was also God and therefore not
subject to the physical laws of mortals, the parents countered with
the apostle Peter, a mere man who walked on water ``until he
doubted and feared and sank like a stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Also receiving the ax was Albert Einstein's 1905 treatise on
Brownian motion, regarding microscopic particles suspended in
liquid or gas.
</P>
<P>
   Although he himself said it was impossible to behold the
universe and chalk it all up to random chance, Einstein was further
dissed by the state Board of Education today when his theory of
time and relativity was dropped as required teaching matter for
public school students.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium of Christian groups, insisting the Bible is ``100
percent true and literal,'' forced the change. A passage from one
of their brochures states: ``Genesis says God created Heaven and
Earth in six days and rested on the seventh. Seven days is seven
days, whether they happened back then or yesterday. There's nothing
RELATIVE about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for measuring distances in so-called light years, who's
been in the spaceship that can prove that anything in the universe
is more than six days away from anything else?''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the consortium, the state likewise altered much of its
curriculum on oceanography (Moses parts the Red Sea, whale swallows
Jonah), reproductive biology (100-year-old Abraham and his
post-menopausal wife Sarah conceive Isaac), and herpetology (Satan
as serpent in Garden of Eden).
</P>
<P>
   Because the Bible says Lot's wife was turned to a pillar of
salt, the state also chose to drop the periodic chart of the
elements from all chemistry classes.
</P>
<P>
   In an impressive show of multi-denominational muscle, proponents
of the Christian, Hindu and Buddhist faiths claimed victory today
when the state Board of Education agreed to strike any references
to human ``death'' from all subject matter taught in grades K-12.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that scientists cannot prove there is no Heaven or
eternal afterlife and therefore cannot factually state that people
``die,'' the Christians formed an unusual alliance with the Hindus
and Buddhists, who believe in reincarnation.
</P>
<P>
   Because Hindus and Buddhists believe in the reincarnation of
animals as well as humans, they had lobbied hard for the widest ban
possible of the word ``death.'' Ultimately though, they had to
settle for only the human references. They did manage to get the
terms ``passed on,'' ``passed over'' and ``transmigrated''
recognized as official state substitutions for ``dead.''

DECADENT CHOCOLATE-CHERRY ROLLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (This is the last of eight columns by Amy Scherber of Amy's Bread
in Manhattan. These columns were written with Dorie Greenspan. Next
week: Patrick O'Connell, the chef and an owner of the Inn at Little
Washington in Washington, Va.) 
(jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pain du chocolat, the French after-school treat, and its Italian
cousin, bread slathered with Nutella, inspired me to create these
chocolate rolls.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted a bread that wasn't too sweet but wouldn't need butter
or jam. A bread that would be rich and, in its own way, decadent.
Something that would be perfect for breakfast or as an afternoon
pick-me-up.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a tender chocolate roll, generously studded with
tart-sweet dried cherries and bittersweet chocolate chunks. The
dough itself is rich, slightly moist and, because I use cocoa
powder and brewed coffee, neither very chocolaty nor very sweet.
So, the sweeter chocolate pieces and tangy cherries stand out even
more. Its soft crumb allows the melted chocolate bits to ooze into
the bread.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate chips will work here, but hand-chopped pieces of good
bittersweet chocolate are best. The darker and more bittersweet the
chocolate, the greater and more exciting the contrasts in taste and
texture.
</P>
<P>
   The dough is easy to make, because there are no starters,
sponges or stages: just put everything in a bowl, and then knead,
let it rest, knead again and cut into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The tricky part is shaping the dough into rolls. Make some room
for yourself on a counter, and cup your hand over a piece of dough,
like a cage. With your fingertips firmly on the counter, rotate
your hand against the counter clockwise. You should feel the dough
move in the opposite direction. Keep rotating the dough until it is
firm and covered by a tight skin.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's tempting to eat these rolls the minute they're
baked, it's better to give the moist bread a little time to set.
But don't keep them on the cooling rack too long _ they're best
when they're still warm.
</P>
<P>
   DECADENT CHOCOLATE-CHERRY ROLLS
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 1{ hours, plus 2} hours for rising and cooling
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   one-third cup unsweetened cocoa powder
</P>
<P>
   one-third cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup warm brewed coffee
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg, separated
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dried tart cherries.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a large mixing bowl, combine yeast and { cup very warm
water. Stir to dissolve yeast, and let rest 3 minutes. In a medium
bowl, combine flour, cocoa, sugar and salt. Whisk to blend, and set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Stir coffee, egg yolk and butter into yeast mixture.
Gradually add flour mixture, stirring until flour is moistened and
binds into a shaggy mass. Dough should be sticky; if it feels
stiff, mix in up to 2 tablespoons water.
</P>
<P>
   3. On a lightly floured surface, knead dough until it is smooth
and elastic, 7 to 8 minutes. Shape it into a loose ball, cover with
plastic wrap and let rest about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. Flatten and stretch dough gently to form a rectangle about 1
inch thick. Scatter chopped chocolate and dried cherries on top.
Fold rectangle into thirds like a business letter, then knead 2 to
3 minutes, until chocolate and cherries are distributed. If some of
the pieces pop out of dough, they can be incorporated after the
first rise.
</P>
<P>
   5. Shape dough into a loose ball, and place in a lightly oiled
bowl, along with any loose chocolate and cherries. Cover bowl
tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise at room temperature until
dough has doubled in volume, 1 to 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   6. Line two large baking sheets with parchment. Gently transfer
dough to a lightly floured work surface, and press in any loose
chocolate and cherries. Divide into 12 equal pieces. Shape pieces
into rolls by forming a cage with your hand over the dough and
rotating dough against table to tighten it. Place 6 rolls on each
baking sheet, evenly spaced. Cover loosely with oiled plastic wrap;
let rise at room temperature until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   7. About 15 minutes before baking, position oven racks to divide
oven into thirds, and preheat oven to 400 degrees. When rolls have
doubled, mix egg white with 1 teaspoon water. Brush each roll
gently with egg wash; coat entire surface. Slide baking sheets into
oven, and using a plant sprayer, mist top and sides of oven with
water 6 to 8 times. Quickly close oven door.
</P>
<P>
   8. Bake for 10 minutes, reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees,
and rotate pans top to bottom and front to back. Bake until tops of
rolls feel firm but not hard, and bottoms are only lightly browned,
10 to 15 more minutes. Cool on a rack before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 12 rolls.

CRABBY CRAB CAKES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Getting the most out of crab cakes often means putting the least
into them. Since crab has the best texture and subtlest flavor of
all crustaceans, the best crab cakes are those that showcase the
crab, not another ingredient. When you load crab cakes up with
white bread, corn or curry and top them with a fussy sauce, you
might be making them different, but not better.
</P>
<P>
   Picked lump or claw crab-meat pieces will retain their form
through the mixing and cooking, giving a simple crab cake a variety
of great textures. Flake crab meat, mostly thin shreds with no real
lumps, will taste just as good but will not be as interesting a
chew.
</P>
<P>
   Lump crab meat not only is expensive _ around $20 a pound in New
York _ but also may require a trip to a fishmonger. Many
supermarkets refuse to stock the best crab meat because it spoils
easily. But picked crab meat freezes fairly well; many times I have
bought it, found myself unable to cook it immediately and thrown it
in the freezer for a few days. The decline in quality, at least
when the crab is used in crab cakes, is undetectable.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing the ingredients for crab cakes is easier than preparing
pancake batter and takes five minutes. Getting the ingredients to
hold together long enough to cook is another matter. If your crab
cake consists of 50 percent crab and 50 percent white bread soaked
in milk, you can practically throw it in the pan from across the
room and it will stay together. But when the mix is 90 percent crab
with only an egg and a little flour, handling takes more care.
</P>
<P>
   But not that much more. All you need is a little time and a
refrigerator. The loose mix is best chilled before shaping, but it
is essential to chill it again for a half-hour or so (longer is
better) before cooking. When cold, the cakes will hold together,
and once the egg, the binding agent, does its work, they will
retain their shape until attacked with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   There are some options here: I think crab cakes are best cooked
in butter, but oil does well, too. You can use extra-virgin olive
oil or a neutral oil like canola or corn, and grape-seed oil is a
little cleaner tasting. In any case, make sure the oil is fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Well-prepared crab cakes need no more than a squeeze of lemon,
but if you like tartar sauce or aioli, you can make them easily
enough. For tartar sauce, mix 1 cup of mayonnaise (preferably
homemade) with \ cup of minced cornichons or other pickles, 2
tablespoons of minced shallots, and horseradish to taste. For
aioli, add finely minced raw garlic to 1 cup of mayonnaise (some
saffron, too, if you have it). Let it rest for an hour or so before
using.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm not opposed to adding some crunch to the cakes: try {
cup or so of minced bell pepper (a combination of colors is nice)
or some minced shallots or onions. But please, no white bread.
</P>
<P>
   CRABBY CRAB CAKES
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour, largely unattended
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh lump crab meat
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, optional
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons flour, more for dredging
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or neutral oil, like canola
or grape-seed
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter (or use a total of 4 tablespoons oil)
</P>
<P>
   Lemon wedges.
</P>
<P>
   1. Gently combine crab, egg, mustard, salt, pepper and 2
tablespoons flour. Cover, and put in freezer for 5 minutes. Shape
mixture into 4 hamburger-shaped patties. Line plate with plastic
wrap, and put crab cakes on it. Cover with more plastic wrap, and
refrigerate for about 30 minutes (or as long as 1 day), or freeze
for 15 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Put flour for dredging in a bowl. Combine oil and butter in
12-inch skillet, and turn heat to medium. When butter melts and its
foam subsides, gently dredge a crab cake in flour. Gently tap off
excess flour, and add crab cake to pan; repeat with remaining crab
cakes, and then turn heat to medium-high. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Cook, rotating cakes in pan as necessary to brown first side,
5 to 8 minutes. Turn and brown other side (it will take slightly
less time). Serve hot, with lemon wedges. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 crab cakes.

   Q: Where can I contact the publishers of ``Business
Opportunities Digest?''
</P>
<P>
   _ J.D., Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: The address for that work-at-home publication is ``Business
Opportunities Digest,'' Chartsearch Ltd., 28 Charles Square,
London, England N1 6HT.
</P>
<P>
   The British Advertising Standards Authority has investigated
several complaints against Chartsearch and the publication. In one
case, the group asked that a ``Digest'' ad be changed because
``advertisers had not substantiated that demand existed for
free-lance proofreaders.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, a ``Daily Telegraph'' consumer action reporter helped
a reader get a long-delinquent refund on a ``Digest'' subscription.
``Dealing with Chartsearch is frustrating in that its `customer
service helpline' does not take calls,'' the ``Telegraph''
reported. ``Instead it requests the reader to write to an address
that from your experience one might presume has a warehouse full of
identical letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to the game Authors?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.Z.
</P>
<P>
   A: Authors, a variation of the children's card game Go Fish, has
been published by several different companies in the past 130
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet auction site eBay frequently lists used versions by
Parker Brothers, Whitman Publishing and the Fairchild Company.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Games Systems currently sells 17 different versions of
Authors, including Composers, Baseball Legends, Children's Authors
and Explorers.

   Q: I have an autograph of the '60s actress Valora Noland, but
don't know anything about her. What has she appeared in?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.G., N. Richland Hills, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Noland had an eight-year TV and movie career, according to
the Internet Movie Database.
</P>
<P>
   The actress appeared in two movies with Frankie Avalon and
Annette Funicello: ``Beach Party'' in 1963 and the sequel ``Muscle
Beach Party'' in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   She also had a role in the John Wayne movie ``The War Wagon''
and guest-starred on a 1968 episode of ``Star Trek,'' ``Patterns of
Force.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time each year, soon after Alexis Lichine had
returned to New York from the harvest at Prieure-Lichine, his
chateau in Bordeaux, when we would drive up to Westchester County
to have lunch with Alfred A. Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of publishing Lichine's books, Knopf had come to
know and love wine. And so at one lunch in the early 1980s he
announced that we would be drinking the four Bordeaux first growths
from 1945: Latour, Margaux, Lafite-Rothschild and Haut-Brion. He
had opened them earlier, he said, to let them breathe. Alexis and I
exchanged concerned looks and, when we sat down to eat, our fears
were fulfilled. All four wines were dead. Letting them breathe had
not improved them; it had killed them.
</P>
<P>
   How often have you heard a waiter or a wine steward say at the
beginning of a meal: ``I'll just open this now and let it
breathe''? Breathing is one of the least understood components of
wine service and wine drinking, in restaurants or at home. Once, at
Harry's Bar in Venice, I ordered a nondescript Italian white wine
as an aperitif. A few minutes later, I was astonished to see the
waiter decanting the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``To let it breathe,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Breathe? That wine needed to breathe about as much as the
mineral water.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Knopf's wines were too old, the Harry's Bar wine too
young. So when exactly does a wine need to breathe? The answer is:
almost never. Certainly white wines don't. Occasionally, when a
powerful red wine is opened before its time, aerating it may soften
its rough, tannic edges. But this can be just as easily
accomplished by pouring the wine into glasses and then letting it
stand for a while before drinking it.
</P>
<P>
   Simply uncorking the bottle early is practically useless. It
will expose an amount of wine in the neck of the bottle equal to
the size of the bottom of the cork. In other words, almost no wine
at all. Mostly it gives the waiter or wine steward a bit of stage
business to help inflate the pourboire. A really harsh young wine
can be smoothed out a bit by decanting, but again, letting it sit
in the glass for a while will accomplish much the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1863, when the French railroads first began carrying wine
from the Mediterranean to the northern cities, Emperor Napoleon III
called on Louis Pasteur to determine why so much wine was going bad
in transit. Pasteur found that air, or more precisely, the oxygen
in air, was the villain. Too much air, he discovered, allowed the
growth of vinegar bacteria. On the other hand, he learned, small
controlled amounts of air matured wine.
</P>
<P>
   Wine matures in the bottle because of the oxygen that is found
in the wine itself and in the small space between the wine and the
cork. The process, oxidation, is the chemical reaction of oxygen
with another chemical. And so steel rusts, copper turns green and a
sliced apple becomes brown.
</P>
<P>
   Oxidization in wine begins when the grapes are first picked,
which is why they are rushed to the wineries where oxygen contact
can be eliminated or controlled.
</P>
<P>
   The other legitimate reason for decanting wine is to avoid
sediment. As they age, wines produce a deposit. It is really
harmless stuff, but many wine drinkers, and particularly American
wine drinkers, prefer their wine squeaky clean. Filtration, a
common practice in the wine industry, has mostly obviated any need
for decanting; it strips out most particles before the wine is
bottled. Critics say it can also strip away the elements that give
a wine its character and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one wine that should always be decanted: vintage
port. Vintage port spends long years, sometimes more than half a
century, in the bottle, is never filtered and can have a
considerable amount of sediment. It is often decanted over a
candle. The light from the candle shows when sediment begins to
flow through the neck of the bottle, and when the decanting process
should stop.
</P>
<P>
   In her Oxford Companion to Wine (1994), Jancis Robinson comes
down against ever decanting wine to aerate it. She cites the great
French enologist Emile Peynaud, who held that exposing wine to too
much air begins a process of destroying its aroma. With very old
wines, like Knopf's 1945 Bordeaux, prolonged exposure to air can be
fatal, even when the surface area exposed is small. The chances are
that those wines would have died soon after pouring even without
the previous exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between death and glory can be minutes. I recall
a half bottle of Chateau Filhot 1911, at the Tour d'Argent in
Paris. It was offered on the wine list for 100 francs or about $20,
hardly exorbitant for what was a 75-year-old Sauternes. The first
glass was glorious. It had the intensity and richness of a wine a
fifth its age; its color was more burnished brass than gold, its
bouquet redolent of flowers, its taste still recalling the honeyed
influence of botrytis.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later the wine was dead, its color muddy brown,
its taste that of bitter, dried leaves. Locked safely in the
restaurant's damp cool cellar, a few yards from the Seine, it might
have lasted for another 20 years. With its cork pulled, its life
was quickly over.
</P>
<P>
   I was lucky; I had a glass of a once great wine _ before
breathing claimed another fragile victim. Good thing it was a
half-bottle. It would have been tragic to watch helplessly while a
full bottle died that way.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He is Peter Pan and Kublai Kahn, Tom Sawyer and
William Randolph Hearst. He is a cowboy at King Arthur's court.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-game players know him as Lord British. Austinites know
his house of horrors, dungeons and secret passageways out in the
hills.
</P>
<P>
   He is Richard Garriott, the designer of Ultima, the
longest-running game in the digital arcade.
</P>
<P>
   Garriott designs heroic struggles in which there are
ramifications to actions. There is moral retribution. Any player
who pillages and plunders will get a comeuppance. Instead of just
playing to win or to score a large kill count, his winners have to
play chivalrously.
</P>
<P>
   Garriott has used a simple version of his home in one of his
games. His home, Britannia Manor II, looks fairly normal from the
outside. It's a cheery yellow, and the gargoyles hanging over the
rain gutters are barely noticeable. The dome-shaped observatory,
built on an independent steel structure so vibrations from the air
conditioner won't damage the telescope, is encased by the body of
the house. The dome is almost invisible from the street. Of course,
the dungeons and secret passages can't be seen; neither can the
skeletons and suits of armor.
</P>
<P>
   Garriott has managed to make his play his work. This approach to
gaming has made him a cybernaire.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 he and his brother, Robert, began a business in their
parents' garage. The family _ Owen, the astronaut dad, and Helen,
the artist mother, plus four kids _ lived in Nassau Bay, a suburb
of Houston. Less than 10 years after setting up shop designing
one-color games packaged in plastic sandwich bags, Richard and
Robert sold Origin Systems to Electronic Arts, a software monster
from San Mateo, Calif., for $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Garriott, now 38, stayed on at Origin as a vice president and
game designer. Over the past seven years, the company has released
additional Ultima games, the Wing Commander Series and Strike
Commander.
</P>
<P>
   Garriott is a successful game designer because he has developed
the rare ability to stay trapped in the imagination of a
14-year-old while expanding his brilliant mind. He is a marvelous
case of arrested development. He spends his fortune on whatever
interests him, and it seems no whim goes unindulged. He has the
tastes of an adolescent science nerd, with the budget of a Lotto
winner.
</P>
<P>
   His private boat dock on Lake Austin has ``both'' paddle-wheel
boats from the Hammacher Schlemmer catalog, the swan and the
dragon. There are jet skis and ski boats, a hydroplane and a new
motorized lawn-chair contraption on pontoons. The seven-slip boat
house is full.
</P>
<P>
   Garriott doesn't collect big-boy toys. Although he does have a
lot of boats, none of them has monster motors. He collects toys.
</P>
<P>
   He has collections of mechanical toys and secret boxes. The
first box he bought for $5 at a local garage sale when he was 8.
``The neighbors thought it was some dumb wooden box. I figured out
it takes over 100 moves to open it,'' Garriott said.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite toys are orreries, mechanical solar systems that,
when cranked, will spin all the planets around the sun in an
appropriate time sequence.
</P>
<P>
   He has the evidence of a lightning bolt that hit beach sand and
left a crystal formation of glass shards. The formation, about 24
inches long, is in a display case; so are the narwhal tusk and the
tentacles of a huge jellyfish.
</P>
<P>
   Garriott wears a crude silver snake with a black tail on a chain
around his neck. It is the logo of his company and something he has
worn since he was 11 years old. In sneakers, bluejeans and a polo
shirt, he looks unremarkable. He is wearing protective coloring in
a university town. Then you see the two long, tightly braided locks
of hair that hang over his shoulder like two leather thongs from a
cat-o'-nine-tails.
</P>
<P>
   This is a warning sign.
</P>
<P>
   Garriott likes the dark side, too.
</P>
<P>
   He owns grisly body parts such as shrunken heads and thigh-bone
clubs. He has a turn-of-the-century vampire-killing kit. He
scatters glass eyeballs and teeth samples around his shelves like
some people use potpourri.
</P>
<P>
   He also owns something no one else can claim to own, a lunar
rover abandoned on the moon by the Soviets. He bought it at auction
for $60,000. ``I am the world's only private owner of an object on
a foreign celestial body,'' he said with a practiced patter.
</P>
<P>
   On four Halloweens, Garriott haunted his house and opened it for
tours. He would move out three months before the end of October so
all the lighting and effects crews could move in and do it up
right. Austinites and Ultima freaks would begin lining up days in
advance on Two Coves Road in hopes of getting tickets. Only 60
people, in groups of four, could tour the house each day.
</P>
<P>
   Garriott doesn't do that anymore. The scene for tickets became
ugly, and he began to resent having to move out, though he did
enjoy the entertainment aspects of decorating his house. He has
solved the conflict and is building a $25 million house on Lake
Austin with space for 200 people in the public rooms. The glories
of the new house will make Britannia II seem like a tract house.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Garriott has perfected decorating techniques that push the scary
buttons. Draping walls in heavy velvet curtains and placing suits
of armor where most people put a side chair or potted plant is
quite effective in evoking the style of a Vincent Price movie.
</P>
<P>
   Flickering flame-shaped light bulbs, minimal amounts of
furniture, and windows draped in blackout fabric are easy
scene-setters.
</P>
<P>
   Not so easy to make are the secret passageways and hidden doors.
Garriott picks up a gnarly ceramic blob embedded with numerous
glass eyeballs. ``This is something my mother made; it should give
you some idea where I get this weird bent,'' he says as he moves it
over the top of a bookcase. Attraction and repulsion of magnets
inside the eyeball creature and the cabinet force a wall panel,
about five feet away, to spring open. Inside is a circular
staircase that goes down to the dungeon and wine cellar. The wine
cellar holds about 100 bottles of wine; the dungeon has a real
skeleton in a real coffin, real shrunken heads and hidden chambers.
</P>
<P>
   There are secret passageways throughout the house. They're great
for wiring all your electronics, said Garriott. Pulling stereo,
television and computer cables through the wall into the secret
passage certainly does control the wire mess. The secret tunnels
are fun when the house is full of guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people bring their kids over, I show them where the
secret passageways are so they can spy on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Who spies on whom?
</P>
<P>
   Garriott looks puzzled, ``The kids spy on the parents, of
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course.

<P>
   Shelf Life for Spices
</P>
<P>
   Q. How long do spices last in storage?
</P>
<P>
   A. In general, ground spices should be stored for six months to
a year, while whole spices can last several years, depending upon
the type of spice and its storage conditions. Since light, air and
heat cause spices to deteriorate, all spices will keep longer if
stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place (even the
refrigerator).
</P>
<P>
   When buying spices, keep in mind that although ground spices are
more convenient, whole spices that you grind yourself, as needed,
will deliver more of a punch. For the freshest spices, buy them in
small quantities from stores with a high turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Kaffir Lime Leaves
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've assembled many of the ingredients needed for Asian
recipes except for kaffir lime leaves. What can I use instead?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Fresh kaffir lime leaves (also called Thai lime leaves) are a
near-ubiquitous ingredient in Southeast Asian soups, curries and
stir-fries. Unfortunately, unless you live near an Asian specialty
store, they can be difficult to find. Although many sources tell
you to substitute grated lime zest, nothing can really deliver the
citrus perfume of a fresh kaffir lime leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, kaffir lime leaves are also sold frozen or dried (the
frozen ones are slightly better).
</P>
<P>
   Fruit Flies
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where do fruit flies come from, and are they a health hazard?
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The common fruit fly (Drosophila) is not dangerous, but an
infestation in your kitchen can be a nuisance. Fruit flies tend to
accumulate around decaying organic matter, like overripe fruits or
vegetables, trimmings that may sit for a few days in an uncovered
garbage can, or house plants. They are also attracted to moisture
and light. Once they appear, fruit flies reproduce rapidly, laying
up to 500 eggs at a time. The larvae will then mature in 9 to 12
days.
</P>
<P>
   To control them, ripe fruits and vegetables should be
refrigerated and overripe ones thrown away outside the house.
Cleaning drains and garbage cans with a stiff brush can kill the
larvae, as will a good rinse with boiling water. Household
insecticides will eliminate adult flies, but they don't destroy the
larvae.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Richard Garriott is building a 21st-century
castle on 65 acres along a bluff above Lake Austin. The
20,000-square-foot house, designed by Moore/Andersson Architects in
Austin, will be surrounded by a moat and reached by a drawbridge
that is typically medieval, with ``oak planks and iron straps,''
said Garriott. However, the master's approach to the house will be
controlled by a garage-door opener. When Garriott comes barreling
up his driveway, through the ``Jurassic Park''-style gates,'' a
submerged road will rise up through the moat so he can drive across
without lowering the drawbridge or fiddling with the portcullis.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation of the house will look ancient, as if a new
structure has been built on something very old. And in some terms
it will be; it has taken six months to pour the slab because the
lower levels _ crofts, Garriott calls them, with all their secret
chambers, staircases and pools _ are so complicated.
</P>
<P>
   This house will be more about gaming, both visual and physical,
than haunting, said Garriott. A three-story public house, a guest
house, a private house and a carousel tower will encircle a
multilevel pool. The bluff side of the pool will have a negative
edge made of glass. A 12-foot glass wall will hold back the pool
water so that when viewed from far below, it will look like a wall
of water suspended over the cliff, said Garriott.
</P>
<P>
   To get to the lake, Garriott installed a shaft 150 feet deep and
then tunneled 150 feet to arrive at the boat dock. The shaft's
elevator can be reached through the master bedroom, where the
master's bed is designed to rise through the ceiling of the domed
planetarium for communing with the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Guest bedrooms are also motorized, and visitors who fall asleep
in one room may be surprised to wake up in completely different
surroundings. The beds are on a turntable apparatus, controlled by
Garriott, that rotates them into a different room.
</P>
<P>
   The public building will have three floors; the apse end will
function as an enormous elevator, so that Garriott can elevate
floor-to-floor and visit all his guests should he be having a
seated dinner for 200. A banquet-style kitchen will be installed,
as will ``storerooms.'' A pantry just wouldn't be large enough.
</P>
<P>
   The house will have permanent party lighting installed that will
be appropriate for Halloween festivities or romantic events, in
case a wedding is scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not mine, though'' said Garriott, who lives with personal
trainer, Heather Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Everything will be controlled by voice commands, but not
directly. Britannia will be ruled by a spirit, and Garriott will
make requests via the spirit. There are underground passages, and
tunnels under the swimming pool and tunnels in the swimming pool.
Garriott likes the secret entrance and exit.
</P>
<P>
   The carousel tower rises out of the swimming pool; each corner
of the tower features a different playground attraction _ a water
slide, a rock-climbing wall, a secret passage to the house or a
staircase to the swim tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   The house is scheduled to be completed in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The hedge maze will take a little longer.

A TEA SO DELICATE AND FRAGRANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tiny, tasty and costly, jasmine pearls are balls of tea made
from the smallest, tenderest leaves of the plant. The leaves are
mixed with jasmine blossoms at night, just after these flowers open
and when they have the strongest aroma.
</P>
<P>
   As the leaves take on the jasmine scent, the blossoms are tossed
away; the process is repeated until the leaves are deeply perfumed.
</P>
<P>
   This green tea is then rolled up into little pearls and dried.
The pearls, when steeped in hot water, unfurl languorously and give
the tea a golden tint. The tea is delicate, with a light grassy
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an ordinary tea and deserves to be drunk from a
porcelain cup: after all, delicacy requires delicacy. A perfect
brew uses one pearl for each ounce of water _ about five pearls for
the average cup.
</P>
<P>
   But the buyer must beware: some jasmine pearls are made with
less-than-tender leaves. These lesser-grade pearls do not show off
pointy tips when they open, and they make a tea with a muddy
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see it rolled up in a ball, but there's a lot of grade
differentiation'' in jasmine pearls, said Bill Todd, whose company,
Todd &AMP; Holland Tea Merchants in River Forest, Ill., distributes an
excellent grade made in China. ``Can you tell by looking at it? No.
Can you tell by smelling it? Probably no. The only way you can tell
is to brew it, and to taste it.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1.6 ounce glass jar of Todd &AMP; Holland jasmine pearls, has 300
pearls and is $22. It is also available in packets holding
eight-tenths of an ounce of pearls ($11.20 a packet) and larger
glass jars holding four ounces of pearls ($56.) Shipping is $4 to
$6. To order: (800) 747-8327 or www.todd-holland.com.

   MEXICO CITY _ I've learned to embrace skeletons in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Skeletons merrily dancing jigs, their skirts and braids flying
and their teeth fixed in eternal grins. Skeleton dentists _ their
ribs cloaked in white coats _ pulling the teeth of obliging
skeleton patients. Skeleton butchers wrapping up slices of pork and
beef.
</P>
<P>
   I've even learned to appreciate the skeleton business executives
who sexually harass their skeleton secretaries. You can almost hear
the quiet sighs of revulsion as the bony secretaries succumb to the
clutches of their grinning bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's centuries-old Day of the Dead celebrations, which took
place here this week, may seem ghoulish or just plain
incomprehensible to many outsiders. But once you immerse yourself
in this playful tradition poking fun at the Grim Reaper, it really
starts to get under your skin.
</P>
<P>
   The market where I shop comes alive with people scrambling for
foodstuffs and the skeleton dolls they use to build special altars
in their homes. People prepare baskets of goodies to leave on their
loved ones' tombs on the nights of Nov. 1 and Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Candles flicker in corners of restaurants and shops, and the air
is filled with the earthy scent of the orange marigolds
traditionally used to decorate graves or shrines commemorating
family members or other loved ones who've passed on.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers load up on round loaves of ``pan de muerto'' or ``dead
bread'' sprinkled with sugar or sesame seeds. And they cluster
around booths where venders sell skulls made from spun sugar and
chocolate, as well as dozens and dozens of traditional skeleton
dolls crafted from papier mache or plaster.
</P>
<P>
   These ``muertos'' or ``dead ones,'' as the skeletons are called,
are often so meticulously and cleverly put together you can't help
but repeat what you hear everyone around you saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ay, que bonito!'' Oh, so pretty!
</P>
<P>
   And after a while, they really do look beautiful. Before moving
to Mexico, I had dabbled a bit in Day of the Dead customs. I bought
a couple of sugar skulls I found in a Mexican import stores and
bought one ``muerto'' that remains a favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Painted on the outside of little cages containing skeletons in
striped prison garb is a play on words in Spanish: ``It's more
convenient to have political prisoners (presos politicos), than to
have politicians prisoners (politicos presos).''
</P>
<P>
   Now that I'm in the cradle of the Day of the Dead, I've started
a full-fledged collection of ``muertos.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, the skeletons seem so human. I recently spotted and
swiftly purchased a statue of two female skeletons, staggering
drunk and gesturing wildly in inebriated bliss as they clutched
their shawls around their bony shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Another treasure is thoroughly modern. It's a woman skeleton
hunched over a computer terminal, her skull cocked at a
contemplative angle as she concentrates on her prose.
</P>
<P>
   For my husband, a fan of the great sculpture Auguste Rodin, I
was delighted to have found a skeleton Thinker. An exact replica of
the famous statue, the skeleton rests the chin of his skull on a
bony fist, which in turn rests on a bony knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Mexicans are very sarcastic. We make jokes out of
everything. And this is a sarcastic way of accepting death,''
explained Armando Martinez, who makes exquisite ``muertos'' out of
paper, wire and cloth and decorates them with tiny guitars, flowers
and bottles of tequila.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich or poor,'' he said, ``we all end up going to our tombs
one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Day of the Dead coincides with All Souls Day, which was
introduced to Mexico by the Spanish as they converted the Indians
to Catholicism. But the roots go back to indigenous customs
requiring tribute to the dead, who were considered links to God and
the world beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spanish came and evangelized, but we Mexicans didn't give
up our past,'' Martinez said as he fluffed the clothes hanging on
the bones of a skeleton bride and groom, a skeleton flower vender
and a skeleton playing marbles.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Halloween threatens to intrude on Day of the Dead.
Children dress up as witches and vampires and go trick-or-treating.
But many of the traditions of Day of the Dead appear to be as
strong as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Another doll maker, Aurora Garcia, told me that the holiday is
just too ``alegre,'' or too ``happy,'' to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my children that when I die, they should please build
me an altar every year, just like I've done for my family members
who have passed on,'' she said. ``That's how I want to be
remembered.''

`ROOM FOR DESSERT': SIMPLE AND SWEET FROM A MASTER BAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As I paged through ``Room for Dessert'' by David Lebovitz, I
immediately began baking and tasting _ in my head. I wondered if
the ginger cake, made with fresh ginger, would be much different
from one made with dried ginger. Or if the black and white cookies
would be crisp and bittersweet, like a cocoa cookie I once made
from a recipe in a newspaper clipping. I wanted to make the nocino
custard simply because I had never heard of it before.
</P>
<P>
   This book (HarperCollins, $30) is as endearing as it is
brilliantly appealing, because Lebovitz writes with a personal
touch. It could be categorized as a chef's cookbook, but that would
be an unfortunate label, as most of those thick compendiums are
full of desserts meant to be composed by a team of cooks, not by a
home cook with a conventional oven.
</P>
<P>
   Lebovitz's approach is neither intimidating nor dumbed down. The
110 recipes are ones he collected during his 12 years as a pastry
cook at Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., and in his stint as the
pastry chef at Monsoon in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   His inclination is toward simplicity and seasonal though
esoteric ingredients, like Meyer lemons, persimmons and red
bananas. This might pose a few shopping problems _ I was unable to
find green walnuts, a rare item, for the nocino _ but it also keeps
you going back to the book, season to season.
</P>
<P>
   Odd ingredients are not added to impress. Orange flower water in
nougat is there to give lofty flavor, not flair; the Sauternes in a
sauce with apricots is the perfect allusion to the fruit's nectar.
And few recipes take very long to make, a reflection of his own
impatience. ``I love to eat and I hate to wait too long for an
outcome,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Lebovitz hands over a collection of his best recipes and leaves
you to assert your own know-how. If you have basic baking skills,
this is not too difficult. His instructions are clear and simple,
and the recipes are so good that it becomes clear what a master
baker he is, without his announcing it himself with complex
recipes.
</P>
<P>
   The ginger cake was a perfect example. No more complicated than
a spiced loaf cake, it was moist and flavorful. The fresh ginger
came through more with each hour it sat. In the coarse black and
white cookies, ground almonds evened the bitterness in the
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Sesame orange almond tuiles took five minutes to mix together
and turned out just as they do in restaurants _ thin and as fragile
as porcelain. The pistachio and cardamom cake was a delight to make
and had a beautiful green and butter-yellow batter. With it was an
apricot sauce, which I made with dried Turkish apricots. They were
soft and lovely and added to the fragrant cake. Leftover sauce
would be well used over vanilla ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   I also made vin d'orange, an aperitif that Lebovitz says is
similar to Lillet. I mixed together oranges, lemons, white wine,
vodka and sugar in a bottle and put it away for a month as
instructed. Given the success I had with his other recipes, I'm not
at all nervous about what will turn out. Just eager.
</P>
<P>
   FRESH GINGER CAKE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Room for Dessert'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes, plus 1{ hours for baking and cooling
</P>
<P>
   1 cup mild molasses
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   2{ cups flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking soda
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces fresh ginger, peeled sliced and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs, at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   1. Position rack in center of oven. Preheat to 350 degrees. Line
a 9-inch round cake pan with 3-inch sides, or a 9{-inch springform
pan, with a circle of fine parchment paper.
</P>
<P>
   2. Mix together the molasses, sugar and oil. In another bowl,
sift together flour, cinnamon, cloves and black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   3. In a small saucepan, bring 1 cup water to a boil. Stir in
baking soda, then mix hot water into molasses mixture. Stir in
ginger.
</P>
<P>
   4. Gradually whisk the dry ingredients into batter. Add eggs,
and continue mixing until everything is thoroughly combined. Pour
the batter into prepared cake pan, and bake for about 1 hour, until
top of cake springs back lightly when pressed or until a toothpick
inserted into center comes out clean. If the top of cake browns too
quickly before cake is done, drape a piece of foil over it and
continue baking.
</P>
<P>
   5. Cool cake for at least 30 minutes. Run a knife around edge of
cake to loosen it from pan. Invert cake onto a cooling rack, and
peel off parchment paper.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 10 servings.

   Shoppers load up on round loaves of ``pan de muerto'' or ``dead
bread'' sprinkled with sugar or sesame seeds. And they cluster
around booths where venders sell skulls made from spun sugar and
chocolate, as well as dozens and dozens of traditional skeleton
dolls crafted from papier mache or plaster.
</P>
<P>
   These ``muertos'' or ``dead ones,'' as the skeletons are called,
are often so meticulously and cleverly put together you can't help
but repeat what you hear everyone around you saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ay, que bonito!'' Oh, so pretty!
</P>
<P>
   And after a while, they really do look beautiful. Before moving
to Mexico, I had dabbled a bit in Day of the Dead customs. I bought
a couple of sugar skulls I found in a Mexican import stores and
bought one ``muerto'' that remains a favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Painted on the outside of little cages containing skeletons in
striped prison garb is a play on words in Spanish: ``It's more
convenient to have political prisoners (presos politicos), than to
have politicians prisoners (politicos presos).''
</P>
<P>
   Now that I'm in the cradle of the Day of the Dead, I've started
a full-fledged collection of ``muertos.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, the skeletons seem so human. I recently spotted and
swiftly purchased a statue of two female skeletons, staggering
drunk and gesturing wildly in inebriated bliss as they clutched
their shawls around their bony shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Another treasure is thoroughly modern. It's a woman skeleton
hunched over a computer terminal, her skull cocked at a
contemplative angle as she concentrates on her prose.
</P>
<P>
   For my husband, a fan of the great sculpture Auguste Rodin, I
was delighted to have found a skeleton Thinker. An exact replica of
the famous statue, the skeleton rests the chin of his skull on a
bony fist, which in turn rests on a bony knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Mexicans are very sarcastic. We make jokes out of
everything. And this is a sarcastic way of accepting death,''
explained Armando Martinez, who makes exquisite ``muertos'' out of
paper, wire and cloth and decorates them with tiny guitars, flowers
and bottles of tequila.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich or poor,'' he said, ``we all end up going to our tombs
one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Day of the Dead coincides with All Souls Day, which was
introduced to Mexico by the Spanish as they converted the Indians
to Catholicism. But the roots go back to indigenous customs
requiring tribute to the dead, who were considered links to God and
the world beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spanish came and evangelized, but we Mexicans didn't give
up our past,'' Martinez said as he fluffed the clothes hanging on
the bones of a skeleton bride and groom, a skeleton flower vender
and a skeleton playing marbles.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Halloween threatens to intrude on Day of the Dead.
Children dress up as witches and vampires and go trick-or-treating.
But many of the traditions of Day of the Dead appear to be as
strong as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Another doll maker, Aurora Garcia, told me that the holiday is
just too ``alegre,'' or too ``happy,'' to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my children that when I die, they should please build
me an altar every year, just like I've done for my family members
who have passed on,'' she said. ``That's how I want to be
remembered.''

   A body clock that confuses day and night causes some symptoms of
a rare genetic defect, scientists say. Their discovery marks the
first time circadian rhythm genes have been implicated in a
behavioral disorder.
</P>
<P>
   One child in 25,000 is born with Smith-Magenis syndrome, a
congenital disease that causes severe learning problems,
hyperactivity and unusual sleep patterns. These children are
missing a chunk of one of their two copies of chromosome 17, but no
one knows which genes are lost.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatrician Helene De Leersnyder and her colleagues at the
Necker Hospital in Paris tried to learn more by following the daily
activity of 20 children with Smith-Magenis syndrome between the
ages of 4 and 17. Each child wore a wrist monitor that tracked
motion, and parents were asked to keep a detailed record of when
the child napped, went to bed and woke up.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern that emerged resembled permanent jet lag. Despite
several naps during the day, all the children went to sleep by 9
p.m. and were up before dawn the next morning. By early evening,
most could barely keep their eyes open. ``They sometimes fell
asleep during dinner with food in their mouth,'' De Leersnyder
says.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers studied eight of the children more closely for
24 hours, monitoring their levels of melatonin, thought to be the
body's primary sleep-inducing hormone. Melatonin levels normally
rise from 9 p.m., peaking at midnight then tapering off until dawn.
But the children's melatonin levels rose during the morning to peak
at noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child struggles against sleep all day,'' De Leersnyderm
says. ``I believe the hyperactivity comes from the fight against
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers hoped to find out which body clock gene had been
deleted. They suspected it might be per1, which lurks somewhere
around the part of chromosome 17 that is missing in people with
Smith-Magenis. The activity of this gene has a daily cycle within
the brain's master clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN,
which responds to environmental light cues from the retina and
helps control the pineal gland, the brain structure that makes
melatonin.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that, in fact, per1 lies just outside the
deleted part of the chromosome 17, not within it. But Mike Young, a
circadian rhythm researcher at Rockefeller University in New York,
says it might still be involved. A nearby deletion could change the
way per1 is expressed and disrupt its cycle, he says. That could
profoundly alter circadian rhythms. ``Misexpression can really mess
things up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   De Leersnyder adds that other symptoms of Smith-Magenis
syndrome, such as severe learning difficulties, are probably not
linked. They may be caused by the deletion of other genes that are
unrelated to the body clock. &QL;

EDITORS NOTE: The Chronicle regularly features ``Best Way'', a
column in which the Food staff tries to establish the most reliable
way to cook many of our favorite foods.  Mashed Potatoes 
 &HT;       
   
 By Sean Forsha  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Oh, the mashed potato. So revered is this
ubiquitous side dish that it has its own dance. But what is it that
makes the perfect mashed potato? It took two days, 25 pounds of
potatoes and a diligent panel of tasters to decide how to get the
best texture and flavor from the humble spud.
<P>
   For each test we used 1 pound of peeled russet potatoes boiled
in water and seasoned with 1 teaspoon salt before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Testing for texture, we challenged a hand masher, a ricer, a
food mill and a KitchenAid mixer to make the best mash.
</P>
<P>
   The hand method won out, creating a finished product that had
evenly distributed small lumps and the classic mashed potato feel.
The ricer was a close second, producing potatoes that were fluffy
but overall too uniform for the department's tastes. The food mill
produced potatoes that were smooth but lacked texture while the
mixer gave us gummy, overworked mashers that had large lumps.
</P>
<P>
   Next we tested for fat, adding 6 tablespoons of fat to one pound
of potatoes in six different combinations. The potatoes were
hand-mashed and seasoned with one teaspoon of salt before serving.
The competitors: whole milk, heavy cream, unsalted butter, and
combinations of whole milk and butter, heavy cream and butter and
half-and-half and butter. We looked for flavor, mouthfeel and
texture.
</P>
<P>
   The cream and butter mixture ultimately prevailed as the
tasters' favorite by providing a mashed potato that was delicious
on its own as well as paired with gravy. The ratio of 1/4 cup of
cream and 2 tablespoons of butter to 1 pound of potatoes turned out
to be the preferred combination.
</P>
<P>
   The final test was the timing for adding salt. We tested salting
the potatoes during cooking, salting them during cooking and adding
more at the end, and salting only at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Department tasters agreed that the best formula was to add 1
teaspoon salt to the cooking water and then add more salt to taste
or leave as is, per individual preference. These potatoes had
complete, full flavor with a distinct punch of salt that accented
the butteriness.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MASHED POTATOES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound russet potatoes (about 2 potatoes)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt + salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Peel the potatoes and cut into eighths. Place in a large pot and
cover with cold water. Add the teaspoon of salt and bring to a
simmer over medium-high heat. Simmer until the potatoes are cooked
through, about 7 minutes. Drain potatoes in a large colander and
shake to remove excess moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, warm the cream in a saucepan over low heat; or pour
the cream into a microwave-safe container and microwave for 30
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl and mash with a hand-held
potato masher until they reach the texture you like. Fold in the
butter and cream and correct the seasoning with salt.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4 (6-ounce servings).
</P>
<P>
   Note: To reheat mashed potatoes, place in a microwave-safe bowl,
cover with plastic wrap and microwave on high for 2 minutes until
heated through.

Fresh.  WORKING COOK: Tomatoes Join Pumpkins on Fall Menus 
 &HT;       
   
 By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  If you hit the farmers' market just right during
fall, the Bay Area climate yields an embarrassment of riches. Go to
one stall full of late-season tomatoes and think outdoor dinner a
la Provence; look at another stall full of pumpkins and think
intimate dinner by the fire.
<P>
   It may be too cool for dining  &LR; al fresco &LR; , but with this year's
late tomato harvest you can still eat as if it were summer. Use the
tomatoes in Anchovy-Rubbed Tuna Steaks with Tomato-Mint Salsa, this
week's Fast&AMP;Fresh recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Anchovy scares off a lot of people, but in this twist on a
classic Sicilian treatment of tuna, it adds a surprisingly subtle
note of saltiness to the rich fish. The cool tomato and mint
offsets any brininess.
</P>
<P>
   For a dinner that's more reminiscent of fall, try the Roasted
Winter Squash Soup. It's a thick but silky-textured vegetarian soup
with roasted garlic and cool-weather seasonings like sage and
nutmeg.
</P>
<P>
   While the squash and garlic are roasting, prepare the easy
vegetable stock recipe. With hearty whole-wheat bread and some
sauteed greens, this soup makes a full meal.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-Minute Main Dish, which combines the elements of veal
saltimbocca with capellini pasta, will fit into either season. Thin
strips of veal scaloppine tossed with the wispy pasta makes for a
light dish that still carries the intense flavors of sage and
pancetta.

 &LR; ANCHOVY-RUBBED TUNA STEAKS WITH TOMATO-MINT SALSA
</P>
<P>
   The amount of anchovy in the marinade is too intense for a long
marinating time. If you would like to marinate ahead, reduce the
amount of anchovy by half.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 tuna steaks or thick fillets
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   14 anchovy fillets, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   4 large ripe tomatoes

<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat the broiler or grill before beginning preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Rub the tuna steaks with the crushed garlic, salt and pepper.
Place the tuna in a shallow bowl and cover with the minced
anchovies.
</P>
<P>
   Broil or grill the steaks until done to your liking, about 7
minutes for medium. Keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   While the tuna cooks, make the salsa. Slice the tomatoes in half
horizontally. Squeeze out and discard the seeds and juices,
scooping out the cavity with your finger if necessary. Cut the
tomato flesh into small dice.
</P>

<P>
   Put a large pot of salted water on to boil for the pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Season the scaloppine on both sides with salt and pepper, then
dredge lightly in the flour.
</P>
<P>
   Saute the pancetta until crisp in a large heavy skillet. Crumble
into bite-size pieces; set aside. Discard the fat in the pan. Add
the olive oil to the pan and place over medium-high heat. When the
oil is hot, add the veal and saute until just cooked through, about
3 minutes. Remove from the pan; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Begin cooking the pasta according to package directions.
</P>
<P>
   Deglaze the veal pan with the wine over medium-high heat. Add
the sage and shallot and let the wine reduce by about half. This
should take about 4 minutes. Add the chicken stock and lemon juice
and bring to a simmer. Add the pancetta, then stir in the butter.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the scaloppine into 1-inch strips. Return the drained
pasta to its pot and add the veal strips and capers, then the
sauce, tossing to combine.

<P>
   While the squash is cooking, roast the garlic. Trim off and
discard the tops of the bulbs. Drizzle with olive oil, wrap in
aluminum foil and roast until soft, about 1 hour. Remove and cool
completely. When cool enough to handle, squeeze out the soft cloves
and combine with the squash.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, heat the butter and canola oil in a heavy saute pan.
Add the onions and saute over low heat until caramelized, about 20
minutes. Mix in the sage and season with salt and pepper. Combine
with the roasted garlic and squash mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Puree the squash mixture in a blender, adding stock as
necessary, until smooth. Strain the puree through a fine mesh sieve
into a medium pot; stir in the remaining stock. Bring to a simmer
and add the cream, then lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper.

EDITORS NOTE: Bay Area Classics profiles food-related businesses
more than a half century old.  Tarantino's: Italian by Name, Irish at Heart  
   
 By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  They were two young men fresh out of Uncle Sam's
Navy at the conclusion of World War II, casting about for something
challenging to do in civilian life.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dan Sweeney Jr. and Gene McAteer both offspring of San Francisco
Irish families, decided a restaurant might provide that challenge.
Finding a largely unused 1922 building at Fisherman's Wharf, they
leased the site, started remodeling and, in 1946, opened
Tarantino's.
</P>
<P>
   Did they know anything about the restaurant business? ``Not
really,'' says Gary Burns, general manager/partner of the
waterfront landmark for the past 19 years. But those were simpler
times. ``You hired a chef and put in a good bar,'' and away you
went.
</P>
<P>
   And why would two men proud of their Irish heritage give their
venture an Italian name? Because the building, formerly home to the
Crab Fishermen's Protective Association, was owned by the Tarantino
fishing family, and the two young entrepreneurs thought McAteer's
or Sweeney's wouldn't sound right next to the establishments of the
Sabellas, Castagnolas, Aliotos, DiMaggios and other Little Italy
community members. They purchased rights to the Tarantino name, all
the while referring to themselves as ``the two Irishmen of
Fisherman's Wharf'' and pinning shamrocks to their own and their
staff's lapels.
</P>
<P>
   The custom is maintained to this day under the ownership of
another offspring of the Emerald Isle, Bill McDonnell, and his son,
Tim.
</P>
<P>
   The elder McDonnell became a partner in 1958, principally as the
man behind Sausalito's Spinnaker restaurant, a Tarantino's offshoot
that opened in 1959. Eight years later, McAteer, 1936 captain of
the University of California at Berkeley football team and later a
California state senator, collapsed and died playing handball at
the Olympic Club. Partner Sweeney had gone on to other pursuits,
and that left McDonnell as the sole Irishman on Fisherman's Wharf.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed in the half-century-plus of Tarantino's
existence. The building was extended over the pier, increasing
seating capacity and maximizing the view of fishing boats below and
the Golden Gate in the distance. A wheelchair-accessible downstairs
dining room has been added, as well as sidewalk seating for
informal midday eating. The restaurant's color scheme has gone from
dark to light, and an open, airy bar area has replaced what was
massive, dark and, in Burns' words, a typical men's bar.
</P>
<P>
   That bar, he recalls, was once central to the operation, with
many guests starting the evening with a lengthy session there,
taking a break for dinner, then returning to the bar for the real
business of the evening, imbibing.
</P>
<P>
   Those drinking customs are as much a thing of the past as
50-cent crab cocktails (on a 1947 menu) and the heavy sauces _
lobster Thermidor, shrimp Newburg _ that once was the mark of a
fine seafood restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Back in mid-century, seafood restaurants did have spaghetti on
the menu if they were of Italian orientation, but nobody would have
believed the rise to stardom which pasta experienced in the '80s
and '90s. Burns estimates that pasta accounts for up to 30 percent
of the meals served today.
</P>
<P>
   What's combined with those pastas would also have startled
Tarantino's founders: angel hair pasta with bay shrimp, mushrooms,
sun-dried tomatoes and garlic; linguine with baby clams and pesto;
fettuccine with shrimp and scallops in a creamy herb and garlic
sauce. Whatever happened to meatballs?
</P>
<P>
   Some vestiges of past menus survive. Tarantino's _ as every
other seafood venue on the wharf _ still offers a mixed fried
seafood platter (now $17.95). ``You have to have it,'' says Burns,
just as you must leave abalone on the menu, despite the prohibitive
price _ the restaurant shells out $65 a pound for it.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers, says Burns, who oversees seafood purchases as
well as the ever-expanding wine inventory, remember abalone from
their youth and insist on ordering it, even though the sauteed
abalone steak for which their parents paid $1.25 in the late '40s
now may cost $58 (the menu discreetly lists it as ``market
priced'').
</P>
<P>
   Midwestern and Southern tourists still lean toward fried rather
than the lighter preparations favored by most locals, but he also
finds that many tourists are willing to try something different
other than the widely available varieties like salmon. They may
experiment with Northern California sole or sand dabs _ and have
something to talk about back home.
</P>
<P>
   Crab is another adventure for many out-of-towners. Cracked crab
is a big seller, particularly at the casual sidewalk tables that
were added a year and a half ago. Rather than having something
ready to be consumed presented on a plate, says Burns, ``eating
cracked crab is a hands-on experience.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their appreciation of the tourist trade, Burns says he
and his fellow wharf restaurateurs are deeply rooted in the
community. ``We all went to school here. We have our families and
friends here. If they approve (of the food and service at the
wharf), we're doing the right thing.''

CONTROVERSIAL SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS TECH COLUMNIST QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Former San Jose Mercury News technology
columnist Chris Nolan has resigned her job at the newspaper,
leaving behind charges of sexual discrimination and a public feud
with the paper's brass.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan, 40, who had written the paper's ``Talk is Cheap'' Silicon
Valley gossip column since January 1997, was suspended from writing
her column last July after the Wall Street Journal revealed she had
invested in and profited from the initial public offering of
AutoWeb.Com, a Santa Clara, Calif., Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said at the time that she had informed her immediate
supervisors about the investment.
</P>
<P>
   In a column written the Sunday after her suspension, Mercury
News Executive Editor David Yarnold wrote: ``(T)he fact that Chris
enjoyed a benefit not available to the public at large _ one
provided by a news source _ violated a cardinal rule of
journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1, Nolan filed a charge of sexual discrimination,
retaliatory firing and unequal pay with the California Department
of Fair Employment &AMP; Housing.
</P>
<P>
   In her complaint, Nolan alleged that she ``received
substantially less pay than all male columnists with similar
experience and job position.''
</P>
<P>
   She also alleged that other female writers at the paper received
less pay than their male counterparts, and that she was not
marketed like other male writers at the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan also charged that the disciplinary action against her in
the wake of her AutoWeb investment was based on her past complaints
about sex discrimination at the Mercury News.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the Mercury News treated me unfairly,'' said Nolan,
reached by phone Monday evening. ``They paid other male columnists
more than they paid me, and there are other pay and work
discrepancies. They're pretty well known, and were brought to my
attention by my supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are getting better, more prestigious and more powerful
jobs in newspapers, but, in many cases, we have to bend backwards
and work in high heels for less money,'' Nolan added. ``That's not
right, and that's not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 21, the Mercury News canceled Nolan's column and
suspended her for one week. The paper later reassigned her to cover
the cities of Belmont and San Carlos, and said it would cut her
salary.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to his staff, Yarnold said Nolan ``at minimum, created
the appearance of a conflict of interest for herself and the
Mercury News and she failed to exercise a reasonable level of
professional responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In a four-page response distributed to the media, Nolan
countered that the policy had been ``gathering dust on a shelf in a
remote office and wasn't distributed to me or others on the staff
when we joined the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan's letter said that _ contrary to Yarnold's column _ the
executive who had offered her the stock deal was not a news source
but a friend whom she'd known for years. She said she had not
written about him or his company. She took the offer, she said,
because she thought her firsthand experience would make a ``good
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan's letter said she had bought and sold the stock in March
with an editor's ``knowledge and approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarnold, reached by The San Francisco Examiner Monday evening,
declined to comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan, who gave the paper two weeks' notice Monday, said she had
received an offer from the New York Post tabloid to run her Silicon
Valley gossip column.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong curiosity about this place,'' said Nolan.
``And I was fortunate enough to be here early enough to build up
the contacts needed for a great column.''

wine grape harvests throughout California until crush's end around
November.   
 CRUSH '99: Oddball Year Ends Up a Little Short  By Janet Fletcher  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  You could almost hear the sighs of relief in Napa
Valley last week as winemakers harvested their last grapes only
days _ or in some cases hours _ before the season's first heavy
rainfall. With grape juice safely in the tanks, winemakers no
longer have to worry about the bunch rot that can attack
rain-soaked fruit. Finally, the exceedingly strange vintage of 1999
is almost over.
<P>
   By most recollections, the harvest was one of the most
concentrated ever. ``What usually takes us 10 weeks has taken about
four,'' says Kent Rosenblum of Alameda's Rosenblum Cellars.
``Everything decided to get ripe at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Vintners also uniformly report low yields this year. Many say
they are 20 to 30 percent below normal; for some, the shortage is
worse. At Oakville's Silver Oak Wine Cellars, winemaker Daniel
Baron says that his 20 percent shortfall took him by surprise; a
scientific crop estimate he made in September _ usually accurate
within 1 to 2 percent _ pointed to a larger crop.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, as grapes take on sugar the clusters become heavier
between veraison (when color change begins) and harvest. This year,
the clusters seemed to be heavier at veraison, Baron says _ perhaps
because they overhydrated during the cool summer. When hot weather
finally arrived in October, the grapes actually lost weight,
throwing prediction schemes off.
</P>
<P>
   Winemakers will earn their salaries this fall as they grapple
with fruit that is, in a word, quirky. ``We saw very unusual
performance of fruit that we've been buying for years,'' Baron
says. ``Vineyards that are normally tannic are lighter and not
tannic; vineyards that are usually lighter and not tannic are more
tannic than normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, winemakers can adjust their maceration times,
fining and other winery practices to manipulate tannins somewhat.
And on the positive side, the smaller-than-normal berries mean a
higher skin-to-juice ratio, giving wines more color and intensity
than vintners have seen in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   With California-style confidence in their ability to work with
what they're given, many predict that the wines from this oddball
year will be just fine. ``Tannins help fix the color and character
of wine,'' Rosenblum says, ``so this could be a good vintage in
terms of ageability.''

 FOOD IN THE NEWS: The Price of Pignoli Goes Nuts   By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Good news and bad news on the nut front.
<P>
   First, the bad news. The price of pine nuts will continue to
climb, brokers and wholesalers say.
</P>
<P>
   Although some pine nuts are imported from Italy (called pignoli)
and Portugal, the bulk of Bay Area supplies come from China. And
prices are driven by the basic rules of supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, when the crop was particularly good, more
Chinese started eating pignoli toasted in their shells. At the same
time, the United States' appetite for pine nuts was growing. Crops
in the following years were smaller but demand was high.
Subsequently, the price jumped.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesalers Pacific Coast Products in San Francisco and In a Nut
Shell in San Leandro are currently selling pine nuts for $6.50 to
$8 per pound. That translates into retail prices of $14 to $15 per
pound at markets like Andronico's and Whole Foods.
</P>
<P>
   The prices will continue to rise, brokers predict, because next
year's crop is expected to be small. Brace for a $1- to
$2-per-pound hike soon after the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   However, there's good news about another nut. Sandy McBride of
Stockton's Diamond of California nut cooperative says this year's
unusually mild and cloudy summer, combined with the maturation of
some new orchards, make the 1999 walnut harvest the largest ever in
Diamond's 87-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The fall harvest is expected to bring in 280,000 tons of walnuts
from some 100,000 acres of trees. That's 23 percent more nuts than
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Long periods of intense sun can actually burn walnuts, McBride
says. This year, cool temperatures in July and August helped trees
as far north as Chico produce an exceptional crop. In addition,
growers have planted 20,000 acres of new walnut trees. Some of the
trees, which take about seven years to produce nuts, came into
maturity this year.
</P>
<P>
   The first batch of each season's walnut crop is shipped to
European countries, where California-grown walnuts are part of
holiday celebrations, McBride says. Most of the rest of the harvest
goes to the domestic market, where demand for the nuts peaks during
October, November and December.
</P>
<P>
   California is the only state to grow walnuts commercially, and
Diamond is the world's largest walnut processor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hoard Those Snickers Bars &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If scientists don't figure out how to stop fungal disease in the
cocoa fields, the world could face a chocolate shortage, government
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Agriculture last week announced that
government scientists have teamed with researchers from M&AMP;M Mars
and the American Cocoa Research Institute to try to stop three
strains of fungus that are threatening the world's 3 million-ton
cocoa crop.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is hitting the estimated 6 million small cocoa tree
farmers in South America, Africa and Asia particularly hard.
Brazil, which usually exports about $100 million worth of cocoa
beans to the United States every year, has long been South
America's top exporter. But its crop has been so damaged by fungi
that it has slipped to eighth place in recent years, the Department
of Agriculture says.
</P>
<P>
   The fungi attack the cocoa beans and make them inedible. The
solution, researchers believe, is introducing a beneficial fungus
that in early tests seems to control the bad fungi.

 COOK'S BOOKS: Fast Appetizers Make Parties a Snap   By Lynne Bennett  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  With the hectic holiday season rapidly
approaching, Fast Appetizers can help make your party a success
with minimal effort. Hosts want to offer enticing, exciting and
flavorful appetizers and spend time with their guests, not in the
kitchen. Since many of the recipes like Chipotle Chile Dip can be
made in less than fifteen minutes, maximum flavor can be achieved
in minimum time.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new book by the prolific writing-teaching husband-and-wife
team of Hugh Carpenter and Teri Sandison offers some other help.
``Fast Appetizers'' is packed with more than 100 globe-trotting
recipes, many of which can be made in 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tease, tempt and torment your dinner guests,'' Carpenter and
Sandison advise. To do that, they give advice on serving portions,
menu planning, do-ahead steps and general shortcuts.
</P>
<P>
   The instruction in most of the recipes is thorough _ with the
exception of the missing notation, ``salt and pepper to taste.''
Most recipes omit those two key ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The pair's recipes use chiles, spices and acid balanced with
dairy products or oil for texture and mouthfeel. They have their
favorite seasonings _ which, like cilantro, they repeat often.
</P>
<P>
   The herb works to good advantage in three recipes that were
favorites of Food department tasters. Spicy Avocado and Goat Cheese
Dip blends the richness of avocado and tartness of goat cheese with
serrano chiles _ excellent with tortilla chips or spread on pita
bread toasts. Chilled Southwest Scallops _ with pine nuts,
rehydrated ancho chiles and cilantro and served in a butter lettuce
cup _ just needed a little salt and pepper. The recipe would also
work well with shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   Gravlax Infused With Chiles, Cilantro and Vodka is a hands-down
winner. The flavor of the curing marinade penetrated the salmon
fillet and produced a moist, medium-firm gravlax that was a snap to
put together _ just plan ahead for the curing time in the
refrigerator. Serve the gravlax dabbed with Thai Tomato Salsa atop
a slice of baguette. The salsa is also delicious with tortilla
chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fast Appetizers'' includes chapters that cover most appetizer
categories _ dips and spreads, pates, canapes, bar-type nibbles,
pastries, meat and seafood _ with lots of suggestions for
variations. With this book, Carpenter and Sandison have contributed
to stress-free, flavor-filled entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``Fast Appetizers,'' by Hugh Carpenter and Teri Sandison &LR; 
 &LR; (Ten Speed Press; 112 pages softcover; $17.95). &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; GRAVLAX INFUSED WITH CHILES, CILANTRO &AMP; VODKA
</P>
<P>
   This recipe is a new twist on traditional gravlax. The salmon
can be sliced hours before serving. Add leftover gravlax to a green
salad tossed with an oil and vinegar dressing for an excellent
lunch or dinner entree. Wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated,
gravlax will last up to a week.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 (1-pound) fresh center-cut salmon fillet, silver skin and pin
bones removed
</P>
<P>
   Baguette, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   Thai Tomato Salsa (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   Fresh cilantro sprigs, as garnish
</P>
<P>
   Marinade
</P>
<P>
   2 to 4 fresh serrano chiles, seeds included, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup finely minced fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup vodka
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup thin or low-sodium soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Check the salmon for bones and remove any that you find. Combine
all of the ingredients for the marinade. Place the salmon and
marinade in a large plastic zip-top bag. Seal the bag, put it on a
tray, and place in the refrigerator. Then place a 5-quart pot
filled with cold water on top of the salmon to flatten it and firm
its texture (it is unnecessary to turn it).
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The salmon must be prepared to this point and allowed to &LR; 
 &LR; marinate for 2 to 3 days before serving.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Toast the sliced bread lightly on both sides under the broiler,
then lightly butter one side. Prepare the salsa.
</P>
<P>
   With a wet hand, wipe the marinade off both sides of the salmon.
Using a very sharp, thin-bladed knife, cut the salmon into about 50
thin slices, keeping the blade wet so the fish does not tear. Press
plastic wrap over the slices so they do not dry out and refrigerate
until ready to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Place a slice of salmon on each buttered side of bread, then
drizzle with sauce and add a cilantro sprig. Serve the salmon
chilled, with a bowl of salsa on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 10 to 16.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Mollie Stone's Produces Fairest Crab Cakes of 
 All   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  With holidays fast approaching, any shortcuts for
entertaining are sure sellers. Prepared crab cakes, both frozen and
fresh in the fish case, are big time savers, working either as
appetizers for a dinner party, or even as hors d'oeuvres. All a
cook has to do is bake or pan-fry them, and they're ready to go.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted seven different crab cakes, frozen and
fresh. All of the crab cakes were prepared according to package
directions.
</P>
<P>
   The panel overwhelmingly agreed on the best, but many others
fell short. The biggest complaint among panelists was the lack of
crab flavor and the harshness of some seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   And while the crab cakes are time savers, the price can break
the bank. The cakes bought at the fish counter can run as high as
$3.69 each.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists deemed  &UR; Mollie Stone's &LR;  ($2.99 each at Mollie Stone's
in the fish counter) the favorite. Many thought the crab flavor was
too mild and the spicing too strong, but two remarked on how fresh
the cakes tasted. Another described the crust and the balance of
crab to everything else as ``awesome.'' Three would buy them; two
might buy them.
</P>
<P>
   Rankings were much lower after first place, but second place
went to  &UR; Trader Joe's &LR;  (6 ounces, $2.99 at Trader Joe's in the
freezer). Three panelists liked the crab flavor, but another
thought it was too mild. One panelist liked the crunchy exterior,
but another found the interior too soft. One would buy them, two
might buy them, and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Stacy's &LR;  frozen (6 ounces, $6.25-$2.89 at many supermarkets)
came in third, which is particularly interesting, because Stacy's
fresh crab cakes in the fish case scored too low to rate. One
panelist liked the crunchy coating, but others found that it
overpowered the crab flavor. One panelist thought the interior was
nothing like a crab cake. Others thought the flavor was too hot
with pepper. One might buy them; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sonoma &LR;  (6 ounces, $4.49 at Lucky in the freezer case) came in
fourth, scoring just two points lower than Stacy's frozen. Two
panelists liked the crab flavor, but two others found it fishy. Two
panelists also complained about the mushy texture. Three might buy
them; two would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Stacy's fresh, Jeremiah's and Nancy's but
they ranked too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Shelley Handler,
consultant and food writer; Donna Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For All
Seasons, San Francisco; Kim Severson, Chronicle staff writer; and
Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, wine editor Gerald Boyd discusses a
variety of wine topics.  WINE POTPOURRI: Cognac Goes Ultra-Premium 
 &HT;       
   
 By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Not long ago, Cognac producers realized they were
up against a changing market where consumption was going down for
all wines worldwide. This was not news to the producers of the
world's best-known brandy, since spirit sales have been dropping
for years.
<P>
   The good news, though, was that while wine drinkers were
consuming less, they were drinking higher quality wines and
spirits. More ultra-premium wines began to appear on the market,
followed by single-malt Scotch, upscale tequilas and rums and
single-village mescals that tasted like aged brandy.
</P>
<P>
   Cognac producers decided to get onboard and now some houses,
including major brands like Hennessy, are releasing
single-distillery Cognacs. Other houses have opted to release a
series of vintage-dated Cognacs.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessy's new single-distillery Cognacs are designed to reflect
the individual style and heritage of each distillery. The concept
is simple. Instead of a blend of brandies that makes up traditional
Cognac, the character of each single-distillery Cognac comes from
the personal style of an individual distillery; similar to the
concept of single-malt Scotch whisky.
</P>
<P>
   The first three single-distillery Cognacs, in an unlimited
series released by Hennessy, includes Le Peu, Izambard and Camp
Romain. These are in the market now and sell for about $48 a
bottle. Other single-distillery Cognacs now coming into the market
include those from Louis Royer, Gabriel &AMP; Andreu and Ragnaud.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Hine, head of Hine Cognac, a highly regarded producer of
premium Cognacs, says the idea behind single-distillery and
single-vintage Cognacs is ``to fight back at the Scotch people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hine was in town recently and we met for a brief chat about the
new ways the Cognac industry is reinventing itself. ``From 1988
most farms (Cognac distiller/producers) put aside some Cognac to be
released later as vintage,'' says Hine about the move to
vintage-dated Cognac. ``If we think they will develop into a very
good vintage Cognac in the years to come, we keep them and leave
them unblended.''
</P>
<P>
   Hine sees the new products as very small prestige items and
doesn't think they constitute a trend. Nevertheless, Hine has
released several single-vintage Cognacs, although only three are
currently available in the United States. The Hine 1953 ($345),
1957 ($275) and 1960 ($254) are all on the market. They make an
ideal holiday gift when price is not a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Other vintage-dated Cognacs on the market include Delamaincq &LR; 
Vintage Cognac 1950 ($620) and Delamain Vintage Cognac 1959 ($450).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Mixable Cognac &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to crack the growing market of generation x-ers,
Cognac producers are also spending a lot of time, effort and money
on promoting the ``mixability'' of Cognac. Not since the first
Cognacs were sipped in the 15th century has there been much
interest in serving Cognac any other way but straight, as an
after-dinner drink.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a refreshing drink is a blend of Cognac and tonic. The
Cognac producers enjoy Cognac with crushed ice, ginger ale and
tonic. Cognac cocktail parties are popping up throughout France and
across the United States. So, what are you waiting for?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Basics &LR;
</P>
<P>
   All Cognac is brandy, but not all brandy is Cognac. Even so,
Cognac imitators flourished for years. Then, on May 1, 1909, the
French government passed a law proclaiming that only the product
made in a sharply defined area, about 100 miles north of Bordeaux,
could be called Cognac.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the region of Cognac was divided into six grape-growing
areas that roughly describe concentric circles around the town of
Cognac. Beginning from the inside of this circle, and radiating out
in ascending quality, the areas are Grande Champagne, Petite
Champagne, Borderies, Fin Bois, Bon Bois and Bois Ordinares.
</P>
<P>
   The highest quality Cognacs are produced from the first three
areas, with the name often appearing on the label.

   It doesn't happen often, but a California winery is dropping
Chardonnay from its line in favor of a lesser-known white wine.
Napa Valley's Swanson Vineyards has decided to stop making
Chardonnay and concentrate on Pinot Grigio. Owner Clarke Swanson
says, ``We know Chardonnay is the world's most popular white wine,
but sometimes you need to try a different direction.'' The 1997
vintage of Swanson Carneros Chardonnay is the winery's last.
Swanson also produces Syrah, Merlot, Sangiovese and Cabernet
Sauvignon.

 LEARNING TO COOK: Curry Spices Up American Macaroni  By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  If the Indian flavor of curry seems strange used
with Italian pasta, quell your doubts and try this macaroni dish.
This isn't ``fusion food;'' it is just good old American
melting-pot food.
<P>
   Simple and easy to make, this dish may be prepared the day
before needed, or early in the day you plan to serve it. Curry
powder is found in the spice and herb section of supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Serve a salad of spinach leaves, pomegranate seeds and Bartlett
pear slices tossed together and lightly covered with a mix of olive
oil and vinegar and a little water added, plus a dash of salt.
</P>
<P>
   Use about 1 tablespoon vinegar, 2 teaspoons water and 4
tablespoons olive oil. Shake together in a bottle with a lid until
mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett pears have bright yellow skins and look like a lopsided
bell. They should feel firm, but give a little when pressed. They
are very juicy and sweet.

SEPARATING POMEGRANATE SEEDS
</P>
<P>
   Here's an easy way to separate pomegranate seeds from the rind
and white membrane.
</P>
<P>
   Fill a large bowl with cold water. Cut or break the pomegranate
in half. Cut or break each half into about 3 sections. Put the
pieces into the cold water and, using your fingers, break and pull
the white membrane apart from the seeds. The seeds will float to
the top.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; CURRIED MACARONI
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to cook the macaroni and serve it immediately, make
the sauce first so it will be ready when the macaroni is cooked and
hot. Two cups of macaroni will make 31/3 cups cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   5 quarts water
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 cups small dried elbow macaroni
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons curry powder
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cilantro leaves (cilantro is found in the fresh produce
section of the supermarket)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Bring the water to a boil in a large pot and stir in the 1
tablespoon salt. Add the macaroni and stir again so the macaroni
doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Set a timer for 8 minutes and test the macaroni for doneness by
spearing a piece with a fork, running it under cold water and
taking a bite. If it is tender, it is done. If it still seems firm,
give it another 2 minutes of cooking and test again. Cook it until
it is tender.
</P>
<P>
   When the macaroni is cooked, put a colander in the sink, pour in
the macaroni and drain. Put the macaroni in a bowl. If you are
making it ahead of time and don't plan to serve it right away, stir
it with a fork and let it sit while you make the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Making the Sauce: &LR;  Melt the butter in a small saucepan over
medium heat. Watch the butter melt and as soon as it is melted,
stir in the flour and stir constantly until the butter and flour
are smooth and blended. Slowly add the milk, stirring constantly so
no lumps form. Brisk stirring with a whisk, if you have trouble
blending, will help.
</P>
<P>
   Add the curry powder while you cook and stir over medium heat.
Stir the sauce for 5 more minutes so it is thickened and the flour
cooks. Remove the pan from the heat and add salt, a little at a
time, stirring and tasting, until you like the taste. Add pepper to
taste, too.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the sauce over the macaroni and toss and mix until the
sauce and macaroni are blended. Add cilantro leaves and serve.
</P>

   Serves 4.

 Yeo fuses French and Far Eastern ingredients  
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  We're all pretty familiar with coq au vin, the
French chicken stew, but in the hands of Chris Yeo it takes a turn
toward Asia.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yeo, the chef/owner of Straits Cafe in San Francisco, opened a
second location in Palo Alto in 1998. The Palo Alto restaurant
features an expansive outdoor patio and a modern interior with a
nod to tradition with a rich wood bar and accents.
</P>
<P>
   He still serves many of his favorite Singapore-inspired dishes,
such as long bean and okra sambal, but he's branched out with even
more creative combinations at the new larger location.
</P>
<P>
   His Asian-inspired coq au vin follows the same eclectic pattern
to produce a clever and innovative dish. Instead of rosemary, thyme
and other Provencal herbs, Yeo uses star anise, and he replaces
some of the wine with soy sauce. The traditional carrots and pearl
onions are joined by dried shiitake mushrooms and chestnuts.
</P>
<P>
   However, the twists in ingredients don't mean extra work. The
recipe is straightforward and easy. It's great for a party because
it cooks slowly over two hours, and can be made ahead and reheated.

HUMBLE QUINCE MAKES A COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD W. LANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quince, a stepchild in the orchard and a princess in the fruit
bowl, makes its annual appearance at the greengrocer's this time of
year, though hardly in great abundance. Not a fruit for eating out
of hand, quince has a sour, astringent taste uncooked.
</P>
<P>
   But with cooking, quince acquires a mellow yet piquant flavor,
somewhat like that of a spicy pear. Once it has been tasted, quince
becomes as much a part of autumn's favorite flavors as pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   In decades past, no farm in New England was without its lilacs
and white-flowering quince trees full of yellow fruit. While the
lilacs remain, often along the foundations of deserted farmhouses,
the quince tree today is rarely found, a victim of food and
gardening fashions.
</P>
<P>
   While once-exotic mangoes and papayas now dot greengrocer
shelves, what remains of the quince in stores is too often just the
occasional jar of jelly, once a staple in New England pantries.
It's a sad comedown for a fruit that was venerated by the ancient
Greeks and Romans, for whom the quince was a symbol of love,
happiness, fertility and all that was good in the empire.
</P>
<P>
   But now that America's culinary taste is reaching out in all
directions, the future of quince may be a little brighter. Once
considered merely a homey ingredient, quince has been discovered by
chefs who value its distinctive taste.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, quince has taken on a starring role at the aptly
named restaurant Quince, which opened last week in midtown. The
restaurant's decor is keyed to the fruit's palette as it ripens _
lime green to golden yellow _ and a bowl of the fruit at the
entrance fills the room with the quince's irresistible fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   The menu lists dishes like a confit of duck with quince pancakes
in a quince and sour-cherry sauce, and a quince and brioche bread
pudding with nutmeg caramel ice cream. Purple cabbage braised with
quince and red wine are to be added to the menu soon.
</P>
<P>
   The chef, Morgen Jacobson, said he was impressed with the
quince's ``wonderful balance of flavor for either savory or sweet
cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   The home cook should not shy away from cooking with quince: it
is not difficult to deal with. Quince compote can be served hot or
cold. It is a flavorful complement to venison and game, and it goes
spectacularly well with a smoked turkey for Thanksgiving _ if you
can bear to break the cranberry-red tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Quince pie, like mince or apple pie, embodies the classic tastes
of American cooking and is delectable, especially with a large
dollop of fresh whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   One word of caution: be careful when cutting this fruit, as even
the ripest of quince are very hard, making it easy for the knife to
slip. A good tool is a heavy Chinese cleaver, because its weight
adds a certain certitude to the slicing.
</P>
<P>
   Quince has seeds, which can be removed by coring. It can be
cooked peeled or not.
</P>
<P>
   As easy as the quince is to cook with, it is even easier to
cultivate. A slow-growing shrublike tree, the quince rarely reaches
20 feet in height. It is self-pollinating and requires minimal
care, making it an ideal lawn tree. But if you are planting for
fruit, you should be aware that some varieties of quince are purely
ornamental, or your cupboard will remain bare.
</P>
<P>
   Fall is by far the best time to plant quince. Any soil will suit
the tree, although if conditions becomes really dry in the summer,
the fruit will remain small. Work in some organic fertilizer or a
bushel or two of freshly raked shredded leaves and dress the
surface around the young tree with some well-aged compost. That's
about all the care you will ever have to give your quince.
</P>
<P>
   Even pruning, the bane of most fruit cultivators, is never
necessary for quince. The first couple of years you might want to
snip off a leading vertical shoot or two to keep the tree compact
and the picking easier.
</P>
<P>
   If you do prune, do so in late winter or early spring and
remember that the fruit of a quince is borne on the very tips of
the new-growth twigs. Once established, the quince tree will bear
without further care, for several decades.
</P>
<P>
   The harvest from a quince tree comes in October or November,
with the fruits often six inches long and weighing more than a
pound each. Squeezing the quince is no indication of its readiness,
but the development of a marvelous fragrance is. The longer you can
leave the fruit on the tree, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Even a leaf-curling frost will rarely affect this hardy fruit.
Fall winds, however, do knock quince down, and the branches laden
most heavily with fruit may snap off.
</P>
<P>
   Stored in a cool place, the unbruised fruit will last two or
more months. As a compote, quince lasts even longer, unless it gets
eaten up during midnight refrigerator raids.

   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas
Tech University's law school.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The deep, curved banquette at Union Pacific is the
most alluring table in the room: plush and cozy, dimly lighted. If
you are lucky enough to get it, you nestle into your own little
pod, protected, yet part of the passing scene, and feel smugly
content. You know you have snagged the best table.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one problem. Once you're in, there's no easy way
out. Escaping from the cushioned embrace of a banquette may be
dining's most awkward moment, requiring a wriggling contortion
that's about as graceful as exiting the center seat on a 747.
</P>
<P>
   It's a maneuver New Yorkers are coming to know all too well, as
restaurants around the city fill their rooms with more banquettes,
bigger banquettes, banquettes of all shapes and sizes. Partly it's
fashion: the curvy, round banquette is the style of the moment in
restaurant design. But it's economics, too: restaurateurs can fit
many more seats into a room when they use the sofalike banquettes
instead of chairs.
</P>
<P>
   At many new restaurants, banquettes outnumber freestanding
tables. They line the walls, lurk in corners, make sculptural
statements as centerpieces to their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Jacks Fifth, a new restaurant in Midtown, could be described as
one big banquette. There they border the room, with a cluster of
balloon-shaped ones anchoring the center. Atlas, on Central Park
South, is filled with small, firm banquettes. The oval corner ones
at Cello are like softly framed box seats with high, mist-green
mohair backs. At the new Sono, on East 57th Street, a circular
banquette two steps up overlooks the entire dining room.
</P>
<P>
   ``People kill to sit in those seats,'' said Gabriel Blanco, a
manager at Celadon, where oval banquettes stand in the entranceway
like a chorus greeting diners.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that initial attraction. Next to a grounded,
thronelike banquette, an unmoored table can seem like floating
driftwood. At a table, diners can hide nothing. Clothing hangs at
their sides in loose flaps. They have to sit up straight. There is
no hand-holding under the table. In a banquette, people slouch or
preen against a high, velvety backdrop. They cling together in
romantic huddles, or sit back and take in the view. Once in a
while, as I've spotted in the Oak Room, they even nap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that it's back to the womb,'' said Sylvia Weinstock,
the owner of Sylvia Weinstock Cakes and a regular in the large
circular banquettes at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strange twist for a way of seating that was designed to
encourage just the opposite feeling. The banquette emerged in
Europe in the heyday of cafe society. People went out to see and be
seen, to hear and be heard. At long narrow banquettes, tables were
close and so were conversations. Tables could be pulled together,
people could socialize with diners next door. Adam Tihany, the
designer of Jean Georges and Le Cirque 2000, said it best,
``They're borderless.''
</P>
<P>
   For New Yorkers, that intimacy seems to breed an unusual
openness.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Bain, an editor at In Style magazine, prefers banquettes
for this reason. Recently in the lipstick-red banquettes at
Heartbeat, in the W New York Hotel, she and her companion found
themselves chatting with diners on both sides of them. ``I've even
had strangers taste my food and vice versa, trading bites,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most restaurants have a different sort of togetherness in mind.
Banquettes, particularly the straight European ones lined up flush
against a wall, maximize seating. A normal table would have to
allow a valuable few inches behind the seat for getting in and out.
By using banquettes, Tihany said he can fit 15 to 20 percent more
tables in a room. Round or elliptical banquettes are less
efficient. But they are great space fillers for corners and have a
way of making the typically dark, inhospitable corner inviting.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants are favoring curvy circular and elliptical
banquettes, and in every part of the room. ``They're really big
pieces of furniture that really connect you to the idea of the
sofa,'' said David Rockwell, whose restaurant designs include
Heartbeat and Nobu. He pointed out that they anchor a room better
than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting in a banquette gives people a great vantage point to
look at the room, and visually, you're surrounding the dining room
with beautiful fabrics,'' he said, adding, ``It kind of gives the
psychological feel of sitting around the kitchen table.''
</P>
<P>
   A very large kitchen table. At the new Do Hwa in the West
Village, the brown leather backs of the banquettes rise seven feet
high. The corner banquette at Osteria del Circo can seat eight _
enough for a board meeting. Packed with people, it is fun, unless
you happen to be the unfortunate person in the middle. To let you
out, either the entire table must be moved or half your party must
get up.
</P>
<P>
   It's a spectacle that has aroused the pity of designers and
restaurateurs. Ashworth and Tihany have begun to make banquettes
with seat bottoms of leather and smooth materials. After 14 years
of sticky upholstery and comments from female diners, Danny Meyer
has given in to a slippery fabric on the banquette at Union Square
Cafe. But some problems will never be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``A banquette to me is more intimate than I usually need,'' said
Alan Roberts, a consultant to law firms. At a business meal, in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Murray, a floor broker at the New York Stock Exchange,
agrees. ``I don't like touching the person next to me,'' he said.
``Even if it's my wife who I've been married to for 34 years.'' &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's a simple dish; yet, minor variations in
ingredients and technique can provoke passionate arguments. Its
origins are most likely noble, yet its heights were reached after
years of peasant refinement. It's the epitome of home cooking, yet
can be the pride of a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   This paradoxical dish is ragu, a sauce atomically bound by meat
and tomatoes, and for Italians all over the world it's a food that
signals the warm, secure embrace of family and home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sauce is the center of everything, it's like a cultural
force,'' said Alessandra Farkas, a correspondent in New York for
Corriere Della Sera, Italy's leading newspaper. ``It's like chicken
soup for American Jews _ it holds generations together.''
</P>
<P>
   While ragu may be the glue of the Italian household, it's not
just home food. It's the rare restaurant in Italy that doesn't
serve its own ragu, especially now in the autumn, the beginning of
ragu season, after the last fresh tomatoes of summer have been put
up.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a staple at the hundreds of neighborhood Italian
restaurants in New York, although frequently it's a disappointment.
Some restaurants throw together a thin, tomatoey ragu as if it were
a contemptible obligation they'd rather not be associated with.
Other restaurants go to the opposite extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get a little too fancy, and they invent all these recipes
I never heard about,'' Ms. Farkas said. ``There is all this fusion
cuisine, and they abandon mothers' and grandmothers' cuisine.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, every now and then you stumble upon a restaurant that gives
the ragu the respect it deserves. These ragus have achieved the
unity of a great sauce, in which the individual flavors _ the
sweetness of onions and carrots, the richness of browned meat, the
intensity and complexity of wine and meat juices _ have melded into
a profound whole. It's a sauce like the mellow yet intense Apulian
rabbit ragu served at I Trulli on East 27th Street, or the classic
Tuscan duck ragu at Paola's on the Upper East Side, or the robust,
earthy wild game ragu at La Grolla on the Upper West Side, which
specializes in Valdostan dishes.
</P>
<P>
   While some Italians invest the sauce with a mystique bordering
on the magical, others take a more practical approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just meat over pasta,'' said Paola Marracino, who
generally has at least one ragu on the menu of her restaurant,
Paola's, on the Upper East Side. But her ragu di anatra, a rich,
luxurious brown sauce made principally of duck, tomato, vegetables
and red wine and served over pappardelle, is far more than ``meat
over pasta.''
</P>
<P>
   Some New York restaurants have ragu on the menu year-round, but
it's really a cool-weather food, making its appearance just about
the time that leaves start to turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't make it in the middle of summer,'' said Arthur
Schwartz, whose book ``Naples at Table'' (HarperCollins, 1998),
celebrates the cooking of Campania. ``You have fresh tomato sauce
in the middle of summer. You make ragu with canned or jarred
tomatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the few points of agreement concerning the highly
personal, emotionally charged issue of sauce. No matter what you
say about ragus, somebody, somewhere, will contradict you. Make a
general statement about ingredients, and somebody will argue. Point
out that ragus are generally the domain of women, and somebody will
trot out a grandfather who made the world's best sauce. But this
much is certain: You do not make fun of a person's ragu.
</P>
<P>
   A ragu stands not only for one's family and mother, but also for
neighborhood, town, region and identity. And as with most things
Italian, the great divide among ragus is north and south.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two classic ragus, and they are entirely different
and equally wonderful,'' said Fred Plotkin, an authority on Italian
foods. ``One is from Bologna, the other is from Naples.''
</P>
<P>
   A foundation of chopped or ground meat is integral to the
northern sauce, the famous ragu bolognese. ``Probably the biggest
misunderstanding is that it's a tomato sauce with meat,'' said
Lynne Rossetto Kasper, whose book ``The Italian Country Table'' was
recently published by Scribner. ``It's a meat sauce with cut-up
bits of tomato.''
</P>
<P>
   In the south, the meat is generally not cut up, but cooked whole
in the sauce _ pot-roasted, essentially _ and then removed. Pasta
with sauce is then served first, followed by a second course of the
meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neapolitans don't think of ragu as tomato sauce,'' Schwartz
said. ``They think of the tomatoes as extracting the flavor of the
meat.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the essential north-south distinction, the identity of a
ragu depends on what meats are used and how the liquid is built up.
It can also turn on subtler but equally crucial distinctions, like
which herbs are added or which bones are used for flavoring. There
may be more red wine in Tuscan sauces than in those of
Emilia-Romagna, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of pasta, too, is revealing. The tagliatelle that is
served with ragu in Bologna would never be used in Rome, where
fettuccine is the choice, or in Apulia, where orecchiette is
prized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every region will do it differently,'' Ms. Kasper said.
``Every town, every valley, every farmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz tells a story he heard of a man who bragged that he
could walk blindfolded through the streets of Naples and tell you
where he was by the smell of the ragu. In the great early
20th-century Italian emigration to the United States, and
especially to New York, these regional differences faded as people
from Calabria moved in next to people from Sicily or Naples and
sons married daughters and sauces mingled together. But then new
regional differences emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the Bronx tell you that people in Brooklyn don't
know how to make it, and people in Brooklyn tell you that people in
the Bronx don't know how to make it, and people in Queens say,
`Hey, you forgot about us!''' said David Ruggerio, the New York
chef, who sought the spirit of Italian-American cooking in his
``Little Italy Cookbook'' (Artisan, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Ruggerio grew up in Brooklyn, where pork neck bones are
considered essential to the sauce, or the Sunday gravy, as it is
known. ``In an Italian-American household, most people don't know a
ragu,'' he said. ``They call it a gravy or a sauce.'' He also
pointed out that the cliched term ``red sauce'' as applied to ragus
is just one of several common misconceptions.

<P>
   As the northern hemisphere gears up for the annual flu season,
another exotic strain of the disease has turned up in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Although health officials are anxious not to cause panic, the
Hong Kong strain is being monitored closely because it seems to
have jumped from pigs _ the animals thought to have been the origin
of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that killed an estimated 20
million people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   New strains of flu turn up each year. Most are variants of
existing viruses and so pose no special problems. But every few
decades, a radically different virus comes along, triggering a
pandemic that can kill millions across the globe. The last two were
in 1957 and 1968. These killer strains are thought to come from
either pigs or poultry.
</P>
<P>
   The latest alarm was sounded after a 10-month-old girl was
admitted to Hong Kong's Tuen Mun hospital in late September.
Although she was successfully treated, her virus bears all the
molecular hallmarks of a strain from pigs. The finding is worrying
because analyses of preserved tissue from victims of Spanish flu
suggest that it jumped from pigs to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're monitoring the case very carefully for that reason,''
says Alan Hay, director of the WHO influenza collaborating center
at the National Institute for Medical Research in London. Hay's
team, and virologists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, are now studying samples of the virus taken
from the Hong Kong patient. ``We don't know the ins and outs of
this yet,'' Hay says. ``It's at quite a preliminary stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous small outbreaks of swine influenza viruses in people
caused what Alan Kendal of Emory University in Atlanta calls
``false alarms.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, a Dutch man suffered severe pneumonia after contracting
a swine-type virus. And in 1977 a similar virus turned up in a
handful of people in Fort Dix, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of those viruses had the combination of virulence and
high transmissibility needed to trigger a pandemic. And it may well
be that the new Hong Kong virus presents no special danger. Kendal,
who headed the CDC's influenza program in the 1980s, says that
health officials find themselves in a dilemma each time a virus
crosses over from pigs. ``The question is: How do you not cry wolf
while avoiding closing the door after the horse has bolted?''
</P>
<P>
   But given the obviously devastating impact of a flu pandemic, no
one can afford to be complacent. A team at the CDC has predicted
that the next pandemic could kill up to 200,000 people in the
United States alone.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong was the scene of a major flu scare two years ago, when
a strain of flu from chickens struck 18 people, killing six of
them. Fortunately, the outbreak was contained and there was no
evidence of human-to-human spread. But in the wake of that scare,
Peter Patriarca, a senior official with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration who was responsible for drawing up an emergency
action plan for the United States in the event of a pandemic,
warned that too few resources were being devoted to the project.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, says Daniel Lavanchy, head of the World Health
Organization influenza program, only 10 nations have produced
pandemic action plans. ``The next pandemic could begin anywhere at
any time,'' says Martin Meltzer, a CDC official working on the U.S.
action plan. ``We need better surveillance now, and it's not
happening.'' &QL;

 NEW YORK: common misconceptions.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's not overly heavy in garlic, it's not a sauce you can make
with fresh tomato and it's got to be brown,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   True enough, generally, except that I Trulli's rabbit ragu is
bright red, made with fresh tomatoes and tender, earthy shreds of
long-stewed rabbit. It all comes in one bowl, which was decidedly
not the way it was served back home, near Italy's heel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the dish my mother traditionally made on Sunday,'' said
Nicola Marzovilla, the restaurant's owner. ``We would then serve
the rabbit as the second course.''
</P>
<P>
   The origins of ragu are murky and in dispute, naturally, but Ms.
Kasper has traced the ragus of Emilia-Romagna at least as far back
as the 16th century, to the wealthy courts of noble families. The
word ``ragu'' itself, she says, is clearly derived from the French
word ``ragout,'' for stews, possibly from the 18th century, when
all things French were fashionable among the affluent citizens of
Emilia-Romagna, in north-central Italy. Somewhere along the line,
the French stew became the Italian sauce, and the rich family's
meat-heavy banquet food became the peasant's method of extracting
every last bit of flavor from scarce meat scraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meat was like gold, especially in rural Italy, up until the
end of World War II,'' Ms. Kasper said. ``Many people ate meat only
at Christmas and Easter. Meat was celebration food.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort to produce maximum flavor from minuscule amounts of
meat is partly responsible for the well-savored reputation of ragu
as a long, long cooked sauce. Another, equally important factor is
that the meat of generations ago is much different from what's
available today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until 60 or 70 years ago, most Italians were living in
agricultural conditions,'' Ms. Kasper said. ``Today, we don't have
10-year-old cows. There's plenty of flavor there, but boy, it's not
tender.''
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the Italian family has also changed. In the days
of large, extended families, a giant pot of sauce required hours
and hours of simmering to cook all the way through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, Italy has a negative population growth,'' Schwartz
said. ``If you're cooking for four, it's a lot quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said that Italians today brag about how short they cook
their ragu. The only Michelin three-star restaurant in southern
Italy, Don Alfonso 1890 in Sant'Agata Sui Due Golfi, has ``two-hour
ragu'' on its menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have friends who make two-hour ragu, but they call it
semi-ragu,'' Schwartz said. ``Our informal cutoff point for real
ragu is 2 hours 15 minutes. Only after that does it start to become
ragu-colored.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all ragus depend on what Ms. Farkas, the Italian
newspaper correspondent, calls the ``trito,'' a trinity of
vegetables _ usually carrots, celery and onions _ that are chopped
up and sauteed. Carrots in particular provide an essential
sweetness, especially for the northern ragus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret is carrots and milk, because fundamentally it's a
sweet sauce, but there's no sugar,'' said Plotkin, the Italian food
authority. ``Carrots are much greater than you expect, and tomatoes
are much less.''
</P>
<P>
   While the bottom-line definition of ragu is a meat sauce, even
that is open to interpretation. At Scopa, on East 28th Street in
New York, chef Vincent Scotto makes a vegetarian ragu with onions
and leeks, a dish that may shock some sensibilities but makes sense
to Scotto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider a ragu something that's cooked slowly to intensify
the flavors,'' said Scotto, whose father's family comes from
southern Italy but who trained in Venice. ``By doing this with
onions you're taking the natural juices and concentrating them. It
might be a contradiction of the classic definition, but it's always
worked for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ragu recipes are highly personal, generally achieved through
either long experimentation or inheritance. Ms. Farkas learned her
ragu from her mother and is passing her recipe down to her two
children, though, she says, her 10-year-old daughter, Giorgia, has
already developed her own variation, adding mint leaves. Once a
recipe is perfected in the home, it tends to create standards
impossible for anyone else to meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Alto Aldige all the way to Sicily,'' Ms. Kasper said,
``it's a matter of style, personal taste and local tradition.''

   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas
Tech University's law school.

`MY BEST FIEND': WITH FRIENDS LIKE THESE ...  
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the actor Klaus Kinski wrote his autobiography, he referred
to Werner Herzog as ``the vermin,'' ``this blowhard'' and ``a
miserable, hateful, malevolent, avaricious, money-hungry, nasty,
sadistic, treacherous, cowardly creep.'' And those were some of the
nicer things he had to say. Now Herzog has a chance to return the
favor with ``My Best Fiend: Klaus Kinski,'' an account of their
unbelievably turbulent collaboration and how each man tormented and
goaded the other into doing his best work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every gray hair on my head I call Kinski,'' Herzog tells the
camera during this captivating documentary, a film that serves as
an eloquent coda to their unforgettable creative partnership. It
doesn't take long to see what he means about the hair. From the day
he and Kinski, who died in 1991 at the age of 65, met as boys in
the same boardinghouse, the wear and tear that accompanied the
fierce Kinski temperament was apparent. ``I never thought anyone
could rave for 48 hours,'' the filmmaker reflects, remembering an
incident in which the budding actor locked himself in a bathroom
and reduced it to smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   He also recalls when Kinski threw two hot potatoes and some
cutlery at a theater critic who had failed to praise him
sufficiently. In the context of the film's reminiscences, this does
not sound like an atypical event. ``Quite often it was very
difficult to talk to him, because he answered back as Jesus,''
Herzog remembers, and the film illustrates that. It begins with
glimpses of Kinski speaking to a lecture audience in his messianic
mode, and then screaming at a heckler who comes on stage.
</P>
<P>
   With Kinski as both muse and nemesis, Herzog was just the artist
to harness that fury. Their first film together, in 1972, was
``Aguirre: The Wrath of God,'' in which Kinski played his most
astonishing madman. Peering out wild-eyed beneath his explorer's
helmet, the actor played an ever more delusional explorer in the
midst of the Peruvian jungle, using his hugely expressive features
to make the character's deranged hubris unforgettable. For Herzog's
own forays into the heart of darkness, Kinski made the perfect
traveling companion. (Their four other films together were
``Woyzeck,'' ``Nosferatu,'' the great, haunting ``Fitzcarraldo''
and a last feature, shot in Africa, ``Cobra Verde.'')
</P>
<P>
   Herzog uses the documentary not only to summon amazing Kinski
stories but also to contemplate the actor's authentic (if erratic)
genius. In ``Aguirre,'' he says, ``somehow the beast had been
domesticated after all, so that his true madness, his true energy
was contained within the frame of a screen image.'' Anyone who has
seen that film will recognize the understatement in this.
Meanwhile, ``My Best Fiend'' switches gears easily among from
Herzog's nostalgic observations, film clips of the finished work
and documentary scenes that chronicle behind-the-scenes turmoil. In
Machu Picchu to shoot ``Aguirre,'' Kinski is seen ignoring the
director's suggestions and announcing: ``You have to beg me. Even
David Lean did that.'' (The actor turned up in ``Dr. Zhivago.'')
``And Brecht, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As the filmmaker describes the various death threats that
punctuated their off-screen relationship (``It went so far that at
one time I seriously planned to firebomb him in his house''), a
whiff of showmanship is also seen here. If Kinski enjoyed throwing
fits, he seemed to enjoy it most while a camera was running;
Herzog, for his part, seems to enjoy remembering a false rumor that
he once directed Kinski while armed with a rifle, and describing
his threat to shoot Kinski with eight bullets and use the ninth on
himself. (``Whoever heard of a pistol or rifle with nine bullets?''
the actor sneered in his memoir.) While ``My Best Fiend,'' which
opens today at the Film Forum, does a splendid job of chronicling
the high drama and creative pinnacles of their work together, it
emphasizes the most public and bleakly amusing aspects of their
story. Herzog's deeper, more complete memories remain his own.

LET THE RECORD SHOW, PAYTON CAME TO PLAY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It seems almost irresponsible to salute Walter
Payton's greatest football trait right now.
</P>
<P>
   He missed just one football game in 13 years as an NFL player _
one game, and he never quite forgave his coaches for keeping him
out.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to run out of bounds to avoid contact. He welcomed
it, savored it.
</P>
<P>
   Can we call him the quintessential football player without
insulting the players whose knees blow out, without implying that
Jamal Anderson, Terrell Davis and Garrison Hearst somehow brought
devastating injuries onto themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Can we laud Payton's toughness without goading Steve Young to
risk his future, without endorsing Deion Sanders' reckless return
to the football field after a concussion two weekends ago? All we
know is that the statistic is a marvel, more spectacular even than
Payton's 16,726 career rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   One NFL game missed in 13 years. None of today's running backs
can match that. It's not fair to expect it. The game becomes more
brutal by the week.
</P>
<P>
   But Payton played in the raw Chicago winters, on the old
artificial turf at Soldier Field. He didn't have it easy.
</P>
<P>
   His economical running style helped him stay healthy, creating
no extra motion that would render a limb or joint vulnerable. So
did his conditioning and his stubborn insistence that all momentum
work for, not against, him. When he went down, the tackler always
looked like the person being hit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one game missed in 13 years? There had to be some luck in
that.
</P>
<P>
   That luck, and the invincibility that it yielded, abandoned
Payton on Monday. He died at home at age 45, done in by a faulty
liver assigned to an otherwise extraordinary body. It was almost as
strange as the way a withering disease consumed Lou Gehrig, the
Iron Horse.
</P>
<P>
   Payton never had a nickname that captured his toughness. He went
by ``Sweetness,'' as if he were all pretty moves and luscious
sprints. But glamour was a small part of his game.
</P>
<P>
   He blocked ferociously, passionately. He could punt, and he
could place-kick. He was the Bears' backup kicker for most of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   He threw eight touchdown passes in his career, three of them in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   And did we mention that he missed one game in 13 years?
</P>
<P>
   That one game was in his rookie season. He had a sore ankle that
kept him out of practice the week before. On Sunday, he said he
could play. His coaches said no, and he concluded that they wanted
to punish him for skipping practice. That one missed game, that
blot on his attendance record, gnawed at him for years.
</P>
<P>
   Like any athlete, he had an ego. But he also had a remarkable
ability to express himself with humility and kindness, with the
sweetness that became his name.
</P>
<P>
   When he addressed the public, he acknowledged that there were
people who wouldn't care for him, would feel offended by something
he had said or done. The modern athlete would be defiant, possibly
profane. Payton asked his detractors to think of him kindly, and he
promised to include them in his prayers, along with all of the
fans.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled this off without a hint of guile. He was reared before
the age of spin. He debuted before ESPN did. He went to a small
school, Jackson State, that didn't produce the telephone-book-sized
media guides that come out of Notre Dame and Texas. He wasn't
groomed for success. He just knew how to behave in public. He just
did it, long before Nike commercialized the concept.
</P>
<P>
   As a football player, he never broke down. As a father, as a
dying man, he did. He cried on a podium, and he admitted that he
was scared. He said that anyone in his situation would be scared.
</P>
<P>
   Payton loved his privacy. He tried to dodge celebrity as if it
were a linebacker. But when he did take a stage, Payton came across
as too genuine to be an icon. That's what happened when he admitted
his fears. Terminally ill patients everywhere must have been
relieved to hear him, one of the greatest football players of all
time, saying that he was scared.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the media's saccharine pieties otherwise, extolling his
stoicism and trivializing the emotional ordeal of a
life-threatening disease.
</P>
<P>
   There was dignity behind his tears, in his wasted body, a grace
that football couldn't possibly reveal, a full measure of
Sweetness.

   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ The Millennium is approaching. Are you
ready?
</P>
<P>
   We don't mean by loading up on supplies of water, batteries and
food _ we're talking about your bubbly stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to panic, of course. There will be plenty of
good bubbly to go around on NYE '99.
</P>
<P>
   Notice we said ``good.'' That's because if you want to bring in
the Millennium with a truly memorable sparkling wine, act now. Some
of the best sparkling wines are already disappearing from store
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   We sampled high-end (and potentially hard-to-find) champagnes
and sparkling wines in order to find the best for your Millennium
Bash.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the wines in the tasting are vintage champagnes from
1985, 1990 and 1992, while the remaining bottles are well-known,
non-vintage sparklers.
</P>
<P>
   Most sparkling wine is made by blending together juice from a
number of years (hence the designation non-vintage or NV on the
label), but vintage champagne is bottled only in superior years and
with wine from the year displayed on the label.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage wines are considered the cream of the champagne crop and
the ones we uncorked lived up to their reputation for opulence and
complexity.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the wines in the tasting carry a fairly hefty
price tag, but that's what this story is about - stocking up on the
best before the best is gone.
</P>

   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black

   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3

TIFFANY DESIGN DIRECTOR UNCOVERS JEWELS FROM HIS CAREER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARILYN McMAHON   
 Santa Barbara (Calif.) News-Press   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There have been many exciting moments in John Loring's career as
design director for Tiffany &AMP; Co. in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But none surpasses the $15 million dollar brooch he created in
the 1980s. In a setting of more than 130 carats of fine white
diamonds was a 105-carat canary yellow diamond. Perched on it was a
pear-shaped 32-carat D-flawless diamond.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was finished, I put the brooch in my pocket and walked
across the street to the Plaza Hotel, where Ivana Trump had her
office,'' said Loring. ``Before I took it out of my pocket, I told
her to close her eyes. Then, I put it on her desk and told her to
open them. I have never heard such a yelp of delight.
Unfortunately, she didn't buy it because the timing was off. I
found out later she and Donald Trump were having marital
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Loring, who has been with Tiffany &AMP; Co. more than 20 years, is
the author of ``Tiffany Jewels'' (Harry N. Abrams Inc., November
1999, $60). It is the ninth book he has written about the company
but the first one that describes in detail the firm's history.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany's began as a ``stationery and fancy goods'' store
founded in 1837 by Charles Lewis Tiffany and has become revered as
one of the world's premier jewelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was important to do this because in a larger sense,
the book is a chronicle of the evolution of American society,
wealth and style over the course of eight generations,'' he said
during a phone interview from his office in Manhattan. ``The
history of America and the history of Tiffany's go hand in hand. As
America grew and fortunes developed, jewels became larger and more
elaborate.''
</P>
<P>
   A major factor in its success, Loring said, is that the
company's founder, Charles Lewis Tiffany, was fearless about
purchasing lavish jewels from deposed royalty in Europe.
Revolutions in Europe allowed women in the American democracy to
possess their own crown jewels, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1887, Tiffany purchased more than one third of the crown
jewels of France, which he resold to American clients like Mrs.
Joseph Pulitzer and Mrs. Leland Stanford,'' he said. ``Kate
Pulitzer dripped in rivers of formerly imperial diamonds, and Jane
Stanford boasted a four-strand necklace made up of French royal
pearls.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany's reputation took off and soared during the 19th
century's many world's fairs at which the firm received numerous
gold medals for its designs, Loring said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much to the distress of European designers, Tiffany was
winning all the awards for its imaginative designs. Everyone found
them refreshing compared to the same old stodgy designs of the
Europeans,'' he said. ``Tiffany's enameled and jeweled orchid and
floral brooches, for example, helped establish the course of
jewelry design in Europe and America, and the company's pioneering,
lavish use of colored gemstones brought fine jewelry to a broader
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Loring stressed that Tiffany's customer base continues to be
broad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our doors are wide open. You don't have to be wealthy to walk
through them. We work hard to attract young people who may not have
much money. On Saturdays, the store is filled with young couples
looking at engagement rings. Charles Tiffany wanted the store to be
a great American emporium,'' Loring said. ``Our prices range from a
few dollars to billions.''
</P>
<P>
   The most popular purchase is the solitaire diamond ring in the
Tiffany setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a worldwide icon,'' Loring said of the six-prong setting.
``The price can range from $1,000 to thousands, depending on the
size and quality of the diamond.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamond stud earrings, strands of pearls, Elsa Peretti hearts
and Paloma Picasso gold jewelry in the shape of an X are also
popular.
</P>
<P>
   What about the signature robin's egg blue boxes in which all
Tiffany purchases are placed?
</P>
<P>
   ``The color dates back to the 1840s and 1850s when Empress
Eugenie was the fashion leader of France,'' Loring said. ``The blue
was her favorite color because it was the favorite color of Marie
Antoinette, whom she revered. When Tiffany's opened its store in
Paris, it was the most fashionable color of the time. Now, it's
known as Tiffany blue. Gifts are always tied with white ribbon,
except at Christmas when red ribbon is used.''
</P>
<P>
   Loring is not one to reveal little-known facts about celebrity
clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Although he mentioned that one person had Tiffany's design a
sapphire collar for his pet ferret, Loring said, ``I have amnesia
about customers, whether they're famous or not.''

GOO GOO DOLLS SURPRISED BY THEIR SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By BILL DeYOUNG   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Goo Goo Dolls were overnight sensations. Some 11 years after
they released their first record, they scored a big hit _ and
suddenly, pretty much overnight, people began to talk about how
sensational they were.
</P>
<P>
   The band consists of singer and songwriters John Rzeznik and
Robby Takac, who play guitar and bass, respectively, and drummer
Mike Malinin. Rzeznik and Takac, schoolboy buds from Buffalo, N.Y.,
have gone the distance together, while Malinin replaced the
original Goo Goo drummer in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Because the band members have always believed in their music,
Takac says in a telephone interview, the long road to hitsville _
via radio-friendly singles ``Iris'' and ``Slide'' _ didn't feel
quite so long. ``It's been marked with mini-victories along the
way,'' Takac says, ``as insignificant as a free guitar from someone
or as huge as getting a song on Top 40 radio. When the chips seemed
down, things would happen for us to where we felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   The band's early records grazed radio playlists and hovered in
the nether regions of the charts _ enough, Takac says, to keep them
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we were ever remotely considering being
successful commercially,'' he says. ``For us, it was just sort of a
thing we did and managed to make a meager living out of. The whole
acceptance at mainstream radio was kind of a surprise to us at the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   When the hits started coming, the band members had a meeting to
discuss changing their goofy moniker. ``We don't like the name,''
Takac says, ``but I think it definitely is memorable _ and that may
have helped us, actually.'' (For the record, the original Goo Goo
Doll was a mail-order toy the musicians discovered in a magazine
ad, way back when.)
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, the band had gone around as Sex Maggot. ``That was
right up until we needed to print something in the paper, and they
wouldn't,'' Takac says. ``At that time, they were still a little
sticky about stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Goo Goo Dolls' self-titled 1987 debut featured
Takac on lead vocals, it's Rzeznik, of the scratchy, wounded voice,
who has been writing and singing the hit songs. With his scraggly
blonde good looks, he's the MTV poster Goo, too.
</P>
<P>
   Takac is OK with that. ``It's the success of the group,'' he
says. ``John has an incredible knack these days for finding
melodies and statements that really work for people. I don't think
it's a conscious decision to do that on his part, it's just that
those are the songs he's writing right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been friends for an awful long time, and we're very
different people from each other. We have needs that are sort of
exclusive, and I think we sort what each other needs to get out of
this whole thing, for it to be something we still feel strongly
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, when I started singing for this group, it was
because we hadn't found anyone yet. We were still looking for
someone after our first record. I think we just let things
naturally fall into place.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough single, ``Iris,'' first appeared on the
soundtrack to the 1998 film ``City of Angels.'' It was hastily
added to the band's ``Dizzy Up the Girl'' album, which they were
finishing up at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dizzy Up the Girl'' was recently certified double platinum,
for sales of 2 million units.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know it was going to be the one,'' Takac says, ``so
when it started to happen we weren't blown out of our socks or
anything like that, because we had sort of been through the process
already and we knew what was waiting for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Goo Goo Dolls are now on a tour that includes information
and demonstration booths to educate audiences about MP3, the
Internet system of condensing high-quality audio files.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems to be where the world is going to get their
music,'' Takac says. ``Everything else comes from a computer now.
That just seems to be how it's going to happen. It's kind of
exciting for us to see it from this primary stage. It's got the
record company shaking in their boots, and that's pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The band is also a supporter of the charity group USA Harvest,
and fans are asked to bring nonperishable food items to concerts.
``We've raised something like 600,000 meals since this summer,''
Takac says, with pride.

`TRAIN OF LIFE': MASTERS OF THEIR FATE: A HOLOCAUST FANTASY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fact that for many people a Holocaust comedy is oxymoronic
hasn't prevented filmmakers from Ernst Lubitsch to Mel Brooks to
Roberto Begnini from finding antic humor in the ultimate
20th-century horror. Whether that humor strikes us as funny or
appalling depends on our personal responses to the unthinkable.
That's why some who watch ``Train of Life,'' Radu Mahaileanu's
fable about a Jewish village somewhere in Central Europe that beats
the Nazis by building its own deportation train and riding it to
freedom, may have the queasy feeling of seeing history trivialized.
Others will find a redemptive warmth in its fantasy of
self-deliverance accomplished through the ultimate
pseudo-assimilation of Jews posing as Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Train of Life'' has already struck a popular chord, having won
the 1999 Sundance Film Festival audience award and several other
international honors. For this rollicking movie has the bustling
energy and narrative momentum of a 1940s ``Fiddler on the Roof.''
With its giddy klezmer lilt and a final image borrowed from the
Broadway revival of ``Cabaret,'' it also seems ready-made for
adaptation into a stage show. All that's missing in the movie with
its proudly shticky screenplay and scenes neatly arrayed like
musical-comedy set pieces are the actual songs, and it is easy to
see where they would fit.
</P>
<P>
   With its tale of the village fool who returns from over the
mountains to his shtetl bearing the alarming news of the Nazi final
solution, ``Train of Life'' belongs to a time-honored Jewish
storytelling tradition in which an idiot with special intuitive
powers proves invaluable to the community. When Schlomo the Dreamer
(Lionel Abelanski) delivers his terrible news, he is immediately
taken seriously by the village elders. Led by the rabbi (Clement
Harari), the community constructs its own deportation train to take
the entire village to Palestine by way of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The purchasing of the train cars, the refurbishment of a
battered old locomotive and the sewing of bogus Nazi uniforms
present no major problems. Where the villagers run into trouble is
in the assignment and acting out of roles. Those who have the best
German accents are drafted to impersonate the fake Nazis piloting
the train. Because Mordechai the Woodworker (Rufus) speaks the best
German, he is chosen to be the commandant who must improvise
convincing explanations to the real Nazis encountered on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   A worrywart suffering from ulcers, Mordechai takes to his role
with a surprising relish. Before long he is behaving like a Nazi
caricature, barking orders and making himself generally obnoxious.
But in leaving their shtetl, the villagers take along their
internal problems. As the train speeds toward the Russian border,
Yossi (Michael Muller), a homely mama's boy desperate for respect,
foments a Communist rebellion among the passengers. His revolution
is partly a sulky reaction to his rejection by the lusty Esther
(Agathe de la Fontaine), the most beautiful girl in the village,
who frets that she may die a virgin and spends the journey shopping
for a lover.
</P>
<P>
   The train finds itself threatened by friends as well as foes.
More than once, it is nearly blown up by a group of Resistance
fighters who, even after watching the passengers (including the
fake Nazis) celebrate the Sabbath in an open field, fail to realize
that these people are allies.
</P>
<P>
   What saves ``Train of Life'' from sinking into sudsy Holocaust
kitsch is its sustained comic buoyancy. The movie doesn't pretend
for an instant to be anything more than a rustic comic fairy tale.
As the director (an exile from Ceausescu's Romania), acknowledges
in the production notes, even the most ingeniously constructed
ghost train could never have eluded Nazi detection.

WHY DOES THIS MAN MUMIA MATTER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday, November 9)

 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   In the film adaptation of the novel, ``The Oxbow Incident,''
Henry Fonda's character tries to stop a lynching and is told it's
not his business. He replies, ``Hanging's any man's business that's
around.''
</P>
<P>
   The case involving Mumia Abu Jamal isn't about a lynching. There
was due process in 1982 when Jamal, an African-American, was
convicted of killing a white Philadelphia police officer. But some
say there was not enough due process.
</P>
<P>
   Why does the life or death of a convicted cop killer in
Philadelphia matter to so many people outside of Philadelphia? In
California, for example, why do people go to lectures about Jamal
in Sebastopol, rally in Vallejo and parade through San Francisco to
demand a new trial? Why do people in Europe march on behalf of the
dread-locked man in the dark glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Is it the man or the times?
</P>
<P>
   Jamal is on death row in Pennsylvania, a scheduled Dec. 2
execution date has been stayed by a federal judge. His supporters
want a retrial, claiming a number of legal points, that the first
judge was biased, Jamal's lawyer inadequate and new witnesses saw
another man running from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   In the protesters' camp are those who proclaim his innocence and
those who haven't made up their minds as to guilty or innocent but
want a retrial in order to see all the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The other side believes he's guilty and want his sentence
carried out. They see his defenders as misguided or catering to a
killer. Both sides demand that justice be done. Neither side does
it in a small way.
</P>
<P>
   To one side he is a cop killer and to others a political
prisoner. To some he is on a par with Charlie Manson and to others,
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   To those in the middle his name and the case is something they
can vaguely identify, but what's it got to do with them?
</P>
<P>
   Before his arrest Jamal was a black activist and controversial
journalist writing about racism, poverty and police misconduct. He
rubbed a lot of people the wrong way and he's continued to, even in
prison, where he's gone on to write books and give interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerned about the fairness of his trial include authors
Maya Angelou, Alice Walker and Salman Rushdie. The European
Parliament appealed for a new trial. Amnesty International has
called for rescinding his death warrant. When Barbara Kingsolver
was writing ``The Poisonwood Bible,'' set in Africa and the
American South, she sent a draft to Jamal seeking his perspective
as an African-American.
</P>
<P>
   The other side accuses Jamal of profiteering on a murder. They
want him dead or silenced. The Fraternal Order of Police believes
he did it. The officer's widow, Maureen Faulkner, who has appeared
at pro-Jamal events holding up a photograph of her dead husband,
believes he did it. So did a jury 17 years ago, which found him
guilty of first-degree murder and gave him the death penalty. But
Jamal has become a symbol for a number of hot-button issues, and if
you are somewhere in between passionately for Jamal or passionately
against him you might lean to one side or the other based on how
you believe things are going in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Are the police your friend or your enemy? When they drive down
your street are you relieved or frightened? Do you worry about
police brutality? How do you feel about the death penalty in
general?
</P>
<P>
   Do you believe there is racial injustice? Perhaps if you are
someone who, as they say, ``drives black'' and worries about being
singled out in traffic stops you feel differently than the person
who ``drives white.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you fully trust your information source, maybe you believe
that the legal system is infallible.
</P>
<P>
   Some think Jamal is only Philadelphia's business, as if we don't
get to worry about what happens anywhere out of our zip code.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Corrie Robb, a 23-year-old college senior from Walnut Creek
why he cares and he says, ``The issues are universal. It doesn't
matter if you live in Sonoma County or Philadelphia or Europe.''
Robb's a researcher with Project Censored, the media watch program
at Sonoma State University that writes about the Jamal coverage in
this year's report. Next year's Project Censored book will have an
introduction written by Jamal.
</P>
<P>
   Robb personally believes Jamal's innocent, but he says the
controversy over his case is bigger than the man because it brings
necessary questions about injustices to the forefront of societal
discourse. ``He's a poster case for how our system can go wrong.''

 By LISA BELKIN  
 From The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On a warm Tuesday night in September, 120 people, nearly all
African-American, fill the echoing auditorium at the Masonic Temple
in Brooklyn. ''No Weapons Allowed, Persons Subject to Scanning''
warns a faded sign at the door, and the words have particular
resonance here tonight.
 &HT;    The special guests for this evening are Michael and Vonda
Shoels, the parents of 18-year-old Isaiah, one of the 12 students
slaughtered at Columbine High School six months ago by Eric Harris
and Dylan Klebold.
 &HT;    Surrounded by their new crop of advisers, the Shoelses walk past
that sign and onto the stage. Michael, wearing a Western hat and
boots with his dark suit, waves heartily to the cheering crowd.
 &HT;    Vonda, in a simple pantsuit, stares at the floor. She looks tiny
next to her solid husband, and very sad.
 &HT;    The Shoelses, whose son was the only black victim of the attack,
have come to this city and to this meeting at the invitation of the
Rev. Al Sharpton, who further warms the simmering room with a lusty
chant of ``No Justice, No Peace.''
 &HT;    Before April 20, before Columbine, Michael Shoels was a
small-business owner who had never given a full-blown
rafters-shaking speech. In his new life as his son's avenger he
hungrily seeks the spotlight, and has traveled to Georgia, Ohio,
Michigan, Texas, Alabama and now New York.
 &HT;    ''They ask us if we blame the parents?'' he thunders. ''Who else
do we blame? I taught my son right from wrong. My son wasn't
shooting people up. My son was in the library doing what he was
supposed to do.''
 &HT;    That question _ who else do we blame? _ is one that hovers over
what is now a roll call of high-school tragedy, lingering long
after the blood is washed away and the classes resume. Are parents
responsible _ are they liable _ when children kill?
 &HT;    It was a question first asked in Pearl, Miss., after 16-year-old
Luke Woodham stabbed his mother to death in Oct. 1997, then shot
nine fellow students, two of them fatally. Now the mother of one of
the victims is suing Woodham's father.
 &HT;    They're suing in West Paducah, Ky., too, where parents of the
three girls shot by 14-year-old Michael Carneal at a morning prayer
meeting have brought action against his parents.
 &HT;    In Jonesboro, Ark., where 11-year-old Andrew Golden and
13-year-old Mitchell Johnson staged a false fire alarm and then
opened fire on the exiting crowd in 1998, their parents are being
sued by the families of those who were killed.
 &HT;    All the parents named in these suits have responded with court
papers of their own, denying the allegations.
 &HT;    And then there is Columbine, the massacre that, because it
played out on television, seems to have crystallized all the
others. Five weeks after the killings, the Shoelses brought a suit
against Wayne and Katherine Harris and Thomas and Susan Klebold,
asking for $250 million and saying that the parents should have
prevented the rampage by their children.
 &HT;    The Shoelses' suit was filed by Geoffrey Fieger, the Michigan
attorney and a man who, far more than Shoels, has come to love the
public eye. He is best known for representing Dr. Jack Kevorkian,
and last May he won a $25 million verdict against the Jenny Jones
talk show in a suit that charged that one guest was essentially
provoked to murder another.
 &HT;    Currently he is defending a 13-year-old Michigan boy accused of
committing first-degree murder when he was 11, who is being tried
as an adult. He ran a noisy campaign for governor in 1998, and he
likes his reputation as a troublemaker.
 &HT;    Fieger does not just take on cases; he takes on causes, and he
expects this one to create more of a societal earthquake than
anything he has touched so far.
 &HT;    ``It's an exploration,'' he says, ``of what's going wrong with
our kids ... What's going on here? Those parents know what
happened. And the fact of filing a lawsuit gives me subpoena power
to ask the questions we need to ask.''
 &HT;    In the months since Columbine, he points out, neither the
Harrises nor the Klebolds have said a word in public. But the
silence that so grates on Fieger is, of course, due in part to the
lawsuit he has filed.
 &HT;    ''Defendants never, never, never speak publicly in a case like
this,'' said Frank Patterson, one of the Klebolds' attorneys,
turning down my repeated requests for an interview with his
clients. (The Harrises, through their attorney, declined as well.)
 &HT;    A rare break in the parents' silence came earlier this month
when the Klebolds filed court papers saying they were considering a
lawsuit against the county, charging that the sheriff's office had
been ``reckless, willful and wanton'' in not informing them that
their son's friend Eric Harris had threatened to kill another
student back in 1998.
 &HT;    The court papers are not a lawsuit, but rather an ``intent to
sue,'' which, according to Colorado law, must be filed within 180
days of the shootings. But they are a first hint of what the
Klebolds did or didn't know about their son. Until this filing and
the accompanying statements released through lawyers, the only
words from either family had been in the private, handwritten
letters received by the families of the victims.
 &HT;    The notes did not impress the Shoels. When we spoke days after
the raucous Brooklyn rally, Michael told me he had not even
bothered to read them.
 &HT;    ''Those parents taught those children hate, and no letter is
going to change that,'' he said. ''They raised children who hate. I
lost a son behind that hate. My children lost a brother behind that
hate.''
 &HT;    If Fieger sees this lawsuit as an exploration, the Shoels see it
as a promise kept _ a promise they did not know they were making at
the time.
 &HT;    ''All we're doing,'' Michael bellows into his microphone, ''is
what our son asked us to do. Seventy-two hours before my son was
slain down like he was some kind of animal,'' he says, Isaiah was
riding in the family van with Michael, Vonda and their four other
children.
 &HT;    ''Out of nowhere Isaiah asked us: 'What would you do if someone
gunned down all your children? Would you go get guns?' I said, 'Is
there a reason you ask that?' He said, 'Dad, I was just asking a
hypothetical.' He got real testy. I said: 'Son, no, we won't get
guns, because we're not vengeful people. If anybody or anything
will take one of my children down I will try to beat it down, I
will try to strike it down, I'll speak against it the rest of my
life.'''
 &HT;    Three days later, Isaiah's question took on the aura of
prophecy, leaving his parents to wonder what their son knew but
would not share.
 &HT;    According to an eyewitness, one gunman said, ``Look, there's
that little nigger,'' before killing the popular athlete with what
the autopsy report would show to be a single shotgun blast to the
chest.
 &HT;    ``Nigger,'' says Michael, all but spitting out the word. `` ...
Should that be the last thing you have to hear before the last
breath leaves your body?''
 &HT;    Because of that word and all it represents, the Shoelses say,
Isaiah's murder was more egregious, more shattering, more evil,
than the murders of the others at Columbine.
 &HT;    As one of a handful of African-American families in Littleton
(Isaiah and two of his siblings were 3 of the 16 blacks in a
student body of 1,965), the family had been the targets of
vandalism long before April 20. Stones had been thrown at their
windows and a rock had shattered the windshield of their van.
 &HT;    Few communities raked by tragedy remain unified in the
aftermath, and the fault lines are becoming evident in Littleton.
There were 5,000 people at Isaiah's funeral six months ago, but
with the announcement of the lawsuit shortly afterward the families
of other Columbine victims began to bristle.
 &HT;    Donna Taylor is the mother of 16-year-old Mark Taylor, who still
has shards of metal in his body and a bullet lodged between his
heart and his spine. The Taylors had financial problems before Mark
was shot, and now Donna has given up her job to battle full time
with insurance companies and care for her son.
 &HT;    The victims' families _ formerly strangers, now largely friends
_ meet as a group as often as three times a week. They are united
in a plan to lobby the school board to destroy the library by
tearing out the floor and creating an atrium in the commons area,
metaphorically opening the entrance up to the sky. The Shoelses do
not come to those meetings or any of the more informal minglings of
the group.
 &HT;    ``They don't live in the area anymore,'' says Tom Mauser, father
of Daniel, who died near Isaiah in the library.
 &HT;    After Shoels finishes his talk, Sharpton takes the microphone.
Placing a large wicker basket at the Shoels's feet, he announces:
``We're gonna help stabilize this family. Write a check directly to
the Shoels family.''
 &HT;    After several dozen people give $50, Sharpton drops a personal
check for $1,000 in the basket then opens the floor to all
denominations.
 &HT;    ``Today was hard, I thought of Isaiah a lot,'' Vonda tells me,
standing by the basket at the edge of the stage. ''Traveling is
hard,'' she says. ''But so is staying home.''
 LEGAL ASPECTS  
 &HT;    It's lunchtime in Southfield, Mich., and Fieger has come to his
favorite jewelry store to choose a birthday present for his wife,
Keenie.
 &HT;    The store owner gushes over a diamond-and-emerald necklace
(``Forty thousand. For you, 26.''), but Fieger decides upon a
$5,200 pair of earrings. He'll take it on credit, as usual, he
says, until Keenie decides if she will keep them. Then he settles
his outstanding bill, for $6,661, from another recent purchase. He
hands his Platinum Visa to the jeweler, who comes back a few
minutes later with news that the card was rejected.
 &HT;    Fieger pays by check and drives to his next stop, the Department
of Motor Vehicles. It's time to renew his driver's license. It
seems his expired _ seven months ago.
 &HT;    Fieger has an interesting relationship with limits and rules. He
doesn't like them. His is a gamesman's approach to the law, and he
takes cases that, by the letter of the law, can't be won. Kevorkian
was acquitted three times of a crime to which he had confessed.
This is because Fieger doesn't talk to juries only about what the
law is, but also about what the law should be.
 &HT;    He plans to do that with the Columbine case too. There are
statutes in Colorado (as there are in nearly half the states) that
specifically hold parents responsible for damage done by their
children. But these laws are more usually applied to things like
vandalism or theft, and the judgment cap is only $3,500, so Fieger
finds the statutes laughable. He is bringing a suit for negligence
and wrongful death under tort law, where the judgment cap, thanks
to recent tort reform, is $250,000.
 &HT;    He doesn't intend to accept that cap either. When he filed
notice of the Shoels suit he included a damage demand of $250
million, a figure meant to challenge the law.
 &HT;    Proving negligence, says Naomi Cahn, a professor of family law
at George Washington University, means proving that the parents
''knew or should have known what the child was going to do,'' she
says.
 &HT;    ``In order to hold the parent liable you have to show a close
connection between what the parent has done or failed to do, and
what the child has done.'' And, Cahn notes, ''there is an enormous
amount of discretion around words like 'close' and 'should.' How
much are parents required to know about their children?''
 &HT;    There is a paradox implicit in the ''assumption of an ideal that
parents can control their children,'' says Susan Frelich Appleton,
an associate dean and professor of law at the Washington University
School of Law in St. Louis. Had Harris and Klebold survived, she
says, there would most assuredly be a demand that they be tried as
adults. ''And at the same time we're saying it's the parents'
fault.''
 &HT;    All this splitting of legal hairs is hardly comforting to the
parent of a child shot by a rampaging student. It isn't terribly
comforting to the rest of us either. If parents can't control their
children, then who can? And if the parents are not to blame, then
who is?
 &HT;    We all wonder how parents can miss a gun in the bedroom or a
bomb-making setup in the garage. But living with a teen-ager is
living with an intimate stranger, and parents are left to puzzle
through when to step in and when to let go. It is an equation
complicated by the fact that parents can be blinded by love for
their child.
 &HT;    It may not be, as these lawsuits indirectly claim, that parents
have gotten worse. It may be that parenting has gotten harder. The
world has changed so much around us that what our parents did is no
longer enough.
 &HT;    But will a lawsuit create better parents? Few of us have ever
faced so cataclysmic a tragedy as these families have, so we can't
really know what we would do to avenge that loss. But there are
other ways.
 &HT;    Misty and Brad Bernall's daughter Cassie, killed at Columbine,
was a troubled teen-ager herself before turning her life around.
They have chosen to forgive.
 &HT;    Brad Bernall says he has no wish to meet with either the
Harrises or the Klebolds, but if that were to happen, ''I would
want to first give them a hug and tell them I'm sorry they lost
their child.''
 &HT;    Tom Mauser, on the other hand, has chosen to fight the weapon of
his son Daniel's destruction. He has picketed at the NRA convention
in Denver and at the local offices of his U.S. senators, carrying a
placard of his child's gentle face. ''My son Daniel died at
Columbine,'' it says.
 &HT;    When the cause seems hopeless he remembers Dunblane, Scotland,
where in 1996 16 kindergarten students and their teacher were
killed in the primary-school gym by a 43-year-old local resident.
The families hired a lawyer, and yet not a single lawsuit was
filed. Instead the families joined together and lobbied for gun
control. As a result handguns are now banned throughout the United
Kingdom.
 &HT;    In September, the Shoels family was asked to speak at the
Greater Grace Church in Taylor, Mich. Taylor, the young man who
still carries a bullet near his heart, and his mother, Donna, were
invited, too.
 &HT;    The Taylors, who had sharply criticized the Shoelses' suit when
it was filed, fearing it would cause much-needed donations to dry
out, spent time during the trip talking with Michael and Vonda.
 &HT;    ''They're just trying to get justice for their son,'' Donna
says. ''It made me think.''
 &HT;    Her HMO has so far failed to reimburse her for an $1,800 special
mattress for Mark, one suggested by his doctor to relieve the
pressure of the shrapnel under his skin. She knows she once vowed
never to sue, but two weeks ago, using her local lawyer, she
protected her options under the law and met the deadline for filing
an ''intent to sue'' the school district and the sheriff. Sixteen
other families of the dead and injured filed similar notices.
 &HT;    And one week ago she signed on with Fieger to sue the Klebolds
and the Harrises.

 By JAMES TRAUB  
 From The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Herman Badillo, former New York City commissioner of housing
relocation, Bronx borough president and congressman, current
chairman of the City University of New York and perennial candidate
for mayor, is one of those rare figures in public life with a
genuine penchant for the harsh truth. For example, while it is
almost obligatory for minority politicians to support the ``open
admissions'' policy that has permitted tens of thousands of black
and Hispanic students to attend a CUNY college, Badillo, who was
born in Puerto Rico, has spent years criticizing the institution as
a swamp of mediocrity.
 &HT;    Along with his political patron, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, he
subjected both a former CUNY chancellor, Ann Reynolds, and a former
school chancellor, Ramon Cortines, to such a merciless and public
battering that they left town. But nothing Badillo has said has
aroused quite so much fury as some casual remarks he made after a
speech to a school-reform group last month.
 &HT;    ``The biggest problem we have is that we are getting hundreds of
students 12, 13, 14 years old from the hills of Mexico and the
Dominican Republic who have never been to any school,'' Badillo
said. ``The problem is that in Mexico and Central America there has
never been a tradition of education. They have education in some of
the cities, but they don't in the hills.''
 &HT;    He went on to describe the new immigrants as ``Incas and Mayans
who are, you know, 5-feet tall with straight hair.''
 &HT;    Within a few days, Badillo's inveterate critics were demanding
that he resign as CUNY chairman. Juan Figueroa, head of the Puerto
Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, denounced Badillo's remarks
as ``callous and prejudiced'' and ``bloodcurdling.''
 &HT;    After Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx spoke at a
press conference of ``the pain that we all feel,'' Assemblyman
Steven Sanders added that as a Jew he felt compelled to speak up in
the face of bigotry. Soon afterward, Badillo issued a statement
saying, ``I know my words were wrong and I apologize.''
 &HT;    Actually, Badillo doesn't regret a syllable. ``I didn't say
anything I hadn't said before,'' he noted when I called him
recently. His actual point, he explained, was that children who
don't even speak Spanish need special services, including bilingual
education _ a liberal-sounding assertion that might confound his
critics. But Badillo's campaign to raise standards at CUNY and in
the public schools has made him such a figure of villainy that it
only takes a modest indelicacy to whip up a major brouhaha.
 &HT;    Badillo himself takes the stoic view: ``If you want to bring
about any kind of basic change, the attacks are going to be
vicious, and I'm used to that.''
 &HT;    Badillo is in the happy position of being able to condescend to
his critics, because he is winning the battle over standards at
CUNY. A resolution he sponsored phasing out remedial courses at the
school's 11 senior colleges passed last winter _ despite one city
councilwoman's accusing Badillo of advocating ``ethnic cleansing''
_ and will be implemented starting in January pending approval of
the Board of Regents.
 &HT;    CUNY's new chancellor, Matthew Goldstein, is an unapologetic
supporter of higher admissions standards.
 &HT;    And in June, a task force impaneled by Giuliani and led by Benno
Schmidt, the former president of Yale, issued a sweeping _ and
widely praised _ indictment of CUNY's academic standards. Badillo
will be 72 at the time of the next mayoral election, in 2001, but
he is planning to run as the candidate of standards.
 &HT;    Badillo has been a mayoral hopeful almost continuously since
1969, so there is good reason to be skeptical about his chances.
Then again, it is worth recalling that Giuliani has already
fashioned a political career in this most liberal of cities from
the harsh vocabulary of personal accountability.
 &HT;    Badillo is a tall man, broad-shouldered, with a bearing of
almost Castilian solemnity and the majestic head of an Easter
Island figure. One can only imagine the monumental effort of
self-will required to construct this persona.
 &HT;    Badillo was born in the Puerto Rican backwater of Caguas. A
tuberculosis epidemic carried away both his parents and then his
grandmother.
 &HT;    ``I remember going constantly to funerals when I was a child,''
Badillo says laconically. He left Puerto Rico with an aunt and
moved around to yet other relatives in Chicago and California
before settling in West Harlem. Nevertheless, he managed to
graduate at the top of his high school and to gain admission to the
City College of New York.
 &HT;    There is in Badillo both the ferocious pride and the
pitilessness of the self-made man; he sees in his own trajectory a
great object lesson in standards.
 &HT;    ``I came here when I was 12,'' he says, with the chaste and
deracinated elocution typical of the CUNY graduate of yore. ``I
couldn't speak the language at all, we were very poor, I was going
around from one relative to another. I had to work full time when I
was going to junior high school, high school, college and law
school. But I was able to move ahead because everyone knew that if
I graduated magna cum laude from the Baruch School of City College,
even if I had a strong Spanish accent, that I knew what I was
doing.''
 &HT;    It is impossible to fathom the violence or the durability of the
debate over admissions standards at CUNY without reckoning with the
sheer weight of symbolism that these schools carry for New Yorkers
of Badillo's generation. For thousands of immigrants, and children
and grandchildren of immigrants, the city's public colleges
incarnated the idea of social mobility and meritocracy.
 &HT;    Anyone could get in, as long as he had the grades. Admission to
City or to Queens, Brooklyn or Hunter Colleges was a badge of
intellectual achievement; graduation offered, as Badillo says, a
virtual guarantee of professional success.
 &HT;    But meritocracy seems fair only to the winners. Only a handful
of black and Puerto Rican students did well enough to get into a
CUNY college; in a city with a growing minority population, the
situation could not last. In 1969, black and Puerto Rican students
shut down City College to demand that admission standards be
relaxed to admit far more minority students.
 &HT;    It was a bitter time. While much of the city's liberal Jewish
elite insisted that the student demands would destroy the CUNY
colleges, minority leaders and activists denounced CUNY's
admissions standards as racist. Badillo was unequivocal. He brought
down the wrath of the students by saying that open admissions would
never work and that ``worthless promises can only bring greater
disruption.''
 &HT;    He had concluded, he says now, that ``open admissions without
standards is going to reduce the value of a City University
diploma.''
 &HT;    Thirty years later, it appears that Badillo and the other
critics were generally right. The combination of declining
graduation standards in New York City's high schools and the
lowered bar at CUNY brought great masses of students with eighth-
or ninth-grade levels of achievement into the four-year colleges;
remedial courses began to swamp the curriculum. Graduation rates
plummeted, from more than three-quarters of entering students at
City College to barely half that. And many students graduated with
only the flimsiest academic competency.
 &HT;    At the same time, it is also true that open admissions made good
on the promise of access: The black and Hispanic population in the
system's senior colleges, once under 10 percent, is now over half
of total enrollment.
 &HT;    So standards have fallen, but access has risen; which is the
more salient fact?
 &HT;    The very question makes Badillo impatient. ``We're sitting here
on Third Avenue between 54th and 55th Street,'' he said as he waved
out the window of his office in the course of a conversation last
month. Badillo is a lawyer with Fischbein Badillo Wagner Harding,
the city's most powerful lobbying firm, though he doesn't seem to
do much lawyering or lobbying himself.
 &HT;    ``You go around here, you would never know that New York City is
predominantly black and Hispanic. Eight hundred thousand people
came into New York today from New Jersey, from Westchester, from
Rockland County and Suffolk to work here, because we have 800,000
people in Harlem, in the South Bronx and Bedford-Stuyvesant who are
educationally unprepared for the jobs that exist. If we allow them
to continue what they're doing, getting diplomas that do not
prepare them for jobs, what have we accomplished? Nothing.''
 &HT;    Badillo's role in eliminating remediation has infuriated many of
his old allies, some of whom are as passionately attached to the
new CUNY as he is to the old. Roberto Ramirez, a state assemblyman
and the Bronx Democratic Party leader, began his own Badillo-like
trajectory to law school and politics at Bronx Community College.
 &HT;    ``If Roberto Ramirez encountered the Herman Badillo world of
today, Roberto Ramirez would not be a graduate of CUNY,'' he says.
 &HT;    Badillo doesn't buy the doomsday scenario. ``There's a fear that
somehow black and Hispanic students cannot keep standards,'' he
bristles, ``and I consider that to be the most racist system of
them all.''
 &HT;    Badillo's immovable assumption is that people will rise, or
sink, to the level of expectations they encounter _ just as he did.
I pointed out to him that most people are not as heroically
motivated, or perhaps as bright, as young Badillo must have been.
He was obviously pleased by the suggestion. ``Not everyone is like
Herman Badillo,'' he agreed, ``but if you want to be an accountant,
two plus two is still four.''
 &HT;    This is the kind of blithe and dismissive answer that makes
people mad at Badillo. Badillo and many CUNY officials argue that
the criticism of Ramirez and others will be addressed by summer
immersion courses for students who fail one or two of the placement
tests and by a program called College Now, which offers either
remedial help or college-level instruction to high-school juniors
and seniors.
 &HT;    CUNY projects that when remediation is eliminated, about 20
percent of students will be initially denied a place at senior
college _ and a sizable fraction of those should be able to
transfer from community to senior college after one semester. This
is a hopeful guess.
 &HT;    Badillo may prove to have been unduly optimistic, but of course
there is no way of knowing how many students will respond to more
rigorous demands unless you make them. And, as Badillo would say,
until the CUNY colleges are able to ask more of their students,
there will still be far too few black and Hispanic graduates
working at places like 55th and Third.
 &HT;    Badillo goes back to almost prehistoric days in New York
politics. In 1961, he ran for district leader against the Italian
machine that controlled East Harlem and lost by 75 votes. In 1965,
he ran for borough president in the Bronx and won, not only scoring
a tremendous victory for the nascent forces of reform but also
becoming in the process the most prominent Puerto Rican politician
in the city.
 &HT;    In 1970, he waged and won his first congressional campaign.
Everything he did was a first for Puerto Ricans.
 &HT;    With his Jewish wife, Italian-sounding last name and untraceable
accent, Badillo was a kind of one-man ethnic coalition. And yet
politics and temperament and sheer bad luck have prevented Badillo
from gaining the one office he craves _ the mayoralty.
 &HT;    Last year Badillo very publicly switched his registration to
Republican _ the equivalent, in New York City politics, of a
sex-change operation. Badillo's obsession with the mayoralty now
constitutes something of a standing joke in local political
circles. Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran political consultant, says,
``Herman is incorrigibly fixed on one thing, and that is to be
mayor.''
 &HT;    When I repeat this theory to Badillo, he stiffens and says, ``My
obsession is to solve the urban crisis in this country.'' He also
has several of his aides call me and explain precisely how
wrongheaded I am.
 &HT;    The official word is that Badillo's obsession is reforming CUNY.
And it is true that Badillo is now working with the board and with
Chancellor-designate Goldstein to develop more accurate placement
tests, to hire five new college presidents, including one at City
College, and to convert the recommendations of the Schmidt task
force into policy.
 &HT;    Still, another mayoral campaign awaits. For once, Badillo may
win a nomination in a cakewalk, since the prospective Republican
field looks fairly weak. The Democratic primary, on the other hand,
is sure to be a monumental traffic jam.
 &HT;    Badillo has recently been meeting with Dick Morris, the
disgraced political consultant; perhaps each sees resurrection in
the other. Morris predicts that Badillo would beat Public Advocate
Mark Green or City Council Speaker Peter Vallone as well as Floyd
Flake, a black minister and former congressman from Queens who has
quietly begun to canvass for support.
 &HT;    This race, should it come to pass _ a plausible scenario, though
hardly the likeliest one, in the eyes of many of the city's
handicappers _ would offer New York unsurpassed political theater.
A Badillo-Flake contest would pit the Mayor's most prominent
Hispanic supporter against his most prominent black supporter _ a
race that would speak volumes about political realignment in the
birthplace of big-city liberalism.
 &HT;    No matter what, Badillo probably can take some credit for the
changes that have already occurred in New York. Practically
everyone now agrees that inner-city students need to be held to
high standards. But not everyone believed it 20 years ago. By
taking a position on standards years before it was politically
acceptable to do so, and then resolutely standing there and
absorbing the abuse, Badillo created some cover for more timid
souls _ especially because he started out as a certifiably
disadvantaged Puerto Rican.
 &HT;    Badillo's greatest virtue, in fact, may be sheer persistence. He
has finished the New York Marathon 11 times; he has run, or
``explored'' a run, for mayor five times. Ambition, and the zest
for combat, keep him young.
 &HT;    I asked Badillo if he would finally call off the permanent
campaign for the mayoralty if he lost in the sixth go-round.
Badillo is not one of life's great comedians _ his pride keeps him
on a tight leash _ but now a twinkle of delight lit up his
leathery, almost Chinese features. ``I have a grandfather in Puerto
Rico who was 110 when he died,'' he said.
 &HT;    ``So you could run again in 2005 or 2009?''
 &HT;    Badillo did the math. ``2013,'' he said, ``or whatever.''

MCCAIN: NO WIMP HE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After all the presidential character tests imposed
these past few scandal-filled years, we have come down to this:
Should an explosive temper disqualify a candidate from the White
House?
</P>
<P>
   Or, to put it another way, would Republicans be better off
picking a hothead or a suspected airhead as their party nominee?
</P>
<P>
   We aren't talking alleged crimes here, or gross immorality, or
even lying. We are suggesting that losing your cool is dangerous to
your reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain was recently accused by his respected
home-state newspaper, the Arizona Republic, of being such a crabby
guy that he is unfit to lead the nation. Familiarity had bred
contempt, a common problem for ambitious local public figures eager
to impress a credulous national audience.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's intelligence is unquestioned, in contrast to the
unknown thought processes of Gov. George W. Bush. But McCain's
alleged inability to get along with others is now the latest issue
in the character wars.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, including the senator himself, denies that McCain has a
hair-trigger temper. But few associates and reporters outside
Arizona have seen it displayed in public. For most of the political
world, it exists only in legend.
</P>
<P>
   As legends go, this is about as substantive as Bush's
unconfirmed youthful use of drugs. Credible people cite it
authoritatively, but no proof exists for the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which McCain's temper could be a disability
depends on the degree to which he can manage it. There is nothing
wrong with a quick temper when provoked in a passionate cause. But
it would be quite another thing to indulge regularly in tantrums
that make unnecessary enemies and jeopardize important goals.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is widely admired as a tough man unafraid to do bruising
battle. No wimp he. Yet what some see as courage and determination
others see as irrational, insulting behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Republican Gov. Jane Hull and some GOP senators who
have complained about McCain tongue-lashings are backing his
presidential rival Bush. They may simply prefer dealing with Bush's
more controlled personality or may be trying to help their
candidate with a dirty-tricks campaign aimed at discrediting
McCain. There's no way to know.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson, McCain's campaign co-chairman,
says wryly, ``Anybody who stays around Washington very long and
doesn't get angry ought to go home.'' True enough. The problem is
that the anger should be justified, appropriately targeted and then
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's other co-chairman, former New Hampshire Sen. Warren
Rudman, asks, ``What do we want, Caspar Milquetoast for
president?''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes. Now we get to the heart of the matter. Let anyone who
has never had a fit of bad temper throw the first stone at McCain.
</P>
<P>
   That person either has the emotional hide of an elephant or
qualifies for sainthood. Do we really want such oddities in the
Oval Office trying to understand a world of less-than-perfect
people?
</P>
<P>
   I have long been a student of presidential history. Every White
House occupant, starting with George Washington, has been described
as throwing a fit over something or other. The intense pressures of
the office make constant serenity impossible.
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. Bush's father was in the White House, he was so
good-natured in public that he seemed a bit of a patsy. But when a
conservative columnist called him a Reagan ``lap dog,'' even Bush
lost his temper and banished the columnist from his sight. ``There
are limits,'' he sputtered, to sympathetic cheers.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a stretch to include an explosive temper in the
pantheon of unacceptable personal characteristics in presidential
candidates. There's no sin in it, certainly, unless it leads to
violence, which is another subject and not at issue here.
</P>
<P>
   And there's nothing illegal about blowing your top. Thank
goodness. If we legislated against it, most of the country would be
in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The question of overall temperament, however, is a legitimate
consideration in the choosing of a president. We wish our
presidents to be persuasive and we don't respond favorably to being
hectored. We wish our presidents to be likable and we don't admire
screaming and yelling. We wish our presidents to be dignified and
we don't think getting purple in the face is at all decorous.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate problem for McCain is to remain calm and
controlled from now on in public. Bush supporters and others will
no doubt try to provoke him into an angry outburst on television
that can be used to demonstrate emotional instability.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Sen. Edmund Muskie's candidacy fell from favor in New
Hampshire because he cried angrily in a snowfall defending an
outrageous press attack on his wife. That is the model McCain must
avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in 1980 Ronald Reagan furiously seized the microphone during
a Republican candidates' debate that was going astray, demonstrated
his dominance and won the primary. Anger can help as well as it can
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   One complaint against McCain is that he regards politics as a
contact sport and flying off the handle as part of the game. Yet
he's no different in that respect from many successful political
predecessors who understood that leadership requires stepping on a
few toes.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to get off the toes quickly and dance off with more
promising partners.

<P>
   Et tu, Ben and Jerry?
</P>
<P>
   The men who brought us the alternative ice cream are once again
adding odd ingredients to cream, sugar and egg yolks. Only now it
is gingseng, echinacea and chamomile that they have put in their
latest smoothies.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the ice cream guys are not setting the trend
but following it, as they join the food manufacturers who are
making so-called functional foods. These foods have been pumped up
with enough herbs, vitamins, minerals and other supplements to
qualify as medicines. At least, that is what their advertising
leads you to think.
</P>
<P>
   Functional foods fall into two categories: those that are based
on science and those that are based on wishful thinking. Products
like Benecol and Take Control salad dressings have the scientific
evidence to back up claims that they can lower cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   But most companies ``are adding whatever the herb of the moment
is without any proof that they work,'' said Phil Lempert, editor of
the Lempert Report Newsletter, which tracks marketing trends in the
food industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see more and more products coming up with
herbs as ingredients, whether they do any good or not,'' he said.
``It's the same thing that happened in the late 1960s, when
everyone was using the term `natural,' whether it was or not, and
for years people were fooled.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Grocery Manufacturers Association, a trade
group, sales of functional foods reached $14.7 billion in 1997 and
are projected to reach $17 billion by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these products suggest that they can bring well-being,
relaxation, wisdom and harmony into your life. The label on
Knudsen's Simply Nutritious peach berry St. Johnswort beverage
states that St. Johnswort ``has been widely used to reduce anxiety
and exhaustion,'' while the So Be Energy drink maintains that it
has ``health benefits enhanced by addition of herbs, nutrients and
other natural supplements.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's Anti-OX drink suggests in its name what it provides,
antioxidants, and the package for Think!, a candy bar with gingko
and choline, calls it an ``interactive bar'' for ``concentration,
calmness and stamina.'' Whatever that means.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these products taste as if they want you to remember
that they aspire to some medicinal purpose. Aqualibra, whose copy
is about its alkalizing effect, has such an unpleasant odor that
you know it must be good for you. Simply Nutritious Mega Green
looks like old mown grass, which is also what it tastes like.
</P>
<P>
   Think! tastes like all those other sports bars, sort of sweet,
sort of crunchy and sort of inedible. Benecol tastes like any soft
margarine. In other words, no one would ever confuse it with
butter.
</P>
<P>
   The trend goes beyond herbs. Fresh Samantha Desperately Seeking
C juice contains 100 percent of the federally suggested daily
requirement of vitamin A, 10 times that for vitamin C and 100
percent of that for Vitamin E. It's an antioxidant pill in drink
form.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a good idea to get 10 times the suggested daily
requirement of vitamin C in this form, because it just might cause
diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's Soup is introducing Campbell's Plus, four soups
fortified with the B vitamins, as well as A, C, E and calcium.
Kraft's new Taste of Life salad dressings ``celebrate a life of
wellness,'' or so their labels say, because they have been
fortified with vitamins A, C and E.
</P>
<P>
   But before you run out to buy Knudsen's Lemon Ginger drink with
echinacea or So Be Wisdom, which contains gingko biloba, St.
Johnswort and gotu kola, consider this: There is no point in
drinking echinacea to prevent colds because evidence shows that it
doesn't. Proof that echinacea shortens the length of a cold and
reduces symptoms is still inconclusive, and no one knows what the
proper dose should be, or which of the three kinds of echinacea
plants works best. And experts warn against using echinacea for
more than eight weeks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   While research has shown that St. Johnswort is useful for mild
to moderate clinical depression, it must be taken for at least four
weeks to be effective. At what dosage, no one is certain.
</P>
<P>
   Some drinks like Odwalla Serious Energy contain ginseng. But
David Schardt, the associate nutritionist at the Center for Science
in the Public Interest, a nutrition advocacy group, said, ``All the
best research in the United States and Canada shows that ginseng
has no effect on energy whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   All the research that has been done on gingko biloba, Schardt
said, ``is almost entirely with those who have dementia,
particularly Alzheimer's.''
</P>
<P>
   Effectively marketing the functional foods that have some valid
scientific evidence to back them has not been easy. Some, like
Hain's Herbal Kitchen Prescription soups, have already come and
gone. Kellogg's had very little success selling its line of
Ensemble foods, which contain psyllium, a fiber that helps reduce
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Benecol, made by McNeil Consumer Healthcare comes in a
margarine product, in salad dressing and in candy bars. Eating a
certain amount of Benecol a day will reduce cholesterol levels by
10 percent, because the product contains stanol esters. Take
Control, which comes in salad dressing and margarine, makes similar
claims.
</P>
<P>
   But to be effective, Benecol should be used in a low fat, low
saturated fat diet with five servings of fruits and vegetables a
day, said Dr. Tu Nguyen, director of the lipid clinic at the Mayo
Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to go to McDonald's and think by taking Benecol
you are still doing a good thing for yourself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to real food and a healthy diet?

 &HT;    CITIES URGED TO HONOR BLACK WWII VETERANS
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington Mayors around the country were urged Tuesday to
recognize the efforts of more than one million black soldiers who
served in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Day of Honor 2000 Project, sponsored by ComTel Productions
and the Black Film Makers Hall of Fame, encourages cities to hold a
day to honor what they say is the overlooked service of blacks
during the war. The project does not specify which day cities
should select.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious step forward in healing the racial divide in
this country,'' said William Smith, an educator and director of the
project who has sent letters to President Clinton and to Congress
requesting a national day be set aside to remember the service of
blacks in WWII.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the service of blacks in WWII has been largely
ignored by the American government and the media. He noted that
films like Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan'' fail to
depict the involvement of black soldiers in WWII.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first blight in American history for African-Americans was
slavery, and the second was not honoring the African-American WWII
veterans,'' said former Sen. Edward Brooke, R-Mass., a WWII
veteran, and the first black popularly ((((CQ leave word--denotes
changes from legislative election of senators))))) elected to the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke said he believes the American government failed to honor
black soldiers who returned from WWII as a means of suppressing
blacks at the beginning of the civil rights era.
</P>
<P>
   During WWII, black soldiers trained in separate camps and fought
in all-black units. It wasn't until after the war that the military
was integrated by President Truman. In 1997, more than 50 years
after the end of WWII, the first black veterans of the war were
awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 cities, including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas and
Houston, New York City, and Los Angeles have agreed to sponsor
programs to recognize the service of the veterans. The nationwide
programs are scheduled to end with a celebration in Washington on
May 25, 2000.

   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas
Tech University's law school.

minority recruitment,'' said Lynn Rodriguez, generE8Dx &LR; IFt

WEDGWOOD SHOOTING QUESTIONS STILL UNRESOLVED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KATHY SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Police are close to ending a 11/2-month
investigation of the Wedgwood Baptist Church shootings without
determining what set off killer Larry Gene Ashbrook and why he
targeted that church, several miles from his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person who knows the answers to those questions is
the person who did it, and he's deceased,'' acting Fort Worth
Police Chief Ralph Mendoza said. ``We can hypothesize, but we have
no physical evidence to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Sept. 15 attack, police have cataloged reams of
evidence from the church, Ashbrook's car and his Forest Hill home.
They have interviewed scores of witnesses and victims in an effort
to re-create Ashbrook's steps and determine why the shootings
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook, 47, killed seven people and wounded seven others in an
eight-minute attack. He turned the gun on himself moments after
being confronted by a 19-year-old man inside the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Don Gerland, head of the Police Department's
Special Operations Bureau, which includes the homicide unit, said a
``few loose ends'' remain before police can officially close the
case.
</P>
<P>
   For one, police want to interview Ashbrook's family to learn
more about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about him indicates he's a loner with no friends,''
Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   Wedgwood Baptist sits in the middle of a residential
neighborhood in southwest Fort Worth. Minutes before the shootings,
Mendoza said, it's a ``good likelihood'' that Ashbrook watched a
children's soccer practice at a nearby park. But Mendoza said there
is no physical evidence placing him there.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators' summary outlines Ashbrook's movements after
he parked his father's car in a handicap space outside the church.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook fired 64 shots, including 40 in the sanctuary where
hundreds of young people and adults were gathered for a prayer
rally. Police took 66 written depositions from witnesses and
tracked dozens of leads and reported sightings of Ashbrook.
</P>
<P>
   They believe that Ashbrook ended up at Wedgwood Baptist because
he had either seen fliers promoting the rally or had noticed cars
outside the church and knew that a gathering was taking place.
</P>
<P>
   From interviews with police, firefighters, city officials and
witnesses, here is the sequence of events confirmed this week by
Mendoza:
</P>
<P>
   About 6:50 p.m., Ashbrook, smoking a Marlboro cigarette, strode
into the church through the far left doors of the south foyer.
</P>
<P>
   A few adults who had arrived early for choir practice were
sitting on chairs and a couch in the foyer. Jeff Laster, 34,
noticed Ashbrook, got up and approached him to tell him that
smoking wasn't allowed in the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this where that damn religious ceremony is going on?''
Ashbrook asked. He then shot Laster, a seminary student and
custodian.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook fired six shots at the group in the foyer. His bullets
wounded Jaynanne Brown, 41, and killed Sydney Browning, 36, who
were sitting side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook walked down a hallway and encountered Kevin Galey, 38,
a church counselor. He shot Galey twice, and a third bullet aimed
for him struck a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Galey, who survived, ran toward the foyer and down a hallway to
escape. Mary Beth Talley, 17, saw the shooting and ran to the
sanctuary, screaming that a man was shooting people in the church.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook continued toward the sanctuary. There he shot once
through the glass and opened the door. He fired one round toward
the ceiling and seven shots toward the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Brown saw what was happening and tried to get inside the
adjacent pastor's office to call 911.
</P>
<P>
   The door was locked. He spotted youth minister Jay Fannin and
told him he needed to get to the telephone to call 911. Fannin
headed to the office with keys, thinking Brown was behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Brown headed back to the sanctuary and peered inside.
Ashbrook spotted him, walked out the door and shot Brown three
times, killing him.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook returned to the sanctuary and began firing randomly.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Kimberly Jones, 23, was huddled in a rear pew when
Ashbrook walked by her, paused, backed up and fatally shot her.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Ray, 17, was killed while videotaping the shooting.
Justin Laird, 16, was wounded, and Joey Ennis, 14, was slain. The
next random shots killed Cassandra Griffin and Kristi Beckel, both
14, and injured Robert DeBord, 17, and Nicholas Skinner, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Talley was shot in the right shoulder. She had been using her
body to shield a lifelong friend, Heather MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
   Then, police said, Jeremiah Neitz, hidden by pews, rose from the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons Neitz doesn't understand, he turned and confronted
Ashbrook, police said. Neitz defended the celebration and religion
to Ashbrook.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook pointed the gun at Neitz, who held out his arms and
told the gunman to kill him because he knew he was going to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Neitz then asked Ashbrook if he knew where he was going.
Ashbrook backed up, cursed Neitz, sat in a pew and killed himself.
By then, two officers were in the hallways and dozens were speeding
to the church.

   DELL-BRAZIL _ Dell Computer Corp. opens its sixth overseas plant
today with a desktop PC manufacturing site in Southeast Brazil that
will serve the world's ninth-biggest economy this year and the
region by next year. Brazil presents Dell with unique challenges,
such as a thriving black-market based on smuggled PC components and
a volatile economy whose currency was hammered by the global
investor panic that began in Asia last year. That partly explains
Dell's forecast that the facility will start with 200 employees and
expand to only 250 by the end of next year. Still, analysts believe
the potential for the region is huge. ``The consumer market for PCs
is growing substantially,'' said Luis Anivitarte of Dataquest.

 &HT;    Motherhood won't slowdown CNN's chief international
correspondent
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pregnancy and motherhood are not going to slow down
CNN's Christiane Amanpour any more than sniper attacks and death
threats have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a child, you have a bigger responsibility to
your personal survival,'' she said Tuesday in Atlanta. ``I think
I'll adapt and modify, but the fundamental thing I do, I can't give
up.''
</P>
<P>
   What Amanpour does, of course, is cover the world's most
dangerous places _ Bosnia, Somalia, Iraq, Sudan, Haiti _ as CNN's
chief international correspondent and a CBS ``60 Minutes''
contributor. But when her pregnancy _ at age 41 _ made news last
month, there was unfounded speculation that becoming a mother might
mean she'd spend less time in Sarajevo. She's due in April, and
says she'll take a regular maternity leave, then return to work,
doing what she's doing now as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   One certainty is that wherever and whenever Amanpour wants to
work, that's where she'll be. She is such a star and valuable asset
within CNN that she doesn't really answer to an assignment desk the
way others do; she decides what she'll cover, and unless her bosses
think it's too dangerous, off she goes.
</P>
<P>
   Amanpour, who prefers to be the reporter rather than the one
reported on, is a little uncomfortable with the public following
her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm really uncomfortable with people assuming I'm going to
give up my life's work because I'm going to become a mother,'' she
added in an interview after speaking to the Atlanta Women's
Foundation at the Georgia World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many other women, I'm now going to have to do the
difficult thing. There's no doubt that it's going to be a
challenge, and I'm going to have to figure out the challenge. But I
want _ deeply want _ to continue doing what I do. I can't imagine
not doing it. It's my passion. It's my mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Amanpour, who's won virtually every journalism award possible
(Peabodys, Emmys, duPonts), married U.S. State Department spokesman
James Rubin in August, 1998. The two have maintained such a
long-term bi-contintental relationship (he in Washington, D.C., she
based in London but always travelling) that ``Somebody asked me how
I had the time to get pregnant,'' she joked.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Iran to an Iranian father and British mother, Amanpour
came to the United States shortly after the Iranian revolution and
studied journalism at Brown University. She got an entry-level
assistant's job at CNN in 1983, sometimes fetching coffee, and by
1989 was an international reporter.
</P>
<P>
   She recently returned from a trip to her native Iran, where she
covered that country's growing freedom for a CNN documentary set to
air in February, when Iran will be holding elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iran is as open as it's ever been in its history. Forget just
during the revolution, but at any time in its history,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She's moved on to New York today to attend an awards dinner
honoring Time Warner Inc. chairman Gerald Levin, and next week will
be in Berlin covering the 10th anniversary of the fall of the
Berlin Wall for CNN, where she has an exclusive interview arranged
with former Soviet premiere Mikhail Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   Amanpour recalls she was in New York when the Berlin Wall came
down, a CNN reporter but not yet big enough to call her own shots.
``I remember just dying, just desperate to be over there,'' she
said. She was able to cover some of the aftershocks of the Wall,
however, such as the fall of Communism in Romania in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   After participating in CNN's Persian Gulf War coverage, Amanpour
became a semi-permanent fixture in the war-wracked former
Yugoslavia throughout the '90s. She had to flee Belgrade in March
when paramilitary thugs began sweeping through hotels, looking for
her specifically among Western journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear side of it _ it exists,'' she said. ``It's not
something I think about, it's just something I do. I don't
over-intellectualize it.''

 &HT;    A supermodel's mix-and-match furniture
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Nov. 4.

<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _ To Kathy Ireland, buying furniture should be
no more intimidating than buying clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The furniture in a home should be like the articles in a
wardrobe: an ensemble of parts that can be mixed and matched
depending on the desired look and the owner's personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take the fear out of furniture buying,'' said the
supermodel, actress and women's apparel designer in explaining her
first venture into the world of furniture design.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland _ a former Sports Illustrated cover bathing beauty,
fitness guru and creator of women's wear for discount retailers
such as Kmart _ was pushing a new creation down the runway at last
month's International Home Furnishings Market in High Point. Kathy
Ireland Home, produced by Vanguard Furniture, is a collection of
furnishings inspired by family and travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 8, we took a family trip to England to my dad's
hometown of Liverpool and visited Windsor Castle (outside London).
I was just awe-struck by the beauty: elegant, gorgeous furnishings.
But they weren't family-friendly,'' said the mother of two, ages 5
and 1.
</P>
<P>
   After coming up with some designs that attempted to capture the
elegance of fine European antiques, Ireland snagged a visit from
Britain's Prince Edward to secure his stamp of approval on their
authenticity _ then brought the designs down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got two small children and want them to feel welcome in
the living room,'' she explained, noting the durable upholstery
fabrics she chose.
</P>
<P>
   The collection also includes slouchy sofas, oversized chairs and
cocktail tables casual enough for feet as well as crystal. The line
is being touted as a ``whole-home approach,'' with items that can
be mixed and matched and, thanks to a varied palette of materials,
used throughout the house. A pine dining room, for example, can be
paired with wicker or iron chairs. A child's bed is large enough in
scale to graduate to the guest room once the child grows up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows the unique personality of the owner to come out,''
Ireland said. ``You can really have fun and complete a room to suit
your personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the more interesting pieces are a metal English settee, a
glass-top end table with magazine storage underneath and an iron
bed with headboard featuring three gate patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a busy mom, finding time to shop is a challenging task,''
said Ireland, who works from her Santa Barbara, Calif., home. ``My
designs are for people who are time-starved and wise with their
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Sofas, for example, are expected to retail for $1,300 to $2,000,
said John Bray, Vanguard's president. A portion of sale proceeds
will be donated to the Entertainment Industry Foundation, for which
Ireland is ambassador for women's health issues.
</P>
<P>
   To Ireland, who insists that she has been involved in the
designs from concept to market, home furnishings seemed like a
natural move, as it has with others in the fashion field, such as
Bob Mackie and Alexander Julian. ``The things I've learned from
fashion, such as color palettes, translate to the home,'' she said.
``You want both to last, but at the same time, you want a freshness
about them. In both, I'm going for clean, classic looks that are
timeless.''

 &HT;    Fusion of styles lets consumers express personality with
furnishings
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday. Nov. 4.
 &HT;    By Danny Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _ If you're planning a new home or even
redecorating one, don't be surprised if sentimentality plays a role
in your decisions. After all, years from now you'll look back at
photos and tell the grandkids, ``This is how we lived at the turn
of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the '50s, trend forecasters predicted we'd be wearing
spacesuits and living in homes like the Jetsons'. But, as renowned
futurist Faith Popcorn now admits, the biggest surprise as the new
millennium dawns is that ``nothing's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers savvy enough to cut through the hype are left desiring
some direction when making large investments such as furnishings.
They want pieces that won't look dated a few years from now,
furniture styles that can be mixed and matched as they grow older
and as tastes change.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers at last month's International Home Furnishings
Market in High Point, the world's largest wholesale trade expo
where new designs debut twice a year, singled out several themes
considered safe bets and cited new lines, expected in stores by
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we're seeing more than anything is a fusion of
styles,'' said Mark McMenamin, merchandising and business editor
for the trade journal Home Accents Today. ``There are so few pure
styles left anyway. The boundaries between what is contemporary,
what is classical have fallen so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are mixing traditional with contemporary, old with
new, as they recognize the best interiors are those that express
their personalities _ not those of their designers or editors of
their favorite magazines. ``They're taking things they've collected
in their travels and learning it's OK to put them all together,''
McMenamin said. ``Things not so much defined by one particular
style but a look that comes from mixing Empire pieces, for example,
with a primitive African bust.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with that eclectic comfort, today's young buyers are
seeking a little more elegance and formality than in the past.
``It's still relaxed and European but mostly English _ a formal
look softened by leather and shapes without hard edges,'' said
Brian Carroll, case goods editor for Furniture Today.
</P>
<P>
   A second major direction in furnishings is soft contemporary.
``It's an earthy contemporary, almost a Pottery Barn look, with
bone finishes and dark brown leathers,'' McMenamin said. ``But
instead of harsh metallic finishes and sharp angles, we're seeing
more of a vintage contemporary with floral and earth colors, mixed
with Asian for exotic elements _ bamboo, wicker, maple.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll predicts this direction will be most popular in major
urban areas, such as Atlanta, and in coastal locales. Look for an
emphasis on ash and ash burl veneers, neutral finishes of taupe,
brown and bone _ ones that showcase wood grain patterns _ and soft
silver hardware. This contemporary is further softened by
traditional elements, including architectural motifs such as
columns and fluted pilasters.
</P>
<P>
   At the fall market, Giorgio introduced its Maylan collection,
which combines Italian cherry and African walnut veneer in a
striped effect that sports a light sheen but dressy texture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a demographic sweep as much as anything,'' company
owner Dave Scarangella said. ``Baby boomers are moving out of the
way, and the next generation wants something parents don't have _
something different but not bizarre, something unique with striking
design but a softer edge.''
</P>
<P>
   That leads to a third direction _ retro. It may fade as
sentimentality over a passing era wanes. But for now, young
consumers who didn't grow up with beanbag chairs and lava lamps are
mesmerized by the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't had a Parsons table or things in every color of
the rainbow,'' McMenamin said, so to them, retro is new and fresh.
</P>
<P>
   On the following pages, Home &AMP; Garden takes a look at these
three directions and how manufacturers at High Point are expressing
them. We then visit five Atlanta area homeowners to hear what they
like best about their homes _ and why they chose the route they've
taken.

 &HT;    Color your world gray _ and beautiful
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Nov.4
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _ Fashion designers last fall dubbed gray as
the in color, and as often occurs, furniture manufacturers followed
suit with gray upholsteries and weathered-finish case goods.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a new twist, gray has been paired with gold, green, blue
and brown in new hand-painted pieces by the John Widdicomb Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, the gray in my hair came first, but these are such
beautiful contrasts and such unusual color combinations,'' designer
Larry Laslo said of the European neoclassic designs Widdicomb has
added to its Victoria &AMP; Albert Museum Furniture Collection.
</P>
<P>
   At last fall's High Point furniture market, the Grand Rapids,
Mich., manufacturer introduced 14 pieces inspired by drawings
discovered in the archives of London's famed museum, which houses
nearly 5 million objects and the finest furniture from every
period. Most _ they retail from $5,400 to $23,000 _ are from
England's traditional Georgian and Regency eras, including
Chippendale and Hepplewhite designs.
</P>
<P>
   At last month's market, the company added 12 reproductions, many
first made for several of England's grand estates, in soft painted
tones of gray-greens and gray-blues, combined with walnut veneers
with marquetry inlays. They include a commode, console table, sofa,
buffet, cocktail table, lamp table, occasional table, arm and side
chair, occasional chair, china cabinet and dining table.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lean toward architectural inspirations,'' said Emma
Saunders, a museum representative.
</P>
<P>
   Corinthian capitals top the legs on the console table, which
features a faux marble top, in tones of gray and tan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, this is what Widdicomb did,'' company president Bob
Dillon said, ``so we're pleased by the renewed interest.''

   Furnishings for both indoors and out
</P>
<P>
   Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
   By Danny C. Flanders
</P>
<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _ The line between indoors and outdoors gets
blurrier, and helping bridge that narrow gap are new furnishings
designed for use in both home and garden.
</P>
<P>
   Veneman Collections, a manufacturer of mostly cast-aluminum
outdoor furnishings, has assembled such a line by a variety of
designers that illustrates a new direction for decorating with
indoor-outdoor pieces.
</P>
<P>
   A cornerstone of the collection is the same eclecticism _ mixing
and matching materials and styles _ that has become so popular for
interiors. Teak with metal. Glass with stone. '40s art deco with
'90s contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The furnishings for our outside spaces should be as well
thought out, as well made, as comfortable and as pleasing to the
eye as those we would choose for our interiors,'' said Carol Helms,
design and furnishings editor for Garden Design magazine. ``We have
learned our lessons well when it comes to mixing styles, materials
and textures in our inside spaces, and now we can take these same
ideas outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideas such as surrounding a traditional wood table with metal
chairs from another era and pulling up a couple of woven chaises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oversize urns and planters and pots, now must-haves inside as
well as out, also add to the mix in glazed or crusty finishes,''
Helms said. ``New weather-resistant fabrics are looking more and
more like those made only for interior use, and when turned into
pillows, cushions and throws will soften the edges just as they do
indoors.''
</P>
<P>
   In developing its line, shown for the first time at last month's
International Home Furnishings Market in High Point, N.C., Veneman
Collections consulted industry experts for input on where the
indoor-outdoor movement is headed. The company found that as
gardens, including decks, patios and terraces, become more
important to homeowners, the demand for bigger, interchangeable
furniture will grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea is for everything to become one so that you're
creating a seamless environment,'' said Andrea Loukin, a company
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes furnishings with thick cushions;
durable, weather-resistant fabrics with an indoor feel; hand-rubbed
metal finishes; teak-and-cast-aluminum chairs; and neutral
upholstery fabrics for blending the indoors and outdoors while not
showing signs of fading.
</P>
<P>
   Some table bases are made of cast stone. A 10-foot-by-10-foot
square umbrella is large enough to cover four tables, ideal for
outdoor dinner parties.
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes several groups, including La Coeur,
designer Larry Laslo's interpretation of French '40s glamour in
cast aluminum; Kew Gardens, an aluminum version of classic English
garden furniture; and Veneman Silver, a sleek contemporary line
designed by John Caldwell that combines warm teak with cool
aluminum.

 &HT;    Extra! Extra! Give paper composting a boost
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Nov. 4
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCCAYSVILLE _ As autumn leaves fall, gaily drifting by our
windows, streaking the crunchy air with browns, yellows, reds,
gardeners always think of ... compost. Mulch.
</P>
<P>
   I welcome this second fall on the ridge, counting on a bountiful
crop of tree droppings to enrich the rocky soil _ as I have used no
fertilizer _ and to insulate the still-new plantings during what I
hope will be a cold Appalachian winter.
</P>
<P>
   But, while I embrace the leaves, pile them up to rot, rake them
around the plants like protective collars, I also give them all the
help I can in making the rocky ridge a little bit richer.
Newspapers started it all. But I had a lot to learn.
</P>
<P>
   From the first, I put wet papers several pages thick around the
new plantings, to keep moisture in the dirt and to prevent weeds
from overtaking the little perennials, shrubs and trees. Then, I
waited for the papers to become part of the soil, watering from
time to time. And I waited. After a year, I could see clearly the
headlines from old copies of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, as
well as those from The New York Times and The News Observer, the
Blue Ridge weekly. This phenomenon gave new meaning to the
expression ``deathless prose.''
</P>
<P>
   While I have a pretty high tolerance for what decaying matter
looks like in my garden (banana peels, peanut shells, leaves, small
clippings and such all make fine ``field mulch''), even I got tired
of looking at the newspapers that hardly yellowed. So, one day this
summer, more than a year after I spread the news, I stormed through
the garden, peeling the still-intact pages from the ground, tossing
them onto the compost pile. (I left newspaper around a nandina _
just to see how long it lasts. Going on two years, now, and still
readable.)
</P>
<P>
   I told this story to a group of gardeners during dinner last
summer in Hillsborough, N.C. Several made sympathetic noises. One
offered an obvious solution, the kind that makes you slap your head
for not thinking of it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I put my newspapers down, I always cover them with pine
straw,'' said the helpful gardener. ``That makes them rot quicker,
and the garden looks fine, too.'' She didn't stop with newspapers,
putting old clothes and rags under the pine straw, as well.
</P>
<P>
   In all my gardening years, I had never bought pine straw, always
believing that it was going just a bit too far, cosmetically. Just
a little too unnatural. I'd thrown a little dirt on my papers to
encourage rotting and placed rocks along the edges to hold them
down.
</P>
<P>
   Well, all that changed. I spread 60 bales of straw in a space
between the road and the woods, keeping it about 6 inches thick.
Underneath, I put newspapers galore, to rot at their private
leisure. I also relieved my closet of a virtual wardrobe, including
worn-out underwear, T-shirts, pants, shirts. Even one of Lyn's old
cloth handbags that she said looked too much like the '70s. (If she
had any of those big, ugly, clunky shoes, I'd bury those and
pretend the style police confiscated them.)
</P>
<P>
   For months, now, no plant, no matter how large or small, has
gone into the rocky ground without the company of some
biodegradable fabric or newspaper. Sometimes I just spread them on
the surface around the plant; other times I roll them and make a
collar inside the planting hole.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of this recycling is, it is done out of sight, of
course, and out of the sun's glare _ which appeals to earthworms.
They've begun doing their work, already, chomping away and
fertilizing in return. As a way of disposing of newspapers, this is
so much better than the earthworm composter I put behind the living
room sofa several years ago. This way, when a worm wants to venture
from home, nobody is offended.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as we humans are buried in paper (despite alleged
paper-saving computers) we all need to do what we can to keep up
with the torrent. Lately, I've been adding magazines, junk mail and
various other kinds of paper to my underground recycling plant.
And, I've buried stacks of newspapers in holes. Yes, I covered
them.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, not a moment too soon: My home recycling bin in
Atlanta, filled to the brim with paper, plastic, glass and aluminum
cans, used to get emptied weekly. Then, collection changed to
whenever.
</P>
<P>
   A personable young woman who answered the city's recycling
hotline (404-792-1212) assured me the pickup schedule still was
supposed to be weekly. I had stopped attempting to recycle, but I'm
willing to try again with plastic, glass and cans. As for the
paper, I've got that covered.

AMERICA MEDIA TO ACQUIRE GLOBE COMMUNICATIONS FOR $100 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Change in ninth graf.) 
 (ms) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an era when Congress worries about multibillion-dollar
megamergers and corporate chieftains with creased, sweaty brows
testify before congressional subcommittees about the threat of
monopolization, one question has yet to rear its head: What happens
if one media company starts to corner the market on tabloid gossip?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, America may find out as The National Enquirer (this
week's headline: ``Woody Allen's Bizarre Lust for Young Girls'')
and The Star (``Hunky Prince William is Moving to U.S.: Look Out
Girls'') are joined in tabloid bliss with The Globe (``Ravaged TV
Beauty Beats Booze!'') under the same owners.
</P>
<P>
   American Media, the company that owns the National Enquirer and
the Star tabloid newspapers, is expected to announce Tuesday that
it will acquire the Globe Communications Corp. for $100 million in
cash, said executives close to the deal. The price is five times
Globe Communications' annual cash flow of about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   American Media is owned by Evercore Capital Partners, LLC, which
is headed by former Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger C. Altman, who
is a close friend of the President and Mrs. Clinton, arguably the
first family not only of the country, but of the tabloid press.
Altman had no comment about the deal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will join The Globe, a 40-year-old weekly tabloid with
a penchant for Elvis sightings and alien landings, and the
approximately 30 other titles owned by Globe Communications _
including Crack'd, Horoscopes and The National Examiner _ with The
National Enquirer, Star, Weekly World News and Country Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   When completed the deal will not only annoy celebrities and pump
up the nation's Elvis-memorabilia market, but will assure that
almost half of the nation's supermarket check-out tabloids are
under one corporate umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe is best known for publishing more front-page articles
about the JonBenet Ramsey murder case than any other tabloid, and
scored a coup, of sorts, by publishing the crime-scene photographs
of that murder. The editor, Tony Frost, was not available for
comment on the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The deal has been on and off for years; Globe Communications has
long been the apple of The National Enquirer's eye. The previous
owner of The Enquirer, Peter Callahan, attempted to buy Globe
Communications at least three times, said an executive familiar
with the negotiations. But Michael Rosenbloom, the Montreal
businessman who owns the Globe, became concerned that the
Department of Justice would investigate the potential for monopoly
_ as indeed the Justice Department did briefly when Callahan bought
Star from Rupert Murdoch in 1990. That investigation was fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase comes at a time of growth and change for the
Enquirer: The tabloid is trying to go legitimate under its new
ownership. In February of this year, Evercore purchased the
Enquirer and the Star for $294 million from its joint owners,
Boston Ventures and MacFadden Holdings, Inc., and hired David J.
Pecker, the former president and chief executive of Hachette
Filipacchi Magazines, to be the chief executive of American Media.
</P>
<P>
   At American Media, Pecker's goal, along with his partners at
Evercore, has been to extend the National Enquirer brand to an
array of new ventures that may include more television programming,
new magazines _ such as Enquirer spinoffs for teenagers and
Hispanic readers _ and online services. Pecker has overseen a
redesign by the same designer who has redesigned The New Republic,
and Pecker has introduced an advertising campaign intended to
portray the National Enquirer as a respected celebrity news source.
</P>
<P>
   There is a potential for conflict among the staffs of the
tabloids, said an executive familiar with the personnel at both
companies. Whenever staff members are dismissed at the National
Enquirer or Star, the executive said, many of them would just ``go
down the road'' and get a job at the Globe; all three newspaper are
currently based in Lantana, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Murray, a vice president at Dirks Van Essen, a newspaper
brokerage company in Santa Fe, N.M., said that American Media is
broadening its demographic reach with the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are getting a spectrum of different readers so you can go
to advertisers and offer them the range of demographics or a
specific demographic,'' he said. The Enquirer, Star and the Globe
``were fighting in the same space. If you control the content of
all three, you can tailor them so they reach different people,''
then sell advertisers either the combined audience or one segment
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Leslee Dart, a public-relations executive at PMK, a firm that
manages the images of celebrities like Tom Cruise, said that
celebrities would just have to contend with the new gossip
configuration.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, by the way, I've always felt it was better to have all
your enemies contained in one spot,'' Ms. Dart said.

ANALYZING THE HARD SELL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a story about the growing popularity of schools that teach
advertising, Speak magazine says attendance has become a
prerequisite to getting hired by prestigious ad agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Most ad educators are practical about their goals. ``Maybe there
is a way to sell Nike without making a kid feel like a loser if he
can't afford it,'' said  &UR; Jelly Helm &LR;  of the AdCenter of Virginia
Commonwealth University. ``Actually, now that I think about it,
maybe there's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Students are often less than altruistic. ``I have no intent to
change things,'' said  &UR; Grant Smith &LR; , a student at the Miami ad
school. ``I don't believe that advertising really can. ... Besides,
there's something appealing about the dark side of the Force. You
get to wear better outfits, fly around in cool-looking spaceships
and have entourages and all kinds of stuff. You don't have to wear
khaki and hang out in the desert.''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher  &UR; Ed Prentiss  &LR; of the Portfolio Center put it this way.
If ad schools are going to philosophize, he said, ``they're going
to hurt themselves. ... I don't have time for moral dilemmas. ...
I'm not going to have my students think about the ethical
implications of buying brownie mix. ... People are just making life
harder than it is. Let's just make it easier and they'll buy more
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S.  &UR; Dan Dorritie &LR;  was thrilled by CompUSA's ``huge selection
of software for the entire family'' that included these goodies the
kids might like: ``Opening Weekend Deer Season,'' ``Panzer Elite''
and ``Freespace 2,'' which promises ``over 20 weapons of mass
destruction at your fingertips!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ECO-FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ It rained fish last Wednesday night in Sausalito, a phenomenon
 &UR; Kate Duckworth &LR;  noticed when she got home from work around 5:45
p.m. and discovered about 50 small fish scattered around her yard
and roof. Luckily, Duckworth works at the Exploratorium, where the
oddity was explained by physicist  &UR; Paul &LR; 
 &UR; Doherty &LR; , who said the fish probably were anchovies:
</P>
<P>

ANALYZING THE HARD SELL

<P>
   In a story about the growing popularity of schools that teach
advertising, Speak magazine says attendance has become a
prerequisite to getting hired by prestigious ad agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Most ad educators are practical about their goals. ``Maybe there
is a way to sell Nike without making a kid feel like a loser if he
can't afford it,'' said  &UR; Jelly Helm &LR;  of the AdCenter of Virginia
Commonwealth University. ``Actually, now that I think about it,
maybe there's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Students are often less than altruistic. ``I have no intent to
change things,'' said  &UR; Grant Smith &LR; , a student at the Miami ad
school. ``I don't believe that advertising really can. ... Besides,
there's something appealing about the dark side of the Force. You
get to wear better outfits, fly around in cool-looking spaceships
and have entourages and all kinds of stuff. You don't have to wear
khaki and hang out in the desert.''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher  &UR; Ed Prentiss  &LR; of the Portfolio Center put it this way.
If ad schools are going to philosophize, he said, ``they're going
to hurt themselves. ... I don't have time for moral dilemmas. ...
I'm not going to have my students think about the ethical
implications of buying brownie mix. ... People are just making life
harder than it is. Let's just make it easier and they'll buy more
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S.  &UR; Dan Dorritie &LR;  was thrilled by CompUSA's ``huge selection
of software for the entire family'' that included these goodies the
kids might like: ``Opening Weekend Deer Season,'' ``Panzer Elite''
and ``Freespace 2,'' which promises ``over 20 weapons of mass
destruction at your fingertips!''

   _ It rained fish last Wednesday night in Sausalito, a phenomenon
 &UR; Kate Duckworth &LR;  noticed when she got home from work around 5:45
p.m. and discovered about 50 small fish scattered around her yard

oddity was explained by physicist  &UR; Paul &LR;

 &HT;    FAILED FEDERAL CONTRACTOR HAD CRIMINAL RECORD
 &HT;    EDS: Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE and MATT KEMPNER
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An Atlanta real estate company that was recently
fired for mishandling federally owned properties in more than 20
states is headed by a convicted felon whose past includes a string
of bankruptcies, Georgia state records show.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that history, Melton L. Harrell and his company, InTown
Properties Inc., won a contract last March from the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to manage and market $367
million in homes that the government had acquired through
foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   By the time HUD pulled the plug on InTown six months later, it
said the company had sold fewer than 2,300 of the 25,000 homes. The
logjam cost taxpayers millions of dollars, created delays for
buyers and left contractors in the lurch across the country in
states including Georgia, New York, Ohio, North Carolina and the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   InTown filed for bankruptcy protection in Atlanta on Sept. 22,
the same day that HUD announced the termination of the InTown
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``HUD sets tough standards for its contractors as part of our
effort to wipe out waste, fraud and abuse involving our funds,''
Cuomo said in announcing the cancelation. ``When contractors fail
to meet our standards, we replace them.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Harrell's record raises questions about how well the
department checked his background before giving his company the
biggest contract of its kind in the country. Stephen Carberry,
chief procurement officer for HUD, said Tuesday that his office was
unaware of the criminal record when he approved the InTown contract
early this year.
</P>
<P>
   He said that felony convictions do not bar a contractor from
doing business with the federal government. ``I'm not sure what we
would have done,'' if HUD had known about them, Carberry said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell served in prison and in a halfway house in Georgia from
1975-78 on four forgery charges. Georgia court records show that
during the same period he also pled no contest to charges of theft
by taking, another felony.
</P>
<P>
   Carberry said he was also unaware that Harrell had been
affiliated with more than a dozen companies and partnerships that
filed for bankruptcy court protection in Atlanta between 1987 and
1990, according to Georgia court records.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those failed companies invested in apartment complexes
which later ended in foreclosure. Harrell filed for personal
bankruptcy in 1989 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Neither InTown officials nor Harrell returned calls from
reporters. Harrell's wife Deborah, who reached her husband while he
was traveling, passed along a message from him, saying that ``HUD
has not behaved properly.'' He promised more detailed comments
later, she told a reporter Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, InTown has bought derelict properties for
renovation in various cities and worked under a number of contracts
with HUD. Harrell's Atlanta headquarters continues to operate
several hotels in the Valu-Lodge chain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 one of his real estate companies was the subject of
negative news reports and commentaries when it informed some
tenants they would have to pay $3,000 a month during the Atlanta
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   HUD's selection of InTown has come under fire from government
investigators. A House Government Reform subcommittee hearing set
for Wednesday is was expected to criticize Clinton administration
officials for their role in the contracting program.
</P>
<P>
   However, Carberry defended the department. ``All of the federal
government requirements were followed in this case,'' he said.
Checks into Harrell's two dozens previous contracts with HUD came
up with no blemish, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carberry said that procedures do not call for criminal
background checks. He added that his department had been unaware of
past bankruptcies, which were filed under a variety of company
names.
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials also blamed Harrell's two partners, an
auctioneering company in Denver, and an accounting firm in Phoenix,
for failing to play a bigger role in the InTown project.
</P>
<P>
   The housing department's inspector general has issued a scathing
report questioning whether federal officials had adequately checked
InTown's financial capacity to handle so many properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff indicated these considerations were discussed and it
was determined that Intown (sic) had sufficient financing to manage
these contracts,'' the inspector general auditors said on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the inspector general charged that HUD had failed to
``adequately document or evaluate basic business decisions'' before
signing contracts with InTown and six other real estate management
companies. The seven companies were charged with disposing of
approximately $1 billion in foreclosed properties over five years.

JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BACKS BILL DESIGNED TO CURB CULT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese government approved a bill Tuesday that is
intended to restrict the expanding activities of the Aum Shinrikyo
doomsday cult, which was behind the fatal nerve gas attack in the
Tokyo subway system in 1995 and other terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which has been eagerly anticipated here, is expected
to be approved with the support of the governing Liberal Democratic
Party and its coalition partners and to go into effect by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill does not mention Aum Shinrikyo by name, it
gives security forces broad powers to monitor and curtail the
activities of organizations that have committed ``indiscriminate
mass murder'' and whose leaders hold strong influence over its
members.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of Aum Shinrikyo, including its founder, Shoko
Asahara, are on trial for, or have been convicted of, crimes that
include the sarin gas attack in the subways that killed 12 people
and injured more than 5,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation comes in response to growing public
outrage against the group, which has greatly expanded its
membership and commercial efforts. It follows legislation passed in
China last week that bans sects like the Falun Gong movement, a
popular program of traditional exercises and meditation, which the
Chinese government has tried to discredit by likening it to Aum
Shinrikyo.
</P>
<P>
   As Aum Shinrinkyo has sought new facilities to house its
followers and conduct operations, many municipal governments across
Japan have refused to allow members to register as city residents,
in effect denying them access to social services. Some businesses
will not sell goods to the group's followers, and some towns have
spent public money to persuade members to leave town.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese political leaders, city mayors, and victims of the
subway attack applauded the proposed legislation Tuesday as a
necessary step to prevent terrorism. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
said that he hoped the legislature would pass the bill ``as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Yukio Takano, the top official in Tokyo's Toshima ward, where
the group's public relations headquarters are based, said, ``I hope
Aum's activities will be curbed by the law and that they are forced
to leave our city and other municipalities.''
</P>
<P>
   But human rights activists and legal groups criticized the bill,
saying that it impinges on personal freedoms and violates the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Shigeru Kobori, president of the Japan Federation of Bar
Associations, said in a statement that while his organization
understands the anxiety that many Japanese feel toward Aum
Shinrikyo, the proposed law ``contains serious constitutional
problems in that it enables the authorities to take up measures to
limit basic human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very dangerous law because it could be used against
any organization that the government, the police, or the public
safety commission doesn't like,'' said Kenichi Asano, a human
rights advocate. Under this law, if the government believes someone
is part of a certain organization, they can arrest them, put them
in prison, or search their home. People should be prosecuted
because they individually commit crimes, not because they belong to
organizations whose members have been accused of crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed legislation, an organized group implicated in
serious crimes can be placed under the surveillance of the Public
Security Investigation Agency for up to three years and forced to
report on its activities every three months.
</P>
<P>
   The bill gives police and public security officials the right to
inspect the group's facilities at any time, and if the group is
found to have broken any laws, it can be banned from acquiring land
or facilities for up to six months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In August, public support for legislation to restrict Aum
Shinrikyo's activities increased sharply after a young woman told
police a frightening account of being chloroformed and abducted for
12 hours by its followers.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old woman said the assailants told her that she
would be killed if her family did not drop a lawsuit seeking
damages from the group for the death of her brother, who was killed
in another nerve gas attack linked to the group in 1994 in
Matsumoto.
</P>
<P>
   Although Aum Shinrikyo denied involvement in any attack and the
police had no evidence implicating it, the young woman's
accusations were widely believed, raising public anxiety and calls
for the government to take action. But last week the woman admitted
to police that she made up the story because she hates Aum
Shinrikyo.
</P>
<P>
   In another case that received widespread public attention,
police arrested two members of the group in September and charged
them with confining a woman follower against her will to a cell
inside an Aum Shinrikyo building
</P>
<P>
   But the two were released after the woman told prosecutors that
she was not being forcibly detained but rather was undertaking an
ascetic program voluntarily.

FRANCE'S FINANCE MINISTER, IMPLICATED IN CORRUPTION SCANDAL,
RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's government suffered a
major blow Tuesday when one of its rising stars, Finance Minister
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, resigned in the face of growing accusations
of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In stepping down, Strauss-Kahn, who has been considered the
architect of France's economic recovery in the last two years and
was often talked about as a future prime minister, declared that he
was innocent of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   But he said ``morality and a sense of responsibility'' demanded
his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me,'' he said ``it is inconceivable that a minister should
continue to carry out his functions while there are suspicions
against him which result in a judicial procedure, with the risk of
damaging the entire government.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Paris prosecutor's office gave a green light for
an investigation of Strauss-Kahn for fraud in his role as a lawyer
in a property deal in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   According to several newspaper reports, the investigation
centers on accusations that Strauss-Kahn, 50, was paid about
$100,000 for the deal but did no work. There are also accusations
that documents were forged to justify the payments.
</P>
<P>
   His difficulties are the most serious scandal to hit Jospin's
Socialist government since it took office two years ago promising
to infuse French politics with a new moral tone.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the suave, affable Strauss-Kahn is also a blow to
Jospin's politically balanced economic strategy, which gave
everyone a little of everything. To please the left, Jospin has
Labor Minister Martine Aubry busy forcing a reduced workweek on
industry. But on the other end of the spectrum was Strauss-Kahn,
the darling of business and international investment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his leftist background, Strauss-Kahn was seen as a
pragmatist and forged ahead with more rightist-sounding policies,
including privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Moving quickly to replace him, Jospin chose Christian Sautter,
59, the little known secretary of state for the budget who has
worked in the shadow of Strauss-Kahn and who is not expected to
make major changes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Speaking in the National Assembly on Tuesday, Jospin praised
Strauss-Kahn for his work in the last few years and said he hoped
that he would soon be back in government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pay homage to the exceptional quality of the work he carried
out over the last two years,'' Jospin said. ``I want to express
before you all my sympathies and my genuine friendship for him. I
hope he will quickly return among us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the case could drag on for years before magistrates decide
whether there is enough evidence to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation _ involving a payment by the MNEF student
health insurance group _ is part of a complicated inquiry looking
at how funds from the insurance cooperative, run by people close to
the Socialist Party for years, may have been siphoned off to
bankroll the party.
</P>
<P>
   But the accusations involving Strauss-Kahn suggest that he took
money for himself. Several newspapers here have reported that a
former senior employee of MNEF told magistrates in October that
before entering government in 1997, Strauss-Kahn was paid for work
he never did. The officials also said false invoices and letters
had been drawn up and backdated to try to disguise the payments.
</P>
<P>
   Magistrates could decide to formally investigate Strauss-Kahn
within days.
</P>
<P>
   News of the his departure made the euro dip briefly below $1.05
and sent the Paris Bourse's CAC-40 index tumbling by more than 1
percent. It later recovered more than half its losses.

   SPEND-CONGRESS (Washington) _ The Senate on Tuesday barely
passed and President Clinton immediately rejected an
across-the-board budget cut of nearly 1 percent along with the last
of the year's spending bills. Senate Republicans held their noses
and passed the across-the-board cut, while Clinton, in Oslo for
Mideast peace talks, immediately shot back: `` will not let it

   SCI-GENE-CROP (Undated) _ (Exclusive) Since 1992, dozens of
biotech crops have been approved for sale to American farmers and
hundreds put in the pipeline as scientists borrow genes from every
form of life _ bacterial, viral, insect, even animal _ to arm crops
with novel abilities. American farmers, seeking greater yields and
profits, have enthusiastically adopted the new plants, using
biotech seeds for 20-45 percent of the country's corn, soybean and
cotton last year. Most Americans have probably eaten some product
made from genetically modified soy or corn. Some scientists say it
is an uncontrolled, nationwide experiment in ecological risks. A
special report, by Carol Kaesuk Yoon.

BELFAST PEACE TALKS ON HOLD AS MITCHELL CONSULTS WITH LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ind.) (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ George Mitchell suspended his nine-week-old mission to
rescue the deadlocked Northern Ireland peace accord on Tuesday,
saying he needed to brief President Clinton and the British and
Irish prime ministers, Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, before
reconvening talks in Belfast on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, the former U.S. senator turned Ulster mediator, left
Belfast Tuesday evening for Dublin to see Ahern and said he would
fly to London on Wednesday to meet with Blair. He will consult
Clinton in Washington later in the week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, the
province's largest, is also going to the United States. He said he
would keep prearranged speaking dates in Indiana on Thursday and go
on to Washington Friday to see Jim Steinberg, the deputy national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by his office in the Stormont Castle
Buildings, where the long days of negotiations have been going on,
Mitchell said he is convinced the rival parties in the province are
``sincere and acting in good faith'' in their desire to put the
provisions of the April 1998 peace agreement into effect and to
bring about the disarmament of paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem, of course, is that there are differences among
the parties on how those objectives can be achieved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement created political structures to give the British
province's Catholic minority a share of power, along with the
Protestant majority, as a way of ending a cycle of systematic
violence that has cost the lives of more than 3,300 people in the
past three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mitchell pledged at the outset that his review would not
be ``open-ended,'' he extended it twice last month. He said Tuesday
that after renewing his contact with the parties in Belfast on
Monday, ``I expect to have my report ready shortly thereafter.''
</P>
<P>
   Progress toward putting in place the new government set up by
the accord has stalled over the refusal of Trimble's party to let
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, take up
its seats in the new cabinet until the IRA begins dismantling its
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement states that all parties must use whatever
influence they have to try to achieve disarmament by May 2000 but
does not call for an actual weapons handover. Sinn Fein has argued
that the Ulster Unionist demand for the immediate surrender of IRA
weapons is establishing a condition for the party's participation
in government that is not in the agreement. The Ulster Unionists
say they will not retreat from their ``no guns, no government''
position.
</P>
<P>
   The two prime ministers presided over intensive but inconclusive
talks in Belfast in April and again in July aimed at ending the
stalemate. In September, Mitchell, who was the chairman of the
26-month-long talks that produced the agreement, returned at the
invitation of Britain and Ireland to see if he could guide the two
parties to a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell set out to conduct the talks in complete secrecy and in
some cases away from Belfast, and the isolation produced a comfort
level between the feuding sides unknown in the polarized politics
of Northern Ireland. Martin McGuinness, the hard-bitten chief
negotiator for Sinn Fein, described the atmosphere as ``cordial,''
and Ulster Unionist spokesmen expressed understanding of the
difficulty that disarmament poses for the republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The deeply frustrating exercise has come down to how two
separate acts will be handled. The first is naming the 10 members
of the executive cabinet to run the new Northern Ireland Assembly,
two of whose members must be from Sinn Fein. The second is
beginning to disarm paramilitary groups like the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   A formula allowing an executive to be set up and a disarmament
timetable to be established simultaneously has proved to be
vexingly elusive. Assessing Tuesday's events, Peter Mandelson, the
new British secretary for Northern Ireland, said, ``There is
neither a breakdown, nor is there yet a breakthrough.''

THE MISSING MESSENGER AND THE THORNY MESSAGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. _ A woman who lives on an island needs to
join her fiance on the mainland so they can marry. The boatman,
seeing she is desperate, doubles the charge for the trip. She does
not have the money but a stranger offers to pay the fare if she
sleeps with him. The deal is consummated. The woman and her fiance
marry. Three years later, a friend of the fiance, now husband,
learns of the deal and tells him. The outraged husband divorces the
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Who is the best person in this story and who is the worst?
</P>
<P>
   Well that depends, doesn't it? A group of us who had returned to
Williams College in September for a reunion of students of Robert
L. Gaudino a quarter century after his death wrestled with the
possibilities for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, we lapsed into supplying unstated facts that made
it easier to answer. Suppose the woman had been desperate to marry
because the fiance was rich, not because she loved him.
</P>
<P>
   But we knew that Gaudino _ we still called him that _ would have
been scornful of such flimsy dodges. So, goaded by our
recollections of the slight, quiet-mannered professor who died on
Thanksgiving, 1974, at the age of 49 after a long neurological
illness, we would quickly back away from easy assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   What values do you apply to the story? How do they affect what
you see and accept as fact in it? Do we apply such critical
thinking to our daily lives?
</P>
<P>
   Those were always the Gaudino questions, whether it was a word
problem like this, the passage from Plato we had discussed that
morning, or the group's reaction to ``Lean on Me,'' Hollywood's
highly fictionalized version of an autocratic principal's battle to
turn around a failing high school in Patterson, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying all of it _ the seminar, the exhibit on Gaudino in
the college library, the convocation where visiting scholars
discussed his view that learning had to be ``uncomfortable'' _ lay
yet another question. Is there a place on today's campuses for a
professor like Gaudino?
</P>
<P>
   Gaudino's view that learning must be a confrontation with one's
self eventually led him to take students not just to intellectually
foreign terrain, but also on semester-long trips. One group went to
India. Later, his ``Williams-at-home'' program took students to
live with autoworkers, poor residents of Appalachia and other
Americans that the typical Williams student had never encountered.
Such ventures and his gadfly views frequently troubled
administrators and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   They seem even more ill-suited to campus conditions today. After
all, universities and colleges like Williams charge upwards of
$120,000 for an undergraduate education. Administrators often speak
of students as customers whom they must please with cozy
dormitories, free Internet access and lavish athletic facilities.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a lot of fretting about relaxed grading so as not
to compromise students' post-graduate job prospects and professors'
ratings in student surveys. It is assumed that anything that
doesn't directly improve a student's resume had better be fun.
</P>
<P>
   The ``consumerism of the contemporary university,'' Columbia
University's Andrew Delbanco lamented in a recent article in ``The
New York Review of Books,'' can undermine serious teaching because
``the high enrollments on which departments depend for lobbying
power with the administration can sometimes be propped up by
turning education into entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who returned to Williams for the Gaudino weekend
wanted to bear witness to different values from an earlier era. At
my freshman orientation in 1968, we were implored to consider
taking a year off and to enroll in a course we thought we might
fail. Williams, by making Gaudino's views the convocation weekend
theme this year, seemed eager to stir some on-campus introspection,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the gathering was as much about the missing
messenger as the thorny message. As much as what he taught, it was
Gaudino's skill and single-minded devotion to teaching that was
celebrated by those who came, a group that included lawyers and
bankers, psychologists, a college president and an architect. No
matter what the intellectual environment, we all realized, such
teachers are rare treasures.
</P>
<P>
   We got an unmistakable reminder from the visiting scholars at
the convocation seminar titled ``Is Liberal Arts Education Too
Comfortable?'' Two of the three speakers _ Professor Noel Ignatiev,
author of ``How the Irish Became White'' and Professor Jane Gallop,
a feminist scholar _ conceded during the question period that they
viewed their work with undergraduates as ``day jobs'' that merely
supported their outside interests. I couldn't help wondering what
Gaudino's question to them would have been.

ONLINE JOB HUNTERS ALTER THE ART OF WRITING A RESUME

 By DAVID LEONHARDT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a tenet of the job search, passed down to college
graduates for decades: Keep your resume short, ideally no more than
one page. A single sheet is more likely to hold an employer's
attention and make an applicant look organized, not arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the Internet is doing to one-page resumes what it
has done to personal letters and travel agents. It is making them
less relevant and perhaps even endangering their survival.
</P>
<P>
   White space, brevity and verbs are out. Nouns and comprehensive
descriptions _ including obscure proper nouns, like the names of
computer programs _ are in. If the resume continues page after
page, or screen after screen, so be it. Even Headhunter.net, which
has stricter rules than other Web sites, allows job seekers up to
6,000 characters, about three times the number in a typical
one-page resume.
</P>
<P>
   Computer databases that screen job seekers are the culprit. With
millions of applications sent by e-mail and the Web, employers lack
the time to even glance at many. Instead, they sort through
job-search Web sites like CareerMosaic or through their own virtual
piles by asking computers to search for phrases in the resumes like
``product manager'' and ``Microsoft Excel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a major change,'' said John A. Challenger, chief
executive of Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas Inc., the Chicago firm
that advises about 2,500 job searchers a year. ``The more you can
provide a company, in a way that makes sense, the better chance youhave of being sorted out.''
</P>
<P>
   This movement of job hunters to the Internet is remaking one of
the workplace's most enduring fixtures. ``Resumes have been the
same for 100 years,'' said Jeff Taylor, the chief executive and
founder of Monster.com, an Internet job site with 2 million
resumes.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor recently retrieved resumes from decades past at
universities around Boston and hung 30 of them on a wall in his
Maynard, Mass., headquarters. ``From five feet away, it was very
difficult to delineate which was a 1922 resume and which was a 1998
resume,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A printout of the typical online resume, however, would be
instantly recognizable from five feet because it might go on for
four or five printed pages. Examined up close, it would show other
contrasts. It would include long lists of accomplishments and
skills, not necessarily written in full sentences. It would feature
links to Web sites where employers could find more information. It
might even have a section called ``keywords'' that unabashedly
plays to the computer, seeking to pop up in as many employer
searches as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have tried to eliminate the traditional resume
altogether. Cisco Systems Inc., the computer equipment maker based
in San Jose, Calif., says it must choose among about 25,000 resumes
that pour in each month to fill 750 jobs _ except that many of the
documents are not true resumes. They are ``profiles,'' entered in
data fields the company has set up on its Web site under the
heading, ``Because the best resume is no resume.'' The standardized
format eliminates many worries, like what typeface or kind of paper
to use for a resume, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   The one-page paper resume is hardly on the brink of extinction,
of course. Many job seekers now keep two versions on file: one for
the Web, the other for actual interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Still, online resumes seem to be the wave of the future. And
writing them does require linguistic skills, if of a new variety.
In his resume, Enrique Ramirez, a 1998 graduate of Oberlin College,
changed ``ran experiments'' to ``researched'' with the computer in
mind. ``You have to word it just right,'' said Ramirez, 24, who
landed a job with a health care company near Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Richard J. Carnoske, a software consultant in Tulsa,
Okla., searches the Web to see how employers write job listings.
When appropriate, he then uses their terms _ like ``e-commerce,''
which he added six months ago _ in his resume.
</P>
<P>
   The new science of wording means that verbs, for years seen as
the hallmark of a good resume, can be less useful than nouns
because recruiters more often search for nouns. Some job searchers
even ponder the form of the nouns they are using, said Ben
Bellimson, a senior vice president at CareerPath.com.
``Management,'' for example, can be dangerous because it would be
missed by a recruiter who typed in ``manager.'' Job seekers who
know about databases put down both words.
</P>
<P>
   Internet job hunting can bring on its own headaches. Bullet
points and boldface, often lost in the translation between software
programs, can produce garbled text. So plain text is becoming more
popular. Still, Ramirez said, ``You really don't know how it looks
to the person receiving it.''
</P>
<P>
   There also is no guarantee that all that extra information will
help. Many companies still take written applications more seriously
than those submitted over the Internet because the written ones
tend to indicate a higher level of interest, job search specialists
said. And the size of some applicant pools has been vastly
increased because the Internet has made the resume-writing process
much less time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting, for example, now receives an astonishing 4
million resumes each year. It uses computer searches to help
determine which 350,000 candidates should be interviewed and which
15,000 should be hired. In other words, the statistical chances of
landing a job at Andersen these days are about 1 in 250.

<P>
   I wanted to be a salesgirl at the Gap. Never mind that I was 60
years old, and that the last time I worked a cash register had been
nearly half a century earlier in a Chicago clothing store for
women.
</P>
<P>
   It was October 1998, I was 10 months into retirement from my
home-based public relations business, and I was getting restless.
Then I saw a help-wanted ad from the Gap and I thought: Why not?
After all, I love their clothes _ and as a salesclerk, I'd get a
discount.
</P>
<P>
   So I went to a Seniors Fair, and the recruiters assured me I was
Gap material: hip, fit and appropriately dressed in my black pocket
T and khakis. They suggested I apply at the flagship store on
Michigan Avenue in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   As I was being interviewed in a group of half a dozen candidates
seated around a table, I noticed that I was the only one over the
age of 25.
</P>
<P>
   Why did we want to work at the Gap? ``I admire their efforts to
turn the apparel chain into a global brand,'' I answered,
impressing my interviewer. (Lifted from a Fortune 1998 cover
story.)
</P>
<P>
   My fellow job seekers gave me a ``there goes the teacher's pet''
look, but I paid them no mind. And when I got the job, I called my
friends and announced triumphantly, ``I'm going to be a Gap girl!''
</P>
<P>
   On my first day, I was assigned to a ``buddy'' who explained how
to check for items in the stockroom, how to place clothing on hold,
how to scan a tag for the current price and other tricks of the
trade. Then off I went to the men's department to ply my new
skills. For four hours, I chatted up customers, gossiped with the
other salesclerks and generally gloried in my new role.
</P>
<P>
   But if my psyche prospered, my body eventually collapsed. I
could barely walk to the subway after work. My Gap Kids shoes were
closing in for the kill. Every aged bone in my body begged for
repose. By the time I made it home, all I could do was sink to the
couch, motion to my husband for a glass of chardonnay and nod my
head to his query: ``Did you have fun?''
</P>
<P>
   It got easier. I loved selling, but I hated folding. I enjoyed
watching the skirmishes between mothers and their teen-age
children, but I had to fight the urge to act as go-between. In my
previous office settings, when bathroom, coffee or hunger beckoned,
I could respond immediately. But on the retail floor, you need your
manager's approval to leave. I swallowed my years of experience and
past career triumphs and did what I was told.
</P>
<P>
   In my Gap fantasies, I imagined myself rising through the ranks
to regional manager, but I stayed for only three months. And I
never saved a penny, spending my entire salary on Gap clothes for
me, my spouse, my kids and my grandson, and gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the holiday season approaches and help-wanted signs are
popping up in every retail window, I think about my days at the
Gap.
</P>
<P>
   I was a good salesgirl in 1952, when I was 14 and the minimum
wage was 75 cents an hour, and I was still good at 60, earning $8.
</P>
<P>
   But though I enjoyed the camaraderie of the workplace, and my
Gap wardrobe, I'll resist the merchants' pleas and leave retail to
the young and hardy.

BUSH SEES SCHOOLS BUILDING MORAL CHARACTER IN CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GORHAM, N.H. _ George W. Bush thinks schoolchildren who break
gun laws should be banned for life from buying weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks teachers who do their jobs well should be protected
from vexatious lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks students should have the option of transferring out of
unsafe schools.
</P>
<P>
   And he wants the voters of New Hampshire to remember that he
came all the way here to say so.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, rounding out his vision for education policy in a speech
here, called for schools to engender in children ``a spirit of
moral courage'' with instruction in character, education, and
discipline that helps them grow to ``be good and kind and decent.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech, the third in a series on education and children, was
delivered in the middle of a campaign swing that marked Bush's
sixth visit to New Hampshire. That's fewer stops here than almost
any other presidential candidate _ a distinction Bush is eager to
put behind him, particularly as Arizona Senator John McCain,
another Republican candidate, steadily moves up in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his trip through the mountainous North Country despite
a few bruises and scrapes sustained when he was jogging in Austin,
Texas, and had to dive out of the way of an out-of-control refuse
truck. ``I'm still standing,'' he joked, as he arrived at the Town
and Country Motor Inn.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate's day began with breakfast in the famed ballot
room at the Balsams with 22 of the town's 29 registered voters in
Dixville Notch. Later he poured coffee for diners at Howard's
Restaurant in Colebrook, and still later addressed about 250
businesspeople at the Northern White Mountain Chamber of Commerce
here.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's stepped-up campaign schedule is a result of
sustained criticism he has faced for skipping two recent Republican
forums and for his light travel schedule to the state. After his
speech, Bush said he plans many more visits to New Hampshire and
noted with pleasure that he has drawn large crowds everywhere he
goes. Next Wednesday, Bush will formally declare his candidacy for
president by filing papers and delivering a check for $1,000 to the
New Hampshire Secretary of State.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Judd Gregg, Bush's chief backer in the Granite State,
insisted that the governor is demonstrating the ``appropriate
deference'' to the voters of the state. He said he knows of no
other candidate who has given a major policy address in the North
Country, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a statement of how important he sees New
Hampshire,'' Gregg said. ``Most candidates come to the state and
treat New Hampshire like it's a grip and grin state.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters up North are evenly split between Democrats and
Republicans, and the Chamber luncheon was no exception.
Nevertheless, Bush received a warm reception.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Jalbert, for example, is a Democrat from Berlin who
works for North Country Internet Access. After listening to Bush's
speech, she said she thinks she could vote for him in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to do well,'' Jalbert said.
</P>
<P>
   And Bill Parsons, a sales representative for Top Furniture in
Hampton, organized his sales calls to make sure he could attend
``to see our future president.'' He said he was not worried about
the amount of time Bush has spent in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we start elections much too early in this country
anyway, so you can't fault him,'' Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bush focused on the need for safe schools that
stress moral development.
</P>
<P>
   ``No child in America, regardless of background, should be
forced to risk their lives in order to learn,'' he said. When
children are afraid, Bush said, ``it is the ultimate betrayal of
adult responsibility.'' And, he said, it communicates ``moral
chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   As president, Bush said he would revamp the Safe and Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act to make it more accountable for the
$600 million it distributes each year. Taking a swipe at President
Clinton, Bush said no one knows how the money is spent or whether
it's doing any good.
</P>
<P>
   ``One newspaper found that federal money had gone to pay for
everything from motivational speakers to clowns to school puppet
shows to junkets for school administrators,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would require every school that receives these
federal dollars to report on their safety records. And if schools
continue to be dangerous, students would be allowed to transfer to
a safe school, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also proposed creating a program called Project Sentry to
prosecute students who use guns illegally or take guns to school,
as well as the adults who provide guns to juveniles. He said that
any juvenile found guilty of a serious gun violation will face a
lifetime ban on carrying or purchasing a gun.
</P>
<P>
   In another jab at the Clinton administration, he complained that
although it is a federal crime to take a gun to a public school,
only 13 of 3,900 violations reported in 1997 and 1998 have been
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easy to propose laws,'' Bush said. ``Sometimes it is
easy to pass laws. But the measure of our seriousness is enforcing
the law.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush was criticizing the Clinton administration, he was
receiving some criticism himself. Joe Sudbay, political director of
Handgun Control and the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, said
Bush has refused other opportunities to reduce gun violence. For
example, he repealed a 125-year-old law in Texas that made it
illegal to carry a concealed weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's given us is baby steps _ baby steps that he can get
past the NRA,'' Sudbay said.
</P>
<P>
   And John E. Rosenthal, the cofounder and chairman of Stop
Handgun Violence, called Bush's proposals ``marginal'' at best.
``None of it speaks to prevention or reducing access,'' Rosenthal
said. ``It's all once there's a victim. It's like closing the door
of the barn once the horses are out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also proposed a Teacher Protection Act to protect teachers,
principals, and school board members from liability when they
enforce ``reasonable'' rules. ``A lifetime dedicated to teaching
must not be disrupted by a junk lawsuit,'' he said. And he said
teachers should have the authority to remove disruptive students
from their classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Bush said he would triple the $8 million currently
spent to promote character education, praising programs that
advocate sexual abstinence and faith-based groups that work with
children after school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am talking about communicating the values we share, in all
our diversity,'' he said. ``Respect. Responsibility. Self-retraint.
Family commitment. Civic duty. Fairness. Compassion. The moral
landmarks that guide a successful life.''

RETIREMENT AFTER THIS SEASON A `POSSIBLITY,' BOURQUE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It is his 21st season with the Bruins, and perhaps his
last. Ray Bourque said he hasn't made up his mind when his career
might end.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a possibility that this may be it for me,'' said
Bourque, who was honored Tuesday night at Symphony Hall during a
benefit for the Lahey Clinic. ``I really don't know. Sometimes you
feel you could play another couple of years and some days you feel
you can't play another year or so. It's something I'm going to
battle with probably all year long and up until it's over, or I
really know for sure, there will be speculation and things said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days I'll be retiring next year and some days I won't be.
I really don't know, and that's the way I really feel about the
situation. I'm just enjoying the good times and having fun with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his internal ambivalence, Bourque said he has made some
adjustments in his game to compensate for the fact that he'll be 39
years old next month. He feels the tinkering will maximize his
ability and keep him from further fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm paying attention to certain things this year,'' said
Bourque. ``I'm not staying out for the whole two minutes on the
power play. I'm not staying out for the whole two minutes on (the
penalty killing). I'm trying to really pay attention to the length
of my shifts. I think I've done that over the last half-dozen
games. I've felt that at the end of games I've had more in the
tank.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past two decades, Bruins coaches have had the luxury of
throwing Bourque out in any situation for any amount of time. Now,
however, Bourque said it's important to pick and choose his spots
in order to stay fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens sometimes is you run out and you give, you give,
you give, and when it's crunch time, at the end of games, and
you've given too much and you've been out there for too many long
shifts, you just can't get anything back into the tank to really
give that extra at the end of games,'' he said. ``This year, I'm
trying to focus on the amount of time I'm spending. I'm playing
around the same amount of minutes but I think my shifts are a
little shorter.
</P>
<P>
   ``(On the power play), if things are going well and you're in
their end, sometimes you don't get tired because you don't have to
chase the puck down the ice all the time. Those are the things I'm
trying to focus on and stay up with. If I do that, I think I'll
feel better for the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the toughest challenge is mental. His mind and heart
are willing but physically, he needs to rein himself in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you feel, `All right, I'll try to stay out there,'
but if you play tired, you get by, but that's all you're doing,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that has made it easier for Bourque to accept a
little bit of a different, perhaps less dominant, role, has been
the emergence of the other defensemen. Before, so much of the
Bruins' fortunes rested on Bourque's shoulders. Now, he's more than
willing to share the load.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very comfortable in terms of not being in there if
there's a power play or any crucial situations,'' he said. ``We've
got guys like Hal Gill, Darren Van Impe, and Donny Sweeney, all our
guys, who can play in defensive situations who are solid and doing
a good job. Offensively, in certain situations, guys have picked it
up like Kyle McLaren and Darren and Jonathan (Girard) or (Mattias
Timander). You don't feel like you've got to be out there the whole
two minutes. We can put out any number of guys. Not so much last
year, but the year before and previous years, you might get down to
four (defensemen) for a whole period. I think the coaching staff
now feels we can roll six guys and really feel very comfortable
with that. That benefits everyone in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the Bruins' potential for a run at a Stanley Cup
might entice him to stay on beyond this season, Bourque smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know,'' he said. ``I can't say it would or it
won't. Some days, it feels like, `Yeah, this could be it.' Other
days, I feel great. I think it's going to be like that for a while.
If it is like that, it just means I'm not ready to make the
decision either way. It'll come to me someday.''

MOORE MULLING DEAL WITH EVERTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Joe-Max Moore, the Revolution's all-time leading
scorer, could leave the MLS to sign with Everton of England's
Premier League.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, whose contract with the MLS expires Dec. 31, trained with
Everton in Liverpool and was to return to his Miami home Tuesday.
Everton manager Walter Smith told the Liverpool Daily Post that
Moore would join the club if financial arrangements could be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Everton offer looks good,'' said Moore's agent, Cory
Clemetson. ``It's a contract for quite a bit of money, about three
times more than Joe-Max is currently making in the MLS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take a lot more than he is currently making to keep
him here.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 28, has scored 38 goals in 79 games in four seasons for
the Revolution and has 18 goals for the US national team. He
converted 15 goals as the Revolution finished in fifth place in the
Eastern Conference this season.
</P>
<P>
   Everton's Scottish defender Richard Gough, who played for Kansas
City and San Jose, recommended Moore as the team went through a
winless October.
</P>
<P>
   The Everton offer would at least double the listed MLS maximum
salary of $250,000, and since Moore's contract is nearly expired
there likely would be only a minimal transfer fee. Clemetson said
Moore also has an offer from a Mexican club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe-Max made it very clear to me and Jonathan Kraft that he
wants to play in New England,'' Revolution director of soccer
operations Sunil Gulati said. ``But the marketplace will determine
what happens. Can the league match any offer he gets overseas? The
answer is no. If the league does not have the capacity or
willingness to do that, we will wish him the best of luck. But I
hope he comes back here. We value him as a key member of the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clemetson, ``I've always maintained that there isn't a
salary cap. I don't look at the base salary of a player, but
average it on a per year basis. A player should be looked at for
what he is worth, salary cap or no.''
</P>
<P>
   But the transfer could become complicated. Moore would have to
be among the top five salaried players on the team in order to
attain a work permit, and Everton is currently undergoing a
financial crisis. US venture capitalists EM Warburg Pincus and Co.
pulled out of a bid to purchase 68 percent of the club's stock at
about $36 million. Hedy Shor, a US diamond dealer, is reportedly
also interested and Everton vice chairman Bill Kenwright, a former
promoter of the Beatles, has made an offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution fired player-coach Walter Zenga in September and
have not named a coach for next season. Gulati said he has talked
to several coaching candidates and will make a choice by late
November.
</P>
<P>
   Moore has expressed a desire to play in Miami. He previously
performed in Germany for FC Saarbrucken and Nurnberg, and played
for Emelec in Ecuador on loan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling from Joe-Max is that he is obviously concerned what
direction the organization is headed in terms of building a winning
team,'' Clemetson said. ``He thinks the fans are the best in the
league and that is what has kept him there.''

<P>
   LONDON _ Banned electric shock weapons that can be used to
torture and rape have been advertised on the British Government's
official export website.
</P>
<P>
   An advert for stun guns, whose export was prohibited in 1997
under the Labor government's ``ethical'' foreign policy, was placed
on the Department of Trade and Industry's TradeUK website last
month by a Surrey arms dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The guns, which are about six inches long and which have been
used to rape prisoners under interrogation are favored by torturers
because they leave no marks.
</P>
<P>
   An advert placed on the DTI's website for Nisam International of
Esher listed stun guns among the equipment the firm was prepared to
sell. The entry said that the firm was ``fully authorized by the
British Government to deal in all defense and security goods.''
</P>
<P>
   When contacted by The Independent on Friday the firm's managing
director, Saliya Abeyeskera, denied that his company had ever sold
stun guns or even advertised on the site. Later that day the advert
was amended to remove the illegal equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not aware of this at all,'' Abeyeskera said. ``I am a
little bit surprised. We aren't selling stun guns and we haven't
sold stun guns. We only sell to legitimate countries and we have to
get export licenses.''
</P>
<P>
   The DTI's website also contains an export lead placed in October
1997, after the ban came in, calling on British firms selling
``electric pistols'' to contact the commercial officer at the
British embassy in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Clwyd, the chairwoman of the Parliamentary Human Rights
Group, plans to question Robin Cook, Britain's foreign secretary,
about the entries. &QL;

<P>
   The battle against malaria, which kills about two million people
a year, has entered a new phase with the publication of the first
genetic map of the infectious microbe.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe the map,published in the journal ``Nature
Genetics,'' will boost the search for new vaccines. However, the
question of who will own the patents on any commercial discoveries
from the project is raised by the presence of Craig Venter on the
team of 15 scientists who have produced the map.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Venter is engaged in the race to sequence the entire human
genome and his company, Celera Genomics, has made no secret of the
fact that it wants to patent as many genes as possible to exploit
future commercial gains.
</P>
<P>
   Malaria is caused by a blood parasite, plasmodium, which has a
complicated life cycle involving the infection of both humans and
its ``vector'' species, the mosquito.
</P>
<P>
   Plasmodium goes through stages of development in its host
species and this, with its ability to develop drug resistance, has
made it hard to combat.
</P>
<P>
   By finding the precise sequence of genetic ``letters'' that make
up plasmodium's 7,000 genes, scientists hope to find ways of
fighting it with tailor-made drugs and vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we know all the proteins the parasite makes, we'll know
how to attack it,'' said Dr. Sharen Bowman, who works on sequencing
the malaria genome at the Sanger Center in Cambridge, England.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic map of the most lethal form of malaria, Plasmodium
falciparum, gives scientists such as Dr. Bowman a chance to
double-check the correct position of a gene on each malarial
chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists hunt for genes by chopping up chromosomes into
smaller, overlapping segments. The new ``optical'' map is made by
sticking the malaria chromosomes to a glass slide and cutting them
up in situ _ a quick way of seeing the correct sequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The map is a completely independent way of checking that our
chromosome segments are in the right order,'' Dr. Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   The map was pieced together by a team from several American
institutes, including the Institute for Genomic Research in
Rockville, Md., to which Dr. Venter is affiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bowman said the international consortium of scientists is
publishing the information as soon as it is discovered, which
should prevent other individuals from patenting the same data.
</P>
<P>
   One area of intense commercial interest and research is the hunt
for the malaria gene that has enabled the parasite to become
resistant to chloroquine, the drug that was the first line of
defense against the illness.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest-growing strain of meningitis could be eliminated
from the population within 14 months, the British government's
chief medical officer said Monday. Professor Liam Donaldson said a
mass vaccination program launched Monday against meningitis C would
offer protection to all of Britain's 14 million children by
December next year. &QL;

GILLETTE, BRISTOL-MYERS MAY OFFER HAIR-PREVENTING DRUG FOR WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Gillette Co. says it is seeking regulatory approval to
market a prescription drug called Vaniqa that would remove unwanted
hair from women's faces.
</P>
<P>
   In a partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Gillette hopes
to sell a topical cream that could help the estimated 20 million
American women who at least once a week remove facial hair by
tweezing, electrolysis, or by using depilatories or wax.
</P>
<P>
   Under a best-case scenario, Vaniqa could be available to the
public in about 10 months to a year, Gillette said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If Vaniqa is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, it
would be the first time that the maker of razors and toiletries has
marketed a prescription drug, said Gillette spokeswoman Michele M.
Szynal.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bristol Myers, Vaniqa would be the first topical
prescription product approved by the FDA for the treatment of
excessive facial hair.
</P>
<P>
   The word Vaniqa was chosen because it can be trademarked; though
vaguely evoking the word ``vanish,'' there is no hidden meaning to
Vaniqa in any language, Szynal said.
</P>
<P>
   US women spend about $500 million a year on shaving products for
legs and underarms, she said. That does not include money spent on
electrolysis and waxing, which so far are among the best ways for a
woman to remove facial hair. Gillette hasn't yet ``dollarized''
Vaniqa's potential market size, Szynal said.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette and Bristol-Myers said they had submitted Vaniqa's
application for FDA approval in early October.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies did not go into great detail about Vaniqa
other than to say it is not a depilatory such as Nair.
</P>
<P>
   An analyst who follows Gillette said he could not yet comment on
Vaniqa because he knew almost nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA does not normally wish for companies to make public
statements regarding drugs in development, and we agree with
that,'' said William Dunnett, a spokesman for New York-based
Bristol-Myers Squibb, explaining Vaniqa's low profile.
</P>
<P>
   It would be not be ``appropriate'' to say much more about Vaniqa
beyond what was released Oct. 4, the day Vaniqa's application was
submitted to the FDA, Dunnett said.
</P>
<P>
   In that release, the companies noted that they have been working
on Vaniqa for about three years. Seeing a huge potential market,
Gillette formed a partnership in 1996 with Westwood-Squibb
Pharmaceuticals, a Bristol-Myers division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through our unique partnership with Gillette, we have been
able to draw on the strengths of both companies,'' said Laurie
Smaldone, a Bristol-Myers Squibb senior vice president, in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette, which also sells Duracell batteries, Braun small
appliances, and Paper Mate pens, counted on razors for about $3
billon of its roughly $10 billion in 1998 sales; women accounted
for about $600 million of its worldwide blade-and-razor sales.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette could use another hot product to go along with Mach3
razors and Duracell Ultra batteries. Though still highly
profitable, it has seen its earnings dip below Wall Street's
expectations in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Economic turmoil in overseas markets have been part of the
problem, but some Wall Street analysts say Braun and Gillette's
stationery lines have been a drag on the company.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Gillette said it might consider selling off or
discontinuing some of its underperforming businesses.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Gillette shares fell 7/16 to
close at 35 1/2, far below a 52-week high of 64 3/8.

   PARIS _ ``Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; Or
close the wall up with our English dead.'' (Shakespeare).
</P>

   ``Once more into the beef, dear friends, once more, or close the
supermarket trolley up with our English apples.'' (Tesco).
</P>
<P>
   Watching the escalation of the beef war from the other side of
the Channel, it has been difficult to know whether to laugh or to
despair.
</P>
<P>
   The British were once prized, on the French side of the water,
for their phlegm; their calm; their sense of fair play. No more.
The hype and hysteria surrounding the French ban on British beef
has been utterly disproportionate to the crime (and a minor
political crime in Paris there certainly was).
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of propaganda and vilification in the tabloid press
_ and not just the tabloid press _ has been reminiscent of the
prelude to a real war, not a trade war.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, this is not a government propaganda campaign but a
propaganda campaign generated almost entirely by the British press
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Since when did the highly urban, British tabloid newspapers and
their mostly urban readers care a stuffed turnip for the genuine
problems of British farmers?
</P>
<P>
   Do we really feel outraged that the French prefer not to eat our
beef? Or have we all fallen victim to a part-cynical,
part-unthinking agenda which loves to feel outraged by foreigners,
especially the Europeans and mostly the French?
</P>
<P>
   Enough. Ca suffit. Please calm down, everybody. Can we just
return to a few simple facts.
</P>
<P>
   The French are in the wrong. It was foolish of them to break an
EU concensus and try to impose an absolute safety standard on
British beef.
</P>
<P>
   There are complex, emotive French political reasons why this
happened. But, in the end, France, as a great food-exporting
nation, has the most to lose from such wildcat applications of an
impossible 100 percent safety barrier for trade in food.
</P>
<P>
   But please let us remember what we are quarrelling about. We are
arguing about the resumption of British beef exports to France,
which British officials say would probably reach no more than 20
tons in the first year, in other words roughly one truck load.
</P>
<P>
   We are hurling insults across the Channel in a horribly
technical dispute in which the scientific arguments are not
completely understood by more than one in every 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   BSE has declined sharply in the UK in the last three years _
more rapidly than the French admit _ but the disease is still
infinitely more rife in Britain than any other country in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The French scientific community has a right to be concerned; so
should we be. But the French have not produced convincing new
evidence that the limited British beef approved for export is
unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   To turn this mind-bendingly complex quarrel into some kind of
national crusade in which the froggies are hypocritical,
protectionists whose cows eat dung (they don't); and we are
obviously right, just because we are British, is absurd; puerile;
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the hypocritical French farmers DO feed their cows
sewage, don't they? The European Commission said so.
</P>
<P>
   No it did not. It said that some French manufacturers of animal
feed had illegally placed processed sewage sludge into the mix with
cereals and a score of other ingredients. In other words, there
were minuscule traces of treated sewage in some animal feeds,
mostly used for pigs and chickens, not cows.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is horrible and disgusting enough. It caused
consternation in France when it was revealed months ago. It is a
long way from what you can still read daily in tabloid and
broadsheet British newspapers and the mouths of Conservative
politicians: that French farmers willingly feed their cows dung.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of fault on the French side of the Channel.
French farmers, always game for a bit of tractor-borne aggro, are
threatening to block British trucks. A trial run by a few farmers
last Tuesday received an escort of French gendarmes as it trundled
through the Pas de Calais.
</P>
<P>
   This contrasts strangely with the pompous and high-handed
reaction of French police to a dotty little demonstration by
British Euro MP's on the Champs Elysees and a British roast beef
lunch organized in Amiens by FRENCH farmers last week, sympathetic
to the British case.
</P>
<P>
   What you don't have in France _ do we have to reach the
depressing conclusion that it is a more grown up country? _ are the
mindless insults and foreigner-baiting which are rife in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   There are real issues here but they are not truly issues of
Britain versus France, or British farmers versus French farmers, or
British consumers versus French consumers.
</P>
<P>
   They are issues of food safety in a world in which some farmers
no longer know what they are feeding to their animals; they are
issues of agri-industry versus traditional farming.
</P>
<P>
   These are issues which cross national boundaries because food
crosses national boundaries, in huge quantities.
</P>
<P>
   They are not issues which can be solved by waving flags and
screaming insults in the name of half-understood science.
</P>
<P>
   Let the politicians and the lawyers and the scientists sort it
out. Let's, everyone, take a deep breath. It is time for common
sense, and a sense of proportion, to break out, on both sides of
the Channel. &QL;

   In a showy ceremony with lifesized Mickey and Minnie Mouse
characters bearhugging top officials, the Hong Kong government
announced Tuesday a $3.55 billion deal to unveil a Walt Disney
theme park here in 2005, the first in China and only the third
Disney park outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The big-ticket project has far-reaching financial,
environmental, and public policy implications for this
cosmopolitan, capitalist enclave determined to maintain a separate
identity from its parent government in Beijing. It also marks a
breakthrough for a US media giant eager to establish a foothold in
China despite its sometimes stormy relationship with the communist
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa called Disney's decision
to site a theme park here ``a vote of confidence in our city and
our future,'' a veiled reference to China's ``one country, two
systems'' promise to let Hong Kong retain its capitalist system for
at least 50 years after the 1997 handover.
</P>
<P>
   The government also hopes the theme park, though costly for
taxpayers, will help lead the territory out of recession. In recent
months, officials troubled by a 6 percent unemployment rate brought
on by the Asian financial crisis bubbled about a ``Disney-led
recovery.'' Government economists asserted the project would create
18,400 jobs and $800 million in economic benefits in the first year
the park opens, and ultimately reap an eightfold return on the
government's investment. The project will be the biggest
undertaking by Hong Kong since its return to Chinese rule two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the theme park and related hotels will cost $1.8
billion to construct. But first the Hong Kong government will have
to spend $1.7 billion on land reclamation, roads, trains, and ferry
links to the proposed 311-acre site on Penny's Bay, Lantau Island,
about 6 miles west of central Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for $416 million in government equity, $314
million in Disney equity, and $1.1 billion in government and
commercial loans. The government will hold a 57 percent stake in
the project, and Disney 43 percent. Hong Kong eventually could own
73 percent by converting subordinated shares.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy public investment in a commercial enterprise
represents a significant departure for a government long heralded
as a hands-off, free-market haven. But to those who criticized the
deal as a virtual state-owned enterprise, officials replied that
the project is an investment in Hong Kong, and that shares could be
sold to the public. Officials said the park would be profitable by
the second year, and would pay share dividends by year 13.
</P>
<P>
   The park is expected to draw 5.2 million visitors in its first
year, of which 1.4 million would be people who otherwise wouldn't
have come to Hong Kong, officials said. By 2020, the park would
draw 10 million visitors annually, most from China, Taiwan, and
southeast Asia. Mainland visitors would rise from one-third to half
of total guests by the 15th year.
</P>
<P>
   The Walt Disney Co. also will gain unrivaled access to the
mainland Chinese market through the park and 5 to 10 percent
royalties on sales of Disney-branded products. That is no small
accomplishment for a company whose movies were blocked from China
just two years ago after the US release of ``Kundun,'' a film about
the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader whom Beijing considers
subversive. Disney has tried to return to China's graces since
then, agreeing to buy the US rights to two mainland films _ one
replete with communist propaganda _ and finally received approval
this year to distribute the ``Mulan'' and ``Tarzan'' films in
China.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Disney's contribution and stake in the project
were determined by painful lessons learned in Tokyo Disneyland _
where Disney passed up tremendous profits by taking no ownership _
and Disneyland Paris, where Disney lost substantially by taking too
heavy a stake and overbuilding.
</P>
<P>
   The deal leaves Hong Kong the right the build any competing
theme park, and Disney the right to develop another park elsewhere
in Asia or China.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers fear a costly joint venture between Disney and a
government under Beijing's ultimate control could prompt quiet
self-censorship in Disney films, creative ventures, or even in news
coverage by its subsidiary, ABC News. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.,
the parent company of numerous newspapers, television networks, and
publishers, has a lucrative franchise in China, and many media
watchdogs have accused his properties of kowtowing to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But those worries were far from the minds of Disney executives
and Hong Kong officials Tuesday as they cavorted with cartoon
characters and extolled the benefits of Hong Kong Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Hardoon, creative director of the imagineering division of
Walt Disney, said in an interview the Hong Kong park would retain
its essential character as ``Americana,'' but would incorporate
Chinese language, food, festivals, performances, color schemes, and
even landscaping. Hardoon said a master of feng shui, an ancient
Chinese design art, had already determined the best placement for
the entrance and appropriate ``guest flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing worries the park might not appeal here, Wing Chao, a
Disney executive vice president, added that even after all the
early difficulties with Disneyland Paris, the park is now the
single largest tourist attraction in Europe, surpassing even the
Louvre Museum and the Coliseum. ``Disney sells,'' he said. ``It is
loved by people all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism executives praised the deal, saying they hoped it would
build Hong Kong's position as a tourist destination for families
and business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was not so enamored of the deal. Christine Loh,
an elected legislator, slammed the government for not explaning the
assumptions underlying its projection that the park would create
35,800 jobs by its 15th year, and yield $19 billion in benefits
over 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They produced what I would call bare-bones numbers. They
didn't want us to get bogged down in the details,'' Loh said.
``When they do give us all the numbers, we're not going to have
enough time to review them.''
</P>
<P>
   Loh predicted the deal, which requires legislative approval,
would win easy passage by lawmakers blinded by Tuesday's public
relations ``razzmatazz.''
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists also objected to the plan. Friends of the
Earth assistant director Plato Kwong-to Yip said underwater
dynamiting and dredging for the project will kill fish, porpoises,
endangered white dolphins, and coral. That in turn could destroy
the livelihood of local fishermen, and noise and pollution from the
park would disrupt the rural lifestyle and untainted woodlands
adjacent to the site on Lantau Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest concern is that the project is irreversible.
Lantau is the `green lung' (that supports the ecosystem) of Hong
Kong,'' Yip said. ``Once you put a tumor on it, you will need a big
knife to get it out.''

   PARIS _ ``Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; Or
close the wall up with our English dead.'' (Shakespeare).
</P>
<P>
   ``Once more into the beef, dear friends, once more, or close the
supermarket trolley up with our English apples.'' (Tesco).
</P>
<P>
   Watching the escalation of the beef war from the other side of
the Channel, it has been difficult to know whether to laugh or to
despair.
</P>
<P>
   The British were once prized, on the French side of the water,
for their phlegm; their calm; their sense of fair play. No more.
The hype and hysteria surrounding the French ban on British beef
has been utterly disproportionate to the crime (and a minor
political crime in Paris there certainly was).
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of propaganda and vilification in the tabloid press
_ and not just the tabloid press _ has been reminiscent of the
prelude to a real war, not a trade war.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, this is not a government propaganda campaign but a
propaganda campaign generated almost entirely by the British press
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Since when did the highly urban, British tabloid newspapers and
their mostly urban readers care a stuffed turnip for the genuine
problems of British farmers?
</P>
<P>
   Do we really feel outraged that the French prefer not to eat our
beef? Or have we all fallen victim to a part-cynical,
part-unthinking agenda which loves to feel outraged by foreigners,
especially the Europeans and mostly the French?
</P>
<P>
   Enough. Ca suffit. Please calm down, everybody. Can we just
return to a few simple facts.
</P>
<P>
   The French are in the wrong. It was foolish of them to break an
EU concensus and try to impose an absolute safety standard on
British beef.
</P>
<P>
   There are complex, emotive French political reasons why this
happened. But, in the end, France, as a great food-exporting
nation, has the most to lose from such wildcat applications of an
impossible 100 percent safety barrier for trade in food.
</P>
<P>
   But please let us remember what we are quarrelling about. We are
arguing about the resumption of British beef exports to France,
which British officials say would probably reach no more than 20
tons in the first year, in other words roughly one truck load.
</P>
<P>
   We are hurling insults across the Channel in a horribly
technical dispute in which the scientific arguments are not
completely understood by more than one in every 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   BSE has declined sharply in the UK in the last three years _
more rapidly than the French admit _ but the disease is still
infinitely more rife in Britain than any other country in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The French scientific community has a right to be concerned; so
should we be. But the French have not produced convincing new
evidence that the limited British beef approved for export is
unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   To turn this mind-bendingly complex quarrel into some kind of
national crusade in which the froggies are hypocritical,
protectionists whose cows eat dung (they don't); and we are
obviously right, just because we are British, is absurd; puerile;
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the hypocritical French farmers DO feed their cows
sewage, don't they? The European Commission said so.
</P>
<P>
   No it did not. It said that some French manufacturers of animal
feed had illegally placed processed sewage sludge into the mix with
cereals and a score of other ingredients. In other words, there
were minuscule traces of treated sewage in some animal feeds,
mostly used for pigs and chickens, not cows.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is horrible and disgusting enough. It caused
consternation in France when it was revealed months ago. It is a
long way from what you can still read daily in tabloid and
broadsheet British newspapers and the mouths of Conservative
politicians: that French farmers willingly feed their cows dung.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of fault on the French side of the Channel.
French farmers, always game for a bit of tractor-borne aggro, are
threatening to block British trucks. A trial run by a few farmers
last Tuesday received an escort of French gendarmes as it trundled
through the Pas de Calais.
</P>
<P>
   This contrasts strangely with the pompous and high-handed
reaction of French police to a dotty little demonstration by
British Euro MP's on the Champs Elysees and a British roast beef
lunch organized in Amiens by FRENCH farmers last week, sympathetic
to the British case.
</P>
<P>
   What you don't have in France _ do we have to reach the
depressing conclusion that it is a more grown up country? _ are the
mindless insults and foreigner-baiting which are rife in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   There are real issues here but they are not truly issues of
Britain versus France, or British farmers versus French farmers, or
British consumers versus French consumers.
</P>
<P>
   They are issues of food safety in a world in which some farmers
no longer know what they are feeding to their animals; they are
issues of agri-industry versus traditional farming.
</P>
<P>
   These are issues which cross national boundaries because food
crosses national boundaries, in huge quantities.
</P>
<P>
   They are not issues which can be solved by waving flags and
screaming insults in the name of half-understood science.
</P>
<P>
   Let the politicians and the lawyers and the scientists sort it
out. Let's, everyone, take a deep breath. It is time for common
sense, and a sense of proportion, to break out, on both sides of
the Channel. &QL;

LAWYER BUYS POTENTIAL EGYPTAIR WEB SITE NAMES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just hours after an EgyptAir jet smashed into the Atlantic
Ocean, a Washington attorney who specializes in aircraft disasters
went on line and bought a handful of Internet addresses that could
be associated with the crash, including www.flight990.com and
www.EgyptAirflight990.com.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of buying Internet domain names is fast becoming a
high-tech form of ambulance chasing; in the wake of recent major
tragedies, including the shootings at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., speculators known as ``cybersquatters'' have
rushed to buy Web addresses that might be sold later for a profit.
</P>
<P>
   But attorney Doug Dejardins insisted Tuesday that he has no
plans to sell the EgyptAir domain names, although he has already
received one e-mail offer from a potential buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it is appropriate for the sites to be run by
anyone who stands to profit from the disaster,'' said Dejardins, an
attorney with R. Jack Clapp and Associates. ``Our feeling is that
those names belong to the families of the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Dejardins represented relatives of the passengers who died in
the ValuJet Flight 592 crash of 1996, and he said he has handed
over the new site addresses to the family association that formed
after that crash. When the EgyptAir support site is launched,
however, it will include a link to his firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site will offer genuine advice to the victims, and part of
that is legal assistance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the site will be operated by Deborah Landrom, whose
sister Terri Bell died on the ValuJet crash in the Florida
Everglades. Landrom and her husband are members of a support and
lobbying group called ValuJet Flight 592 Remembered Inc., and they
also run www.flight592.com, a memorial and information
clearinghouse for the ValuJet crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about a money exchange,'' said Landrom. ``We are
only interested in getting information to the family members about
what to expect next. I want to save them the pitfalls that we have
endured.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the ValuJet crash, families have typically formed
support groups in the wake of disasters, and some of them have Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan on putting up answers to questions the families might
have,'' said Landrom. ``Down the road, we'll give it to one of the
family members who can handle it and control it. But believe me,
they can't handle it right now.''

BUSH CALLS FOR TEACHING MORALS IN THE CLASSROOM
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GORHAM, N.H. _ Lamenting that classrooms have ceased to be safe
places where students are taught moral values, Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas said Tuesday that schools should allow more religious
expression, that teachers should be freer to punish unruly students
and that the government should more aggressively prosecute children
who carry guns.
</P>
<P>
   In his third extended speech on public education, Bush offered
an array of proposals designed to ensure that classrooms were
places of learning and discipline, not fear and disarray. But he
dwelled longest and most deeply on a conservative complaint that
students were not being taught fixed principles of right and wrong,
that religion was in retreat and that sexual abstinence was not
being urged as strongly as contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination, said that he would try to change all of that and would,
for example, increase the federal government's annual spending on
character education to $25 million from $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we want our children to be smart and successful,'' Bush
said. ``But even more, we want them to be good and kind and decent.
Yes, our children must learn how to make a living. But even more,
they must learn how to live, and what to love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make the case for moral education,'' Bush continued,
adding that morality is not ``a cafeteria of personal choices _
with every choice equally right and equally arbitrary, like picking
a flavor of ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that church groups should be encouraged and allowed to
participate more freely in after-school programs and that students
should not be prohibited from voluntary gestures of spiritual
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools must never impose religion,'' Bush said. ``But they
must not oppose religion, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious groups have a right to meet before and after
school,'' he said. ``Students have a right to say grace before
meals, read their Bibles, wear Stars of David and crosses, and
discuss religion with other willing students.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of what Bush discussed Tuesday involved issues beyond the
reach of the presidency or federal government, and he made it clear
that he was not advocating a greater federal role in public
education. Instead, it was more a reflection of the broad political
themes he is pushing in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He said that there were values that people of all faiths and
sensibilities shared _ ``respect, responsibility, self-restraint,
family commitment, civic duty, fairness, compassion'' _ and that
schools could and should encourage these values, perhaps by
identifying these traits in historical figures, perhaps by having
children take daily pledges of virtue.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, his speech came across as a baby boomer's
general expression of regret for the moral relativism that his
generation had allowed to creep into classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks also reflected his hopes for stemming the string of
school shootings in recent years _ including the deaths of 15
people at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., last April.
</P>
<P>
   ``When children and teenagers go to school afraid of being
bullied, or beaten or worse, it is the ultimate betrayal of adult
responsibility,'' Bush said. ``It communicates the victory of moral
chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made education one of the core issues of his campaign.
By choosing New Hampshire as the site for his third speech on the
topic, he was able to court voters in a state where many of his
rivals have spent more time than he has and where Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., has pulled closer to Bush in polls over the last few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Before the midday speech here, Bush made two other stops in New
Hampshire, where he arrived late Monday and will stay until
Wednesday morning. In Colebrook, he poured coffee for people in a
diner and stopped to help a local shopkeeper wash the windows of
her store.
</P>
<P>
   Although his education speech, delivered to a meeting of the
Northern White Mountain Chamber of Commerce, included some tough
talk about guns, gun control advocates noted that Bush's record on
firearms in Texas included signing into law a measure that enabled
people to carry concealed handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Bush advocated increased federal spending for more
prosecutors to crack down on students who bring guns to schools and
adults who illegally provide children with guns. He also endorsed a
lifetime ban on gun possession for anyone who is convicted of a
violent crime as a juvenile, a proposal that enjoys support even
among some of the most fervent opponents of gun control in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that he wanted increased accountability for about $600
million a year that the federal government distributes to school
districts to help with efforts to prevent drug use and violence.
Additionally, Bush said he would require unsafe schools that fail
to improve to provide students with the option _ and the means _ to
transfer to another school.
</P>
<P>
   To promote discipline in schools, Bush urged legislation to
shield teachers and principals from lawsuits that he said inhibited
them from punishing children who misbehave.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that the final ingredients in restoring order to
schools were character development, including more aggressive
efforts to encourage abstinence, and a relaxing of the strictures
that prevent the commingling of public education and religious
expression.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Education experts said that while there were worthy
recommendations in Bush's remarks, there were also vague,
unrealistic expectations and manipulations of the truth that
amounted to pandering.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Jennings, director of the Center on Educational Policy, a
nonpartisan advocacy group in Washington, D.C., said that Bush's
assertion that religion is suffocated in schools is an
overstatement designed to curry favor with religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings also questioned how schools were supposed to become the
cultivators of children's character on top of all the other
responsibilities that schools shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't do everything,'' Jennings said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush's speech contained distinct echoes of his campaign themes
of compassionate conservatism and ``prosperity with a purpose'' and
tried to hone his image as a Republican more sensitive to racial
diversity and less hostage to partisan thinking.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to both the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat. And he said that
children should be told in no uncertain terms that ``life is too
grand to be wasted on whims and wants, on getting and keeping, that
selfishness is a dark dungeon, that bigotry disfigures the heart.''

BILL WOULD DISCOURAGE COMPANIES FROM DUMPING UNDESIRABLE DRUGS
ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Pa.)   (bl)  
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Legislation was introduced in Congress on Tuesday to discourage
American drug companies from sending donations of unwanted or
inappropriate drugs during world crisis situations.
</P>
<P>
   During the Kosovo crisis, drug companies and relief agencies
worked together to provide badly needed medicine to the hundreds of
thousands of refugees streaming into Albania and Macedonia. But
huge quantities of outdated, unlabeled or inappropriate drugs were
also sent, including items like Chapstick, Preparation H and
anti-smoking inhalers, relief workers reported at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. tax laws provide an incentive for foreign dumping that
must end,'' said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, a member of the House
Ways and Means Committee, who introduced the bill.
</P>
<P>
   American companies receive generous tax deductions for donating
medicines for needy people, including those hit by emergencies like
an earthquake or a war.
</P>
<P>
   Under Doggett's bill, only drugs donated under guidelines
developed by the World Health Organization, which has been a vocal
critic of drug dumping, would be eligible for this deduction.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of unwanted drugs has been a longstanding issue, and
the health organization has estimated that hundreds of tons of
unusable drugs have been sent in response to emergencies. A recent
study by the Harvard School of Public Health concluded that a
significant percentage of donations in recent years in the three
countries studied _ Armenia, Haiti and Tanzania _ were also not
high-priority drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those in need around the world, the dumping of useless
drugs is actually worse than no help at all, since such toxic junk
must be destroyed by the very people requesting help,'' said
Doggett, whose staff said he was prompted to introduce the bill by
an article in The New York Times in June about the problem during
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As much as half of shipments of donated drugs to the region were
inappropriate and likely to take up space in warehouses or have to
be destroyed at considerable expense, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
   Doggett and Rep. William Coyne, D-Pa., have also asked the
General Accounting Office to investigate these donations of drugs
overseas. They want the office to determine whether companies are
now following the guidelines, and how much is being taken annually
by the drug companies in tax deductions for unwanted and
inappropriate drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, which is being supported by 54 House members,
all Democrats, only donations that are sent with adequate labeling
and with a shelf life of at least one year, unless otherwise
requested, and that are donated with the approval of foreign health
workers will be eligible for tax deductions. The IRS would be able
to deny deductions for donations that do not meet these criteria.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is supported by the Partnership for Quality
Medical Donations, an umbrella group of six relief agencies,
including the Catholic Medical Mission Board and AmeriCares, and 11
drug companies, including Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli
Lilly. In October, the partnership said it would endorse the WHO
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The health organization is collecting reports of drug dumping
and says it will make public the identity of any repeat offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really disappointing how high a percentage of donations
do not follow the guidelines,'' said Jonathan Quick, the director
of WHO's essential drug program. ``The more groups that come on
board, the better the situation will be.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Windswept rain will lash the Northeast Coast early Wednesday in
advance of a potent cold front. Onshore winds will gust near 60
miles an hour at many exposed coastal locations, especially in New
England. The rain will end quickly as winds shift and begin to blow
strongly from the southwest. Winds averaging 15 to 30 miles an hour
with higher gusts will prevail for much of day throughout the
Northeastern states as drier and much cooler air spreads from the
interior toward the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Intermittent snow will fall in the cold air from eastern Ontario
to the west slopes of the central Appalachians. Bands of heavier
snow squalls will develop near the eastern shores of Lakes Erie and
Ontario ascold winds gain moisture in passing across the warmer
lake water. The warmth of the lakes will contribute to a mixture of
rain and snow near the immediate shoreline, while several inches of
wet snow is expected to accumulate over parts of the higher terrain
from western New York to northern West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine will be plentiful from the Southeast to the coastal
Middle Atlantic states, however, brisk breezes will add to the
unseasonable chill. Winds will diminish Wednesday night setting the
stage for widespread frost across these regions except near the
immediate coast.
</P>
<P>
   Mild weather with abundant sunshine will cover a very large area
from the Plains through the Rockies and into the Southwestern
states. Meanwhile, a front surrounded by clouds and rain will
approach the Pacific Northwest Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: The Road To Normal &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Grand Junction, Colo., the road to a normal October was paved
with extremes. The average temperature last month was only 0.5
degrees below normal. But, most days were unusually warm and most
nights were uncommonly chilly. Daytime highs averaged 4 degrees
above normal, while nights averaged the 12th coolest since records
began in 1893. Tranquil, sunny days and clear nights led to the
unusually large diurnal temperature range. While monthly averages
are an important tool for climatological comparisons, they can
sometimes mask important weather variations. &QL;

 &HT;    Statistics on Georgia's child poverty 'very bleak'
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More than one-fourth of Georgia's pre-schoolers live
in poverty, despite a healthy economy in the state and nationwide,
according to statistics the U.S. Census Bureau released today.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia ranked 17th highest in the nation for the percentage of
young children living in poverty _ 26 percent. The national average
is 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-schoolers in only four Southern states _ Alabama, Arkansas,
Florida and Louisiana_ were worse off than those in Georgia. Of
Georgia children younger than age 5, almost 150,000 live in
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks very sad. It looks very bleak,'' said Douglas C.
Bachtel, a University of Georgia demographer.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty level for a home with two parents and two children
is less than $16,000. When there is only one parent and two
children, the poverty threshold is $12,600 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A single woman with two kids would have to make about $27,000
to just get basic expenses,'' Bachtel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bunch of things are happening at once,'' said Arloc Sherman,
a researcher with Children's Defense Fund, a Washington-based
non-profit organization that focuses on the needs of children.
``More people are working but the safety net is really being pulled
apart quite rapidly for those unable to work. We're supposed to be
moving toward a society that supports struggling working families,
but we're not doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   While the federal government and virtually every state are
pushing families off Temporary Assistance to Needy Families,
commonly called Welfare, the jobs they are getting do not pay
enough for them to meet most basic needs. Those jobs usually do not
include health care benefits or child care assistance.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, most of the parents of these young children
are young themselves, and lacking job skills. When a child is sick
or parents cannot find affordable and dependable child care, they
usually quit or lose their jobs, costing them any gains they had
made by working, Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just falling through the cracks,`` Sherman said.
``We're at a crossroads. We have a record high proportion of poor
families that are working, but they're still poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia had the largest percentage of
impoverished pre-schoolers at 35 percent, followed closely by
Mississippi and New Mexico at just under 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau numbers _ from 1996, the most recent year
available _ are not Georgia's highest in this decade. The state
peaked at 29 percent in 1993, one of the results of the recession
of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Lee, a spokesman for the Georgia Department of Human
Resources, said there has been an increase in state spending to
help with transportation and child care expenses for families
leaving Welfare for jobs since Georgia began limiting those
benefits to four years. Lee also said the number of families
receiving ``transitional'' Medicaid also had increased from almost
14,000 in 1997 to about 15,000 the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1996, we've been doing a lot to get people established
and to try to get them off Welfare and into jobs and to give them
the support services they need,'' Lee said. ``We've had a good
economy and we've had some real success stories of people who have
gone from Welfare to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all Georgia's children and teenagers younger than 18, almost
22 percent were impoverished, compared to less than 17 percent of
the same age groups nationwide. When adults were factored in, less
than 16 percent of the state's population is struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Child poverty rates nationwide peaked in 1959 when about 27
percent of the country's children were impoverished, just a few
years before then-President Lyndon Johnson designed his ``Great
Society'' programs after visiting desperately poor Appalachian coal
mining communities.
</P>
<P>
   Life is better now, but not by much for some, said Peter Seigel,
a Census Bureau statistician who compiled the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could you do for $16,000 a year?'' Seigel asked. ``Some
places, they're going to bed hungry. Some places they're going to
be cold. And some places they are doing both.''

 &HT;    Panda's presence sure to pack punch at zoo's ticket booth
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's going to be a zoo at Zoo Atlanta _ inside and out
_for the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Starting about Nov. 20, Atlantans and out-of-town tourists will
start lining up by the thousands to see Lun-Lun and Yang-Yang, the
zoo's new baby pandas, which are scheduled to arrive at Hartsfield
International Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   With long lines will come some frustration, on the part of panda
viewers and possibly also the zoo's Grant Park neighbors who must
cope with additional traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo Atlanta marketing director Gail Eaton estimates that 15,000
people will show up for opening day of the panda habitat, three
times the average on a sunny Saturday. Only about a third of those
will get to see the pandas.
</P>
<P>
   Early zoo-goers will receive a stub when they fork over their
money at the front gate, telling them what time to show up at the
panda habitat. When the stubs run out, they run out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come and get in line, so when the zoo gates open, you can get
on in,'' Eaton recommends. ``Latecomers run the risk of seeing the
zoo, but not the pandas.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who get panda stubs will join groups of about 35 people to
be taken through the bears' habitat with a guide. The panda tour is
expected to last seven to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton estimates the pandas will boost attendance by about
250,000 in the first year, about a 20 percent increase, to over 1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Just getting to the zoo could be a problem. Extra Atlanta police
will be on duty on opening day because traffic jams are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo Atlanta has no parking lot of its own; visitors use
adjoining Grant Park lots or city streets, where people also park
to see the Cyclorama or for Grant Park events. At least for the
first day of panda viewing, the zoo will run free shuttle buses
from the gold lots at Turner Field, where parking will be free.
MARTA will run its normal buses to the zoo from West End and Five
Points rail stations.
</P>
<P>
   John Aiken, 51, who lives near the zoo, plans to stock up on
groceries so he doesn't have to fight the traffic on opening day.
``We'll just settle back and watch the crowds,'' he says. ``It's
part of the price you pay for living in Grant Park. It'll probably
be nothing compared to what the folks at Piedmont Park face several
times a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Another zoo neighbor, Joe Wilkins, 49, says: ``Traffic will be
pretty severe that first day, I imagine, but it'll quickly die
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Mia Pond, 53, who also lives near Grant Park, isn't worried. A
member of the zoo who takes her children often to see the animals,
she says she's excited the pandas are coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a zoo,'' she says. ``But we've always been
able to work around things. . . I think we can work around
pandas.''
</P>
<P>
   The zoo's normal hours are 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. every day
except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day, when it's
closed. It won't alter those hours, except to let zoo members in a
half-hour early on some days.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton says: ``What we're hoping is that folks realize they don't
have to come that first day. The pandas are with us by contract for
at least 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowds will be less on weekdays, she advises, but zoo-goers
should still get to the park as early as possible, at least an hour
before closing, to get a shot at the pandas.
</P>
<P>
   Though the zoo has received calls about advance tickets, it
won't be selling any. ``We cannot accomodate any telephone orders
for tickets,'' Eaton says. ``We don't do advance sales. It will be
a first come, first served scenario.''

 &HT;    EDITORIAL: Falling trees can sow seeds of discontent among
voters
 &HT;    By Jim Wooten
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Metro Atlantans want trees in their lives and their
neighborhoods. Rip out the trees and the quality of our lives
diminishes and the threat we feel from development increases.
</P>
<P>
   Every day for weeks, I have driven past the South Cobb County
intersection, feeling the tightening of a world that I don't own
and can't influence. Daily, the forested corner gave way to
bulldozers making way for a new shopping center until there were no
trees left.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club has undertaken a national campaign against
something it calls sprawl. Members prefer that people who live in
suburban areas be persuaded, or coerced if necessary, back toward
the central city. The result is the popularization of ``infill''
development.
</P>
<P>
   Infill development is wonderful when it is taking out ugly,
abandoned warehouses and strip shopping centers, and restoring
run-down areas. But it is highly overrated when the result is that
urban pockets of green are eaten by development.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club's national campaign to compress people into
urban settings to spare surrounding areas does have that one flaw.
Metro Atlanta is livable because of its trees. And yet, literally
hundreds, if not thousands, have been destroyed between my home and
office over the past 18 months for commercial, office and
residential development. The area is now less livable, less
inviting, less the sanctuary from the din of urban activity. This
is good?
</P>
<P>
   The problem, too, is that infill development increases traffic
congestion. Ask people what aggravates them about life in this area
and, invariably, they cite traffic. When this newspaper recently
asked residents of Gwinnett County whether the quality of their
lives had improved, declined or stayed the same over the past five
years, two-thirds said it was the same or better. When asked about
the next five years, 55 percent expected the quality of their lives
to remain the same or improve. The ``will decline'' crowd had risen
by 15 percentage points, from 27 to 42.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what most urgently needs improvement, 49 percent
cited traffic, three times more than the next largest category,
public transportation. But only 8 percent of those polled in
Gwinnett say they are very likely to use the new bus system; 65
percent say it is not likely at all that they'll use it. Clearly,
they want the other guy off the road.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic inhibits the quality of life in metro Atlanta. Infill
makes it worse. It adds delays where none existed. And the loss of
trees and green space increase the feeling that the quality is
deteriorating uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders have launched something they cannot control.
People will not sit in traffic and decide, rationally, that it's
better to take the bus or move into an apartment. They will move
farther out. Or they will rebel against the politicians, state and
local, they believe are worsening the quality of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   In the happy phase of this ``sprawl'' campaign, concepts such as
adventure rail, commuter and high speed, are unconstrained by
practicality, ridership or cost. In the abstract, it is marvelous.
</P>
<P>
   But trees are falling and traffic congestion is not.
Politicians, beware: Those are the seeds of a ballot-box uprising.

 &HT;    No answer for special teams' fall
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In two seasons, Gary Downs had just one carry and four
receptions. So, when the reserve running back was lost for the
season with a knee injury in training camp, it was natural to
assume the Falcons could easily replace him.
</P>
<P>
   But Downs also was the Falcons' best special-teams player. This
season, he has been missed as much on punt and kickoff teams as
injured running back Jamal Anderson has been missed on offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons rank next to last in the NFL in kickoff-return
yardage allowed (28.5 yards per return), third to last in
punt-return average (6.4) and No. 25 in kickoff-return average
(19.6).
</P>
<P>
   Downs was second last year in special-teams tackles and led the
team in 1997. He also was assigned routinely to block the other
team's best cover man and ``almost always took the guy out of the
play,'' special-teams coach Joe DeCamillis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was our best guy, by far,'' DeCamillis said. ``Plus, he had
an attitude. It just hasn't been the same continuity as in the
past. And to be frank, guys just haven't made the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons beat the Panthers 27-20 Sunday, but they had to
sweat because Carolina's Michael Bates returned a kickoff 100 yards
for a touchdown in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The player who was supposed to prevent a return from getting
outside to the Falcons' left, reserve cornerback Keith Thibodeaux,
was waived Tuesday. Thibodeaux's biggest mistake was repeating the
same mistake reserve running back Winslow Oliver made two weeks
earlier on a 101-yard return by the Rams' Tony Horne.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to keep stressing how important it is to stay
outside, regardless of what you see,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``You
have to do your assignment first.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Downs' injury isn't the only one that has hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Return man Tim Dwight, who set a franchise record last season by
averaging 27 yards per kickoff return, missed two games with a
hamstring injury. Dwight is averaging 21 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries to starters have moved some reserves off special teams
and into starting roles. They have been replaced, in some
instances, by rookies or other young players.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has replaced Downs as the emotional leader of special
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Craig Sauer would be a good example of a guy who can do that,
but he's playing defense because (weak-side linebacker Keith)
Brooking is injured,'' DeCamillis said.
</P>
<P>
   The special-teams woes began in the season opener, when Dwight
made three ill-advised returns out of the end zone and fumbled one
away. Also, the Vikings' David Palmer returned a kickoff to
midfield to set up a Minnesota field goal that proved the
difference in a 17-14 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Kicker Morten Andersen missed field goal attempts of 35 and 39
yards in that game. His 33-yard miss in a 19-13 overtime loss to
Baltimore and a 47-yard miss in a 13-9 loss at Pittsburgh changed
the texture of those games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vikings game shook our confidence,'' said DeCamillis,
whose units also have had an inordinate number of penalties. ``It's
just kind of snowballed from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks largely to Dan Stryzinski's sky-high kicks, only 14 of
his 42 punts have been returned, and Atlanta leads the NFL by
allowing just 2.7 yards per punt return.
</P>
<P>
   But the low point might have come on Bates' kickoff return, when
the slightest nudge by Andersen could have pushed Bates out of
bounds. Instead, Andersen flapped a hand weakly against Bates'
helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he could have given a hell of a lot better effort than
that,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons filled Thibodeaux's roster spot with fifth-year
guard Evan Pilgrim, 6 feet 4 and 305 pounds, a former second-round
draft choice of the Bears who was waived by Tennessee during the
summer. Also, the team waived linebacker Lamont Green from the
practice squad and signed linebacker rookie Brian Smith from the
University of Alabama at Birmingham.

PEACE TALKS `REVITALIRING OSLO SUMMIT 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway _ Warmed by the memories of slain Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, President Clinton on Tuesday proclaimed
peace talks ``revitalized'' as Middle East leaders reaffirmed their
desire to end a century of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   After a joint meeting, Clinton said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat agreed to
meet regularly and restrain public comments and actions while their
teams undertake the most difficult phase of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   And, the United States pledged to step up its mediation efforts,
including possibly hosting a summit, if the critical talks
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that we have revitalized the peace process and we've
got the framework talks off to a good start,'' Clinton said before
leaving for Washington following a two-day commemoration of Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiation teams from Israel and the Palestinian Authority open
talks next week to resolve the most difficult outstanding issues
such as the status of Jerusalem, the question of a Palestinian
state, Jewish settlements on occupied lands, prisoners and
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   They plan to craft a framework for an agreement by mid-February
and write a final treaty by September. This phase would complete
the 1993 Oslo Accord in which Israel turned over lands on the West
Bank and Gaza Strip to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said Middle East Envoy Dennis Ross would
make trips to the region every two weeks and that Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright would visit once or twice. If those
initial talks for a framework agreement go well, the United States
may host a final summit in January or February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll all be in high gear between now and then,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The framework talks received a boost from the commemoration
ceremonies hosted by Norway to honor Rabin, whose signature on the
1993 Oslo Accord helped set the path for peace between Israel and
its neighbors. Rabin was assassinated in 1994 by a Jewish extremist
opposed to the Oslo agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have now a chance, but only a chance, to bring real and
lasting peace between Israel and her neighbors,'' Clinton said.
``If we let it slip away, all will bear the consequences: Israel
still trapped within a circle of hostility; the Palestinians still
saddled with poverty and frustration and pain; and their Arab
neighbors wrapped in an endless and pointless cycle of conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In the emotional ceremony in memory of Rabin, marked by many
quotations from Walt Whitman's ``Oh, Captain! My Captain!`` Barak
reassured the international community he intended to pursue his
mentor's path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I vow to you, Yitzhak, a soldier who fell in the battle for
peace, that we as the head of the new government of Israel are
determined to give your death the meaning by following your legacy
until we achieve peace,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My government is determined to strengthen Israel and to bring
prosperity to the region by putting an end to the century of
conflict between Israel and its neighbors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from the Middle East, Russia and the United
States joined Leah Rabin, the prime miniwidow, and Norwegian
officials, including King Harald, in the ornate Oslo City Hall
where Nobel Peace Prizes are awarded. Rabin, Arafat and Shimon
Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, shared the 1995 peace prize.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat dipped his head toward a giant photograph of Rabin and
snapped a salute before beginning his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``From this beautiful city and on this occasion, I would like to
extend my hand once again to our Israeli neighbors and to my new
partner, Prime Minister Barak, and to tell them: Let us continue
together through re-partnership to make the peace of the brave. Let
us put an end in practice to decades of enmity, wars, occupation,
eviction and exile,'' Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat also warned of the continued expansion of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Barak's government has
allowed some expansion to continue as had his predecessor, Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel great concern over the destructive dangers posed by
the Israeli policy of settlements to the peace process. It had
reached very dangerous dimensions under the Netanyahu government,''
Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerusalem Post reported in its Tuesday editions that Barak
outlined to Clinton the four areas that Israel considered
non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   Those items were: keeping Jerusalem as Israel's capitol; keeping
most settlements under Israeli sovereignty, retaining its borders
established after the 1967 war; and rejecting any foreign army west
of the Jordan River.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat also claims Jerusalem as the capitol of an independent
Palestinian state, and he reaffirmed his position in Norway.
</P>
<P>
   After the Rabin ceremonies, Clinton met with Barak and Arafat as
they outlined their positions in preparation for the final phase of
the talks that began in secret more than six years ago in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said the ``spirit of Rabin''
helped Barak and Arafat focus on the task at hand. He referred to a
``new spirit'' and a ``renewed awareness'' of the stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a real sense of history there,'' the official said.

REAGAN BIOGRAPHY BALANCES PRESIDENT'S BEFUDDLEMENT AND BRILLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few minutes into PBS's ``The American Experience'' documentary
on Ronald Reagan, the former president's funny, intuitive son Ron
faced the TV screen and cautioned: ``Don't ever try to figure him
out. Nobody has.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan'' is the product of a 14-year
effort by Edmund Morris, courted and recruited as Reagan's
authorized biographer. Between 1985 and 1988, Morris was given
selective but close access to a man with whom nobody was really
close.
</P>
<P>
   The book is filled with contradictory judgments in Morris'
struggle to come to terms with America's 41st president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dutch'' delivers devastating assessments of Reagan's lack of
curiosity, his absence of intellectual energy and his passive
tendency to take direction. The president of the United States
mused about Armageddon and told stories in which he confused
Hollywood plots with real life.
</P>
<P>
   But the man had a clear set of core beliefs. Reagan came through
when the chips were down. Most notable was his refusal, at the
Reykjavik summit with Mikhail Gorbachev, to abandon America's
strategic defense initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing metaphors, an aide to Soviet foreign minister Eduard
Shevardnadze wrote of Reagan: ``Suddenly he flare up, crisp,
engaged. When you touch raw nerve, Reagan's flare will fill the
room. He feel something close to his heart, he is like lion!''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan could be painfully considerate. At his 1985 summit with
Gorbachev in Geneva, with the fate of the world on the table,
Reagan fretted over a dead goldfish. The fish in question belonged
to Hussain Aga Khan, son of Prince Karim Aga Khan, at whose
lakeside villa the president was staying.
</P>
<P>
   In a note to the boy, Reagan explained that he had fed the
goldfish as instructed. ``On Tuesday, I found one of your fish dead
at the bottom of the tank,'' wrote the president of the United
States. ``I don't know what could have happened, but I added two
new ones (same kind). I hope this was alright.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this was a man who could not remember the names of his own
Cabinet members. Aides worked tirelessly, businessmen devoted their
fortunes to getting him elected, but received no reciprocating
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Eye-opening stories were told to Morris during Reagan's last
month as president. Holmes Tuttle was a wealthy Los Angeles auto
dealer who helped put Reagan in the White House and wanted to sleep
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all these years,'' he tells Morris, ``I've never asked but
one thing of Ronnie. And that was for my wife and I to spend but
one night in the Lincoln Bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle reminds them over eight years. The offer finally comes
through after the 1988 election. Tuttle's hand shakes with anger.
``I said no thanks. It's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   About to become president, George Bush shakes his head at the
man he is about to succeed. He hints at the Gipper's famously
dysfunctional family. When the Reagans went to spend a weekend at
Camp David, they ``never took their kids with them. Bar and me,
we'd go crazy if we found ourselves up there without a whole bunch
of family runnin' around.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, in perhaps Morris' finest bit of reporting, Bush
disses his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, he was a prince of a feller, I'd never say anything
against him. Nancy neither ...'' begins Bush, pausing to exchange
glances with his wife. ``Well, sometimes, I kinda wished they'd
shown _ y'know, a little appreciation. Didn't seem to want us
upstairs in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Oblivious to many of life's details _ even vitally important
details about the budget and economy _ Reagan held to his core
beliefs. He insisted on cutting taxes while ordering the largest
peacetime defense buildup in America's history.
</P>
<P>
   What resulted was a trillion-dollar buildup of the national
debt, more red ink than the nation had piled up in its previous 204
years. ``Yet, such is the man's logic of economics, he also
initiated the greatest sustained peacetime boom since the founding
of the Republic,'' Morris writes.
</P>
<P>
   The most important core belief, of course, was Reagan's sense of
a universal human yearning for both economic and personal freedom.
Hence, communism was always an artificial and imposed system of
government. The Soviet Union was ``an evil empire,'' dependent on
force, because its subjects would grasp at the chance to break
free.
</P>
<P>
   How right he was. Lampooned as naive, Reagan governed from one
of the century's great insights: Sustained pressure of military and
economic competition would bring down the rotting edifice of
Bolshevism.
</P>
<P>
   Morris tells parts of the Reagan story brilliantly. Elsewhere,
``Dutch'' trips over its own central literary device. The device is
what Morris calls ``semifiction.'' He creates a fictional
character, modeled after Morris, who runs into Reagan repeatedly
through life. According to Random House's Web site, Morris'
``biographical mind becomes in effect another character in the
narrative.''
</P>
<P>
   As a lifeguard, Reagan rescues this person. At another time, the
fictional Morris reports to a young Lt. Reagan while serving in the
Army Air Force. He writes movie scripts in the 1940s, and in the
1950s works for a trade group Reagan is addressing. The character
even has a fictitious son named Gavin who participates in 1960s
Berkeley free-speech confrontations with California Gov. Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The device can be distracting and annoying. ``Gavin Morris''
takes up pages that should be devoted to Reagan's political rise,
and his willingness as governor to accommodate causes ranging from
environmentalism to legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, Morris clicks. ``Dutch'' is at its best in its
close-up examination of Reagan's transformation from a 1940s
Hollywood liberal to a reborn conservative a decade later. It was a
tough time in Reagan's life. He was seriously ill. A baby by wife
Jane Wyman died soon after birth. Soon after that, Wyman divorced
Reagan and labeled him a bore. As president of the Screen Actors
Guild, meanwhile, Reagan clashed with doctrinaire communists
seeking to gain control of the union.
</P>
<P>
   The experiences left Reagan a far more somber man, suspicious of
big government, an apostle of self-reliance, and married to a
second wife of tenacity and total devotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dutch'' is on mark in recounting Reagan's moving public
performances as president. The physical vitality of the man comes
across again and again, memorably in a scene where an iron-pumping
75-year-old Reagan boasts of his 44-inch chest. Robustness saves
him from John Hinckley's bullet. ``I have never in my life seen a
chest like that on a man his age,'' the operating physician told
Reagan aide Michael Deaver.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Morris fails to clearly explain how Reagan connected with
the American people, and how somebody so oblivious to so much
succeeded as a leader. He badly shortchanges Reagan's presidential
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dutch'' is a fascinating, not-always-successful book. In
trying to figure out Reagan, Morris has taken on a challenge that
has defeated the man's own children as well as the world leaders
who dealt with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What planet is he living on?'' France's President Francois
Mitterrand asked at one summit, after hearing Reagan tell a
Hollywood story. But the cerebral, canny French socialist studied
Reagan and, writes Morris, ``decided that he liked him _ with
reservations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man without ideas and without culture,'' Mitterrand
told Germany's Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. ``A sort of liberal, for
sure, but beneath the surface you find someone who isn't stupid,
who has great good sense and profoundly good intentions. What he
does not perceive with his intelligence, he feels by nature.''

 &HT;    FAILED FEDERAL CONTRACTOR HAD CRIMINAL RECORD

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An Atlanta real estate company that was recently
fired for mishandling federally owned properties in more than 20
states is headed by a convicted felon whose past includes a string
of bankruptcies, Georgia state records show.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that history, Melton L. Harrell and his company, InTown
Properties Inc., won a contract last March from the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to manage and market $367
million in homes that the government had acquired through
foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   By the time HUD pulled the plug on InTown six months later, it
said the company had sold fewer than 2,300 of the 25,000 homes. The
logjam cost taxpayers millions of dollars, created delays for
buyers and left contractors in the lurch across the country in
states including Georgia, New York, Ohio, North Carolina and the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   InTown filed for bankruptcy protection in Atlanta on Sept. 22,
the same day that HUD terminated its contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``HUD sets tough standards for its contractors as part of our
effort to wipe out waste, fraud and abuse involving our funds,''
HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo said in announcing the cancelation.
``When contractors fail to meet our standards, we replace them.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Harrell's record raises questions about how well the
department checked his background before giving his company the
biggest contract of its kind in the country. Stephen Carberry,
chief procurement officer for HUD, said Tuesday that his office was
unaware of the criminal record when he approved the InTown contract
early this year.
</P>
<P>
   He said that felony convictions do not bar a contractor from
doing business with the federal government. ``I'm not sure what we
would have done,'' if HUD had known about them, Carberry said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell served in prison and in a halfway house in Georgia from
1975-78 on four forgery charges. Georgia court records show that
during the same period he also pled no contest to charges of theft
by taking, another felony.
</P>
<P>
   Carberry said he was also unaware that Harrell had been
affiliated with more than a dozen companies and partnerships that
filed for bankruptcy court protection in Atlanta between 1987 and
1990, according to Georgia court records.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those failed companies invested in apartment complexes
which later ended in foreclosure. Harrell filed for personal
bankruptcy in 1989 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Neither InTown officials nor Harrell returned calls from
reporters. Harrell's wife Deborah, who reached her husband while he
was traveling, passed along a message from him, saying that ``HUD
has not behaved properly.'' He promised more detailed comments
later, she told a reporter Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, InTown has bought derelict properties for
renovation in various cities and worked under a number of contracts
with HUD. Harrell's Atlanta headquarters continues to operate
several hotels in the Valu-Lodge chain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 one of his real estate companies was the subject of
negative news reports and commentaries when it informed some
tenants they would have to pay $3,000 a month during the Atlanta
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   HUD's selection of InTown has come under fire from government
investigators. A House Government Reform subcommittee hearing set
for Wednesday is was expected to criticize Clinton administration
officials for their role in the contracting program.
</P>
<P>
   However, Carberry defended the department. ``All of the federal
government requirements were followed in this case,'' he said.
Checks into Harrell's two dozens previous contracts with HUD came
up with no blemish, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carberry said that procedures do not call for criminal
background checks. He added that his department had been unaware of
past bankruptcies, which were filed under a variety of company
names.
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials also blamed Harrell's two partners, an
auctioneering company in Denver, and an accounting firm in Phoenix,
for failing to play a bigger role in the InTown project.
</P>
<P>
   The housing department's inspector general has issued a scathing
report questioning whether federal officials had adequately checked
InTown's financial capacity to handle so many properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff indicated these considerations were discussed and it
was determined that Intown (sic) had sufficient financing to manage
these contracts,'' the inspector general auditors said on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the inspector general charged that HUD had failed to
``adequately document or evaluate basic business decisions'' before
signing contracts with InTown and six other real estate management
companies. The seven companies were charged with disposing of
approximately $1 billion in foreclosed properties over five years.

<P>
   Edmund Morris won a Pulitzer Prize for his book ``The Rise of
Theodore Roosevelt,'' about an intellectually insatiable leader who
penned books, loved argument, held his ground with experts in
multiple scientific fields and aggressively propelled America into
a 20th-century world power.
</P>
<P>
   While working on his second Roosevelt book, Morris found himself
diverted to become the official biographer of Ronald Reagan, a
president who was ``incommunicable'' when challenged and long ago
abandoned intellectual inquiry in favor of reiterating old
certainties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like visiting the other side of the moon,
intellectually,'' Morris said in an interview. He was to spend 14
years grappling with the multiple careers, mysteries and
contradictions of the country's 40th president.
</P>
<P>
   Morris says he went ``as far as I could possibly have gone'' in
understanding his subject. He followed Reagan through a half-dozen
careers _ sportscaster, actor, union executive, corporate
spokesman, two-term governor and president of the United States _
but found him ``opaque and unaffected'' by the experiences. ``He
was what he was for as long as each production lasted,'' Morris
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reagan was very intelligent in an instinctual way,'' Morris
added. ``He wasn't intelligent like Theodore Roosevelt, who debated
in his mind what to do. Culturally, he was a yahoo.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' Morris ended up
inserting himself at various places in Reagan's early life, in
order to give readers a better sense of the man. The author, born
in 1940, invented a fictional ``Edmund Morris'' and even gave the
character a son, Gavin, who witnesses Reagan's confrontations with
student radicals as governor of California in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dutch'' has been used as critical target by both Reagan
hagiographers and Reagan haters. The book has been eviscerated by
Nancy Reagan's longtime literary lap dog, columnist George F. Will,
but celebrated by the president's son, Ron Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Morris was, in a sense, in enemy territory as he talked about
Reagan over lunch in downtown Seattle. The Emerald City never
warmed to the one-time actor whose best known role was as a running
back for the Fighting Irish.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle practiced its own foreign policy during the Reagan
years. The city supported the nuclear freeze movement. Its
Episcopal cathedral dispatched peace delegations to Tashkent,
Seattle's Soviet sister city. The city's Catholic archbishop
decried the nearby Trident nuclear submarine base as ``the
Auschwitz of Puget Sound.'' In 1984, sweeping to re-election with
nearly 60 percent of the vote, Reagan took only 40 percent of
Seattle's ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Reagan ever connect with Washington state. In a famous
speech, the president referred to then-Republican State Chairwoman
Jennifer Dunn as ``Dunn Jennifer'' _ even though Dunn was a
ferocious loyalist who named one of her sons Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Should those who hurled hyperbole at Reagan in the early 1980s
eat their words today? Morris gently suggests that the doctrinaire
liberals of Seattle might give the man his greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was intellectually honest, I would have to accept that
all things I feared and disliked about Ronald Reagan turned out to
be benign,'' Morris argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did reduce the nuclear threat, in contrast to those who
protested NATO's deployment of missiles in Europe. He did bring
about destruction of the biggest totalitarian power in human
history. He did improve American life. He did restore the American
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Morris, however, there is much for which
doctrinaire conservatives must come to terms. There is Reagan's
``total lack of self-analysis or curiosity into other human
beings.'' Even George and Barbara Bush seethed about being treated
like ``the help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Reagan had a ruthless lack of regard for the personal
feelings of his aides,'' Morris said. ``All the favor he had to
show them was to appoint them. ... If they resigned, they became
superfluous. They immediately vanished from memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris cites the example of master image-maker Michael Deaver,
who worked for Reagan most of his adult life, but ``became a
stranger virtually overnight'' when he left the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The South African-born Morris has found himself dueling with the
diehards. Ex-Reagan aides are a curious breed. They've filled
memoirs with derogatory observations about his detached presidency.
After explaining how she put words in the Gipper's mouth,
speechwriter Peggy Noonan likened Reagan's role in his
administration to a giant balloon hovering over Macy's Thanksgiving
parade.
</P>
<P>
   When Reagan's lack of intellectual energy was described in
``Dutch,'' however, Noonan penned a wicked review describing
Morris' book as ``this high dive, belly-flop into the pools of
Narcissus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all political ideologues,'' Morris said in the
interview. ``And they are disconcerted by a literary book.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, it was a Northwesterner _ Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield _
who gave impetus to Morris' project. Hatfield, one of the Senate's
last liberal Republicans, felt it vital that a historian have a
close-up view of Reagan's presidency. He hosted a dinner party that
brought Ronald and Nancy together with Morris and several other
historians.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Reagan was fascinated with the idea from its inception.
Not so her husband. Even before stricken with Alzheimer's disease,
Ronald Reagan was one American president not obsessed with getting
his proper place in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could not care less what I or any other writer thought
about his place in history,'' Morris said. ``What he was concerned
with was bringing about things he believed in.''

 &HT;    Dell comes up with solution for Brazilian logjam
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It is potentially one of the biggest personal
computing markets in the world, with South America's biggest
economy and a population keenly interested in the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But the world's No. 2 computer maker was at a disadvantage in
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   While its biggest competitors had plants in the country, Dell
Computer Corp. was virtually closed out by of expensive government
tariffs that would nearly double the price of a typical machine.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Dell officially unveils its solution.
</P>
<P>
   With Michael Dell and government and business leaders in
attendance, the company this morning plans to open its sixth
overseas plant in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre.
</P>
<P>
   The plant _ its first in South America _ is part of a global and
Internet expansion plan that Dell officials believe could add about
$40 billion in revenue over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   The move, primed with undisclosed financial concessions by the
Rio Grande do Sul state government, also underscores the leverage
of punitive tariffs on importing finished goods into Brazil. Those
tariffs, designed to lure manufacturers to Brazil, would have
nearly doubled the price of an imported $1,000 PC, said Daryl
Robertson, general manager for Dell's Latin American operations.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Michael Dell, who on Tuesday was making the
17-hour trip _ including layovers _ to Brazil, said in a statement
that the region is a ``phenomenal opportunity'' for Dell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rio Grande do Sul is an excellent base of operations because
of its sophisticated labor force, its economic incentives to
attract technology-manufacturing companies to the region, and its
strategic location as an export hub to other South American
countries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to incentives offered by the state, the area was
chosen because of its proximity to other members of Mercosur, the
open-trade alliance of Brazil and neighboring Uruguay, Paraguay and
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said it will expand into Mercosur countries in the next
year. Chile, on South America's West Coast, is expected to be added
to the group in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This factory is in the heart of Mercosur,'' said Rosental
Alves. The former executive editor at one of Brazil's leading
newspapers, Jornalou du Brasil, Alves holds the Knight Chair in
Journalism at the University of Texas. ``Dell is going to a market
that is very big.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Anavitarte, an analyst with the Dataquest Inc. research
group, said only 1 percent of the 480 million people in Latin
America own computers. But PC sales are expected to grow 22 percent
this year, vs. 10 percent in 1998, as prices tumble and the
Internet exerts its global pull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very clearly, when Dell decided to open the plant, they bet on
the Latin American market,'' Anavitarte said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company's short-term goals for Brazil are relatively
modest by Dell's historic growth standards. For now, the 200
employees at a temporary factory will make only the Dimension and
OptiPlex lines, desktops for consumers and small businesses and
corporate accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is planning a permanent factory nearby,
conservatively projects employment of 250 within the year.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Dell's launched its Dimension manufacturing and
customer-support facility this summer near Nashville, Tenn., with
nearly 1,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is going into Brazil at a time when the country's economy
is on the mend. Brazil was hurt last year after Russia defaulted on
international loans. Investors withdrew $30 billion from Brazil in
August and September 1998, forcing the government to spend billions
to support the currency, the Real. Fiscal reforms and an
international loan of $41.5 billion have at least slowed the
decline of the growth in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   And while Brazil dominates Latin American economies, it remains
a relatively poor country. Dell will focus initially on selling
computers to the offices of global companies it serves in other
countries as well as the consumer market, said Robertson, Dell's
general manager for Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Dell will battle its familiar U.S. competitors for Brazil's PC
sales, including Compaq Computer Corp., IBM and Hewlett-Packard Co.
Compaq, the No. 1 worldwide PC maker, leads in Brazil with 13
percent of the market, according to Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   But like other international markets, Brazil also has strong
local PC makers. Companies like Itautec and UIS account for more
than half of Brazil's PC sales, according to a U.S. State
Department report.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a sizable ``gray'' market of small clone makers
uses smuggled components to undercut prices of mainstream makers,
Anavitarte and others say.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said Dell is not worried about those businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will target customers that value service and support,'' he
said.

SKEPTICAL JUSTICES QUESTION POLICE RIGHT TO CHASE PEOPLE WHO FLEE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An intensely skeptical Supreme Court on Tuesday
questioned whether the Constitution allows police in high-crime
areas to stop and frisk people simply because they run upon seeing
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the court's moderate and liberal justices indicated
some unease with the proposition, made by government attorneys,
that police should have wide discretion to chase down people who
run from them.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives on the court, however, showed disdain for the
counter argument of a defense attorney that police need more than a
panicked scamper to suspect that a fleeing person has either
committed or plans to commit a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong argument at the high court pit the interest of law
enforcement against the Fourth Amendment right of people to be free
from unreasonable searches. The justices are expected to render
their decision in the case, Illinois vs. Wardlow, by July.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois Supreme Court, in ruling against the police last
year, said Sam Wardlow's decision to run from Chicago officers did
not give them sufficient reason under the Constitution to suspect
him of having committed a crime or to frisk him. The 1995 search
uncovered a firearm and led to Wardlow's conviction for unlawful
gun possession and a two-year prison sentence, which the Illinois
high court overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Richard Devine, pressing Illinois' appeal of that
decision, urged the justices to give police broad constitutional
leeway to chase people who flee. Police can reasonably suspect that
someone who runs upon seeing them, without any other provocation
from the officers, has violated the law or plans to participate in
wrongdoing, argued Devine, state's attorney for Cook County, Ill.,
which includes Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flight (from police) has historically been related to illegal
activity,'' Devine said in urging the justices to rule that the
officers acted constitutionally in chasing Wardlow. ``Flight is so
inherently suspicious'' that a police officer would be negligent in
not giving chase, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice John Paul Stevens interjected that not everyone who
runs from police fears being arrested. He asked rhetorically
whether officers could reasonably suspect someone of wrongdoing
when he or she is running from police while wearing running shoes
and dribbling a basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter also appeared unconvinced, as he
expressed concern that Devine's view would allow police to storm a
neighborhood in force and simply round up everyone who scampered
away. Many of the people might bolt from the area not because they
did anything illegal but because they feared gun play might ensue
due to the massive police presence, Souter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How high is the risk that innocents are going to be stopped''
by the police, the justice said. ``Anyone in his right mind is
going to want to get out of the way fast.''
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Antonin Scalia, in an apparent show of support for
allowing police great constitutional latitude, disagreed with
Souter's view of human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience is just the opposite,'' Scalia said, referring
to how people react when officers arrive. ``The police have to keep
the crowd back.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the justices, Devine said the demands of law
enforcement require that police be permitted to at least stop
people who scamper upon seeing them. Barring officers from giving
chase ``would prevent police from doing the job we want them to
do,'' which is prevent crime, Devine argued.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia, in apparent agreement, said he supports the
law-enforcement tactic of approaching a suspect for the sole
purpose of seeing if that person runs away in panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would seem to be pretty good police practice,'' Scalia
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Stephen G. Breyer expressed concern that race too
often plays a part in law enforcement. The justice said black
residents might run from a white officer based on historic fears of
intimidation, not because they did anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Devine responded that white officers should be free to give
chase but that black suspects might have a civil-rights claim or
even a criminal complaint against police who engage in racial
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart, pressing the
Clinton administration's support for law enforcement, also argued
that police can reasonably suspect that someone running from them
has committed or plans to commit a crime. Innocent people generally
do not run from the police, he said.

BOOK REVIVES ISSUE OF PIUS XII AND THE HOLOCAUST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The debate over the conduct of Pope Pius XII during World
War II has lasted far longer than either the war or his 19-year
papacy.
</P>
<P>
   Accused by critics of remaining shamefully silent during the
Holocaust, Pius XII is revered by many Roman Catholics as quite
literally a saint. His cause for beatification, the penultimate
step before sainthood, is still on course.
</P>
<P>
   But a new and scalding biography, ``Hitler's Pope: The Secret
History of Pius XII'' (Viking Press), by the British journalist
John Cornwell, has revived public scrutiny of the wartime leader of
the Catholic Church. The intensity of the dispute, moreover, has
led many Jewish leaders and even some Catholic scholars to question
the Vatican's decision to make him a candidate for sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   At a Vatican-sponsored interfaith meeting last month, Jewish
representatives said they had been privately informed by Vatican
officials that Pope John XXIII, whose Second Vatican Council in the
early 1960s rid church doctrine of the notion that Jews were
collectively responsible for the death of Christ, is to be
beatified next year. The leaders said they had been told that the
cause of Pius XII, however, would not be ready in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jewish organizations viewed the disclosure as a sign that
their lobbying had paid off. But the implication that the Holy See
is delaying the beatification of Pius XII to appease Jewish
concerns is resented by many Vatican officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beatification of Pius XII will not take place in the year
2000 because we have not completed the preparatory work, but that
does not mean it has been slowed or stopped,'' said the Rev. Peter
Gumpel, a Jesuit who has been researching the cause of Pius XII for
the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Jewish and Catholic leaders alike have warned that
the beatification of Pius XII could harm reconciliation efforts
begun during Vatican II and cemented by the current pope, John Paul
II. Now, some religious leaders say they fear that a perception
that the beatification was halted for political reasons could also
impede reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constant condemnation of Pius XII is causing a Catholic
backlash that can impede Catholic-Jewish relations,'' said Rabbi
Jack Bemporad, the director of the New Jersey-based Center for
Interfaith Understanding, who attended the Vatican interfaith
assembly. ``It is obscuring the substance of what has been
achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials have confirmed that John XXIII, but not Pius
XII, will be beatified next year, but insist that neither Jewish
criticism nor Cornwell's unflattering biography affected the
schedule. They explain that while both processes were begun in
1965, John XXIII's papacy lasted less than five years, and involves
less paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II ``is not one to bend to outside pressure,'' said
the Rev. Pierre Blet, a Jesuit who helped compile an 11-volume
collection of Vatican documents from World War II and wrote his
own, less incendiary biography of Pius XII.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell's book was written for a mass audience, and its more
sensational arguments _ Pius XII, who was pope from 1939 until his
death in 1958, is painted as a lifelong anti-Semite _ have helped
make it a best-seller.
</P>
<P>
   But the book has infuriated Vatican officials, who say it is an
unjust portrait. Some reviewers have argued that Cornwell squeezed
the facts to fit his thesis that Pius XII could and should have
spoken out against Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   America, a Catholic national weekly magazine edited by Jesuits,
concluded that Cornwell's book ``fails as a work of historical
scholarship.'' But its editors also stated that because of the
lingering questions, beatification of Pius XII ``at this time would
be inopportune.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, however, the challenge to Cornwell's scholarship is
being led by Gumpel, a respected church historian who also happens
to be in charge of Pius XII's beatification process.
</P>
<P>
   Gumpel is the ``relator'' of the beatification cause, which the
Vatican defines as an investigating judge. The Vatican revised its
rules on canonization in 1983, eliminating the role of the Promoter
of the Faith, commonly known as the ``devil's advocate.'' Gumpel
explained that it was his duty to present even damning information.
But so far, he insists, he has found none.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell has thrown himself into the process, saying in an
interview, ``I suppose I am the devil's advocate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell makes much of a letter sent to the Vatican by Pius XII
in 1919, when he was Bishop Eugenio Pacelli and papal nuncio in
Munich, that reports on his deputy's unpleasant encounter with
Bolshevik revolutionaries who were then terrorizing Catholic
priests and the German bourgeoisie. The letter describes the
leader, Max Lieven, as ``a young man, of about 30 or 35, also
Russian and a Jew. Pale, dirty, with drugged eyes, hoarse voice,
repulsive, with a face that is both intelligent and sly.'' The
letter also describes Lieven's companions, ``a gang of young women,
of dubious appearance, Jews like the rest of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell said he was the first person to find the document
buried in Vatican archives. Gumpel, however, found a full
transcript of the same letter in a 1992 biography of Pius XII by
Emma Fattorini. Cornwell said he was unaware of it when he made his
claim, but added that the letter's existence only underscored the
Vatican's refusal to examine Pius XII's failings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they knew about this, then shame on them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell has told interviewers that the letter left him in a
state of ``moral shock.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the letter, however, has not shocked other scholars,
who note that Pacelli's description of Communist Jews, while not
especially enlightened, was hardly uncommon 80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are Jewish scholars who dispute Cornwell's thesis. But
they also reject the Vatican view of Pius XII.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pius XII was not an anti-Semite,'' Bemporad said. ``He didn't
publicly protest the deportation of Jews, but he also didn't speak
out against the slaughter of Catholic priests in Poland. He
believed it was more prudent and effective to be quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he added: ``I understand that the Vatican feels
that Pius XII is unjustly criticized and should be defended. But
why canonize him? I believe that Pope Pius XII did things that were
helpful to Jews, but I don't think one can argue that he did it in
a heroic way.''
</P>
<P>
   Pius XII never publicly condemned the Nazis for their
persecution of Jews, though he did denounce atrocities committed
against people ``sometimes only by reason of their nationality or
race'' in a 1942 address. When the Nazis began rounding up Italian
Jews, the pope instructed Catholic churches, schools, convents and
monasteries to harbor them. Many Jews were given refuge inside the
Vatican itself.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is hyperbole on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that by his unpardonable silence, Pius XII was
indirectly responsible for the deaths of millions upon millions of
Jews,'' said Rabbi Henry Sobel, a director of the Latin American
Jewish Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gumpel and other Vatican officials, however, insist that Pius
XII was responsible for saving as many as 850,000 Jews, citing a
calculation made in 1967 by Pinchas Lapide, an Israeli historian.
Those figures have not been verified. ``They haven't been proven,
but nobody has showed the reverse,'' Blet said, explaining why he
had cited the figure in his biography.
</P>
<P>
   The deep disconnect over Pius XII's record mirrors other
disputes between Vatican and Jewish leaders. When John Paul II in
1998 issued his ``We Remember: A Reflection on The Shoah,'' a
document that apologized for the failure of many Catholics to save
Jews during the Holocaust, Vatican officials viewed as a
groundbreaking gesture. Many Jewish groups said they were
disappointed by the final draft, which praised Pius XII's ``quiet
diplomacy'' and did not criticize his failure to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   The Simon Wiesenthal Center and World Jewish Congress have
charged that not all the pertinent Vatican records relating to Pius
XII have been disclosed. Last year, the Israeli ambassador to the
Holy See publicly implored the Vatican to put the beatification
aside for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to deflect criticism that the church is withholding
relevant material, the Vatican announced last month the formation
of a team of Jewish and Catholic scholars to examine jointly the 11
volumes of documents that the Vatican released between 1965 and
1981. But they have not yet decided whether those scholars should
also be allowed to examine unpublished documents. That has only
fueled complaints that the Vatican is unwilling to bare all its
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Pius XII is often cast as a battle between the
Vatican and Jewish groups. But Vatican watchers also stress the
internal politics of beatification. They cast Pius XII, who did
much to consolidate the power of the papacy, as a candidate of
Vatican conservatives who want to balance the beatification of John
XXIII, who is revered by more liberal Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Gumpel said his only criterion in his investigation was whether
Pius XII lived ``the theological virtues to a heroic or outstanding
degree,'' one of the official conditions for sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever would come to the conclusion that the cause of Pius
XII does not merit to be pursued, I will say so,'' he said. ``But
after having studied more than 100,000 documents written by him and
written on him, so far I really have come to the conclusion that
there is nothing against the cause. And, on the contrary, I agree
that the man merits to be beatified.''

MICROSOFT WANTS SHAREHOLDERS TO BE WATCHDOGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Microsoft Corp. is onto something other companies may
want to emulate.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is encouraging shareholder activism, but not the sort
that invites more scrutiny of the company's affairs. Rather,
Microsoft wants its shareholders to take a more active role in
protecting company interests in the government arena.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, Microsoft has sent a letter to its stockholders
urging support against government meddling that ``could choke off
innovation and threaten the continued vitality of our industry as a
whole.'' The letter invites Microsoft investors to join the Freedom
to Innovate Network, whose members are encouraged to write Congress
and speak out in their communities concerning Information Age
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's move won't affect the outcome of its antitrust
trial, because a ruling is expected soon. Moreover, the letter
doesn't mention the pending outcome of the legal showdown between
government and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, observers say that while it won't influence what's
happening in court, it does have the potential to influence future
Capitol Hill debate on information technology issues. Microsoft
says it's pursuing this effort because it doesn't want its
stakeholders ``left out of this debate.''
</P>
<P>
   This includes customers and business partners as well as
Microsoft investors. Over the past year, Microsoft has quietly gone
about building a large, well-funded network operated almost
entirely on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In what promises to be a surefire bet to strengthen the network
even further, Microsoft recently teamed up with the National
Federation of Independent Business. The federation is a
small-business advocacy organization numbering about 600,000
members. It has built a reputation as a scrappy lobbying force that
has made it something of a junkyard dog in federal and state
legislative affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it's estimated that some 50,000 people have joined
the Freedom to Innovate Network, and Microsoft says its Web site
has gotten ``hundreds of thousands of hits.''
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of worker capitalism as more individuals become
involved in the stock market, Microsoft could be creating a model
that will revolutionize economic policy-making.
</P>
<P>
   Government traditionally has been perceived by Americans as
their watchdog. If, however, business leaders can create an
awareness of how misguided tax and regulatory policy works against
the best interests of workers as investors, legislative priorities
can't help but be changed.
</P>
<P>
   For most of Microsoft's history, the company ignored the need to
play the political schmooze game with powerful pols and
bureaucrats. This left it vulnerable to targeting by trustbusters,
with scant support in congressional circles to counter the
subsequent legal attack.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has proved a quick study, though. In addition to its
other efforts, it not only has expanded its Washington lobbying
staff but also hired lobbyists to work the corridors of most of the
state's capitols, according to The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Adding lobbyists is standard stuff, but Microsoft's bid to
create an army of activist shareholders to help fight the company's
political battles seems a seminal event in U.S. business history.

AN AFRICAN POLITICAL WOMAN GOES FROM IVORY TOWER TO STREET
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The term ivoirite in the 12th graf properly takes an accent
ague over the ``e''.)  (fb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ The often-told story about Henriette
Diabate went like this: The woman with the impeccably proper
upbringing once lost an election because instead of making sure
that the ballots were being counted properly after a long day she
daintily went home to take a bath.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a legend,'' Diabate said recently, describing the story
as a crude attempt to discredit the rarity of rarities: a female
African political leader. ``But the legend survives.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not for much longer. As a political crisis has deepened in
this West African nation in the last two weeks, the 64-year-old
Diabate _ mother of this country's main opposition party, mother of
five children, grandmother to six _ has emerged as a central
figure.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the head of her party overseas, Diabate led followers
through the streets of Abidjan on a spontaneous march after the
police hurled tear gas canisters. And since last Wednesday, after
the government accused her party's supporters of marching
illegally, as well as rioting and burning public buses, she has
been jailed with other party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Diabate, a historian and a former minister of culture for the
party in power, awaits a court hearing on Thursday and faces months
in prison. Her party says that the government rescinded the permit
for the march at the last minute and the police incited the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman, I respect her for who she is and what she has
done,'' said Kone Ahmed, 28, as he walked in a recent march for the
Rally of the Republicans, whose secretary general is Diabate.
``Here's someone who has everything in life: a husband, children,
grandchildren, money, diplomas, honors. But she's here with us, in
the middle of all of us who have nothing and who are fighting to
get something.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she were at home giving us orders, I wouldn't follow
them,'' Ahmed said. ``But she's here with us.''
</P>
<P>
   During the sit-in that followed the march, Diabate, described by
many as a spoiled woman who would never be able to take to the
streets, sat on the hot asphalt under a scorching sun, her legs
crossed. ``I don't feel the ground,'' she said defiantly. ``I don't
even know whether it's hot, cold, hard or soft. Why be afraid of
the sun when the decisions taken by the ruling party are hotter
than the sun's rays? Better fight them now.''
</P>
<P>
   The election for president is still a year away. But the battle
pitting the Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast of President Henri
Konan Bedie against the Rally of the Republicans, led by Alassane
D. Ouattara, who was until recently a deputy director at the
International Monetary Fund in Washington, has begun with
unexpected fierceness.
</P>
<P>
   The fairness of the election, in a country that has long been
the most stable and richest in French-speaking sub-Saharan Africa,
will be watched closely in a region with little success in
democracy. It will also amount to something of a test of the
Clinton administration's frequently stated commitment to democracy
in Africa, particularly since the government of Bedie has the
backing of the French government, according to diplomats based
here.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the U.S. State Department asked for the release of
the opposition leaders and warned that the United States might have
to reassess its relations with the Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to Ouattara's scheduled return here,
the government drummed up its campaign of ivoirite, a vague concept
of national identity by which longtime Ivoirians were to be
distinguished from supposed newcomers. The message dovetailed with
the government's long-held assertion that Ouattara's father was
from Burkina Faso (something Ouattara denies) and that he is thus
ineligible to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Diabate controlled the opposition party until Ouattara, a prime
minister here in the early 1990s, came back in July. But Ouattara
has been in Paris for the last month as the government-controlled
courts charged him with forging his Ivoirian identity cards and
invalidated his citizenship papers. And so with Ouattara unable to
return without facing arrest, the reins of the main opposition
party have fallen back into the hands of Diabate.
</P>
<P>
   Things were not expected to turn out this way. For many
skeptics, Diabate had been chosen as her party's head during
Ouattara's absence because it would be easier for a woman to step
down upon his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she was a puppet,'' said Guy Liali, an editor at
L'Argument, a magazine for another opposition party. He added: ``I
thought she was a great lady. But precisely because of that, I
thought she couldn't lift a finger to give her supporters orders.
She couldn't order her supporters to take to the streets, because
she's not a woman from the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a successful businessman, Ms. Diabate lived all
over the Ivory Coast as a child. She went to college in Senegal and
then to France, where she earned a doctorate in history at the
Sorbonne. After her return to the Ivory Coast, she taught at the
University of Cocody in Abidjan, the country's main university.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, just after the country's independence, most of her
colleagues were French, and she was the only Ivoirian woman on the
faculty. She specialized in the Ivory Coast, including the history
of an incipient women's movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit that many people were asking what possessed me
to abandon my children to do field research and teach,'' Diabate
said during a recent interview at her villa. ``It seemed silly and
incomprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in a culture where girls are often denied
schooling, married off in their adolescence and men are permitted
multiple wives, Diabate became a model for a younger generation of
women.
</P>
<P>
   Tannella Boni, a professor of philosophy at the University of
Cocody, described Diabate as an older sister to the still
relatively small number of women teachers. Diabate had now become
an even greater model in public life, Boni said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a symbol for all of us regardless of our political
affiliation,'' Boni said. ``We see her there, a woman of
conviction. All of us are watching her and hoping that she'll win,
that she'll hold on and succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Diabate came into politics through Ouattara, who was a protege
of her second husband, Lamine Diabate, a banker. When Ouattara was
prime minister in the early 1990s, he chose Diabate as minister of
culture.
</P>
<P>
   But after Ouattara had a falling out with Bedie and formed his
own organization, Diabate also left the party that has ruled the
Ivory Coast since its independence.
</P>
<P>
   Half a decade later, especially after recent events, Diabate may
finally dispel all the stories about being a soft woman more
interested in soaking herself in a bathtub than in the dirty world
of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inspiring to see a woman at the head of a party,'' she
said. ``But as long as a woman is a model, we have not attained our
goal. To say that a woman is a model means there aren't that
many.''

IN THE END, THE `SENSATION' IS LESS THE ART THAN THE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No one should have been surprised by a court's
decision Monday in favor of the Brooklyn Museum of Art and against
New York City and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, since the ruling was
predictable, but museums across the country must have been relieved
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Even those museum officials (and there are plenty of them around
the country) who privately disliked ``Sensation'' and the way it
was handled by the Brooklyn Museum couldn't help feeling that their
own fates were on the line, too. What was at stake was their
interpretation of the First Amendment, which lets a public museum
show work without fear of financial retribution if someone in the
government finds the work offensive. Now the mayor is heightening
his objection to the financial arrangement of the exhibition, which
involves works from a private collection.
</P>
<P>
   These sorts of exhibitions have been going on pretty much for as
long as museums have been around and for obvious reasons, besides
trying to solicit art. The public gets to see work that's usually
in someone's living room. Publications keep the work in
circulation. Collecting is an interesting subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sensation'' isn't really exceptional among private collection
shows except that it presents itself, not precisely as a show about
collecting, but as a survey of new British art that happens to come
from one collector. Of course, it is still clearly about Charles
Saatchi, the exhibition being the most conspicuous product of the
revolution he has caused to come about in the promotion and sale of
this art. But it is one of those shows marketed as one thing that
is also something else.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt it was easier, and cheaper, for Brooklyn to take an
existing exhibition than to organize its own survey. But it's
interesting to ask what would have happened if the museum had put
together works by the same artists on its own. Would the show now
seem to the public, or at least to the mayor, less marred by
commercial interests?
</P>
<P>
   Impressions are important in these affairs. What Brooklyn did by
soliciting money from people with direct financial involvement in
the works in the exhibition was at the dubious extreme of museum
practice, if it wasn't unethical, and it certainly makes a very bad
impression by creating the image that Brooklyn is for sale. The
museum was additionally foolish to have dissembled about the
financing.
</P>
<P>
   But whenever corporate donors and private individuals give money
to pay for exhibitions they expect something in return, whether it
is in the form of good publicity or special access to the show for
themselves and their clients. That's business as usual. Giving the
auction house Christie's special access in Brooklyn was nothing
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Believing that Christie's does not plan to sell works by the
artists in ``Sensation'' or that Saatchi was not thinking about the
enhanced value of his collection when he entered into his agreement
with Brooklyn is simply naive. He sold works at Christie's after
``Sensation'' was in London. Collectors often sell works after
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn episode may be an egregious example, but it is of a
piece with how cultural institutions in the United States function.
This is a capitalist country. Museums must depend on private
support, and private contributors naturally have their own
interests.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago there was a spate of private collection
exhibitions. Over the course of several months the National Gallery
had more than a half dozen of them. It was at the peak of the '80s
art boom, and museums, unable to compete with rich buyers in the
auction rooms, needed to entice donations through whatever other
means possible, and the currency of a private collection show is
not inconsiderable in terms of vanity, publicity and the value
added to the collection by the museum's prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, showing private collections like Saatchi's, like
selling off, or deaccessioning, art, erupts into public controversy
and misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The problem stems from the puritanical American supposition that
culture is pure and money is corrupt. This leads to the notion that
self-interest on the part of rich collectors necessarily pollutes
the sanctity of the museum, as if American museums were not the
result of rich collectors' donations. Collectors' loans of their
works to museums for exhibition also benefit the public and are an
act of generosity. No one said that generosity cannot exist
simultaneously with self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Different museums have different policies about private
collection shows. Some museums prevent collectors from selling art
for a period of time after the show. The Museum of Modern Art
doesn't do these shows unless parts of the collection are promised
to it, but even this arrangement doesn't mean that the collector
isn't profiting from the event. Donating art in return for a show
can itself be construed as a quid pro quo arrangement by people who
see the whole relationship between museums and private collector
shows as questionable. Saatchi says he isn't planning to donate any
art to the Brooklyn Museum, but if he did, would that placate the
Mayor or others suspicious of his motives and the museum's?
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Museum, which has a hard time raising money, went
way too far this time by turning in an unseemly way to collectors,
dealers and an auction house who will profit by its exhibition. But
the blame isn't entirely Brooklyn's. The museum world has no
enforcing regulatory body to oversee practices that in other
disciplines might seem questionable, only the government, which is
mostly concerned with outright fraud and theft. In an ideal world,
museums should have firmer rules about donations and private
collection shows, with public perceptions more squarely in mind.
They would bring to these exhibitions the same standards of
objective scholarship that they (supposedly) bring to other shows,
which would include critical investigation of the taste, and
sometimes even the biography, of the collectors.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't an ideal world.

RUSSIAN PILOTS SEE CHECHNYA SORTIES AS NECESSARY JOB 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   MOZDOK, Russia _ The Su-25 ground assault jet glided onto the
tarmac at the Russian military base, two tons lighter than when it
had taken off for Chechnya, that being the weight of the bombs,
rockets and bullets fired at ground targets by its pilot, Major P.
</P>
<P>
   With a triumphant wave and a confident grin, Major P. gave an
upbeat report of his 25-minute sortie over Gudermes, Chechnya's
second-largest city. The crescendo of international criticism about
the mounting civilan death toll from Russian air strikes is not a
problem here in Mozdok, Russia's staging center for the offensive
against breakaway Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're asking whether I wasted any Chechens, yeah, I blew
away a lot of them,'' Major P said in an interview just after
landing from his sortie Sunday. Like all Russian pilots flying in
the Caucasus war zone, he spoke on the grounds that his full name
not be published, to prevent some victim's vengeful relatives from
tracking him down later.
</P>
<P>
   As Russian planes and artillery again pounded Gudermes and
Chechnya's capital Grozny Tuesday, President Clinton met with
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in Oslo to express US
concerns about the conflict. A White House spokesman said Clinton
pressed Putin on the fate of tens of thousands of civilians trapped
inside the combat zone, and about such incidents as last week's
bombing of Red Cross vehicles in which at least 25 civilians died
and dozens were wounded. Russia denied responsility and said its
planes were bombing rebel positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stressed that it's not in the interest of any country...to
try to resolve internal problems at the price of a major loss of
life of innocent people,'' a senior administration official told
reporters in Oslo. ``Political dialogue has to be the absolute
foundation for a successful solution because we don't see how a
military solution is going to work in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Putin made it clear that Russia would not ease its onslaught
against Chechnya, saying Islamic militants in the breakaway
republic must be destroyed before any negotiations can began. And
Russian military continued to block the border of the rebellious
region, refusing to let refugees from the fighting leave Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, federal troops and local police scuffled briefly at the
border crossing into the Russian republic of Ingushetia, when
police demanded that refugees be let out of Chechnya. Crowds of
desperate refugees pushed to be let through. One woman died,
apparently of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian military is just mocking civilians, what they do
is an act of lawlessness,'' said Ingushetia's leader, Ruslan
Aushev.
</P>
<P>
   Major P., the jet fighter pilot, has no regrets about what he
does. He knows that Chechen separatists have already brought down
at least two heavily armored attack planes like his own. He knows
he is fighting the ``bandits'' and ``terrorists'' Moscow has vowed
to wipe out in Chechnya. His job is to kill as many of them as he
can.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chechen fighters call themselves wolves, but they call the
Russian pilots flying wolves,'' Major P. said, ``because they kill
so many Chechens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military claimed that Tuesday's raids killed between
100 and 150 fighters. The separatist Chechen government said the
civilian death toll from a month of fighting had risen to 3,600.
Neither figure could be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Russia says it is targeting only rebel positions, not civilians;
on Sunday, Putin dismissed reports of civilian deaths as
``evil-minded propaganda of the terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are not so sure. Tuesday, the New York-based Human Rights
Watch released a report saying dozens of innocent victims had died
in the Russian assault. And in Moscow, where the war is popular,
some commentators attacked the Russian campaign as a cruelly flawed
recipe for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``For each dead (Chechen) fighter we are going to kill 10
civilians,'' wrote veteran political commentator Andrei Piontkowski
in the weekly Novaya Gazeta. ``Each one of them has relatives, and
they will take the place of that dead fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has portrayed its advance into Chechnya so
far as a relatively easy one. Russian armor, aviation and artillery
have pounded rebel positions in the plains and low mountains north,
west and east of Grozny, allowing the federal units to gradually
push back the lightly armed rebels while trying to minimize their
own losses.
</P>
<P>
   The generals say this tactic is the fruit of lessons learned
during Russia's disastrous 1994-1996 war in Chechnya, when federal
troops sustained heavy losses and flattened most of the region's
towns, but failed to crush the separatists. The military now
portrays that war as a defeat caused by meddlesome politicians in
Moscow and this new conflict as something totally new and
different. Some commanders are predicting victory by the end of the
month. Almost everyone in Mozdok is convinced that an assault on
Grozny, something the military ruled out at the beginning of the
conflict, is now inevitable and imminent.
</P>
<P>
   There are several problems with the Russians' rosy outlook. One
is that Russia admits to having lost far more soldiers _ 133 _ than
it lost in the first four weeks last time. Tuesday, the Soldiers'
Mothers Committee, a respected non-government group, accused the
military of deliberately underreporting its casualites. The real
number, id, is closer to 600.
</P>
<P>
   The second problem is that the Russians' stated goal to kill all
the ``terrorists,'' when combined with Putin's vow to fight ``to
the end, until complete victory,'' looks like a blueprint for
eternal warfare in Chechnya. Or as former Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin put it, ``to win this war, one has to destroy the entire
male population of Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Russian units have yet to encounter serious resistance
from the rebels, whose combined forces federal commanders estimate
at anywhere between 8,000 and 40,000. By all accounts many of those
men are now in Grozny waiting for the Russian army to come in and
fight them in the streets, where the bullets, bombs and rockets of
Major P. will not be able to prevent a bloodbath.

UNDATED: the knobs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Audiences may be getting restless. Last week, the excellent
young baritone Mark Delavan performed the title role in Verdi's
``Falstaff.'' Delavan has an enormous voice, and in the first scene
his fortissimo top notes seemed to push the sound system to the
max. His voice just shook the place. During the scene change that
followed, an agitated listener from an upper balcony shouted out
angrily: ``Turn off the mikes. Turn off the mikes. Let's have some
real sound up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who notice no amplification should be concerned. If
opera houses start using sound systems, will company directors
start casting according to appearance, charisma and acting ability?
Will singers with voices too small for certain heavy roles be
encouraged to take them on? Will the very art of singing, based for
centuries on the projecting the natural voice, be changed? As the
conductor, opera coach, and former New York Times music critic Will
Crutchfield writes in the November issue of Opera News: ``Anyone
who assumes that the disciplines of good singing will automatically
be maintained as the practical need for them recedes is kidding
himself big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Natural sound has always been the glory of classical music,
especially opera. But the golden age of singing was a quieter time
than ours, and audiences were willing to pay attention. Consider
this glorious cast from a Metropolitan Opera performance of Verdi's
``Rigoletto'' in 1945: Leonard Warren as Rigoletto, Jussi Bjorling
as the Duke and Bidu Sayao as Gilda. Warren's baritone voice was
robust and enveloping; Bjorling's tenor voice was vibrant and
thrilling. Sayao's soprano was delicate, tender and ... small. The
smallness was not considered a shortcoming: such touching
differences among voices were cherished and intensely discussed by
opera buffs.
</P>
<P>
   Such differences used to be cherished on Broadway as well.
Everyone talks about the legendary big voices, like the proudly
untrained Ethel Merman, and John Raitt, who could have been a fine
Verdi baritone. Think of Fred Astaire singing with that tiny voice
and no microphones in Gershwin shows of the 1920s. Yet Gershwin
loved Astaire's literate, jaunty, conversational singing style and
wrote with his voice and personality in mind. No one complained
that Astaire could not be heard. Ira Gershwin wrote clever lyrics
because he knew that people were leaning forward in their seats
hanging on every word.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a stretch to say that more than 30 years of amplification
accounts in large measure for the depressing state of Broadway
musicals today? Why write engaging lyrics and music when people
want to be passively carried along by numbing spectacle? Why tailor
a song to the voice and talents of a Broadway singer when any pop
crooner or rock belter with a body mike will do?
</P>
<P>
   So why haven't City Opera audiences risen up in protest? One
reason is that Kellogg and his company have succeeded fairly well
at attracting their target audience of younger people who are new
to opera and have little experience of the natural singing voice.
They have grown up with amplified sound in movie houses, rock
clubs, high school auditoriums, even churches. How many young
people have ever heard an unamplified speech?
</P>
<P>
   Of course City Opera also attracts devoted opera buffs, but
mostly to repertory that few other companies are doing, like
Handel's ``Ariodante.'' Those who want to hear these works will
value the opportunity under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg has said that the venture into sound systems is an
experiment. The equipment was lent on a trial basis to the State
Theater by the Dutch company that developed it, and it can be
returned if deemed unacceptable. My guess is that it will stay and
we will all have to live with it. But there will be some principled
resistance. I can imagine 20 years from now the Metropolitan Opera
advertising itself as the last house in the country that shuns
amplification.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kellogg may yet side with Sills and pull the plug on the
sound system. And that would be a bigger statement than installing
it in the first place. &QL;

DEFENDING THE OPERATIC VOICE FROM TECHNOLOGY'S WILES
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blaring amplification systems that destroy spatial relationships
among performers onstage and turn a musical score into just one
element of a high-tech spectacle have been major components of
Broadway musicals for at least 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The world of classical music has long abhorred the idea of
amplification. Concert halls and opera houses were considered the
last bastions of unamplified sound. Opera houses in particular were
regarded as virtual temples where devotees of singing could worship
the natural human voice.
</P>
<P>
   This has been changing. In the last decade, dozens of concert
halls and opera houses in Europe, including famous ones like the
Berlin Staatsoper, have installed electronic sound systems. This
trend has been prompted by acoustical problems, especially in
postwar halls and houses, and by a desire to placate listeners
accustomed to amplified sound. While these systems sound nothing
like the amplification typical of Broadway, they still rely on
technology to assist the sound, or enhance it, or whatever
euphemism the inventors use to describe a process that is still
amplification: sound from the stage and the pit is picked up by
microphones, carried via wires and disseminated through speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Now electronic sound enhancement has arrived at the New York
State Theater, home of the New York City Opera and the New York
City Ballet. The City Opera is in the eighth week of the
experiment. A notable segment of opera buffs and several critics,
including this one, are dismayed by the development, though the
company reports that for the most part its audiences have been
accepting.
</P>
<P>
   But a line has been crossed, and I fear the worst. Opera, as it
has existed since a group of Florentine composers and poets more or
less invented it around 1600, may be about to change forever.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the implications of what is happening one can look
to Broadway, where the slow but inexorable move toward
amplification began. Microphones were used on Broadway at least as
early as 1940, in Earl Carroll's ``Vanities'' revue. By the
mid-1950s sound systems that relied on stationary microphones and
provided minimal amplification were being incorporated into some
productions. But amplification was still vigorously resisted by
defenders of tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Over time the defenders were routed as technology took over. The
point of no return came on March 26, 1964, the opening night of
Jule Styne's ``Funny Girl'' at the Winter Garden Theater. That
night the cast, led by Barbra Streisand in her star-making turn as
Fanny Brice, wore hidden body microphones and wireless
transmitters, still the standard method of amplification today.
</P>
<P>
   Historians may some day fix the point of no return in classical
music as Sept. 11, when the City Opera opened its current season
with ``Madama Butterfly'' using a sound system for the first time.
That the step was taken so publicly by a major company in the
capital of high culture added to its significance. In recent years
places like the Houston Grand Opera and the Brooklyn Academy of
Music have installed sound systems too, but surreptitiously at
first, fearing disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the City Opera and the City Ballet made a
potentially risky joint announcement about their sound system,
hoping to foster public understanding and to win points for
honesty. As a specific solution to a longstanding problem at the
acoustically poor State Theater, the decision might be thought
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   But those of us who cherish natural sound as a defining
component of opera and concert music recognized it as a big step
down a slippery slope. So far City Opera audiences, by and large,
seem not to have particularly cared or even much noticed. Some
critics have shrugged as well, a few of them suggesting that the
sound-enhanced State Theater didn't sound all that different from
the singer-unfriendly place that artists and audiences have endured
for years.
</P>
<P>
   I hear a difference in the house sound; it bothers me, and I am
not alone. Beverly Sills, the greatest star in the company's
history and a former general director, has gone public with her
opposition. But even if the change in the State Theater's acoustics
was barely discernible, the implications of the move are troubling.
</P>
<P>
   After attending six performances since this season's opening
night, I can report that the reverberation of sound is not right.
In an opera house with good acoustics a voice onstage comes
directly at you and then reverberates throughout the hall. At the
State Theater that sort of echo effect seems to happen too soon,
almost immediately after the sound leaves the stage.
</P>
<P>
   During opening week the balance between singers and orchestra
favored the orchestra, although that has been adjusted for the
better. But the microphones remain overly sensitive to some sounds:
the high notes of sopranos, for example, now tend to boom.
</P>
<P>
   During ``Carmen'' the chingling of a triangle stood out oddly,
and Carmen's castanets were strangely loud. Perhaps this can be
adjusted. But Paul Kellogg, the artistic and general director, has
said his strong preference is to set the controls in the house at
certain levels and then leave them alone so that the State Theater
will have a characteristic house sound like any unenhanced hall for
music. Fair enough. But it is so easy to tinker that it is hard to
believe that sound engineers will keep their hands off the knobs.

A 100 YEARS LATER, CAN FREUD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (THIS ARTICLE ALSO MOVED IN ``K'' and ``L'' CATEGORIES) One
hundred years ago this month, Sigmund Freud began an enterprise
that would turn us all inside out.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Interpretation of Dreams,'' published in November 1899,
the 43-year-old Viennese doctor theorized that dreams present us
with repressed desires. All dreams are wish fulfillment, Freud
claimed, and it is possible to read our dreams and to know things
felt long ago in childhood that were driven into the unconscious
under the weight of social norms and parental expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Using free association, dream interpretation and long-term
interaction with an analyst, neurotic behavior could be understood
as the result of repressed memories of childhood trauma.
Consciousness could dispel those unconscious urges that rule us
from below.
</P>
<P>
   Freud wrote many other books over the next four decades,
developing his theory of psychoanalysis into a comprehensive view
of human experience. By knowing the dark sources of its everyday
behavior, he averred, humanity could be made healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone has agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After untold millions of hours have been spent by thousands upon
hundreds of thousands of patients on couches talking about potty
training and relationships with their moms, it seems scarcely
possible to assert in 1999 that humans are generally happier than
they were in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Freud's theory is not so life-altering as originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's not even tenable.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Greeks, in the myth of Orpheus and the Underworld,
seem to have anticipated Freud and found his theory wanting.
</P>
<P>
   According to the myth, the great musician Orpheus loved the
nymph Eurydice with a passion that transcended all. When, on their
wedding day, she died of a snake bite, Orpheus would not let death
part them. Orpheus strode into the Underworld and requested of
Pluto, its King, to let Eurydice leave with him when he returned to
the sunshine. Pluto granted Orpheus' request on one condition:
Orpheus must not look back at Eurydice as they left, but keep his
gaze directed at the road ahead, the path out of the Underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus began the journey back with Eurydice following. But as
he neared the exit from the kingdom of shades, he could not resist
a glance back at his beloved. Instantly, he realized his mistake,
as Eurydice slipped back helplessly into the darkness. Orpheus
emerged into the light alone, and for the rest of his days roamed
the land, heartbroken, singing his tragic songs.
</P>
<P>
   In the myth, the Underworld _ the Greeks' symbol for the
unconscious _ could not be successfully breached by Orpheus/Reason
without losing the object of its quest. The contents of the
unconscious could not be pulled out into the sunshine and
comprehended in conscious, rational terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Freud asserted that they could, and he has convinced most of
the rest of us that he was right. His theories, once radical, are
now everyday. His observation of the stages of infant development
today seem obvious to any observant parent: the oral stage,
dominated by feeding; the anal stage, with attention shifted to
endless diaper changes; and the genital stage, signalling the first
hints of sexual awareness. After the mindless destruction of World
War I seemed to deny the life force itself, Freud put forth the
idea, in ``Beyond the Pleasure Principle,'' that humans struggle
daily with two opposing forces: Eros, the life force, and Thanatos,
the death force. Whenever we talk about someone having a death
wish, Freud is there.
</P>
<P>
   He's also there when we say something sexual where a sexual
reference was not intended _ we call it a ``Freudian slip.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's there whenever his grossest generalization, the Oedipus
complex, is taken seriously. Generalizing from the results of his
own self-analysis, in which he found himself attracted to his own
mother in childhood, Freud asserted it to be true of all children,
male and female alike (which has recently found him favor in
lesbian circles). The actual story of Oedipus in Greek mythology
probably points to something far less sexually specific: that a man
is likely to follow the pattern set out for him in youth, to
attempt to duplicate the home he was raised in and to replace (to
``kill'') his father. But the myth is now so wrapped up with Freud
that it is hard to disentangle it.
</P>
<P>
   Freud's reputation crested sometime midcentury and has since
been under sustained attack. Where once Freud was a hero of popular
culture _ the 1962 Hollywood howler ``Freud'' cast Montgomery Clift
as the bearded cigar-smoker and featured the oracular tones of
director-narrator John Huston comparing Freud to Christ _ he is now
passe, a name with little resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, the scholarly world, too, has tended more to
Freud-bashing than to Freud hagiography. In ``The Memory Wars:
Freud's Legacy in Dispute (New York Review, 1995),'' author and
former Freudian Frederick Crews dismissed Freud as ``the discoverer
of vague general truths about human deviousness.'' E. Fuller
Torrey, in ``Freudian Fraud (Harper Collins, 1992),'' made a case
that there is no scientific basis whatsoever for Freud's theories.
</P>
<P>
   Long before either book was published, no less a figure than
Ludwig Wittgenstein, one of the century's greatest philosophers,
pointed out perhaps the single greatest flaw in Freudian theory. If
Freud had indeed discovered dark things in the unconscious, how
could he possibly prove they were things of meaning? A cause is not
a meaning. Event A may cause Behavior B without imbuing B with a
particular meaning.
</P>
<P>
   A child may learn to repress sexual urges that do not correspond
to parental expectations, but, well . . . so what? Nothing
scientific can be drawn from such an observation. An additional
element is needed, Wittgenstein observed, to give the event and its
repression meaning: the very unscientific one of mythology.
(Wittgenstein's observations about Freud, scattered throughout his
career in essays and lectures, are gathered in ``Wittgenstein Reads
Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious,'' by Jacques Bouveresse,
translated by Carol Cosman (Princeton University Press, 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   So, Freud's power depends, not on any factual, scientific
observation about humanity, but on the skills he had as a writer
and self-promoter to convince us that looking at life his way _ at
every neurosis as a repressed desire, at every dream as wish
fulfillment, etc. _ is the right way to look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Psychoanalysis is a myth without hard scientific basis.
Paradoxically, it's a myth that loses potency when stripped of its
supposed factual basis, becoming then just one possibility among
many others. Freud himself was adamant that his theories be
considered ``correct.'' In ``The Ego and the Id (1923)'' he wrote:
``The fact that in the technique of psychoanalysis a means has been
found by which the opposing force (repression) can be removed and
the ideas in question made conscious renders the theory
IRREFUTABLE.(ITAL)''
</P>
<P>
   The claim to irrefutability was part of Freud's myth.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Orpheus and Eurydice was a myth about the
exploration of the unconscious. Its moral was that knowing the dark
side of ourselves is not possible except in the symbols of art _
Orpheus' music.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of Freud was a modern version of same in which knowing
our unconscious selves in rational terms is not only possible, but
factually verifiable according to the theories of psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the old myth, and not the new one, more accurately
represents the human condition? Not all myths are equal. Some got
there first because they state a truth that lies at the center of
our existence.
</P>
<P>
   If the story of Orpheus is truer than the story of Freud, then
our conscious and unconscious selves are not meant to communicate
in the way Freud wanted them to. In psychoanalysis, the language of
the conscious self dominates the unconscious; the unconscious is
invaded. The Orpheus myth would lead us rather to leave the
unconscious alone on its own terms, and content our conscious
selves with meditating on the symbols of art and spirituality that
are the universal language of the unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   In very general terms, this is what Carl Jung did. The Swiss
student of Freud trumped his teacher's belief in the unconscious by
giving the unconscious its due, developing a whole new branch of
psychology that diverged from Freud by dwelling not on repressed
sexual urges but on the meaning of symbols from the unconscious. He
let the unconscious speak in its own language.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of plumbing the darkness inside ourselves, sexual or
otherwise, may have begun to pale. The latest trend in therapy is
philosophical therapy, which is an exact denial of psychological
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   According to philosophical therapists, our duties as people are
to develop conscious discernment and leave what cannot be discerned
to dreams, art and religion. In a time when Freudian theories have
decayed to the point that respect is given to every smirking sexual
reference on daytime television talk shows, it's a refreshing
concept. &QL;

AUDIENCE REACTION IS MORE HO-HUM THAN OUTRAGE 
</HEADLINE>
 (With AMPLIFIED-OPERA) 
(fb) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surtitles! Microphones! Few things in opera arouse more
opposition than change. For the serious operagoer, the human voice
is a sacred instrument and nothing must stand between it and the
audience, even if it clarifies a work. And the trained human voice
in its pure form, unencumbered by amplification or alteration, has
an almost religious significance. Opera singers are the sum total
of all their training, of their physiognomy, the size of their
palate and voice box, the configuration of their teeth, their lung
capacity. And to the purist, any attempt to interfere with them is
fundamentally a lie.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when Paul Kellogg, the general and artistic director of
the City Opera announced that he was installing a new sound system
at the New York State Theater to try to improve its historically
bad acoustics, there was a predictable outcry from people who
protested that it would violate the very soul of opera. ``It's
immoral, an aesthetic crime,'' said Manuela Hoelterhoff, a writer
for Talk magazine who has been an opera critic for The Wall Street
Journal. ``My friend Paul Kellogg should be welded to a boombox for
the rest of the season,'' she said after she heard the news.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Theater, which has housed the Opera since 1965 and
is home to the New York City Ballet, was designed to deaden the
footfalls of ballet dancers, not to project the human voice into
its 2,730-seat hall. Sometimes singers standing at the back of the
stage are barely audible, their voices absorbed in the vast dead
air. Occasionally young singers seem to strain in an effort to
reach the back of the theater. Performers develop favorite spots on
the stage, believing that their voices project better from there.
Beverly Sills, who made her career at the City Opera, said she used
to believe that singing ``six inches to the left of center was
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Kellogg has installed a system of microphones and panels
that he said were designed to enhance the sound, not to amplify it.
But an informal survey of operagoers over the last few weeks seemed
to indicate that many regulars didn't notice a difference or
thought the sound had improved.
</P>
<P>
   During the intermission of a performance of ``Ariodante,'' Dick
Titan, a retired guidance counselor from Commack N.Y., on Long
Island, said the sound ``was exceptionally clean.'' A friend,
Stuart Agins, also a retired guidance counselor, said, ``You're
supposed to notice it enriching the sound but not the volume. It
sounds great.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Osgood, a writer who came from Germantown, N.Y., to see
``Ariodante,'' said, ``I didn't sense any artificiality about the
sound of the voices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then I had the thought that the voice sounded
fuller than it might have without enhancement,'' said Osgood, who
has subscribed to the City Opera for five years. ``But that was
only a fleeting thought from three or four times during the
opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Another subscriber, Barbara Welter, a professor of history at
the Graduate Center of the City University, said after she attended
performances of Rossini's ``Il Viaggio a Reims'' and ``Ariodante'':
``There was no distortion, not that brassy sound we used to get. At
first I couldn't figure out what was different.'' She added that
the change ``was noticeable, particularly at the high and low
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Smith, the former editor of Opera News, said after
seeing ``Ariodante'' and ``Il Viaggio a Reims'' that he ``was quite
impressed with what had been done in the sense that I didn't notice
a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This sounded clearer; it was better done than most'' sound
enhancement, Smith said. ``They weren't pushing,'' he said of the
singers. ``I was favorably impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   But a man who identified himself as H. Collen from northern New
Jersey said during the intermission of Puccini's ``Madama
Butterfly'' that he was not pleased. ``There's a shrill quality,''
he said, ``mostly on the high notes, a trembling that goes through
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another audience member at ``Butterfly,'' Ralph Stein, a
professor of law at Pace University in New York City who has been
attending the City Opera for 35 years, said he noticed ``some
amplification.'' But he said: ``I don't think it changes the
tonality. There should be a greater range of sound. What they're
doing is bringing an equalization that Broadway shows have been
doing for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Davis, the classical music critic for New York magazine,
said he thought the announcement of the new sound system was a
hoax. ``My theory is that the announcement was made and they didn't
even turn it on,'' Davis said, half joking. ``And after all this
fuss calms down, they will start turning it on, and then people
won't notice.''
</P>

<P>
   It has been a nightmarish autumn for the Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   First, the company drew the wrath of politicians and family
members of those killed in 1996 on TWA Flight 800, when it was
revealed that in 1980 the company studied the likelihood of the
center fuel tank exploding on the military version of the 747, but
never shared the data with the National Transportation Safety
Board.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Sunday, an EgyptAir Boeing 767-300ER, one of the
Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer's most successful airplanes,
crashed mysteriously south of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   And late Monday, Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration
announced that the company is halting delivery on 747s, 757s, 767s,
and 777s because a piece of cockpit insulation was being
manufactured improperly and in a burn test last weekend ``failed
miserably,'' said a high-ranking FAA official.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman Randy Harrison said that somehow the way the
piece of insulation, known as a drip shield, was manufactured was
changed at the Boeing factory in Spokane, Wash., in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change was discovered in Spokane last week, and that was
communicated instantly to Seattle and we instantly notifed the
FAA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The change involved putting adhesive on the insulation, which
made it more flammable.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said the company has already started manufacturing
proper drip shields and is installing them on planes in production.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and the FAA are trying to determine how to replace the
drip shields in some 30 planes that are farther along in the
production schedule and how best to replace them in the existing
fleet, which one source said could involve as many as 1,000
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and the FAA said there was no connection between the
crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 and the improperly manufactured drip
shield. That airplane was delivered in 1989, before Boeing added
adhesive to the shields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing Co. looks at incidents like this as altogether
unfortunate,'' said Harrison. ``But it is a way to improve the
process. We will find out how it happened and why it happened and
what we can learn from and then share that lesson across the
breadth of the company.''

   Here are Anne Stephenson's New &AMP; Notable capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``MY CAT SPIT MCGEE'' &QL; 
By Willie Morris (Random House, $18.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of any cat hater, this is a major defection.
Morris was a confirmed dog man most of his life. First there was
Skip, about whom Morris wrote a book called ``My Dog Skip,'' and
then there was Pete, a carefree black lab who hung out with the
guys at the local gas station and counted Truman Capote among his
many friends before he settled down with Morris. In the last years
of his life (he died of heart failure this year), however, Willie
Morris loved a cat. Not that he went gently. When he noticed his
faltering resistence to feline company, he consulted with a friend,
the dog-loving Eudora Welty (who was no help), and with a
psychiatrist, who told him it was not unmanly to love a cat. And so
he and Spit McGee became a twosome, Morris spellbound and smitten
and companionable, Spit haughty and all-knowing and coy. This is
Morris' ode to Spit, whom he sometimes believed was his dog Skip
reincarnated. However, Spit was Spit and no one else. Do you have
to love cats to love this book? We'll be honest with you _ it
helps. A little Spit McGee goes a long way. ``This afternoon the
two of us were down by the creek sitting together in our favorite
spot,'' Morris writes. ``It was false spring again in January and
the warming sunlight fell languidly upon us. As I stroked him on
his back, once again he snuggled into my lap. `I love you, Spitty,'
I said. He extended his paw toward me.'' Pete and Skip are probably
spinning in their graves. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``CARE PACKAGES: LETTERS TO CHRISTOPHER REEVE FROM STRANGERS AND
OTHER FRIENDS'' &QL; 
By Dana Reeve (Random House, $20) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Get out your hankies, folks. This is a weeper. And yet it's not
a sappy book. We thought it would be, and we opened it with
considerable reluctance. Then we got our hankies out and read to
the last letter in the pile. The people who have written to Reeve
since he was paralyzed in a riding accident four years ago _
especially the strangers _ are not overly sentimental people. They
tend to be survivors themselves, who have faced physical adversity
and come out of it reborn, if not recovered. Their messages tend
toward the challenging. Buck up. Don't let people tell you what you
can't do. Things might never be the same, but make something of the
life you have now. Never give up. Never. Dana Reeve also includes
letters from old acquaintances who knew her husband both as himself
and as Superman, and from celebrities who sent their good wishes
and encouragement. Here's a note, in its entirety, from a
7-year-old boy: ``Hope you'll come out of hospital soon. And you
can come round. Dad will help you up the stair's.'' (cq) Paul
McCartney wrote about the day he and his young son, a huge Superman
fan, traveled on the same plane with Reeve to America from London.
``You were kind enough to give him a big wave when he turned around
to look at you,'' McCartney said. ``That's the kind of thing that
means a lot to soppy old parents like us, and something we won't
forget in a hurry.'' And Katharine Hepburn typed this _ ``Let me
know if I can do anything _ My golly what a mess.'' and signed it
with a very shaky hand. It's hard not to be heartened by the
collective goodness of these people, who took time out of their
days to reach out to a man in need. ``By compiling these letters,''
Reeve says in his foreword, ``Dana is sharing with you and
reminding me of words that helped me start a new life. For that I
am deeply grateful.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BASEBALL'S 25 GREATEST MOMENTS'' &QL; 
(The Sporting News, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We showed this book to a rabid Pirates fan, who let it be known
that the editors erred deeply when they ranked Bobby Thomson's home
run against the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1951 pennant race over
Pittsburgh second baseman Bill Mazeroski's homer in the last game
of the 1960 World Series. It's that kind of book _ you don't check
your allegiances at the door. Also among the Top 10: the hobbled
Kirk Gibson's home run in the opening game of the 1988 World
Series; Bill Buckner's devastating error in game six of the 1986
series; Don Larsen's perfect game for the Yankees over Brooklyn in
Game Five of the 1956 series; and ``The Catch,'' which Willie Mays
made in 1954 and has been downplayed ever since, but we think it's
just the most amazing thing, so amazing that we could watch it
forever. Our Pirates fan says the first 10 ``greatest moments'' are
fun, but after that the editors make some faulty picks and leave
themselves open to ridicule. As we said, it's that kind of book. &QL; 
``THE WAY WE LIVED THEN'' &QL; 
By Dominick Dunne (Crown, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When he was 9, Dunne's aunt took him from his home in
Connecticut on a vacation in the West. Their first stop was Los
Angeles, and when they got onto the bus that toured movie stars
homes, Dunne sat next to the guide so that he wouldn't miss
anything. In truth, he knew more about the stars than the guide did
_ he was already steeped in Hollywood gossip and glamour, the
intrigue and the dirt. Years later, as a young stage manager, he
attended his first Hollywood party at the home of Humphrey Bogart
and Lauren Bacall, where he saw Judy Garland, who lived next door,
and Lana Turner, who lived next door on the other side (she walked
in late, ``looking the way you wanted Lana Turner to look''), Frank
Sinatra, Spencer Tracy and so many others. ``Before the night was
over, people jumped in the pool in their party clothes,'' he says.
``I jumped in, too. I wanted to be a part of it. I thought to
myself, `This is how I want to live.' '' He did, for a long time.
This is his memoir of life in Hollywood, with photographs from his
own scrapbooks showing the stars at leisure.  &QL;

A 100 YEARS LATER, CAN FREUD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (THIS ARTICLE ALSO MOVED IN ``A'' and ``K'' CATEGORIES)
 &UR; One hundred years ago this month, Sigmund Freud began an enterprise
that would turn us all inside out.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Interpretation of Dreams,'' published in November 1899,
the 43-year-old Viennese doctor theorized that dreams present us
with repressed desires. All dreams are wish fulfillment, Freud
claimed, and it is possible to read our dreams and to know things
felt long ago in childhood that were driven into the unconscious
under the weight of social norms and parental expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Using free association, dream interpretation and long-term
interaction with an analyst, neurotic behavior could be understood
as the result of repressed memories of childhood trauma.
Consciousness could dispel those unconscious urges that rule us
from below.
</P>
<P>
   Freud wrote many other books over the next four decades,
developing his theory of psychoanalysis into a comprehensive view
of human experience. By knowing the dark sources of its everyday
behavior, he averred, humanity could be made healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone has agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After untold millions of hours have been spent by thousands upon
hundreds of thousands of patients on couches talking about potty
training and relationships with their moms, it seems scarcely
possible to assert in 1999 that humans are generally happier than
they were in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Freud's theory is not so life-altering as originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's not even tenable.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Greeks, in the myth of Orpheus and the Underworld,
seem to have anticipated Freud and found his theory wanting.
</P>
<P>
   According to the myth, the great musician Orpheus loved the
nymph Eurydice with a passion that transcended all. When, on their
wedding day, she died of a snake bite, Orpheus would not let death
part them. Orpheus strode into the Underworld and requested of
Pluto, its King, to let Eurydice leave with him when he returned to
the sunshine. Pluto granted Orpheus' request on one condition:
Orpheus must not look back at Eurydice as they left, but keep his
gaze directed at the road ahead, the path out of the Underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus began the journey back with Eurydice following. But as
he neared the exit from the kingdom of shades, he could not resist
a glance back at his beloved. Instantly, he realized his mistake,
as Eurydice slipped back helplessly into the darkness. Orpheus
emerged into the light alone, and for the rest of his days roamed
the land, heartbroken, singing his tragic songs.
</P>
<P>
   In the myth, the Underworld _ the Greeks' symbol for the
unconscious _ could not be successfully breached by Orpheus/Reason
without losing the object of its quest. The contents of the
unconscious could not be pulled out into the sunshine and
comprehended in conscious, rational terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Freud asserted that they could, and he has convinced most of
the rest of us that he was right. His theories, once radical, are
now everyday. His observation of the stages of infant development
today seem obvious to any observant parent: the oral stage,
dominated by feeding; the anal stage, with attention shifted to
endless diaper changes; and the genital stage, signalling the first
hints of sexual awareness. After the mindless destruction of World
War I seemed to deny the life force itself, Freud put forth the
idea, in ``Beyond the Pleasure Principle,'' that humans struggle
daily with two opposing forces: Eros, the life force, and Thanatos,
the death force. Whenever we talk about someone having a death
wish, Freud is there.
</P>
<P>
   He's also there when we say something sexual where a sexual
reference was not intended _ we call it a ``Freudian slip.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's there whenever his grossest generalization, the Oedipus
complex, is taken seriously. Generalizing from the results of his
own self-analysis, in which he found himself attracted to his own
mother in childhood, Freud asserted it to be true of all children,
male and female alike (which has recently found him favor in
lesbian circles). The actual story of Oedipus in Greek mythology
probably points to something far less sexually specific: that a man
is likely to follow the pattern set out for him in youth, to
attempt to duplicate the home he was raised in and to replace (to
``kill'') his father. But the myth is now so wrapped up with Freud
that it is hard to disentangle it.
</P>
<P>
   Freud's reputation crested sometime midcentury and has since
been under sustained attack. Where once Freud was a hero of popular
culture _ the 1962 Hollywood howler ``Freud'' cast Montgomery Clift
as the bearded cigar-smoker and featured the oracular tones of
director-narrator John Huston comparing Freud to Christ _ he is now
passe, a name with little resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, the scholarly world, too, has tended more to
Freud-bashing than to Freud hagiography. In ``The Memory Wars:
Freud's Legacy in Dispute (New York Review, 1995),'' author and
former Freudian Frederick Crews dismissed Freud as ``the discoverer
of vague general truths about human deviousness.'' E. Fuller
Torrey, in ``Freudian Fraud (Harper Collins, 1992),'' made a case
that there is no scientific basis whatsoever for Freud's theories.
</P>
<P>
   Long before either book was published, no less a figure than
Ludwig Wittgenstein, one of the century's greatest philosophers,
pointed out perhaps the single greatest flaw in Freudian theory. If
Freud had indeed discovered dark things in the unconscious, how
could he possibly prove they were things of meaning? A cause is not
a meaning. Event A may cause Behavior B without imbuing B with a
particular meaning.
</P>
<P>
   A child may learn to repress sexual urges that do not correspond
to parental expectations, but, well . . . so what? Nothing
scientific can be drawn from such an observation. An additional
element is needed, Wittgenstein observed, to give the event and its
repression meaning: the very unscientific one of mythology.
(Wittgenstein's observations about Freud, scattered throughout his
career in essays and lectures, are gathered in ``Wittgenstein Reads
Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious,'' by Jacques Bouveresse,
translated by Carol Cosman (Princeton University Press, 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   So, Freud's power depends, not on any factual, scientific
observation about humanity, but on the skills he had as a writer
and self-promoter to convince us that looking at life his way _ at
every neurosis as a repressed desire, at every dream as wish
fulfillment, etc. _ is the right way to look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Psychoanalysis is a myth without hard scientific basis.
Paradoxically, it's a myth that loses potency when stripped of its
supposed factual basis, becoming then just one possibility among
many others. Freud himself was adamant that his theories be
considered ``correct.'' In ``The Ego and the Id (1923)'' he wrote:
``The fact that in the technique of psychoanalysis a means has been
found by which the opposing force (repression) can be removed and
the ideas in question made conscious renders the theory
IRREFUTABLE.(ITAL)''
</P>
<P>
   The claim to irrefutability was part of Freud's myth.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Orpheus and Eurydice was a myth about the
exploration of the unconscious. Its moral was that knowing the dark
side of ourselves is not possible except in the symbols of art _
Orpheus' music.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of Freud was a modern version of same in which knowing
our unconscious selves in rational terms is not only possible, but
factually verifiable according to the theories of psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the old myth, and not the new one, more accurately
represents the human condition? Not all myths are equal. Some got
there first because they state a truth that lies at the center of
our existence.
</P>
<P>
   If the story of Orpheus is truer than the story of Freud, then
our conscious and unconscious selves are not meant to communicate
in the way Freud wanted them to. In psychoanalysis, the language of
the conscious self dominates the unconscious; the unconscious is
invaded. The Orpheus myth would lead us rather to leave the
unconscious alone on its own terms, and content our conscious
selves with meditating on the symbols of art and spirituality that
are the universal language of the unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   In very general terms, this is what Carl Jung did. The Swiss
student of Freud trumped his teacher's belief in the unconscious by
giving the unconscious its due, developing a whole new branch of
psychology that diverged from Freud by dwelling not on repressed
sexual urges but on the meaning of symbols from the unconscious. He
let the unconscious speak in its own language.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of plumbing the darkness inside ourselves, sexual or
otherwise, may have begun to pale. The latest trend in therapy is
philosophical therapy, which is an exact denial of psychological
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   According to philosophical therapists, our duties as people are
to develop conscious discernment and leave what cannot be discerned
to dreams, art and religion. In a time when Freudian theories have
decayed to the point that respect is given to every smirking sexual
reference on daytime television talk shows, it's a refreshing
concept. &QL;

IN BARCELONA, SAVORING EROTICISM AND ITS ARTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARCELONA, Spain _ At the entrance to a large exhibition of
erotic art in an 18th-century palace in central Barcelona, a
discreet sign written in Catalan, Spanish and English warns that
``Garden of Eros,'' as the show is called, is for ``adult
audiences'' and that unaccompanied minors will not be admitted. The
advisory also cautions visitors who might wander into the palace
unprepared that ``they may find works on show offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in truth, said the show's organizers, Victoria Combalia and
Jean-Jacques Lebel, they were not overly fearful of a backlash.
Almost 25 years after the death of, memories of his long and
repressive dictatorship are still fresh enough for Spanish society
to frown on any hint of censorship or display of puritanism.
Indeed, even this show with its many works of eye-opening
explicitness has provoked no protests, not even from the once
all-powerful Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, meddling by the mayor was never in the cards, since
the city government provided both the space and much of the budget
for the show. In a preface to the exhibition catalog, Mayor Joan
Close says he is ``pleased'' that Barcelona is the first city ``to
have the opportunity to enjoy this show.'' He adds: ``In all times
and in all cultures, the expression of eroticism has been one of
the most creative and at the same time one of the most hidden
features of civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Combalia, who directs the Centre Cultural Tecla Sala in
nearby L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, where the 1990s part of the show
can be seen, said she felt the moment was ripe for something
daring. ``Barcelona has a very young and open-minded government,''
she said. ``Ten years ago, this would not have been possible.
Perhaps in 10 years' time, it may also not be possible. Attitudes
change.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, the show is proving immensely popular, with
close to 100,000 visitors so far. It will travel to Bergen in
Norway after it closes here Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if ``Garden of Eros'' is being greeted as something of a
novelty here, its premise is that erotic art is anything but a
novelty. Indeed, by displaying Chinese, Japanese and Indian prints,
pre-Hispanic Peruvian statues and African wood carvings as well as
early Roman pottery, the show goes out of its way to demonstrate
that erotic art has long been a global phenomenon. Given budget
constraints, though, the exhibition's 400 or so works focus on
Western art since the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   The line separating erotic art from pornography has of course
always been defined both subjectively and by prevailing social
attitudes, but in this case Ms. Combalia and Lebel have
purposefully avoided being judgmental: if they believe a painting,
print, drawing or photograph has artistic value, they have included
it even when the work's purpose may have been to provoke sexual
excitement, as was certainly the case with erotic drawings of
18th-century salon scenes and much turn-of-the-century nude
photography.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the case for art over pornography is bolstered by the
large number of famous artists who have dabbled in erotic art. The
organizers of the show here could not afford to bring _ and
probably could not have borrowed _ famously sensual paintings by
the likes of Poussin, Lotto, David, Ingres and Manet (whose
``Olympia'' was considered scandalous in its day). They
particularly lamented not being able to show ``L'Origine du
Monde,'' Gustave Courbet's 1866 renowned portrait of a woman's
genitalia (although they do show a painting by Antoni Tapies and a
video by Zoran Naskovsky and Vesna Pavlovic inspired by Courbet's
painting).
</P>
<P>
   But drawings by Rodin, Schiele and Klimt help prepare the way
for the Surrealists, for whom eroticism became almost a philosophy.
Again, the show was unable to present Dali's ``Great Masturbator,''
but several of his bawdy drawings are included, as are works by
Marcel Duchamp, Paul Eluard, Max Ernst, Andre Breton, Francis
Picabia, Dora Maar, Miro and even Magritte, the seemingly
strait-laced Belgian whose more famous works are notably bereft of
sexual content.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Surrealist work that comes closest to pornography is
a 20-minute film by Man Ray called ``Two Women,'' projected onto
the floor of a room in the palace, which shows two prostitutes
making love. The film belongs to the Georges Pompidou Center in
Paris, which has the largest collection of works by Man Ray.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, which is divided into sections, also has one
small gallery given over to the German Expressionists George Grosz
and Otto Dix, whose penchant for erotic art and in Grosz's case
detailed portrayals of sexual couplings is well known. Explicit
drawings by Picasso suggest that he, too, took pleasure in
capturing the sexual act in progress, although many of these works
are rarely shown in public.
</P>
<P>
   While offering ample evidence of erotic art's established place
within the artistic tradition, however, the show has also picked
themes that have often inspired erotic art. One section, for
instance, deals with the use of crucifixes as instruments for
erotic transfiguration. This is a concept that has reappeared
through the ages, sometimes with sacrilegious intent and other
times linked to notions of bondage and sadism.
</P>
<P>
   Another section shows how artists like Degas and
Toulouse-Lautrec and photographers like Bellocq and Brassai were
drawn to bordellos not only because of they could easily find nude
models there and witness sexual acts, but also because of their
bohemian ambience. ``Many works of visual art and countless novels,
poems, stories, historical or anthropological essays, photographic
reports and a great number of films have used as their theme
prostitution in general and the brothel in particular,'' Lebel
notes in a catalog essay. Indeed, the painting used to promote
``Garden of Eros'' is Kees van Dongen's ``Madame G, Dite
l'Artiste.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Combalia said she was pleased to organize the show with
Lebel, an artist who gained some fame in Europe as the author of
erotic Happenings in the 1960s, not only because men and women have
different perceptions of erotic art, but also because the Ms.
Combalia and Lebel are of different generations: she is 47, and he
is 63. Ms. Combalia was perhaps more aware, for example, that
erotic art and even pornography are of growing interest to young
female artists these days.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, she said, perhaps because of AIDS, she felt there was
``less celebration of flesh'' in erotic art today than a generation
ago. ``In general terms, there has been a move from the collective
to the individual, from the festive to the morbid and from the
political to the obsessively neurotic,'' she wrote in a catalog
essay, adding that the exception was the sense of humor of some
young British artists.
</P>
<P>
   What ``Garden of Eros'' demonstrates, then, is that erotic art
can serve as a kind of sociological gauge of the mood of an era. In
the 18th century it was celebratory; in the 19th century it was a
response to puritanism, and in the early 20th century it was often
experimental. Today, however, with pornography so available and
nudity and sexual suggestiveness ever present in fashion and
movies, erotic art has become almost introspective. But can it
still be erotic if it is separated from the notion of pleasure?

SEN. CHAFEE'S SON STEPS INTO LATE FATHER'S JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lincoln D. Chafee was appointed Tuesday to finish
out the term of his late father, Republican Senator John H. Chafee
of Rhode Island, becoming only the second politician in history to
take over his father's US Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee, 46, the mayor of Warwick, R.I., said he expects to
assume his new role Thursday. His father's Capitol Hill office,
still piled with books and paperwork, will be passed down intact,
and many aides who worked under the elder Chafee are now expected
to work for his son. Lincoln Chafee has even been added to the
luncheon list of the Northeast GOP moderates, the five-member
coalition his father led.
</P>
<P>
   But the vacancy left by Chafee's death Oct. 24 caused political
ripples elsewhere Tuesday, as Senate Republicans hashed out who
would replace him as chairman of the Environment and Public Works
Committee. The seat went to Senator Bob Smith, Republican of New
Hampshire, but only after a private debate that included some GOP
senators still irked by Smith's angry departure from the party last
August.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Chafee will be given a seat on that committee for
the remaining 14 months of his father's term, GOP officials said.
Chafee readily accepted the assignment, saying: ``I welcome and am
prepared for the challenges that are before me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do realize that a high standard has been set, and I look
forward to carrying on in the tradition of excellence that the
people of our state have come to expect and rightfully deserve,''
Chafee said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee, who is in his fourth term as mayor of Rhode Island's
second-largest city, said earlier this year he would run for the
seat, after his father announced plans to retire at the end of
2000. With Tuesday's appointment by Governor Lincoln Almond, Chafee
gains the advantages of incumbency as he campaigns for a full
six-year term. Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, a Rhode Island
Democrat, said the Senate seat is ``his to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, two Democrats, Representative Robert A. Weygand of
Rhode Island and Providence attorney Robert A. Licht, are planning
to challenge Chafee in next year's election. Saying the appointment
hadn't changed his strategy ``one iota,'' Weygand indicated he
would use Chafee's fledgling record in the Senate as a campaign
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``His dad has a reputation as a moderate and often ran into
trouble in his own party. I don't know what will transpire these
next few weeks and months,'' Weygand said. ``Clearly, our votes and
how we perform here will be analyzed more vividly than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1965 has a son taken his father's Senate seat. Two
days after Senator Harry Byrd Sr., a Virginia Democrat, retired
after being diagnosed with brain cancer, his son, Harry Byrd Jr.,
was appointed to the office. Almost a year later, the younger Byrd
was elected to the position.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, only 48 percent of the 167 interim senators
appointed since 1913 have gone on to win a permanent seat. And
according to Democratic Senator Jack Reed, now Rhode Island's
senior senator, Chafee will face several tough votes in the Senate.
He is likely to have to vote on so-called ``wedge issues'' such as
health care and the minimum wage _ issues that might divide his
loyalties between the moderate constituency of Rhode Island and the
conservative laders of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Smith's appointment as committee chairman capped
nearly a week of jockeying among Republicans for a seat that would
have automatically been his by seniority if he had he not bolted
the Republican Party to run for president as an independent last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   As late as Tuesday morning, Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican
of Oklahoma, was openly bidding for the chairmanship, and some
Republicans argued that Smith's departure from the party was enough
reason to strip him of his seniority. But after objections from
both Republicans and environmentalists, Inhofe dropped his
campaign, ``realizing that this could get us into a bloodbath.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was confirmed by the GOP senators, 32 to 4. Some Democrats
said they were relieved, despite Smith's reputation as far more
conservative than his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is that his New Hampshire roots and his New England
roots will predominate over any kind of ideology and politics,''
Senator John F. Kerry said.

A 100 YEARS LATER, CAN FREUD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (THIS ARTICLE ALSO MOVED IN ``A'' and ``L'' CATEGORIES)
 &UR; One hundred years ago this month, Sigmund Freud began an enterprise
that would turn us all inside out.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Interpretation of Dreams,'' published in November 1899,
the 43-year-old Viennese doctor theorized that dreams present us
with repressed desires. All dreams are wish fulfillment, Freud
claimed, and it is possible to read our dreams and to know things
felt long ago in childhood that were driven into the unconscious
under the weight of social norms and parental expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Using free association, dream interpretation and long-term
interaction with an analyst, neurotic behavior could be understood
as the result of repressed memories of childhood trauma.
Consciousness could dispel those unconscious urges that rule us
from below.
</P>
<P>
   Freud wrote many other books over the next four decades,
developing his theory of psychoanalysis into a comprehensive view
of human experience. By knowing the dark sources of its everyday
behavior, he averred, humanity could be made healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone has agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After untold millions of hours have been spent by thousands upon
hundreds of thousands of patients on couches talking about potty
training and relationships with their moms, it seems scarcely
possible to assert in 1999 that humans are generally happier than
they were in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Freud's theory is not so life-altering as originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's not even tenable.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Greeks, in the myth of Orpheus and the Underworld,
seem to have anticipated Freud and found his theory wanting.
</P>
<P>
   According to the myth, the great musician Orpheus loved the
nymph Eurydice with a passion that transcended all. When, on their
wedding day, she died of a snake bite, Orpheus would not let death
part them. Orpheus strode into the Underworld and requested of
Pluto, its King, to let Eurydice leave with him when he returned to
the sunshine. Pluto granted Orpheus' request on one condition:
Orpheus must not look back at Eurydice as they left, but keep his
gaze directed at the road ahead, the path out of the Underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus began the journey back with Eurydice following. But as
he neared the exit from the kingdom of shades, he could not resist
a glance back at his beloved. Instantly, he realized his mistake,
as Eurydice slipped back helplessly into the darkness. Orpheus
emerged into the light alone, and for the rest of his days roamed
the land, heartbroken, singing his tragic songs.
</P>
<P>
   In the myth, the Underworld _ the Greeks' symbol for the
unconscious _ could not be successfully breached by Orpheus/Reason
without losing the object of its quest. The contents of the
unconscious could not be pulled out into the sunshine and
comprehended in conscious, rational terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Freud asserted that they could, and he has convinced most of
the rest of us that he was right. His theories, once radical, are
now everyday. His observation of the stages of infant development
today seem obvious to any observant parent: the oral stage,
dominated by feeding; the anal stage, with attention shifted to
endless diaper changes; and the genital stage, signalling the first
hints of sexual awareness. After the mindless destruction of World
War I seemed to deny the life force itself, Freud put forth the
idea, in ``Beyond the Pleasure Principle,'' that humans struggle
daily with two opposing forces: Eros, the life force, and Thanatos,
the death force. Whenever we talk about someone having a death
wish, Freud is there.
</P>
<P>
   He's also there when we say something sexual where a sexual
reference was not intended _ we call it a ``Freudian slip.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's there whenever his grossest generalization, the Oedipus
complex, is taken seriously. Generalizing from the results of his
own self-analysis, in which he found himself attracted to his own
mother in childhood, Freud asserted it to be true of all children,
male and female alike (which has recently found him favor in
lesbian circles). The actual story of Oedipus in Greek mythology
probably points to something far less sexually specific: that a man
is likely to follow the pattern set out for him in youth, to
attempt to duplicate the home he was raised in and to replace (to
``kill'') his father. But the myth is now so wrapped up with Freud
that it is hard to disentangle it.
</P>
<P>
   Freud's reputation crested sometime midcentury and has since
been under sustained attack. Where once Freud was a hero of popular
culture _ the 1962 Hollywood howler ``Freud'' cast Montgomery Clift
as the bearded cigar-smoker and featured the oracular tones of
director-narrator John Huston comparing Freud to Christ _ he is now
passe, a name with little resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, the scholarly world, too, has tended more to
Freud-bashing than to Freud hagiography. In ``The Memory Wars:
Freud's Legacy in Dispute (New York Review, 1995),'' author and
former Freudian Frederick Crews dismissed Freud as ``the discoverer
of vague general truths about human deviousness.'' E. Fuller
Torrey, in ``Freudian Fraud (Harper Collins, 1992),'' made a case
that there is no scientific basis whatsoever for Freud's theories.
</P>
<P>
   Long before either book was published, no less a figure than
Ludwig Wittgenstein, one of the century's greatest philosophers,
pointed out perhaps the single greatest flaw in Freudian theory. If
Freud had indeed discovered dark things in the unconscious, how
could he possibly prove they were things of meaning? A cause is not
a meaning. Event A may cause Behavior B without imbuing B with a
particular meaning.
</P>
<P>
   A child may learn to repress sexual urges that do not correspond
to parental expectations, but, well . . . so what? Nothing
scientific can be drawn from such an observation. An additional
element is needed, Wittgenstein observed, to give the event and its
repression meaning: the very unscientific one of mythology.
(Wittgenstein's observations about Freud, scattered throughout his
career in essays and lectures, are gathered in ``Wittgenstein Reads
Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious,'' by Jacques Bouveresse,
translated by Carol Cosman (Princeton University Press, 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   So, Freud's power depends, not on any factual, scientific
observation about humanity, but on the skills he had as a writer
and self-promoter to convince us that looking at life his way _ at
every neurosis as a repressed desire, at every dream as wish
fulfillment, etc. _ is the right way to look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Psychoanalysis is a myth without hard scientific basis.
Paradoxically, it's a myth that loses potency when stripped of its
supposed factual basis, becoming then just one possibility among
many others. Freud himself was adamant that his theories be
considered ``correct.'' In ``The Ego and the Id (1923)'' he wrote:
``The fact that in the technique of psychoanalysis a means has been
found by which the opposing force (repression) can be removed and
the ideas in question made conscious renders the theory
IRREFUTABLE.(ITAL)''
</P>
<P>
   The claim to irrefutability was part of Freud's myth.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Orpheus and Eurydice was a myth about the
exploration of the unconscious. Its moral was that knowing the dark
side of ourselves is not possible except in the symbols of art _
Orpheus' music.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of Freud was a modern version of same in which knowing
our unconscious selves in rational terms is not only possible, but
factually verifiable according to the theories of psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the old myth, and not the new one, more accurately
represents the human condition? Not all myths are equal. Some got
there first because they state a truth that lies at the center of
our existence.
</P>
<P>
   If the story of Orpheus is truer than the story of Freud, then
our conscious and unconscious selves are not meant to communicate
in the way Freud wanted them to. In psychoanalysis, the language of
the conscious self dominates the unconscious; the unconscious is
invaded. The Orpheus myth would lead us rather to leave the
unconscious alone on its own terms, and content our conscious
selves with meditating on the symbols of art and spirituality that
are the universal language of the unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   In very general terms, this is what Carl Jung did. The Swiss
student of Freud trumped his teacher's belief in the unconscious by
giving the unconscious its due, developing a whole new branch of
psychology that diverged from Freud by dwelling not on repressed
sexual urges but on the meaning of symbols from the unconscious. He
let the unconscious speak in its own language.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of plumbing the darkness inside ourselves, sexual or
otherwise, may have begun to pale. The latest trend in therapy is
philosophical therapy, which is an exact denial of psychological
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   According to philosophical therapists, our duties as people are
to develop conscious discernment and leave what cannot be discerned
to dreams, art and religion. In a time when Freudian theories have
decayed to the point that respect is given to every smirking sexual
reference on daytime television talk shows, it's a refreshing
concept. &QL;

MIKE WALLACE `FEELING BETTER' ABOUT `INSIDER'; SWEEPS SCHEDULING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Wallace said he still has not seen the movie ``The
Insider,'' Michael Mann's re-creation of the most turbulent moments
of Wallace's career as a correspondent for CBS's ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   But after many months of anguish about how he is portrayed in
the film (by Christopher Plummer), Wallace said this week that he
was finally ``feeling better about the whole business.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason, he said, was the number of reports he has gotten
from friends and colleagues who have seen the film, which opens
Friday. ``Everybody is saying I really don't look so bad at all in
it,'' Wallace said. He added that he had heard that Plummer stands
a chance of being nominated for an Oscar for his performance as
Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason he is less tortured about the movie, and far
more important to Wallace, is the backing he received this week
from CBS management. CBS News president Andrew Heyward sent out an
internal memo to the CBS News staff Monday in which he said the
film ``casts a very misleading light'' on Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   As late as Thursday, Wallace was still wrenched at the prospect
of seeing his reputation tarnished by the movie, which covers CBS's
decision not to broadcast an interview that Wallace and his
producer, Lowell Bergman, had done for ``60 Minutes'' with Jeffrey
Wigand. Wigand, a former executive for Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco,
was the first tobacco insider to make public charges of morally
corrupt practices by a big tobacco firm.
</P>
<P>
   Under orders from its legal department, ``60 Minutes'' did not
broadcast the interview but used an edited version that skipped
most of Wigand's most volatile charges. At the time Wallace
acknowledged that he agreed with that legal decision.
</P>
<P>
   A day later he changed his mind so radically that he pushed to
make an appearance on the CBS Evening News to explain his change of
heart. In an interview that night, he argued against the decision
to block the interview and even made one especially impassioned
protest, saying, ``This is the first time I really feel I have been
let down by the company.''
</P>
<P>
   That part of the interview never got on the air. The scene of
Wallace doing the interview and exploding at the CBS lawyer when
his harshest comment does not get on the air is in the film.
</P>
<P>
   But Wallace said he had been told that in the film it comes not
one day after his initial acquiescence to the lawyer's decision but
is portrayed as taking place only after Bergman (played by the
movie's star, Al Pacino) has had days or weeks to work moral
suasion on him.
</P>
<P>
   That is total nonsense, Wallace said, as he has for months. He
is also bothered by some other details he knows are still in the
movie _ including one scene in which Bergman says he's going to
quit CBS. ``Lowell worked another two years here,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   But the edge to his anger about the film seems to have
dissipated. ``I'm very pleased Heyward said what he did,'' Wallace
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Heyward, who was also involved as the executive producer
of the CBS Evening News at the time, said in his memo, ``From the
outset, Mike was fighting with all the means at his disposal to get
his interview with Wigand on the air. Far from accepting the
company line, Mike was vociferous and public in his campaign and in
his criticism of his own corporate bosses.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the Mike Wallace character that Wallace would obviously
prefer Mann to have created in his movie. Still, he said, he
recognizes that the story is dramatic and ``basically a good idea
for a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I was feeling so benign about it all that I called
Michael Mann about it.'' He said he told Mann that he wished the
director had ``done the film the way I said to do it,'' but in the
end told him he agreed it was a good subject for drama and
concluded, ``Live and be well.''
</P>
<P>
   Crying in Vain
</P>
<P>
   Even though it winds up damaging their overall ratings, the big
four television networks continue to schedule enormous program
jousting tournaments during the so-called sweep months.
</P>
<P>
   The practice reaches a peak early in November when the four
networks slug it out Sunday night with a wave of programs, each of
which would, on other nights, probably lead to a big ratings
victory.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday, CBS begins its heavily promoted music-based
mini-series, ``Shake, Rattle and Roll,'' at the same time that NBC
is beginning its own heavily promoted Irish-based mini-series
``Leprechauns.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, meanwhile, finally brings back ``The X-Files'' for a new
season the same night. And over at ABC, the network will unveil the
latest of its revivals of Broadway musicals with ``Annie'' from 7
to 9 p.m. The rest of these ultra-expensive shows all go
head-to-head at 9.
</P>
<P>
   Network executives, like CBS Television president Leslie
Moonves, have been increasingly open in condemning this practice,
saying it hardly serves the viewers to stockpile the best programs
and then run them all on the same nights.
</P>
<P>
   But the networks continue to do it so they can perform at the
highest possible level for affiliated stations, which use the sweep
month ratings to sell advertising.

MOVE TO FURTHER REDUCE CATCH EXPECTED TO IRE NE FISHERMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The longstanding argument between scientists and fishermen over
whether New England's waters are being dangerously over-fished is
about to heat up.
</P>
<P>
   According to a key scientific report released Tuesday, some New
England fishing grounds are rebounding from decades of
over-fishing, but regulators need to sharply reduce the catch of
everything from cod to winter flounder to meet new conservation
goals set by Congress,
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Multispecies Monitoring Committee, a
scientific panel that tracks the region's most commercially
valuable fish, said the cod population in the Gulf of Maine has
gotten so small that regulators need to consider closing more
sections of the ocean to fishing _ this time close to the coast of
Maine and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The sobering report, which comes on the heels of five years of
ever-tightening fishing regulations, is sure to be controversial,
especially as fishermen report improved catches in the more distant
Georges Bank area after several lean years.
</P>
<P>
   But conservationists said the recommended cuts, while painful,
are necessary to prevent fishermen from depleting one fish species
after another as they try to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that, despite annual agonizing over needed
cutbacks in fishing as well as millions of taxpayer dollars spent
to buy back boats, there is still way too much fishing pressure on
New England's ocean fish stocks,'' said Sonja Fordham of the Center
for Marine Conservation in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Multispecies Monitoring Committee found that the cutbacks in
New England fishing so far aren't deep enough to meet the goals of
the 1996 Sustainable Fisheries Act, in which Congress called for
fish populations to be rebuilt in 10 years or less.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the report suggests a 67 percent reduction in
fishing for cod on Georges Bank, even though thousands of square
miles already have been closed to fishing since 1994, and, this
year, fishermen report that the cod catches are abundant.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the panel called for 60 to 94 percent cuts in fishing
in seven of the 11 main groundfish stocks, stocks that account for
half the $107 million value of all fish landed in Massachusetts.
Only yellowtail flounder off Cape Cod and on Georges Bank can
sustain more fishing, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen Tuesday labeled some of the proposed reductions
ridiculous, especially after the most plentiful summer of
codfishing in years. But scientists warn that the fishermen are
getting a false impression of abundance because cod tend to
congregate in reduced territory as their numbers dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   The findings still must be turned into proposed fishing limits,
something that the New England Fishery Management Council will do
only after public hearings and not before the 2001 fishing season.
However, council staff members hope the report will guide the
17-member council in planning for next year's limits as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to be cognizant of what is coming down the road,''
said Phil Haring, an analyst at the council who serves on the
Multispecies Monitoring Committee. ``It doesn't make sense for them
to do something (in 2000) that is not consistent with what they'll
have to do the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Most urgently, the committee said immediate action is needed to
restore the record-low cod population in the Gulf of Maine, the key
species for small-boat fishermen from Gloucester, Mass. to
Eastport, Maine. The committee urged regulators to either close
fishing areas altogether or cut in half the number of days
fishermen are allowed to fish.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, relatively few fishermen have given up fishing
altogether, in part because they've been able to shift from
depleted fishing grounds to others that are more healthy. Tuesday's
report, observers warned, may end that practice by forcing
regulators to crack down more broadly, setting tough limits even
for obscure species such as American plaice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no more options to simply shift fishermen from the
depleted cod stocks to others that are better off because they are
all in bad shape now with just a few exceptions,'' said Doug
Hopkins, a member of the Fishery Management Council and attorney
for the Environmental Defense Fund.

HINT OF FIRE PROBLEM HALTS BOEING JET DELIVERY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wash .)  (fb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ The Boeing Company has halted delivery of 34
planes, and is discussing with the Federal Aviation Administration
whether it will have to repair several hundred already delivered,
after discovering that too much glue was used to put together a
cockpit part, the company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The part, called a moisture barrier, is designed to keep
condensation inside the plane from dripping into electronic
equipment in the cockpit, and will perform that function, Boeing
said, despite the newly discovered problem. But, the company said,
that problem increases the part's flammability beyond the relevant
standard.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said that it could not yet tell exactly when workers
began producing the barrier incorrectly but that the wrong method
had been used for much of this year on the company's 747, 757, 767
and 777 jetliners. Boeing's only other high-volume product, the
737, has a different kind of moisture barrier.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was not present on the Egyptair 767 that went down
off Nantucket on Sunday, said John Dern, a Boeing spokesman who is
here in Newport for the investigation of that crash. The Egyptair
plane was built 10 years ago, when the part was still being
produced according to the specifications agreed to with the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   The events that led to the discovery of the problem began last
Thursday, when a Boeing technician realized that the moisture
barriers, which the company produces in a plant in Spokane, Wash.,
did not match the engineering drawings for them. Boeing reported
the discrepancy to the aviation agency and ran a flammability test,
which the part failed: It took too long for the flame to die out
once the incorrectly produced barriers were set afire.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   An official of the aviation agency explained the problem this
way:
</P>
<P>
   One component of the barrier, fiberglass insulation, is covered
in a layer of Mylar, sheet polyester, which is flammable. The
insulation is supposed to be glued to the Mylar only around the
edges, leaving the Mylar free to shrink in case of fire so that it
does not burn very long. But for some time, this FAA expert said,
Boeing has been spraying the Mylar with glue so that it adheres to
the entire surface of the barrier. As a result, the Mylar cannot
shrink, and burns longer.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The aviation agency is now performing tests at its Atlantic
City, N.J., technical center to determine what should be done about
the several hundred affected planes delivered over the last year or
so.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hawk, Boeing's director of airplane certification, in
Seattle, said in a statement, ``This is not related to any
accident, incident or in-service event,'' and the FAA agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But where the aviation agency said Boeing had halted production
of the affected models of aircraft, Randolph C. Harrison, a company
spokesman, said adamantly, ``Production has not been interrupted.''
Only delivery has been halted, Harrison said, and that move may
soon be reversed.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's governing party pledged to turn over a
new leaf this year by making its first presidential primary open,
clean and fair. But since Francisco Labastida Ochoa seems to be the
president's choice, many old guard party leaders are backing him
with the dirty electoral tricks that have kept the party in power
for 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Party chiefs in one gulf coast town ordered a municipal
bulldozer to block the road leading to a rally last week for
Labastida's main rival, Roberto Madrazo Pintado. Some school
teachers nearby were given time off to help in Labastida's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a popular radio talk show host was forced off the air
a few months ago after broadcasting an interview with Madrazo. More
recently, television newscasts, strongly influenced by the
government, have been giving Labastida overwhelmingly lopsided
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   And all across Mexico, state governors and town mayors from the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, have
been handing out groceries, building supplies and other gifts to
buy votes for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't act like a bunch of idiots _ we have to guarantee a
victory for Labastida!'' said Roberto Albores Guillen, the PRI
governor of Chiapas state, swearing like a drill sergeant last
month as he dressed down a group of the party's legislators who
questioned his orders that they work for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   That outburst found its way into some Mexican media, and
Madrazo's campaign filed a complaint with the party.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents are embarrassing to a party that has mixed
paternalistic populism with electoral skullduggery to elect 11
consecutive presidents but was supposed to be shedding its
authoritarian past.
</P>
<P>
   In March, President Ernesto Zedillo renounced the lengthy
tradition by which Mexican presidents, who are limited to one
six-year term, handpicked their successors. Two months later, the
PRI scheduled its first primary election for this Sunday, pledging
that all four candidates would run as equals.
</P>
<P>
   But Labastida, who stepped down as Zedillo's interior minister
to seek the nomination, has been seen as an ``official candidate''
who is Zedillo's choice _ despite the president's repeated
protestations to the contrary. But the perception persists partly
because many of Labastida's top aides are Zedillo intimates. Also,
his leading rival, Madrazo, has magnified the impression by
portraying himself in a flurry of television commercials as a rebel
defying the president. He has infuriated PRI officials in these ads
by insulting Labastida and thumbing his nose at the party
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexican political tradition, every six years after the
president named the new PRI candidate, a ritual followed: ``la
cargada,'' or the charge, in which party leaders rushed to publicly
proclaim obsequious loyalty to the future president.
</P>
<P>
   This year, party rules guarantee equal competition in the
primary _ at least on paper _ and there was to be no cargada. But
Mexicans have recognized a 1999-style cargada anyway, with old
guard PRI leaders trampling on the new rules to demonstrate
allegiance to Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders of the PRI are simply overwhelmed,'' said Agustin
Basave Benitez, a former PRI congressman who has studied the
party's history. ``The rules are being broken and they can't keep
order.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Several surveys show Labastida to be leading, but since the PRI
has never staged a primary, even many pollsters acknowledge that
nobody can predict the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that the favoritism is helping Labastida, and in
many cases it is embarrassing him. He has several times distanced
himself from PRI leaders accused of committing campaign abuses on
his behalf. In an interview, he interpreted the support shown him
by PRI officials as acts of personal friendship, rather than as a
new cargada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of friends,'' Labastida said.
</P>
<P>
   Among his best friends have been Mexico's television
newscasters, who are heavily influenced by interior ministry
officials. Rafael Gimenez Valdez, a respected private pollster,
said that Labastida has been receiving far more air time than his
three competitors combined. Last week, for instance, he got triple
the time of all his rivals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labastida's dominance in the news programs is overwhelming,''
Gimenez added.
</P>
<P>
   One broadcaster who sought balanced coverage lost his radio
show. Felipe Manzanares, the host of ``Good Morning Sinaloa,'' was
forced off the airwaves in June after he broadcast an interview
with Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
   Manzanares said Sinaloa state officials told him Emilio Gamboa
Patron, a former cabinet minister who is an aide to Labastida, had
pressured broadcasters to cancel his show. Gamboa denied that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never gone against any journalist,'' Gamboa said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, a popular Mexico City radio talk show host also
blamed Gamboa, then Labastida's deputy at the interior ministry, of
engineering his ouster.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond news coverage, Labastida's campaign has also benefited
from more concrete government support, as PRI governors and mayors
have been handing out everything from building supplies to school
scholarships to buy votes.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has used these tactics in several recent state
elections. In July elections for governor in the state that
surrounds Mexico City, for instance, one in every three voters who
cast ballots said they had received groceries or other government
aid before the vote, and 80 percent of recipients voted for the
PRI, according to a private study.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mexican journalists have documented vote-buying in the PRI's
own primary. The magazine Proceso, for instance, reported that
government resources have been used on Labastida's behalf in half a
dozen states.
</P>
<P>
   In western Colima, officials handed out roof tins and cement. In
Michoacan, a PRI congressman distributed chickens. In southern
Oaxaca, a government welfare agency paid Indians 60 pesos, about
$6, to attend a Labastida rally, Proceso said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're having a rally, the Labastida supporters schedule
other events at the same time,'' Madrazo said in an interview.
``They do lottery drawings, they hand out scholarships, roof tins,
groceries. And all these things come from the state government.''
</P>
<P>
   As Madrazo arrived with a reporter in San Andres Tuxtla, in the
palm-dotted hills of the Gulf Coast, there was news of more dirty
tricks. Seeing that Madrazo supporters were boarding buses in a
suburb to meet the candidate near the central plaza, authorities
sympathizing with Labastida dispatched a municipal bulldozer to
block the road leading into the city. Madrazo supporters were
forced to get off the buses and walk a mile into town to hear
Madrazo's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think they can scare us with their threats!''
Madrazo told the San Andres crowd. ``They tried to stop our buses
coming to this rally. They think they can buy the votes and
conscience of the Mexican people.''
</P>
<P>
   His campaign has filed detailed complaints over a dozen similar
incidents, but the most severe punishment a PRI disciplinary
committee has meted out so far has been a verbal reprimand. All the
chicanery has embittered relations between the Madrazo and
Labastida camps, and Madrazo's complaints appear to be preparing
the way for a broad challenge of the primary results if he loses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't paid any attention to our complaints so far, but
if they defraud us, we're going to make them feel it hard, I
swear,'' Cuauhtemoc Garcia, a Madrazo coordinator in the state of
Mexico told local reporters.

 By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the question: Now that Regis Philbin has a prime time hit
all his own, is he beginning to contemplate life without Kathie Lee
Gifford?
</P>
<P>
   He starts to yell. ``Joy, get in here! Twelve minutes into this
and she's asking the tough questions. Joy!''
</P>
<P>
   This is a change at least from the grumbling, when Philbin first
walked into his Manhattan apartment on the 51st floor and
discovered the windows completely socked in by fog. ``Just my
luck,'' he said, roaming from one to another. The guy has been
killing himself in show business for 40 years, he finally makes it
big, and his views are mushroom soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello.'' The voice is pure sanity and it is Joy Philbin,
Philbin's wife of 29 years. They met on ``The Joey Bishop Show,''
where Philbin was Bishop's sidekick and she was Bishop's secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin repeats his pleas for help. Mrs. Philbin's expression
remains pleasant while she completely ignores him and talks about
the guest list for dinner that night at the Museum of Television
and Radio, where her husband will be honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like being honored. It makes me uncomfortable'' is
what he has to say.
</P>
<P>
   She turns to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, you're leaving me here?'' he demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, dear,'' she says, shaking my hand. ``Nice to see you.''
</P>
<P>
   He throws up his arms in a gesture out of the Yiddish theater.
Abandoned. Alone. Woe is him.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, enough. In addition to starring in his hit morning show,
``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee,'' Philbin is the host of the
biggest hit in television this year, ABC's game show ``Who Wants to
be a Millionaire.'' It was shown tournament-style for two weeks in
August, ending its run with a whopping 31 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, it begins again every night for the next two weeks
just in time for sweeps (including two nights in combination with
ABC's ``Monday Night Football''). Philbin, professional pill, finds
himself his network's biggest star.
</P>
<P>
   All kidding aside, that's a very big deal. Not only is Philbin
66 _ ancient by Hollywood, if not human, standards _ but when ABC
first bought the rights to ``Millionaire,'' which originated as a
huge hit in Britain, Philbin was not anyone's idea of a host.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name was not on the list, thank you very much,'' he says
now. ``My agent had sent me a tape of the show and I loved the
production values. I wanted to be a part of it. So I had to pitch
them. I was relentless. I have never felt that I was high on ABC's
priority list for anything. And yes, I could have said, `You don't
want me, I don't want you.' I guess I was hurt a little bit. But I
got over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting over it just may be Philbin's biggest talent. From his
beginnings as a stagehand at KCOP-TV, a local station in Los
Angeles, to jobs as host of other local shows like ``Regis
Philbin's Saturday Night in St. Louis,'' Philbin worked for 20
years in broadcasting before receiving real acclaim as co-host of
``A.M. Los Angeles'' in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, his national exposure consisted of 26 weeks of his
own late-night show and the stint as second banana on ``The Joey
Bishop Show.'' During the '60s, the '70s and the '80s, Philbin
says, he was unemployed for at least a year of each decade, which
only paralyzed him with more fears that his Italian-Irish family in
the Bronx had been right after all and he had no place in
television.
</P>
<P>
   But the doubts and the knocks and the underdog hard work paid
off; not only did he find the perfect foil to his exasperated
Everyman in Kathie Lee Gifford, his scandal-plagued sidekick on the
morning show, which started locally, then went national, but the X
factor of ``Millionaire's'' success seems to be _ besides the
money, of course _ that Philbin genuinely wants the contestants to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This show is serious,'' he says. ``These people are trying to
win a lot of money to have it for the first time in their lives. I
don't want to intimidate them.''
</P>
<P>
   If the numbers are good enough during this go-round, the show
may be broadcast again _ maybe regularly during sweeps seasons,
maybe even weekly. So, let's get down to business. When is his
morning show contract up?
</P>
<P>
   He sighs. Granted, Philbin is in a pickle here. Like Laurel and
Hardy, or the Two Fat Ladies, he is bound to Ms. Gifford in his
fame. So, the original question about feeling liberated was
legitimate. The man not only has a wife at home; he has one at work
too. And she is the quintessential loose cannon.
</P>
<P>
   The ``host chat'' segment of their hourly show is 20 minutes
long and completely unscripted. While Philbin makes dutiful rounds
of movie premieres and Broadway opening nights looking for
anecdotes to share the next morning, Ms. Gifford shows up either
tear-stained and betrayed by her elderly husband, or tear-stained
and excoriated by Honduran children forced to make her clothing
line for a pittance. You can certainly see why Philbin called his
1995 autobiography ``I'm Only One Man.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His contract, he says, is up in August 2001. Hers is up next
year. ``They keep us separate so if one leaves the other is still
there,'' he says. Before Ms. Gifford joined the show, Philbin
worked with Cindy Garvey and Ann Abernathy, but his chemistry with
his current co-host is unsurpassed.
</P>
<P>
   He squirms on the couch. ``I try to be compassionate to Kathie
Lee,'' he says. ``She's a lightning rod.'' He smiles. ``What is the
question again?''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he says: ``I have to feel for her. Honestly, how is she
supposed to know the labor situation in a factory in Honduras?'' He
sighs again. ``Yes, we're joined at the hip for that one hour,
there's no doubt about it. What happens to her becomes the point of
the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Only to an extent. Philbin's grumpy-uncle-with-a-heart-of-gold
routine provides the backbone that makes everyone feel secure no
matter Ms. Gifford's high jinks du jour. It's what Philbin calls
``keeping it small.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people come on like gangbusters when they're doing a
morning show,'' he says. ``They do all the magazine covers, go
everywhere, do everything. I never had that, never tried for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a notorious business for burning out fast. I'm with
you every morning, we're having our coffee, you're having yours.
There's nothing urgent about the show. It's just time together.''
</P>
<P>
   Time that makes an impression on people. Following a recent
``Live'' performance, Philbin was all but mauled by the studio
audience, half of whom had Instamatic cameras and a friend who just
had to shoot them with their arms around Reege, as they like to
call him. He accommodated them all.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin understands fans so well because he is one himself; he
proudly displays his Dean Martin Fan Center newsletter, and he
plays tapes of the singer in his office. ``Don't you love Dean
Martin?'' he asks earnestly. ``Doesn't he lift your spirits?''
</P>
<P>
   It's an endearing quality to find in a celebrity and a welcome
relief from Philbin's shtick, which is so ingrained at this point,
he seems practically incapable of shedding it. But in a moment
following the show when he was alone in his office, he paced
hurriedly in front of his closet, shoulders hunched, seemingly bent
with worry.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anything was wrong; it was a customary stance for an
off-duty funny person who, by definition, sweats alone. When he
realized he had company, he stood up straight and the shtick was
on.
</P>
<P>
   You can imagine him growing up in the Bronx, a shy, gawky kid at
Cardinal Hayes High School, listening to Bing Crosby and dreaming
of becoming a singer. At Notre Dame, he was still so shy he
couldn't bring himself to knock on the door of its radio station.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest childhood influence was his uncle Mike Boscia, a
press agent for CBS who would bring his star-struck nephew
backstage to ``The Arthur Godfrey Show'' and tell him that ``99.9
percent of these people who want to be in show business aren't
going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Philbin's father, whom he describes as ``a real guy who went to
business every day,'' was a personnel director for Sperry Gyroscope
and had his doubts about his son's career path. ``I guess I was
trying to prove to myself and my family that I didn't make the
wrong decision,'' Philbin says. ``When I was out of work I would
think, `Maybe everybody was right.' But I was trying to make them
see I was right. That I could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents did live long enough to see some of his success,
though by the time ``Live'' really took off they were gone. He is
close to his own children; Joanna is a first-year law student at
Notre Dame; her sister Jennifer is a writer on ``Saturday Night
Live.'' He also has a daughter and a son from a previous marriage:
Amy, a singer who lives in Los Angeles, and Dan, a news producer
based in Washington who overcame serious birth defects that
necessitated the amputation of his legs, and whom Philbin proudly
calls ``a gutsy kid.''
</P>
<P>
   As for their father, he has been in the business long enough to
know that everyone loves a success until they envy a success, then
turn on it _ so already, he's backpedaling. ``Maybe `Millionaire'
won't be as gigantic a hit in November,'' he's saying now. ``August
is a pretty easy time. I got lucky with this show. I thought I had
climbed my mountain with the morning show. Big hit locally and
nationally. And all of a sudden this `Millionaire' show comes along
and I'm pushed to another mountain peak. I really don't dare ask
anything more. This is it. What else can I want?''
</P>
<P>
   You can practically see the light bulb go off over his head as
he starts to shout. ``I want this interview to be over with
already!''

 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fiona Apple showed up late for an interview with her
excuse on a makeshift leash. It was a black-and-white wire-haired
mongrel that had been abandoned in the New York subway. Ms. Apple
and her manager, Andrew Slater, were walking through Central Park
when they came across some policemen offering the dog to passers-by
as an alternative to the city pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an adult dog and no one's going to take it and it would
be done away with,'' Ms. Apple said in a nervous rush. ``I feel
like it's your fault if you know something might happen to that dog
and you don't do something. That dog never did anything to anybody.
And I would have been sitting here wondering.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Apple, clearly, is a worrier. In her songs, she broods about
guilt and responsibility, agonizing over why love goes wrong and
who sabotaged the latest liaison. She's buffeted by her own passion
and insecurity and tormented by people who take advantage of her or
suddenly turn indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   In the songs on her two albums _ her second one is due for
release on Tuesday _ she ricochets from anger to self-laceration,
from bitter memories to tentative promises. Her second album brings
new complexities: shifting, metamorphosing music that shadows ever
more unsettled relationships.
</P>
<P>
   While her publicist called People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals about placing the dog, Ms. Apple settled on a couch at her
publicist's office to talk. She was voluble and fidgety, putting on
and pulling off a pair of gloves while she spoke about music and
fretted about the dog.
</P>
<P>
   Since she lives in Los Angeles, she would be unable to take it
home herself. Partway through the interview, a woman arrived from
the animal rights group (for whom Ms. Apple has recorded public
service announcements) with a leash and an assurance that the dog
would live.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Apple, now 22, started working on her first album,
``Tidal,'' when she was 17. Its songs, including the 1996 hit
single ``Criminal,'' pondered the desires and choices that arrive
with adolescence. When the album appeared, Ms. Apple was praised
for frankness and mocked for self-absorption. By the time she was
old enough to vote, it had sold two million copies.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't hold herself back. In interviews she revealed that
one song, ``Sullen Girl,'' was about getting raped when she was 12,
and she mentioned her years of psychotherapy, her fears and her
compulsive rituals. When she received the MTV Video Music Award for
best new artist in 1997, she blurted out a speech that concluded,
``It's just very stupid that I'm in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   While nominees who were carrying their thank-you's on index
cards rolled their eyes, the diatribe made Ms. Apple seem earnestly
unpolished, an arty high school girl who had somehow landed in show
business.
</P>
<P>
   Yet her gawkiness ended at her music. Ms. Apple's sultry voice
and troubled phrasing gave her songs a precocious gravity. So did
her piano-centered melodies, harking back to standards and blues.
</P>
<P>
   While other musicians her age were learning basic guitar chords
or techniques of sampling as the 1990s began, Ms. Apple immersed
herself for a year in ``The Real Book,'' a collection of Tin Pan
Alley songs, to teach herself jazz harmony after she gave up
classical piano lessons.
</P>
<P>
   The title of the new album (Clean Slate/Epic 69195) hands new
evidence to those who consider Ms. Apple self-indulgent. It's a
90-word pep talk: ``When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He Thinks Like
a King/What He Knows Throws the Blows When He Goes to the Fight/And
He'll Win the Whole Thing 'fore He Enters the Ring/There's No Body
to Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might/So When You Go Solo, You
Hold Your Own Hand/And Remember That Depth Is the Greatest of
Heights/And if You Know Where You Stand, Then You Know Where to
Land/And if You Fall It Won't Matter, Cuz You'll Know That You're
Right.'
</P>
<P>
   The screed, she said, was sparked by a derisive story and
letters about her in Spin magazine. ``I was crying, like, `This
can't be happening,''' she said. ```People are personally attacking
me way too much, and I need to remember that I do everything for
the right reasons.' I question my motives, I make myself proud, I
am a good person, I've never done anything to hurt anyone, and this
is not me that they're putting down. This is something that they've
created.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to write something, the same way that I write songs,
when I feel like I need to clarify something to make myself feel
better. I didn't have a piano because I was on a bus, so I wrote a
poem. And then I figured, I'm going to get into a lot of this stuff
again where I'm probably going to get attacked a lot. To remind
myself, I'll just make it the title.''
</P>
<P>
   On the new album, her bravado rises and ebbs, song by song. The
word ``crazy'' keeps turning up; she applies it to herself, but she
also lashes out at someone who uses it to keep her weak and
dependent. ``Call me crazy, hold me down, make me cry, get off now,
baby'' she snarls in ``Limp.'' But in ``Paper Bag'' she admits, ``I
know I'm a mess he don't want to clean up.''
</P>
<P>
   Crazy or not, she won't be dismissed. ``When the Pawn ... ''
shows increasing musical confidence, a willingness to let songs
crack open or take odd turns while her voice grows tender or
vehement. She growls, lets loose elaborate melismas, works up to
near-sobs or spits out bursts of words; her voice quivers and
breaks with suppressed fury.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestral passages and strange keyboard sounds slip in behind
the piano, bass and drums, and the late-1960s Beatles seem to hover
on the sidelines of Jon Brion's production, spurring Ms. Apple to
try the extra chord change or let another instrument poke through.
</P>
<P>
   Like the music, the romances in Ms. Apple's songs are
increasingly unstable. Ms. Apple is still mulling over what happens
when a lover decides to be just friends and she's still enmeshed in
intimate power games. This time, however, she's enveloped in
contradictions and ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   Her lyrics, as the album title suggests, aren't graceful
reading; they're made to be sung. ``You're all I need,'' she
insists in the album's opening song, with her voice growing more
heated as she repeats the line. But she can't convince even
herself: ``Baby, say that it's all gonna be all right/I believe
that it isn't,'' she concludes.
</P>
<P>
   She knows she's not blameless; ``Fast as You Can,'' her new
single, signals its mood swings _ love me, fight me, don't go, get
out while you can _ with tempo changes and unlikely interludes,
from a blunt hip-hop drumbeat to flutelike ``Strawberry Fields''
keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   In ``To Your Love,'' she apologizes to people she's driven away.
But in other songs, like ``Get Gone'' and ``The Way Things Are,''
she sees all too clearly that she ought to escape a relationship
yet can't force herself to break free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't learned those lessons,'' Ms. Apple said. ``I mean,
I've learned them, but I'm not done with them. But at least it's a
step to write it down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Pawn ...'' is an album of fascinating solipsism;
while the lyrics wrangle, the music seems to understand every
flip-flop. The combination of painful, sometimes clumsy honesty and
punctilious craftsmanship makes Ms. Apple sound as if she's growing
up on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   And she may be starting to enjoy the process, traumas and all.
``I'm gonna make a mistake, I'm gonna do it on purpose,'' she sings
in ``A Mistake,'' over a taunting guitar lick. ``And if you wanna
make sense, whatcha looking at me for?''

AN ART DECO MASTER WHO TURNED IRON INTO LICORICE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edgar Brandt, the French Art Deco blacksmith, rarely
seems to have forged an iron rod into anything but spirals, judging
from the decorative and architectural metalwork he produced from
1901 to 1942. And currently there is much to see of his
spiral-embellished work that once sold widely in the United States,
especially in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt devised metal spirals that were far from ordinary. Using
oxyacetylene torchs and power hammers, he bent and twisted metals
into flowers, clouds, snakes and waterfalls for the jewelry,
tables, stair railings, fire screens, radiator covers and gates.
</P>
<P>
   As his metalworking skills grew ever more sophisticated, he
diversified his signature-like spirals, making images that ranged
from the sparest flattened coils seen in neolithic pottery to the
jagged embroidered clouds bordering Qing dynasty robes.
</P>
<P>
   The spirals and a great deal more are visible in ``Edgar Brandt:
Art Deco Ironwork and Photographs from the Atelier,'' an exhibition
at the Moderne Gallery in Philadelphia, through Dec. 24. Many of
the 40 objects in the show _ lamps, tables, paperweights, bookends,
fire screens and decorative sculpture including a leaping deer _
and 60 photographs of Brandt's designs are illustrated in the new
book that inspired the show, ``Edgar Brandt: Master of Art Deco
Ironwork,'' by Joan Kahr, published recently (Harry N. Abrams,
$60).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved ironwork, especially the work of Edgar
Brandt,'' said Robert Aibel, the collector-turned-dealer who owns
the Moderne Gallery. While most of the objects on view are not for
sale, 13 are. They range from $2,500 for a cast-iron change holder
in the shape of a pelican to $27,500 for a pair of andirons
depicting owls and serpents.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no major architectural works in the show, the
book mentions several Manhattan buildings where Brandt's
distinctive grillwork can be seen surrounding the doors, windows
and even radiators in the lobby, as at 181 Madison Avenue, at 34th
Street, the former showroom of Cheney Brothers, textile merchants,
and at 320 East 57th Street, an apartment house.
</P>
<P>
   Also absent from the exhibition are any of Brandt's furnishings
masterpieces like ``Oasis,'' a glowing five-panel screen emblazoned
with overlapping images of arches and gilded flowers against a
background of spirals. The exquisitely wrought imagery in
``Oasis,'' like so many of Brandt's greatest pieces, was inspired
by the work of another artist, the lacquered screens of Jean
Dunand.
</P>
<P>
   Today most of Brandt's architectural ironwork has disappeared
from the facades of buildings and is now used like sculpture
indoors. At the Art Deco gallery of Anthony DeLorenzo at 958
Madison Avenue in Manhattan, there is a massive grill, eight feet
tall with spiral clouds radiating from an image of storks flying
into the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use it as a room divider,'' DeLorenzo said. This tour de
force of metalwork from 1922, which was derived from a Japanese
textile, costs $325,000.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt's collaborations with prominent designers often produced
works that were more innovative in their patterning than those he
made alone. His gates at the entrance to the 1925 Exposition des
Arts Decoratifs Industriels Modernes in Paris reiterated the motif
of frozen water that Rene Lalique had molded in the glass atop the
towering columns that framed the gates.
</P>
<P>
   And in Brandt's metalwork at an Au Bon Marche department store
in Paris, there is a greater than usual simplicity, attributed
possibly to Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann, the chief designer on that
project.
</P>
<P>
   Forty tons of Brandt's brass grills and railings from that store
were acquired 15 years ago by Gil Shapiro, an owner of Urban
Archaeology, dealers in architectural artifacts with two stores in
lower Manhattan. Some panels of balcony railings, depicting palms
in a waterfall of spirals and measuring two feet wide and three
feet high, are still available, at $5,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started looking at Edgar Brandt's metalwork in the late
1960s in a junkyard in South Beach, Miami,'' Shapiro said. ``That's
where I found a pair of his snake-shaped bronze floor lamps. At the
time, I was a lover of objects, a hoarder of things you didn't need
a lot of money for. But when I came across the lamps, I had to have
them and bought them for $300. They were ugly, old and out of
style, and they were were missing their Daum glass
reflector-shades. But I thought they were wonderful and well worth
the price.'' (Such lamps sell for more than $60,000 each today.)
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro still owns most of the Brandt pieces that he bought as a
collector. ``I love them,'' he said. ``Brandt was a brilliant
blacksmith. He worked with many different metals _ iron, brass,
bronze, nickle and copper _ and made iron look like licorice. It
was amazing: the crispness of it, the flowing lines on everything,
from napkin holders to garden gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro says he gets a kick out of looking for Brandt's
signature. ``He signed every piece of metal he ever made, not
because he was egotistical, but because he was precise, and maybe a
bit of a tease,'' he said. ``The signature _ E. Brandt _ could be
tiny, a quarter the size of a pinky nail. I've been looking for
that signature for 9 years on a pair of 10-foot-tall driveway
gates,'' he said. ``Maybe I don't really want to find it _ the fun
would be over.''

   NORMAN-ROCKWELL-ART (Undated) _ Who was the most popular
American artist of the century? Norman Rockwell, obviously. The
Saturday Evening Post already had a circulation of two million
readers a week when Rockwell first walked through its doors in
1916. You might say that the magazine was akin to what television
became in terms of general appeal, and Rockwell quickly rose to be
its premier draftsman, doing 322 covers during the next 47 years. A
couple of years before he died in 1978, at 84, 10,000 people turned
out for a Rockwell parade in tiny Stockbridge, Mass. Saturday the
High Museum in Atlanta began a national tour of works by Rockwell
that ends up in 2001 at the Guggenheim in Manhattan. By Michael
Kimmelman.

look at working there today by four members of the younger
theatrical generation. By Andrea Stevens.

<P>
   FITZCARRALDO-VIDEO (Undated) _ ``I want my opera house,''
screams Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald, known as Fitzcarraldo, from the
top of the bell tower in the Peruvian Amazon town of Iquitos.
Toasted as a ``conquistador of the useless,'' the rabidly
enthusiatic and mostly failed entrepreneur, portrayed with mad
nonstop ardor by the wild-eyed, spike-haired Klaus Kinski, has
heard Enrico Caruso perform in Brazil and is determined to erect a
building grand enough to lure the singer for a gala evening deep in
the bush. By Peter M. Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   MY-BEST-FRIEND-FILM (New York) _ ``My Best Fiend,'' at the Film
Forum in Manhattan through Nov. 16, is the German director Werner
Herzog's documentary about his tumultuous, love-hate relationship
with Klaus Kinski, the actor who starred in five of Herzog's
feature films. When Kinski published his autobiography, ``Kinski: I
Need Love'' (``Kinski Uncut'' in the English translation) just
before his death in 1991, he wrote disparagingly of Herzog: ``I've
never in my life met anybody so dull, humorless, up-tight,
inhibited, mindless, depressing, boring, and swaggering.'' Now,
with ``My Best Fiend,'' Herzog has a chance to set the record
straight, or at least tell his side of the story. By Gilberto
Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ROSETTA-FILM (Undated) _ Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, brothers
who dazzled critics everywhere with ``La Promesse'' three years
ago, have come back with an even better film and a tougher one.
``Rosetta,'' which opened on Friday, had its American premiere last
month at the New York Film Festival. Discussing the movie with the
audience afterward, Luc Dardenne used battle language to describe
its heroine, played by Emilie Dequenne, a newcomer. ``She's at war
with the world that won't let her in,'' he said. ``To her, it's a
fortress she's trying to storm. But she becomes a fortress in the
process, and it nearly kills her.'' By Karen Durbin.

   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PEARL-THEATER (New York) _ Shepard Sobel has some truly radical
notions about the theater, and if they start getting around,
there's going to be trouble. ``I think the most interesting take on
Chekhov is Chekhov's take,'' he says. ``I'm not going to improve on
that. My basic thing is, trust the playwright and the text.'' Sobel
not only preaches this wild heresy, he also practices it in his own
little hotbed of classicism, the Pearl Theater Company. By Peter
Marks.
</P>
<P>
   BROADWAY-THEATER (New York) _ For one brief, shining moment, and
it really wasn't much more than that, there flourished on the
island of Manhattan a bold and glittering realm of theaters, or so
legend has it. It was called Broadway, in reference to the arterial
avenue that ran through it. And those who are old enough to
remember swear that there was a time when this neighborhood
comprising 40 square blocks held up the most scintillating of all
cultural mirrors to the urgency, energy and impudence that was New
York. That moment was a matter of two mere decades, give or take a
few years _ that period between world wars when the mind of a new
country was finally catching up with its overgrown body. By Ben
Brantley.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTIC-THEATER (New York) _ How does a nonprofit off Broadway
company measure its success? In the case of the Atlantic Theater
Company, the answer may go back to the Stoics. ``We measure what we
do against our larger guiding principles,'' says the group's
artistic director, Neil Pepe. While most theater troupes have the
vaguest of mission statements, the Atlantic Theater has what its
members refer to, without irony, as a philosophy. This credo _
mixing the Greeks and the myth-based writings of Joseph Campbell
with Konstantin Stanislavsky's principles on acting _ was handed
down in 1985 by one of the company's founders, David Mamet. By
Steven Drukman. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   OFF-BROADWAY-THEATER (New York) _ This month is an anniversary
of sorts: the beginning of the seventh year I have been covering
theater as a regular beat. Not the least of the discoveries for a
man who had been made numb after decades of total immersion in
films: that Off Broadway (including Off Off Broadway) is not just
an alternative New York theater, but virtually the entire New York
theater. Broadway continues to exist, but mostly as a glitzy, very
dear sideshow for attractions of greater scope and grander
aspirations in other neighborhoods. By Vincent Canby. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GARTH-FAGAN-DANCE (Rochester, N.Y.) _ On a recent morning, the
12 members of Garth Fagan Dance arrived at company headquarters in
downtown Rochester excited that they would be learning a new Fagan
work later in the day. The piece, ``Woza,'' which means ``Come'' in
Zulu, set to a commissioned score by the South African composer
Lebo M, will have its world premiere during the company's two-week
engagement at the Joyce Theater, beginning on Tuesday. By Valerie
Gladstone.

   KING-ROGER-OPERA (Undated) _ Karol Szymanowski's ``King Roger''
is a beautiful opera with qualities that work against its survival.
At 80 minutes, it is too short for a full evening, and finding a
suitable partner for a double bill is not easy. ``King Roger,'' if
the composer's elaborate directions are followed, is complicated to
stage, this coupled with the fact that in terms of theater, very
little happens in it. A debate between the Apollonian and Dionysian
spirits is rich food for contemplation, but grand opera craves
direction and movement, something more on the lines of Mimi and
Rodolfo. But the opera has had uncharacteristic exposure recently.

   MASUR-MILLENNIUM-MUSIC (New York) _ Kurt Masur's idealism
pervades his talk about music. He professes to believe that music
can contribute to a dialogue about life and liberty. So with the
approach of the year 2000, he decided to ask six composers from
around the world to write works expressing their visions for the
new millennium. As music director of the New York Philharmonic,
Masur would conduct the pieces in a full evening's program to be

filling holes in the Paris cultural scene. By Alan Riding.

fact, Warhol's art and ideas didn't find musical expression until
the Velvet Underground was long defunct. The arts don't evolve in
temporal lock step, and it wasn't until the mid-'80s, largely
because of advances in technology, that pop music began to explore
the territory Warhol had opened up long before. By Tony Scherman.

   FIONA-APPLE-ALBUMS (New York) _ Ms. Fiona Apple, 22, started
working on her first album, ``Tidal,'' when she was 17. Its songs,

and choices that arrive with adolescence. When the album appeared,
Ms. Apple was praised for frankness and mocked for self-absorption.

documented in detail how wartime industry was retooled to create

much to see of his spiral-embellished work that once sold widely in
the United States, especially in New York. The spirals and a great

BUSH CALLS FOR SCHOOLS TO DISCIPLINE STUDENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GORHAM, N.H. _ Calling for better discipline and an improved
moral climate in the classroom, George W. Bush on Tuesday proposed
pumping more funds into character and abstinence education while
holding schools and students more accountable for violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, the front-runner for the GOP presidential
nomination, also promised to seek a greater role for religious
groups in after school programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's push to improve discipline comes only months after a
critical state audit that found Texas' safe schools program had
failed to remove dangerous students from the classroom and had
become a dumping ground for minority and poor students.
</P>
<P>
   In an address Tuesday to the White Mountain Chamber of Commerce,
Bush characterized the nation's public schools as having suffered
too long from moral relativism and a breakdown in student conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children must be educated in reading and writing _ but
also in right and wrong,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem comes, not when children challenge the rules,
but when adults won't defend the rules,'' he said. ``And for about
three decades, many American schools surrendered this role.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's education speech _ his third on the issue _ comes a week
after he skipped a town hall meeting at New Hampshire's Dartmouth
College. Bush drew criticism for failing to appear with other
Republican opponents, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is
inching up on Bush in all the statewide polls.
</P>
<P>
   While parroting the traditional GOP argument that the federal
government ``must be humble enough to stay out of the day-to-day
operation of local schools,'' Bush immediately laid out a plan that
included a larger role for Washington in dealing with student
conduct and education.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with discipline problems, Bush said, he would require
schools that receive federal funding under the Safe and Drug-free
Schools and Communities Act to submit reports on their safety
records, which then would be available for public inspection.
Parents would be allowed to transfer their children out of the most
dangerous schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also would require schools receiving federal safety funds
to institute a zero-tolerance policy against disruptive behavior,
meaning that teachers would have the ability to remove students who
are violent or unruly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush argued for more accountability, citing reports of federal
money earmarked for safe schools being spent for unrelated matters,
such as school puppet shows and junkets for school administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the Texas Safe Schools program, created by the
Legislature in 1995, has been criticized for not accomplishing its
goals of ridding schools of dangerous students.
</P>
<P>
   A state auditor's report in September said that during the
1997-98 school year there were at least 850 incidents, including
255 involving knives and 74 involving firearms, when
problem-students were not removed from their regular classroom and
placed in alternative programs, as required by state law.
</P>
<P>
   The audit also found minority students comprise 55 percent of
the school population but 72 percent of the programs for students
with disciplinary problems. The Texas safe schools programs cost
about $50 million in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that George W. Bush is preaching to New Hampshire
voters about how to create safer schools when his own record in
Texas is more in line with the National Rifle Association than the
National Education Association,'' said Joe Andrew, chair of the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In his New Hampshire address, Bush also said that he would push
for a measure that would protect teachers, principals and school
board members from what he termed ``meritless federal lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also proposed spending more federal money to promote his
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate said he would triple the $8 million the federal
government now spends on character education efforts, arguing that
he wanted schools to stress such broad themes as respect,
responsibility, self-restraint, family commitment, civic duty,
fairness and compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would increase taxpayer funding for abstinence
education, claiming that such programs have been successful
``because more teenagers understand that true love waits.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he would provide as much money for the
abstinence programs as he said the federal government now pays for
teen-contraception programs. Bush campaign materials claim the
federal government now spends about $135 million annually on such
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also waded into the separation of church and state
controversy saying that students should be allowed to pray in
schools and religious groups should be allowed to participate in
after school activities.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would funnel more money into faith-based groups to
make it easier for them to be involved in after school activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools must never impose religion _ but they must not oppose
religion either,'' he said. ``Religious groups have a right to meet
before and after school. Students have a right to say grace before
meals, read their Bibles, wears Stars of David and crosses and
discuss religion with other willing students. Students have a right
to express religious ideas in art and homework.''
</P>
<P>
   The prayer in the school issue has bedeviled many school
districts. As Texas governor, Bush has sided with the Santa Fe
school district south of Houston in its challenge of federal court
decisions barring school prayers at football games.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has been criticized by Democrats for opposing gun
control measures in Texas, used the address to emphasize his
support for stepped up enforcement of federal laws that makes it a
crime to bring a gun to school.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting an activist role for the federal government in the
area of education is not new for Bush. In his previous speeches
Bush also advocated that the federal government reward schools that
perform well with more money and withhold funds for lower
performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day Bush met with residents of Dixville Notch,
the tiny town that traditionally casts the first ballots in the
presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to ask for your vote. I've been raised that if a
politician doesn't ask for somebody's vote they don't get it,'' he
told 22 of the 29 registered voters who had gathered in the
enclave's ballot room.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the meeting was closed to the media. Bush later
told reporters he had a ``good frank, discussion'' with the locals.

BENEATH THE LAWNS, SEEDS OF DISCOUNTENT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some shows stick in the mind. For example, ``World War II and
the American Dream,'' an exhibition presented in 1994 at the
National Building Museum in Washington, strongly influenced my view
of suburban development.
</P>
<P>
   The show documented in detail how wartime industry was retooled
to create the economic infrastructure of the post-war consumer
society. Talk about the ghost in the machine! Beneath the malls,
the lawns, the garages lay this subterranean realm of bombers,
explosives and tanks.
</P>
<P>
   I thought about the show earlier this year on reading news
reports of violence at high schools in suburban Littleton, Colo.,
and Conyers, Ga. Could it be that this militaristic past had come
back to haunt the American dreamland superimposed atop it?
</P>
<P>
   I thought of the Washington show again on a visit to ``Charles
and Ray Eames: A Legacy of Invention,'' now on view at the
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York. Not
coincidentally, both exhibitions were organized by the same
curator, Donald Albrecht, now on the Cooper-Hewitt staff.
</P>
<P>
   The two shows tell much the same story but from radically
different perspectives, and the fact that both stem from the same
curatorial intelligence adds immeasurably to their depth. Together,
they offer a disturbing parallax view of suburbia's present
discontents. And they provide a background for understanding what
was sacrificed by the suburban exodus of the postwar decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Eames show documents the work of the most influential
designers of that period. Including their chairs and tables,
magazine layouts, and corporate exhibitions, the show centers on
the couple's own house, a 1949 glass pavilion in Pacific Palisades,
Calif. The house, manufactured from ready-made industrial
components, was an idealized vision of what American life could be
like in peacetime _ affordable, bucolic, efficient in the manner of
Frank Lloyd Wright's Usonian houses, a place of Japanese serenity
spiced with modern technology, the appliances of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   As the show demonstrates, the Eameses were not really designers
of postwar America's physical landscape. They were orchestrators of
a myth about that period's potential. In the catalog, Peter
Smithson compares the two to art directors, their work to layout,
display, cut-and paste. (The installation by Craig Hodgetts and
Ming Fung mirrors this sensibility.)
</P>
<P>
   In the cold war, the Eameses were enlisted as propagandists for
the West. In 1959, the two created a multiscreen slide show,
``Glimpses of America,'' that was shown in the pavilion built by
the United States at the Moscow Trade Fair. Like the nearby model
kitchen, site of the famous debate between Richard Nixon and Nikita
S. Khrushchev, the Eames' presentation showcased the superior
standard of living enjoyed by American workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cooper-Hewitt show, there is a photograph of Charles
Eames' head inside a model of the pavilion, a dome designed by
Buckminster Fuller. Eames could be a manifestation of the Wizard of
Oz, or a Western equivalent of Big Brother, spouting slogans to
extol the joys of free enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   In the World War II show, a pair of photographs documents a
camouflage village created to hide an aircraft factory in Santa
Monica, Calif. The first picture shows the village as it might have
looked to an enemy aircraft with a telephoto lens. A bathing beauty
sits by the side of the road, casually trimming a shrub. Behind her
are shrubs, hedges, trees.
</P>
<P>
   But this bucolic image turns out to be an illusion sewn on
camouflage netting, as we see in the second picture, taken from a
street in the factory complex below. In the context of Albrecht's
show, this diptych could be taken as a metaphor for American life
in the cold war years and beyond: the alluring image of suburbia as
a cover for the machinery of consumer production. The difference
this time is that the camouflage was designed to deceive Americans
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One object appeared in both shows and is a splendid symbol of
the links between them: a leg splint of molded plywood, designed by
Charles Eames for the Air Force in 1942, and initially modeled on a
leg of his. It was the first of the molded-plywood experiments that
eventually produced the famous chairs manufactured by Herman Miller
in the 1950s. Designed for wounded pilots, the splint might have
come in handy as American families strode into the postwar consumer
society.
</P>
<P>
   For whose legs could have held out in the ruthless race to
acquire gracious living? The house! The car! Huff and puff ... The
major appliances! The hobbies! Quick, the splints! Some for Buzz
and Princess, too! The color TV! The lawn mower! The second car!
The second house! CRACK-K-K-K! More splints! More splints! Aspirin,
Miltown, Prozac, Ritalin ... The past half-century is suddenly
revealed to be a Depression-era dance marathon, held in a
make-believe ballroom that stretches from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   Wartime production lifts the United States out of the
Depression, suburban life keeps the wheels turning, but there is
still a need to dance on and on, faster and faster, or else we
might fall through the camouflage netting, disappear entirely from
view, be swallowed up by the subterranean realm where chimneys
belch and garbage piles up in bigger and bigger heaps.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Louis Sullivan wrote, ``Once you learn to look upon architecture
not as an art, more or less well or more or less badly done, but as
a social manifestation, the critical eye becomes clairvoyant, and
obscure, unnoted phenomena are illumined.'' Since the killings in
Columbine, people have been speculating on possible connections
between violence in suburban high schools and the planning, or lack
of it, of suburban communities.
</P>
<P>
   The dispersal of houses, the social isolation that results from
it, have been held partly accountable for crimes and panic once
associated with the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   This diagnosis is much sounder than the one that blames the
entertainment industry for glamorizing violence. But how closely
can we really afford to peer into the heart of this social
manifestation? A lot is riding on our willingness to keep it going.
</P>
<P>
   Housing starts. Fuel, asphalt and car production. If any of this
were to go, we would end up with a home-front version of the cold
war domino effect. Malls, theme parks, edge cities, office
campuses, multiplexes, highway cloverleafs would topple in quick
succession. More than half the population would tumble through the
camouflage net of prosperity into bread lines, soup kitchens and
other scenes straight out of the 1930s. Millions of desiccated
lawns would produce the Dust Bowl all over again. It's much easier
to point a finger at gangsta rap.
</P>
<P>
   Should we be optimistic that a solution will be found in the
compact communities envisioned by the so-called New Urbanists?
Appealing to what are essentially nonurban ideas of harmony and
conflict avoidance, they are as likely to increase social isolation
as to overcome it.
</P>
<P>
   The period styles of New Urbanist communities like Seaside and
Windsor in Florida, the re-creation of a small-town America that in
truth never existed, are a denser and more expensive form of
camouflage draped over the machinery of consumer manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth recalling a project designed by John Hejduk.
Inspired by the Stanley Kubrick film ``The Shining,'' Hejduk's
``New England Masque'' depicts a Palladian-style country house
inhabited by a couple who never meet. The house is completely
symmetrical, its two halves joined by the living room. The easy
chairs facing one another resemble suits of armor with masks and
gauntlets that seal off faces and hands.
</P>
<P>
   Hejduk's project carries an implicit criticism of suburban
values. Like ``The Shining,'' it suggests that the impulse to flee
the city stems from a psychological disorder that can have
disastrous consequences. People can dwell beneath the same roof and
remain permanently estranged. Lessening the distance between the
roofs isn't likely to cure an illness of the inner life.
</P>
<P>
   To extend the idea further: the postwar separation from the city
was inherently violent. The rejection of spontaneous social
contact, of the unplanned, the unscripted, of conflict and
diversity, of history, of life itself, was a traumatic uprooting
that no mythology could wish away.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators have adopted the view of psychologists and
social workers that what is most lacking in suburban life is the
means to satisfy the human need for attention: getting it, giving
it, competing for it, losing it.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may well feel closer to sitcom or talk-show versions
of community than to the folks they're watching TV with. It should
not be surprising to find such people acting out a rage that could
be allayed by walking down a city street.
</P>

CONTINENTAL BUCKS TREND TOWARD CURBS ON CARRY-ON LUGGAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (duplication warning: also sent with `t' code)  
 (bl)  
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Short of war and high school, there are few times when as much
general antipathy prevails as those moments when several hundred
people, fumbling with clunky carry-on bags, squeeze onto a fully
booked airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants especially loathe this part of the trip, which
occasionally involves unpleasant confrontations with passengers
unable to find stowage space for their carry-ons. The Association
of Flight Attendants, which represents 46,000 flight attendants at
26 carriers in the United States, is now lobbying for a federal law
that would impose industrywide restrictions to reduce carry-ons by
50 percent (while limiting passengers to a single bag, 13 pounds or
less, whose combined length, width and height cannot exceed 45
inches). Safety, the union says, is the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year or so, most airlines have begun restricting
carry-ons, both in size and number. But carry-on policies at two
airlines that have excellent reputations for service among business
travelers illustrate the difficulties that the union and the
industry in general may be facing in achieving mandated
one-size-fits-all rules on what a passenger can tote on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not bag cops,'' said Sarah Anthony, a spokeswoman for
Continental Airlines. ``This is a competitive issue, not a safety
issue.'' To the dismay of the flight attendants' union, Continental
is aggressively leading a charge against proposed federal rules to
mandate strict restrictions on carry-ons that every airline would
have to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just not going to be part of this trend,'' Ms. Anthony
said. ``Our policy is, as long as there's space on the aircraft and
there's room in the overhead bin and it can be stored safely
according to the law, then our customers are allowed to bring their
bags on,'' with no restriction other than those suggested by
fundamental common sense and the understanding that bags that can't
fit, once the space is full, will instead be checked.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, to accommodate more carry-ons, Continental spent $14
million enlarging overhead bins on 150 of its aircraft. Also, new
planes coming into the fleet all have bigger overhead bins, Ms.
Anthony said. ``People want to bring on board what's convenient for
them. Laptops, for example. Their overnight bags. For goodness
sakes, why not let them bring that with them? We believe our policy
works.''
</P>
<P>
   The carry-on issue got attention in recent years as many
airlines cut back on storage space to cram in more seats. At the
same time, flights became increasingly crowded, and flight
attendants often found themselves unhappily adding baggage handling
to their growing list of chores. Meanwhile, more passengers,
especially business travelers, began carrying all of their luggage
on board because they no longer trusted the checked-baggage service
to provide reliability or promptness.
</P>
<P>
   While Continental is openly proclaiming its amenability toward
carry-ons, another carrier with a good reputation among business
travelers, Southwest Airlines, has actually managed to maintain
good will while toughening up its policy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, after noticing that the growing volume of carry-ons was
starting to slow down aircraft boarding, Southwest began a humorous
``don't be a bin hog'' campaign. It was designed to reduce excesses
while allowing the accommodation of reasonable amounts of
carry-ons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appeal was mostly to customers' common sense,'' said Linda
Rutherford, a Southwest spokeswoman. ``It really worked for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a short-hop carrier, we have always handled a greater
amount of carry-on luggage than long-haul airlines,'' she said.
Thus customers ``knew the drill,'' understood the problem, and saw
the logic of reasonable restrictions, she continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you only bring two carry-ons and they're right size, there
is room for everyone on board that aircraft to bring on their
luggage,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, many airlines, echoing their flight
attendants, have become downright grouchy about carry-ons. Paul
Hudson, the executive director of the Aviation Consumer Action
Project, an air-passenger advocacy group, said that airlines were
trying to blame passengers for ``a problem that has been primarily
caused by the airlines'' as they reduced storage space and cut back
on service, both on board and at terminal checked-baggage
operations. One in every 200 passengers, he said, experiences a
problem with a lost, delayed or damaged bag.
</P>
<P>
   Given those odds, ``If you travel more than a little bit, the
chances are you would have had one of these bad experiences. And
you will be wanting to carry on as much as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, he added, is that ``the airlines for many years
encouraged people to carry on bags because it meant less baggage
for them to handle, which cost less money.
</P>

NONTOXIC DRUG SHOWN TO HELP REDUCE RETURN OF BREAST CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A nontoxic drug related to Vitamin A that sharply reduced the
risk of recurring breast cancers in young women unexpectedly cut
their risk of ovarian cancer as well, according to a new report.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said that the study needs confirmation but said it
could lead to a new and apparently safe form of breast cancer
prevention in premenopausal women.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, called fenretinide, had a less potent protective
effect than tamoxifen, another breast cancer preventive, but has
fewer side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Julia Lawrence at the National Cancer Institute called the
results ``very promising'' and added, ``this is not a definitive
trial'' but provides data ``we need to follow up on.''
</P>
<P>
   The report in the current Journal of the National Cancer
Institute is from the European Institute of Oncology, a private
nonprofit research and treatment center in Milan. Dr. Umberto
Veronesi, the institute's director, is the lead author of the
paper.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 2,972 women aged 30 to 70 who had had surgery
for early (stage 1) breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ, a
premalignant type of breast lesion. They were assigned randomly
either to receive daily doses of fenretinide for five years or to
have no additional treatment.
</P>
<P>
   These women, because of their earlier cancer, had a four to five
times-higher risk of developing another breast cancer in the
opposite breast or the same breast than women at normal risk.
</P>
<P>
   Fenretinide, a chemical analogue of Vitamin A, has been
previously studied as a cancer preventive. It works by imposing
order on cells that are becoming malignant by growing more
disorganized and growing out of control. Additionally, said
Veronesi, fenretinide forces cells that are becoming dangerously
immortal to go through normal cell death, or apoptosis.
</P>
<P>
   After the women's health had been monitored for seven years, the
researchers compared the drug-treated and control groups. There was
a total of 214 cases of breast cancer, 129 in the control group and
85 among those receiving fenretinide.
</P>
<P>
   But when the scientists analyzed the data further, they found
that only women who were premenopausal received the benefit: their
risk of a second cancer dropped by about 35 percent. Among
postmenopausal women, in fact, there was a slightly increased risk
of developing a second cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Veronesi said in an interview that the reason for this isn't
completely clear, but may be related to the interaction of the drug
and estrogen, which postmenopausal women have in much less
quantity.
</P>
<P>
   The drug also showed an effect against ovarian cancer, which is
much less common than breast cancer but more lethal. ``During the
five years of treatment, there was not a single case of ovarian
cancer in the treatment group but we had six cases in the control
group,'' said Veronesi.
</P>
<P>
   Veronesi said the researchers are now conducting studies
combining tamoxifen (which has shown a 50 percent reduction in
breast cancer risk among women, both pre- and postmenopausal) with
fenretinide. They also plan to give the drug to postmenopausal
women who are taking estrogen replacement, to see if that will work
better as a preventive than it did in non-estrogen-taking
postmenopausal women.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial accompanying the report, a cancer
biostatistician, Dr. Steven Piantadosi, said the report has some
statistical weaknesses but should be followed up. ``We can neither
dismiss fenretinide as producing no effect nor can we endorse it
for use in premenopausal women'' solely on the basis of this study,
he wrote.

 &HT;    Huddle House pairing with hotel chains
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Huddle House has entered into a co-branding deal with
a Virginia-based franchisee to develop the 24-hour restaurants
alongside hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The deal involves only one property, but Huddle House President
Philip M. Greifeld said it could be expanded to include as many as
seven more.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Lonesome Pine Dining and Lodging Inc. is the first
Huddle House venture in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about the growth opportunities with Comfort Inn
to establish a nice relationship, with more to come,'' Greifeld
said.
</P>
<P>
   Greifeld said some of the additional sites would be co-branded
locations and others might be freestanding Huddle Houses, with
Lonesome Pine serving as the franchisee.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last few years. Decatur-based Huddle House has been
on an aggressive program to revamp and expand its restaurant chain.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the company unveiled a new prototype and plans to
increase its co-branding efforts as well as open new freestanding
units. Currently, Huddle House has co-branding deals in several
travel plazas across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Huddle House has more than 335 company-owned and franchised
restaurants in a dozen southeastern states and Missouri.

U.S. ACCESSS TO RUSSIAN NUCLEAR SITES BECOMES SENSITIVE ISSUE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Tuesday was supposed to be a banner day for
U.S.-Russian cooperation. The U.S. ambassador was scheduled to cut
the ribbon at a gala opening of a U.S.-financed business center in
one of Russia's closed nuclear cities.
</P>
<P>
   But after Russian authorities barred him last week from bringing
his top science adviser or inspecting other U.S.-Russian projects
at the site, known as Krasnoyarsk-26, Ambassador James Collins
angrily canceled his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson protested the Russian
restrictions in terms so strong last weekend that Russian Atomic
Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov stormed out of the room in Denver,
Colo., where both were attending a conference.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has worked hard
to protect nuclear materials in Russia and to prevent them from
falling into the hands of Iran, Iraq or other aspiring nuclear
powers. But the question of access to Russian nuclear sites, always
a sensitive issue, has become increasingly troublesome of late.
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of reasons, including the frustration of the
Russians over restrictions placed on their visits to the U.S.
Energy Department's headquarters and laboratories, the sheer number
of American visitors to the Russian weapons complex, and a residual
distrust within Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy of U.S.
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Another key factor is the influence of Russia's internal
security service, the FSB no friend of expanded cooperation with
the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time that we are making significant progress on
the nuclear cities initiative we are starting to experience more
access problems,'' Richardson said in a telephone interview. ``We
have set up a task force to examine access questions and resolve
what is becoming a problem: the continued interference by the FSB
with our joint operations.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that nuclear cooperation is on the verge of
breaking down. Experts from U.S. nuclear laboratories and the
Pentagon work with their Russian counterparts in ways that were
unthinkable during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's uneven policy on access is threatening to erode
support in the U.S. Congress for the Clinton administration's
program to create civilian jobs within Russia's closed nuclear
cities _ nuclear-weapons complexes where 750,000 Russians live, but
which remain off-limits to foreigners and Russians lacking special
permits.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the latest dispute over access, Congress slashed the
administration's primary program of assistance to the closed cities
to $7.5 million from the $30 million proposed for fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Certainly, the access problems at Krasnoyarsk-26 came as an
unpleasant surprise to Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the center he was to inaugurate is to help develop
new businesses, an important step toward creating employment for
former weapon scientists and reducing their temptation to sell
bomb-designing skills abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities approved a two-day visit by Collins to
Krasnoyarsk-26 and, after some importuning, allowed him to bring
his interpreter. But they would not allow his main science adviser,
Thomas Maertens, to go. Maertens had been in Krasnoyarsk-26 earlier
this year, and Russian authorities sometimes like to limit the
frequency of such visits.
</P>
<P>
   Collins insisted that he, not the Russians, should be able to
determine the composition of his team.
</P>
<P>
   In canceling his visit, the U.S. Embassy sent Russia's Atomic
Energy Ministry a blunt letter noting that the restrictions were
hampering the ambassador's ability to monitor United States
assistance to Krasnoyarsk-26. Still, the business center was
inaugurated as scheduled by mid-level U.S. Energy Department
officials
</P>
<P>
   Russia's atomic energy minister declined comment. But Andrey
Katargin, the mayor of Zheleznogorsk, the civilian area within the
Krasnoyarsk-26 complex, complained that that some of the
restrictions Russian authorities have imposed on access to his city
are excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. ambassador is an important person,'' Katargin said in
a telephone interview. ``His presence would have increased the
status of the opening.''
</P>
<P>
   Krasnoyarsk-26 is not the only place where U.S. officials have
run into problems. Richardson has pressed unsuccessful to visit
Avangard, a factory for assembling and disassembling nuclear
warheads, which is located in the closed city of Arzamas-16.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has offered to provide funds to convert the
plant to civilian production if the Russians agree to shut it down
ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been problems at Mayak, where the United States
is funding the construction of a warehouse to protect bomb-grade
plutonium extracted from nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kuenning, a retired U.S. Air Force general who directs a
Pentagon program to help the Russians reduce their strategic
arsenal, said the Russians still have not provided the necessary
access for the new American project manager at Mayak. Russia's
Defense Ministry, he said, tends to be more cooperative than its
Atomic Energy Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access needs to be answered on a ministry by ministry basis,''
Kuenning said. ``We try to develop trust and chip away at it.
</P>
<P>
   Some former U.S. officials said the Russians are not the only
ones at fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a problem that exists on both sites,'' said Kenneth
Luongo, a former Energy Department official and the head of the
Russian-American Nuclear Security Advisory Council, a private group
that focuses on the problems of Russia's closed cities.
</P>
<P>
   Luongo said that the U.S. Energy Department headquarters has
imposed a new series of background checks for Russians. And while
foreign reporters have been allowed to visit Pantex, the U.S.
warhead disassembly plant, Russian visitors are not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians are slowly tightening the noose, but the United
States is doing the same thing,'' Luongo said.

OCEAN STORM HAMPERS FLIGHT 990 RECOVERY EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS AND THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Wind-whipped seas under leaden skies hampered
search efforts for human remains and pieces of EgyptAir Flight 990
Tuesday, as investigators sought out other pilots who had flown the
ill-fated Boeing 767 and complained of troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investigators are interviewing some EgyptAir pilots who
thought there was a problem with the thrust reversers,'' said a
high-ranking federal official speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Thrust reversers are flaps that mechanically extend behind an
engine to redirect its exhaust on landing to slow the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a Lauda Air Boeing 767, identical to the EgyptAir jet
and manufactured within days of it, crashed in a jungle in Thailand
when one thrust reverser deployed as the plane was climbing to
24,000 feet. All 223 people on board were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The source said members of an EgyptAir flight crew were
interviewed by FBI agents in connection with the crash because they
had flown the aircraft recently.
</P>
<P>
   Another federal source said he believed those pilots flew the
plane to Los Angeles hours before the crash; that could not be
confired. Flight 990 left Los Angeles with a stop in New York
before continuing on to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   When government aviation specialists interviewed them again
Tuesday, the crew members implied that the problem had been
corrected, but the initial comment has officials eager to review
the airplane's maintenance records in Egypt to confirm the problem
had occured and was corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the comments from the pilots, federal aviation officials
remain mystified by the crash of the Cairo-bound jetliner, which
took off from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport
early Sunday morning with 217 people on board. Within 30 minutes,
the plane had reached its cruising altitude of 33,000 feet but
suddenly plunged 14,000 feet in 36 seconds. Moments later, it
disappeared from radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   The plane began to break apart at around 17,000 feet, an
aviation source said.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing Tuesday, Navy Captain James M. Graham said search
ships have located the pinging signals from both so-called black
boxes, the flight data and cockpit voice recorders that are
expected to yield crucial data about the plane's final moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not have the actual distance between them. They're just
close,'' Graham told reporters. ``It's kind of hard to pinpoint
that far down. But they're close to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said deteriorating weather conditions forced Navy vessels
to seek safe harbor here Tuesday where they were expected to stay
for as long as 48 hours until the autumn storm blows past the New
England coast and farther out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have retrieved their side-scan sonars. They have stopped
their mapping operations and they are seeking storm evasions,''
Graham said. He said one of the pinging noises is apparently coming
from the center of the jet's debris field.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said the Navy salvage ship Grapple is expected to arrive
at the crash site by late Thursday. The searchers are likely to
depend on the Grapple's remote-controlled search vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the depth, we will be limited how long we can be
down on the bottom of the ocean with humans,'' the Navy captain
said. ``As we did with the Swissair 111 incident, we anticipate
this being more of a (remote) operation so we do not endanger the
sailors who are going down there diving.''
</P>
<P>
   Because there is no obvious cause for the crash, aviation
officials are reviewing security procedures for the flight and at
Kennedy International Airport, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Cathal Flynn, the chief security officer for the Federal
Aviation Administration, was taking center stage at FAA briefings
on the crash, a source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a little more prominent even though there is nothing
that says, `OK, it looks more like a bomb.' It is just that no one
can figure out what happened,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of FBI agents have been put on the case, while
officials continue to stress that there is no immediate evidence of
sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a briefing here Tuesday about reports that some people
on Nantucket saw a ``plume'' in the sky at the time of the crash, a
federal investigator calmly responded: ``I'm not aware of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also pursuing theories that a mechanical
malfunction brought the airplane careening into the Atlantic Ocean,
60 miles south of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Lauda Air crash, the FAA temporarily banned
the use of thrust reversers on Boeing 767s because the planes can
stop using brakes alone. In 1994, the agency issued an
airworthiness directive requiring airlines to install an extra
locking device on the thrust reversers.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane's manufacturer, Boeing, designed a mechanical lock
as a safeguard against unintended activation of the engine thrust
reversers. The company has said it knows of no significant
thrust-reverser problems since the FAA ordered its corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, however, there have been several instances of
deactivated thrust reversers partially deploying on landing. In
September, the FAA issued a notice that it was considering a
proposal requiring additional work on the thrust reversers to
prevent their deployment in flight.
</P>
<P>
   One commercial airline pilot who flies Boeing 767s expressed
confidence in the airplane Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A thrust reverser deploying in flight is not going to
happen,'' he said. ``It has been made physically impossible as near
as humans can possibly make it. I fly that airplane-engine
combination and it is just not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, who is familiar with crash investigations, said ``I
have no earthly idea what happend on that plane, but it was really,
really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   As relatives of the victims and the world's media continued to
arrive in this city synonymous with Gilded Age fortunes and
international yacht races, the human toll of Sunday's crash grew
mercilessly cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said there was little hope of recovering bodies
intact. ``As they move closer to the area and they get more detail,
it's becoming more terrible,'' said Nihad Awad, executive director
of the Council on American Relations in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery crew members wore surgical gloves and masks as they
plucked human remains and heartbreaking reminders from the sea,
like a pair of floating rollerblades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking of the people, hoping it was quick,'' said R.J.
Burns, chief engineer on the Coast Guard cutter Chinook, which
collected about 700 pounds of debris and human remains from the
crash site. ``I was thinking of what they were thinking for the
last 30 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Captain Russell Webster said what investigators at
first believed was a significant chunk of the aircraft, spotted
Monday and reportedly collected by a crane, was in fact a luggage
container.
</P>
<P>
   ``That object sank,'' he said. ``We did not recover it.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said the Navy will use the period of stormy weather to
prepare the salvage ships for speedy deployment once skies clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are not being delayed because we were planning on
having Grapple here,'' he said. ``All this does is delay the
mapping process. But at least we already have a good idea of where
to go and we can pick up on the mapping process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see this as a major delay. We're still making proper
progress in this operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash is the third major loss of life in the North Atlantic
in the last four years. In July 1996, TWA Flight 800 exploded off
Long Island en route to Paris. Investigators believe the plane's
center fuel tank exploded, killing all 230.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, SwissAir Flight 111, reported smoke in the cockpit,
and crashed off Nova Scotia while trying to make an emergency
landing in Halifax. All 229 people died.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such a wide range of possibilities that is why
everyone is waiting for the flight data recorder and the cockpit
voice recorder to be pulled from the ocean,'' said Michael Barr,
director of aviation safety programs at the University of Southern
California. ``Until then, it is kind of wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Because accidents have become so rare, Barr said, a cause other
than human error ``is often something you have never thought of in
your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you came up with a center fuel tank exploding before Flight
800 and told airlines they had to fix the potential problem, they
would laugh,'' he said. ``I have a feeling this is going to turn
into one of those events.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr said the crash is like a mystery novel, and ``we all want
to go to the last chapter. The only trouble is the last chapter is
250 feet beneath the water.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of the 30 years Bernie Thiel has been growing squash,
he has battled an invisible but potent adversary: viruses that can
turn his neat rows of sunny-yellow vegetables into a mottled,
sickly green harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see a virus in your fields, it makes you sick,'' said
Thiel, showing a visitor a patch of ruined squash in his fields in
Idalou, Texas, outside Lubbock. ``There is no cure for it. You're
done.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, Thiel fought back, trying out a yellow
crookneck that genetic engineers had armed with resistance to two
devastating viruses. In doing so, he has joined hundreds of other
American farmers embarking on what some scientists say is an
uncontrolled ecological experiment carrying unknown risks _ the
planting of millions of acres of genetically engineered crops on
American land.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agriculture Department, the primary agency responsible
for assuring the ecological safety of such plants, has never
rejected a single application for a genetically engineered crop.
Scientists who studied the approvals say the department has
frequently relied on unsupported claims and shoddy studies by the
companies producing the seeds. Department officials acknowledge
that their system for weighing applications is ``evolving.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, dozens of biotechnology crops have been approved for
sale to American farmers and hundreds more are in the pipeline,
with genes borrowed from every form of life _ bacterial, viral,
insect, even animal. American farmers like Thiel, seeking greater
yields and profits, have enthusiastically adopted the new plants,
using biotech seeds for 20 to 45 percent of the country's corn,
soybean and cotton last year. Most Americans have probably eaten
some food made with genetically modified soy or corn. But Thiel's
squash, produced by Asgrow Vegetable Seeds, was the first approved
bioengineered crop with the potential to spread its doctored genes
into the larger environment.
</P>
<P>
   While fears that such crops are unsafe to eat have stirred
popular alarm in Europe, and to a lesser extent in the United
States, some biologists say the more immediate concern is this:
that genetically modified plants could interact with the
environment in hazardous ways, and that federal regulators are not
demanding the proper studies to assess the risks.
</P>
<P>
   A close look at how the Asgrow squash made its way from the
laboratory to the dusty fields of West Texas, based on documents
and interviews, shows that the virus-resistant strain was approved
without rigorous study, setting what critics say is a lax standard
for assessing environmental risk.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment they first heard of the squash, scientists
worried most about the possibility that it could breed with wild
squash plants, creating a ``superweed'' that would proliferate in
the wild or in farmers' fields, comparable to relentless invaders
like the South's kudzu vine or the Great Lakes' zebra mussels.
</P>
<P>
   The critical question was whether viruses keep the population of
wild squash in check. Asgrow determined that they do not by
conducting a survey involving lab tests of 14 plants selected from
nine sites. None had the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in environmental risk say the study proved nothing.
``What if we asked if the most important disease controlling human
population sizes, malaria, was in fact an important disease?'' said
Dr. Norman Ellstrand, an evolutionary biologist at the University
of California at Riverside. ``If you took 14 random individuals
from around the world, the chances of picking one that has malaria
would be relatively low, making the chance of getting a misleading
result really high.''
</P>
<P>
   Even scientists at Asgrow admitted that they could have done a
more thorough job of providing information to the Agriculture
Department on the plant's ecological safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a learning process for all of us,'' said David
Tricoli, managing research scientist at Seminis Seeds, which now
owns Asgrow Vegetable Seeds. ``I'm a molecular biologist. I'm not
an ecologist.'' Tricoli said, however, that he believed the squash
posed no risks.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department officials involved in approving the
squash stand by their decision and note that there are no signs of
environmental damage. But five years after farmers were allowed to
begin planting the squash, another agency of the department funded
a study to determine whether the genetically engineered squash
could create superweeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we're making the best decisions that can be made
on the basis of the information that we have,'' said Keith Pitts,
policy adviser to the secretary of agriculture, who described the
agency's regulatory process as ``evolving.'' The Agriculture
Department announced Sept. 29 that the National Academy of Sciences
would be conducting a review of the agency's regulatory process.
Pitts added, ``We don't claim to have this system totally worked
out.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of studies suggest that the genetically
engineered crops could lead to rapid evolution of
pesticide-resistant insects, creation of new plant diseases and
harm to insects that benefit mankind. A recent laboratory study,
for example, showed that corn pollen engineered to carry a toxin
against the European corn borer can kill monarch butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually we are going to have some problems,'' said Dr.
Allison Snow, a plant ecologist at Ohio State University. ``I don't
think the risks are being taken seriously or addressed seriously by
the system we have now.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of genetically engineered crops say such fears are
overblown and are creating roadblocks for a technology that could
feed the world and offer a host of other benefits. For example, Dr.
Charles Arntzen, president and chief executive of the Boyce
Thompson Institute for Plant Research Inc., is developing bananas
that grow medicines and could act as child-friendly delivery
systems for vaccines. Arntzen compared the risk posed by
genetically engineered crops to the risk of getting hit by an
asteroid while sitting in his New York office. ``The real risk is
the hysteria,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, plant breeders have mated the plants bearing the
biggest fruits to produce plants with even bigger fruit, and the
hardiest plants to produce hardier ones. But emboldened by the
biotechnology revolution, researchers envision giving the world
crops that can do much more: fend off pests, thrive in hostile
environments and bear fruit offering better nutrition and
disease-fighting compounds. Soon, they say, genetically modified
plants will serve as biofactories growing plastics and other
products; one plant in development would grow cotton with polyester
built right into it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first companies to exploit the new technology was
Asgrow Seed Co. in Kalamazoo, Mich. In 1986 an Asgrow scientist,
Dr. Hector Quemada, teamed up with Dr. Dennis Gonsalves, a
biologist at Cornell University, to create a squash resistant to
viruses, the bane of farmers. Four years later they were taking
genes from two viruses devastating to squash and inserting them
into the DNA of normal squash. The genes produce proteins, known as
coat proteins, that encase a virus' genetic material. For reasons
not fully understood, coat protein genes provide powerful
resistance to the viruses from which they come. The result was the
creation of a squash nearly invulnerable to diseases associated
with the two viruses.
</P>
<P>
   But before Asgrow could begin selling its new squash, it had to
get the plant out from under government supervision. Regulations
for genetically modified crops required Asgrow to get federal
permission each time the squash was planted outside and to abide by
a number of safety procedures. If deregulated, the squash could be
freely sold or planted anywhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1992, Quemada and Tricoli petitioned the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, the main government body overseeing genetically
modified plants, requesting that the squash be deregulated. (The
Environmental Protection Agency regulates plants engineered to
produce pesticides; the Food and Drug Administration does not
require engineered products to go through an approval process, but
is available for optional consultations.)
</P>
<P>
   In its petition, Asgrow, then part of Upjohn Co., stated that
the plant presented no risk to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials and environmental groups watched the case
closely. The squash was the second plant to be considered for
deregulation, after the Flavr Savr tomato, and the first to raise
the possibility of significant ecological threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a test case,'' said Dr. Margaret Mellon, director of
the agriculture and biotechnology program at the Union of Concerned
Scientists. ``We were all testing the waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists were concerned that the squash might turn its
relatives into virus-resistant weeds by interbreeding with them.
The squash also posed the risk that its virus genes or the coat
proteins they produced might interact with other viruses to produce
new diseases. And, as with any genetically engineered crop, the
squash posed the risk that its new genes might cause it to spread
and become difficult to control.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after two months the Agriculture Department issued a
proposed ruling approving the squash. Environmental groups and some
state agriculture departments protested, prompting the Agriculture
Department to commission a report by Dr. Hugh Wilson, a squash
expert at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of backing up Asgrow and the Agriculture Department,
Wilson agreed with critics. In his report in July 1993, Wilson
found there was insufficient scientific information to draw
conclusions of safety and that studies ``point toward the clear
presence of risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's report revealed that Asgrow's petition contained
crucial errors and omitted information that pointed toward risk.
For example, Asgrow claimed that wild squash was unlikely to
interbreed with genetically engineered squash, despite much
scientific evidence to the contrary. Wilson's report also noted
that the wild relatives of the new squash were already problematic
weeds in some parts of the country, suggesting it might not take
much to push them into the category of superweed, another fact
omitted by Asgrow.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these findings, in the spring of 1994 the Agriculture
Department again proposed approving the new squash and issued draft
documents dismissing ecological risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have any strong evidence it would be bad,'' said
Dr. Snow, who wrote the department arguing against the ruling,
``but they didn't have any strong evidence it would be safe,
either. It was just a lot of guesswork.''
</P>
<P>
   The most contentious of the Agriculture Department's conclusions
in the draft documents was the dismissal of the superweed risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department acknowledged that the new squash
would interbreed with wild relatives and pass along its foreign
genes. But the virus resistance could only create a superweed
problem if viruses were preventing the spread of wild squash in
nature. Asgrow's research had already shown that the wild plants
were highly susceptible to viral disease in field experiments. In
order to determine how important viruses were in nature, the
Agriculture Department in 1993 asked Asgrow to conduct a survey of
wild plants.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers did visual scans of an unknown number of plants in
nine areas scattered over three states and saw no signs of disease.
In addition, they collected 14 plants: one vine from each of eight
areas surveyed, and six from a ninth area. Gonsalves tested the
plants for viruses in the laboratory _ the only definitive way to
test for viral infection _ and found no signs of disease.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, the Agriculture Department claimed, proved that wild
populations of the squash are not attacked by viruses. Therefore,
the Department concluded, the new genes would not be enough to turn
wild relatives into superweeds. Therefore, the squash could be
deregulated.
</P>
<P>
   But ecologists vigorously objected. They said it was impossible
to draw such a conclusion from such a small number of plants over
just one summer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Kareiva, senior ecologist for cumulative risk
assessment at NOAA, called the study ``amazingly small'' and noted
that if disease is a really devastating problem, scientists may
never find the disease and the plant together as the virus would
quickly wipe out any plants it encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gonsalves, a co-creator of the squash, called the survey
``preliminary data.'' Gonsalves said the Agriculture Department's
decision ``could be open for criticism. The sample is very small.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. James White, senior operations manager with the Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service, the Agriculture Department
agency that regulates genetically modified crops, defended the
approval and the survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no evidence that the gourds were ever infected with
the virus,'' he said, ``and there's been no evidence since 1994.''
He added that there are no known cases in any crop of a new gene
for virus or other resistance making the crop or its wild relatives
any weedier.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite scathing criticisms of their conclusions, in December
1994 the Agriculture Department again dismissed ecological risks
and gave final approval to the squash.
</P>
<P>
   ``USDA asked, could they finesse these arguments and just go
about their business?'' said Wilson. ``They proved they could, and
I would assume that that has greased the tracks for what has come
down the pike since.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 a second Asgrow squash with resistance to three viruses
was approved by USDA. A third Asgrow squash with resistance to all
four major viruses is in experimental field testing.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Quemada, of all people, has succeeded in convincing
the Department of Agriculture to support more risk analysis on the
squash.
</P>
<P>
   After years of arguing on behalf of Asgrow that the squash posed
no environmental risk, this summer, Quemada, now an independent
regulatory consultant, received a $253,000 grant from the
Agriculture Department to study whether the new squash poses a
superweed risk and whether viruses infect wild populations.
</P>
<P>
   White declined to comment, saying he had not seen the grant.
Quemada said he saw no conflict between his previous work and his
receipt of the new funding.
</P>
<P>
   The grant was funded by Biotechnology Risk Assessment Research
Grants Program, a branch of the Agriculture Department independent
of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Dr. Deborah
Sheely, the program director, said her panel of risk assessment
experts felt the grant addressed ``still relevant, still important
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecologists say that more worrisome than any threat from the
squash is the quality of science and the regulatory process that
was used to deregulate the plant, a process meant to be the
nation's safeguard against ecological disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 study of Agriculture Department petitions, Dr. Joy
Bergelson, an ecological geneticist at the University of Chicago,
and Dr. Colin Purrington, an evolutionary biologist at Swarthmore
College, examined the seven petitions approved at that time and
reported that much of the data were from critically flawed
experiments. They also reported a ``remarkable reliance'' in the
petitions on unsupported claims.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Dr. Bergelson said: ``It still is the case. A
lot of the key experiments don't seem to be being done.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, scientists say, is that the Agriculture
Department has set no scientific standards for proving the
environmental safety of a plant. Government agencies regulating new
products often demand specific experiments and data to establish
safety. In contrast, the Agriculture Department asks only that
petitioners explain why the new plant is unlikely or likely to pose
a number of broadly defined risks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tests that companies do use to argue for a crop's
safety, researchers say, are inadequate for risk assessment because
they are designed specifically to avoid ecological risk. For
example, in field trials flowers are often covered to avoid
interbreeding with wild plants. In addition, field tests typically
run for one or two years, too short a time, ecologists say, to
assess a plant's potential weediness.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arnold Foudin, assistant director of scientific services at
the animal and plant health inspection service, defended the
regulatory process. The requirements are not vague, he said, but
rather are ``necessarily generic _ it gives us the flexibility and
the applicant, to supply the necessary information.'' He added that
he believed that longer-term field tests were impractical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average corn variety lasts only five years in the
production world,'' Foudin said. ``Does it pay to do 20-year
experiments?''
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists, particularly those who genetically engineer
plants, applauded the approval of the squash and said environmental
risks were overblown. Supporters of genetically engineered plants
say critics ask the impossible: technology without risks and a
promise of unconditional safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world you'd know all the risks and all the
benefits before you use something,'' said Dr. Herb Aldwinckle,
plant pathologist at Cornell University, ``but we'd be very slow to
progress if we had to know all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, risks posed by these crops must be weighed against
the benefits they offer farmers, consumers and the environment. But
even as the first large-scale studies of benefits of genetically
modified plants appear, more questions than answers remain. Even
for Asgrow's squash, the plant that Tricoli called ``the most
highly regulated and reviewed squash product ever produced,'' the
costs and benefits to farmers and the environment remain unclear.
</P>
<P>
   In Idalou, Thiel, who has been planting and picking squash all
his life, was philosophical. ``We've got a long way to go before we
know whether it's good or bad,'' he said. ``The way I see it,
whenever you get something, you lose something else. We just don't
know what we'll lose yet.''

COMMENTARY: SOCIAL SAFETY NET

<TEXT>
<P>
   Estimates are that by 2005 one billion portable Internet
connections will be deployed around the world _ be it through cell
phones, pagers or Palm Pilots. And by 2010 there'll be about three
billion _ so many in fact that 100 million toasters should be
online by then. Why not? Finland is already putting phones in Coke
machines _ you can charge your drink to your home number _ and the
company DigiScents plans to deliver smells over the Internet by
sending data to a ``Snortal'' attached to your PC, which would on
command mix different chemicals to recreate various scents. Look
around: anything with electricity is being reinvented to carry
software and become networked. That's the future. Even for your
toaster.
</P>
<P>
   I picked up such futurology not at an Internet trade show but at
an Aspen Institute seminar on poverty, headed by Nelson Mandela and
Jimmy Carter. The question participants were asking was this: Can
any of this whiz-bang Internet technology be used for alleviating
poverty?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes. ``The Internet scales like no other
technology,'' argues Allen Hammond, the senior scientist at the
World Resources Institute. ``One education Web site translated into
Hindi, Mandarin, Swahili and Spanish would have a potential user
base of 2 billion people. It can help even the poorest people
invent their way out of poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   How so? Consider the Web site www.PlaNetfinance.org. The
brainchild of a French banker, Jacques Attali, PlaNet Finance works
like this: Roughly 1.3 billion people live on a dollar a day. One
thing we know is that one of the most effective tools for combating
their poverty is micro-lending. Micro-loans range from $10 to
$1,000. They go mostly to women and are given without any
collateral. Micro-loan recipients use them to buy everything from
sewing machines to a cell phone the whole village can use, to
beauty supplies to start a salon in a Bangladeshi slum. These
people have the will to better themselves, they just don't have the
basic cash, and that's what micro-loans provide.
</P>
<P>
   While people who need micro-loans are not online today, many of
the micro-banks and aid organizations that work with the poor do
have computers and can get online. What PlaNet Finance is doing is
wiring these 7,000 micro-finance groups around the world into a
network that holds huge possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``First,'' says Attali, ``PlaNet will connect as many
micro-banks as possible so they can share solutions. Second, we
will help those that are not online get online, as we did in Benin.
Third, we are creating a system, like Moody's, that will rate
micro-banks according to their ethics, how well they serve the poor
and financial efficiency. Fourth, we are setting up a university
online to teach best practices to micro-banks, and an online
marketplace for micro-loan recipients to sell their crafts.
Finally, we are creating PlaNet Bank, which will extend lines of
credit to micro-banks and will enable anyone to come to our Web
site, donate money to selected projects offered by the best
micro-banks, and then track whom that money went to and how it is
used.''
</P>
<P>
   If PlaNet can really rate and link all the micro-banks, it could
help them lower their biggest cost _ tracking and processing all
these little loans. The idea is that a single micro-banker, armed
with the sort of information device that FedEx uses to track your
packages, could keep track of hundreds of loans and payments at a
time. If the processing and transaction costs of these micro-loans
can be reduced, they can be bundled together and sold on a
commercial basis to the Citibanks of the world. Micro-banks usually
charge 4 percent to 5 percent interest a month, so this market
would appeal to big banks _ if the processing costs were cut. And
that would change everything, because right now there is great
demand for micro-loans, but their cash pool is limited to
donations. With $20 billion in commercial loans from big banks you
could provide micro-loans to 100 million people living on $1 a day.
</P>
<P>
   That's how you change the world _ get the big market players to
do the right thing for the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an old saying: `Feed a man a fish and you've fed him
for a day. Teach a man to fish and you've fed him for a
lifetime,''' says Attali. ``Well, we have millions of poor people
who know how to fish. They just don't have a pole. Through PlaNet
we might be able to get poles for a lot more of them.''

FDA LEVIES $100 MILLION FINE ON ABBOTT LABORATORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.) (sw) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Abbott Laboratories, the nation's largest maker of
medical diagnostic tests, agreed on Tuesday to pay $100 million to
settle allegations that the company failed to meet federal quality
standards when it made hundreds of varieties of medical test kits.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the
manufacture and sale of medical devices, said it was the largest
fine ever levied by the agency. Under a consent decree approved by
a federal judge on Tuesday in Chicago, Abbott Laboratories agreed
to change its practices over the next year and to discontinue the
manufacture or distribution of many of the test kits that were
developed using what the FDA called a ``faulty manufacturing
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The process at issue, which is mostly chemical, is used to
create more than 300 kits that can be used to evaluate blood and
urine samples and offer diagnoses to treat a multitude of other
ailments, from cancer and thyroid complications to hepatitis and
cardiovascular problems. The company denied on Tuesday that any of
the kits are faulty.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has not recalled any of the test kits, but the
inventories of more than 100 different products will be destroyed.
An additional 175 test kits that are considered ``medically
necessary,'' often because they are the sole test kit on the
market, will continue to be sold to hospitals and laboratories even
as the company develops a better process. Those include tests that
detect the AIDS virus and Hepatitis in donated blood.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials said they did not have any evidence that consumers
had been harmed by errors tied to the test kits, but the agency
feared that the manufacturing process was so deficient as to raise
doubts about their effectiveness and pose the risk of creating test
kits that could result in faulty or erroneous diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it took its action on Tuesday after more than
six years of prodding Abbott executives to improve manufacturing
processes in its medical diagnostics division to meet federal
standards. Agency officials said that Abbott officials had tinkered
with the processes but had failed to adequately correct the
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past six years we have been inspecting and leaving
them letters, and we have not been successful with that,'' said Dr.
Jane Henney, commissioner of food and drugs at the FDA. ``We don't
know of any actual patient harm, but we are looking at processes
that don't give us the level of assurance we need.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Abbott Laboratories said that by signing the
consent decree, it was not admitting to violating any federal
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman for Abbott Laboratories, which is based in
Abbott Park, Ill., said the company was taking the FDA concerns
seriously and would try to improve the manufacturing process at its
plants in Lake County, Ill., where all of the processes in question
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have invested significantly in this, and we feel we've made
progress,'' said Rhonda Luniak, a spokeswoman at the company, which
had revenue of more than $12.4 billion in 1998. ``But the FDA
believes we have not progressed. We need to do it, and we need to
do it fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials insisted it was not the test kits or even
diagnostic equipments that were the problem but the manufacturing
process behind the test kits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consent decree said nothing about the efficiency of the
test kits,'' Ms. Luniak said. ``The products that are out there
continue to provide accurate results. What's at issue here is the
manufacturing process.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott officials also said they were pleased that in taking its
action, the FDA allowed the company to resolve the issue without
disruption to patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott Laboratories will continue to make medical test kits _
some largely chemical formulas that interact with fluid samples _
that diagnose hepatitis, retrovirus, cardiovascular disease,
cancer, thyroid disorders, fertility, drug monitoring and
congenital and respiratory conditions. In many of these areas, few
alternative products exist, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are allowing them to remain in the market where this is the
sole product,'' Dr. Henney said in a telephone interview. ``They
are the only diagnostic kit to test certain things.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 other test kits, however, will be destroyed in
inventory and discontinued on the market, largely because there are
alternatives. Those products account for about $250 million a year
in sales for Abbott Laboratories. The company's diagnostics
division had sales of about $2.8 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the FDA's action, Abbott officials said on
Tuesday that the company had taken a $168 million charge and
restated its third-quarter earnings to 30 cents a share from a
previously reported 38 cents. The company said that earnings could
be lowered by as much as 2 cents a share for the fourth quarter and
by as much as 10 cents a share for 2000. Analysts had expected
Abbott to earn 45 cents a share in the fourth quarter and $1.86 a
share for 2000, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Abbott Laboratories fell $2.3125 on Tuesday, to $38.
</P>
<P>
   The F.D.A. said it first discovered problems at Abbott's
manufacturing plants in 1993. In subsequent inspections over the
years, the FDA continued to find violations of its quality
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Under the consent decree, Abbott Laboratories is obligated to
submit to the agency a ``master compliance'' program and resolve
the problems within one year or face large fines.

<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. -- His face crumpling, Sayed Gaber held out a
snapshot, waving it to the cameras and the world. The photograph of
his sister, taken at Los Angeles International Airport just before
she boarded EgyptAir Flight 990, was a paper-thin substitute for
what he had hoped to bring her children back from Rhode Island _
their mother alive and well, or at very least, her body, for a
proper burial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `I'm going to bring your mom to you,' '' he said,
the picture quivering in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Gaber and nearly 200 victims' relatives gathered at a Newport,
R.I. hotel Tuesday, the end of a sad pilgrimage near the site of
the crash in the waters south of Nantucket Island.
</P>
<P>
   When they started their journeys, many held out hope that their
loved ones, by a miracle, would survive. When the news grew darker,
they still expected some finality to the story _ a body to bury.
</P>
<P>
   But at what witnesses described as a traumatic meeting Tuesday
morning, the National Transportation Safety Board told family
members news that triggerred a wave of hysteria and newfound grief:
no whole bodies were likely to be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 15 minutes, the meeting broke up because people
fainted,'' said George Arrian, editor of Donia Al Arab News, a New
Jersey-based newspaper, who is serving as a spokesman for Egyptian
families. ``Everybody was crying like babies. When the Red Cross
started talking, no one was interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Many families are in agony over what is turning into a long,
fruitless wait, said Nihad Awad, executive director of the
Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations, who
attended the meeting between families and crash investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some people, this is brutal to their emotions,'' Awad said.
``Some would like to leave. They would like to just go home. `How
long does this have to take us?' they ask.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the salvage effort has been slow. Coast Guard officials
have brought one intact body to shore, and crews returned to land
with some human remains. But officials said rough seas and deep
water may mean that the recovery of human remains will never be
complete.
</P>
<P>
   That likelihood is difficult for most families to face, and
especially tough for Muslims, Islamic leaders and Red Cross
officials have said. Islam regards the burial of a whole body vital
to their faith's burial rite.
</P>
<P>
   Some relatives spoke poignantly of their families' despair at
trying to cope with the growing likelihood that their loved ones
have been lost to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Sanna Eissa, from Calgary, Canada, was waiting for her sister _
who lost her husband in the crash _ to arrive from Egypt. As she
spoke by phone with Sanna, Eissa's sister clung to the idea that
some remnant of her husband would come home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister, she's crazy. She doesn't want him to remain in the
sea. She doesn't care how much it costs to get his body. She just
wants to find him,'' Eissa said. ``She was screaming into the
phone: `I just want to see even his hand or his legs.' She wants to
bury him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as they faced devastating news, and turned toward to grim
tasks _ such as talking to medical examiners and providing the
dental records and X-rays that will be used to identify victims _
many victims' families appeared, at least in public, to hold
themselves together.
</P>
<P>
   When a planeload of relatives landed at T.F. Green Airport
outside Providence and boarded charter buses bound for Newport, a
few women held their hands to their mouths, and one man briefly
leaned his head on another man's shoulder. But most appeared stoic,
quiet, and nearly expressionless.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they spoke, some relatives managed to maintain their
calm. Eric Lavoie, of Montreal, was poker-faced as he paced alone
in front of the Goat Island Doubletree Hotel here, where the
relatives were staying. His mother, Agdnate Lavoie, was on the
plane, en route to what she hoped would be another adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was on a trip to the Nile with some friends,'' he said.
``She traveled at least once a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to retain his compusure and in a quaking voice Lavoie
detailed his mother's travels since her husband's death three years
ago. And then, almost as an afterthought, he added just as calmly
that three of his wife's relatives had also perished in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy still seemed unreal, he said. His equanamity seemed
to serve as a kind of shield from the chaos around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's crazy,'' he said. ``You see it on TV. You hear it.
But you're like a spectator. To me, she's still on that trip.''
</P>
<P>
   But his seven-year-old twin daughters, at home, had been
expressing raw emotions, including fear. They were terrified, he
said, that their father had to board an airplane just days after
their grandmother had died on one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part for the kids was to know that their father
will travel by plane,'' he said. ``I had to call them yesterday to
calm them down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hours since they started to gather together, victims'
relatives have gone through a range of emotions, from fear to grief
to anger to the urge assign blame, said psychologist Bob Hayes, who
is heading the Red Cross's mental health services for victims'
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel in Newport's harbor, accustomed to well-heeled
tourists, has become a makeshift counseling center and temporary
home. Inside, the Red Cross set up what spokeswoman Renita Hosler
called ``a supportive environment'' for grieving. Conference rooms
have been turned into mini-chapels where people of different faiths
can pray. Hotel staff members have found themselves consoling the
bereaved.
</P>
<P>
   A team of clergy, specially trained to respond to airline
crashes, was on hand. And other ministers came here on their own.
Clothed in a long, black robe, with a silver cross around his neck,
the Reverend Marcos Girgis, a priest at an Egyptian Christian
church in Cranston, R.I., met families in Providence and tried to
comfort them by discussing the religious idea of divine will.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any choice to come to the world and we have no
choice to leave the world,'' he said. ``It's their destiny. And you
have to yield to the will of God.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is small comfort for Elissa when it can not be followed
up with the familiar, calming rituals of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he died normally, it's different,'' she said. ``But if they
can't find his body or anything, it just kills us inside.''

 LEO GROUP TO ACQUIRE MacMANUS, CREATING 4th BIGGEST ADVERTISING (Exclusive)  
 (bl)  
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leo Group, the advertising concern that created the
Jolly Green Giant and the Marlboro Man, is expected to announce
Wednesday that it is acquiring MacManus Group, the creative team
behind Folgers coffee commercials. It also plans to take the new
agency public next year, company executives said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The combination will create the fourth largest advertising group
in the world, behind Omnicom Group, Interpublic Group of Cos. and
WPP Group.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising industry has been consolidating recently, and a
merger of these two holding companies will help them compete
globally against their larger peers, said Roger Haupt, the incoming
chief executive of the Leo Group, who will be named chief executive
of the combined company to be temporarily named BDM.
</P>
<P>
   Recently other advertising groups have been going public, using
the cash infusion from investors to expand their operations.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Haupt said the two companies need the financial
resources to attract and retain creative people.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And it isn't the first time they have found themselves at the
negotiating table. Last year the two companies _ which are holding
companies comprised of several advertising agencies and other
businesses _ held talks about combining their media operations.
Those discussions broke down.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies had hoped to merge their operations in Europe
first, but the talks expanded to include all planning and buying
for television, radio, print, the Internet and other media. ``It
was a good idea then but it is a better idea now,'' Haupt said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   MacManus Group chairman Roy Bostock will be named chairman of
the combined company. Agencies and other units for the two
companies _ which include media buying, advertising, health care
marketing and public relations _ will continue to be run
separately.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will have $1.7 billion in annual revenues
with media billings of about $13 billion. And if the company goes
public it could command a valuation of two times revenue, which
could value it at more than $3 billion in the public market,
according to estimates by industry observers.
</P>
<P>
   The Leo Group through its Leo Burnett agency handles companies
including Hallmark, Nintendo and Walt Disney. The MacManus Group is
home to Mars Bars, Pampers and Ernst &AMP; Young.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies share several clients also, including
Coca-Cola, General Motors and Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Philip Guarascio, vice president and general
manager for marketing and advertising at GM, said MacManus, through
its D'arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications agency represents
Pontiac and Cadillac. The Leo Group though its Leo Burnett agency
represents Oldsmobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're GM,'' Guarascio said. ``We're not concerned about
getting anyone's attention. But in consumer research and
development, we need more talent.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Burnett has pushed the creative side of the business
a little more. The combination gives us more resources and we think
they are better off.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The companies also expect to announce that Dentsu Inc., the
Japanese advertising powerhouse, will take a 20 percent ownership
stake in the combined entity. The equity stake will not only give
Dentsu access to untapped markets here, but will give the combined
company greater leverage with advertising clients in Japan. Dentsu
too has a relationship with Young &AMP; Rubicam.
</P>
<P>
   The move is surprising given that for years both companies said
they would remain privately held, very much in the same way
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., the investment bank, wished to remain private
for years before later selling shares to the public. Some industry
analysts suggested though that there was a shift in thinking
recently at the Leo Group, which was formed in 1999, but originally
founded by Leo Burnett, who died in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we'd been vocal about remaining independent,'' Haupt
said. ``But it's clear we weren't stupid enough to rule out our
options.''
</P>
<P>
   MacManus too had been approached by several peers interested in
their business.
</P>
<P>
   But Procter &AMP; Gamble encouraged the pairing of the two
companies, in part, because MacManus' Televest handles all of
Procter &AMP; Gamble's U.S. television buying and the Leo Group's
Starcom Worldwide handles its print advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expansion of resources will give us more people to give us
great ideas,'' said Bob Wehling, the global marketing officer for
Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the company plans to spend more money on, Bostock
said, is expanding its capabilities to help clients use the
Internet to increase sales and expand e-commerce operations. ``This
is no longer the world of 30 second sound bites,'' he said. &QL;

WARHOL: THE HERALD OF SAMPLING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Tony Scherman is the author of ``Backbeat: Earl Palmer's Story.''  
 By TONY SCHERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mention Andy Warhol's relationship to pop music, and the first
name to crop up will be that of the Velvet Underground, the band
Warhol championed in the mid-'60s. In fact, Warhol's art and ideas
didn't find musical expression until the Velvet Underground was
long defunct.
</P>
<P>
   The arts don't evolve in temporal lock step, and it wasn't until
the mid-'80s, largely because of advances in technology, that pop
music began to explore the territory Warhol had opened up long
before. Today, the connections between Warhol's ideas and pop music
_ especially electronica and hip-hop _ have only deepened, offering
one more strand of evidence that Warhol, far from being the poseur
and opportunist many still consider him, was an artist and thinker
of uncanny prescience.
</P>
<P>
   Warhol, who died in 1987, wasn't the first artist to use
borrowed images, but he was the first (along with Pop Art
colleagues like Roy Lichtenstein) to make the practice central to
his art. In doing so, Warhol, Lichtenstein &AMP; Company were
registering the tide of commercial imagery in which the United
States, circa 1960, was newly awash: the stuff of television,
movies, photojournalism, advertisements and comic strips, a barrage
so insistent and seductive that it demanded attention.
</P>
<P>
   At first Warhol worked by hand, painting simulacra of
mass-cultural artifacts like nose-job advertisements or the front
page of The Daily News. In 1962, he worked out a semimechanical
procedure in which he printed a silk-screened photograph onto a
painted canvas. It became his trademark technique, used for most of
his best-known pictures: the portraits of Marilyn Monroe,
Jacqueline Kennedy, Elizabeth Taylor and Elvis Presley; the remakes
of the ``Mona Lisa''; the ``Skull'' pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how he worked, his art was unabashedly second
generation. More than anyone else, Warhol accustomed artists and
critics to the use of borrowed imagery. He was the founding father
of ``appropriation'' (the currently fashionable critical term),
which has become a staple of postmodernism, an aesthetic strategy
for an era in which the concepts of originality and authorship are
rigorously questioned.
</P>
<P>
   By the '70s, the theory and practice of appropriation had
penetrated the more cerebral corners of rock, with bands like Can
using tape recorders to borrow others' music. But working with tape
was cumbersome, and pop-music appropriation got a tremendous boost
from the arrival of digital technology in the early '80s. Now
musicians had a miraculous tool, the sampler, with which to mine
the entire history of recorded music.
</P>
<P>
   A sampler converts sound into digital data, enabling its user to
lift a musical sequence from one recording and drop it into
another. Samples can be used unaltered (like the James Brown grunts
that are a hip-hop cliche) or, since digital data is infinitely
malleable, processed into unrecognizably new sounds.
</P>
<P>
   A short musical phrase (say, a catchy bass lick) can be sampled
and ``looped'' _ programmed to repeat _ forming the rhythmic and
harmonic foundation for an entire song. With sampling, it became
possible to make recordings that bypass the performer:
second-generation, appropriated music.
</P>
<P>
   Our environment is as saturated aurally as it is visually.
Recorded music is omnipresent: piped into stores, offices and
elevators, transportable via boombox, Walkman and car radio. Armed
with samplers, musicians were free to respond to sensory overload
as the Pop artists had, by helping themselves to the shards flying
past.
</P>
<P>
   In an environment crammed to bursting with recorded sounds,
piecing and patching them together may indeed be a more rational
compositional approach than ransacking that hallowed Romantic
source, the soul.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for sampling to work its way into the pop
mainstream, but it was used sparingly, for exotic touches here and
there or as a cheap substitute for real musicians. Sampling found
its first real home in hip-hop, whose pioneering South Bronx DJs
used records and turntables to splice songs together as far back as
the mid-'70s.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop had an appropriative, recontextualizing aesthetic from
the start and took to sampling like Elvis to a comb. (Those early
DJs, by the way, spawned a brand new, postmodern recording artist,
the remixer, who was hired to alter a recording as he saw fit,
usually for a dance club audience. The result, a new record that
incorporates an old one, is a perfect instance of appropriation.)
</P>
<P>
   The hip-hop producer tends to leave samples in their original,
recognizable state. The result works on two levels. Aficionados
``get'' the reference and appreciate the creative recycling of pop
history, while most listeners, unaware that that funky bass line
was recorded before they were born, still think it sounds great.
</P>
<P>
   A current example is the punchy horn riff from Earth, Wind and
Fire's 1978 song ``Fantasy'' that Sean ``Puffy'' Combs (whose major
skill as a producer may be his ear for a good sample) uses to
anchor his new song ``Angels With Dirty Faces.''
</P>
<P>
   The other pop-music genre to embrace sampling is electronica, a
catchall term for the mostly instrumental, largely English-based
dance musics (trip-hop, hardcore, drum-and-bass, big-beat) that
have flirted with mainstream status for most of this decade. Unlike
hip-hoppers, electronica musicians prefer to camouflage their
sampling.

 &HT;    Weather to hamper tomorrow's search and recovery efforts
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Gusty wind blowing in rain and fog will hamper
the search for human remains and debris from EgyptAir Flight 990,
investigators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   All 217 people on the flight died when the jetliner traveling
from New York's Kennedy International Airport to Cairo, Egypt,
crashed early Sunday 50 miles south of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials have warned that the investigation could take
several years, searchers are eager to recover the two ``black box''
recorders, which could provide clues to why the Boeing 767 plunged
33,000 feet without warning into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the victims, who have assembled in Newport, are
eager for answers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ships assigned to the large-scale investigation, the
USS Grapple, arrived in Newport on Tuesday afternoon from Norfolk,
Va. It is carrying divers who will try to retrieve the jetliner's
flight data and cockpit voice recorders.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, searchers detected a pinging sound that investigators
believe is coming from one of the two recorders.
</P>
<P>
   Government rules require the capsules holding flight data and
cockpit voice recorders be able to withstand pressure at 20,000
feet under water and resist corrosion from salt water for 30 days.
The pinging sounds are supposed to be emitted every second for 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   The Whiting, a vessel usually used to survey ocean coastal
waters and make nautical charts, arrived at the crash site early
Tuesday. It has computer equipment that will analyze winds, tides
and currents to determine where wreckage might drift.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard, fearing bad weather, stepped up its search
Tuesday. So far, it has recovered one body, some human remains and
wreckage, including a large section of the plane. Passengers'
belongings, such as shoes, purses, dolls and teddy bears, were also
recovered from the surface of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   None of the retrieved debris has any burn marks that might
indicate a fire or explosion, search officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The sonar-equipped Grapple will help retrieve debris from the
ocean floor. It was used after the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800 off
New York's Long Island and the 1998 crash of Swissair Flight 111
off Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   A private diver conceded bad weather will hamper the Flight 990
investigation
</P>
<P>
   ''If you get 6 or 8 or 10 foot waves, it is going to be too
dangerous,'' said Chris Lisi, a commercial diver from Wakefield,
R.I.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Lisi, 42, has twice dived to the wreckage of
the luxury liner Andrea Doria, which sank in 1956 in the vicinity
of the EgyptAir site. In that area, shoals rise from the ocean
floor, creating big swells during storms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gets real bad out there,'' the diver said, explaining that
waves imperil rescuers. ''You've got the ship rocking and rolling,
and the guys on it get jacked all around.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisi said he does not believe that debris and human remains on
the ocean floor will move around in the choppy water.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'd need a hurricane to push the swell down 250 feet,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the joint command center at the Newport naval base
are tracking the storm and the location of each ship involved in
the Flight 990 recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The austere, makeshift center is staffed by an estimated 30
officials of the Navy, Coast Guard, FBI and the National
Transportation Safety Board, the agency leading the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, the command center was quiet, with few phone
ringing and few people talking.

 UNDATED: their sampling.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big-beat superstars the Chemical Brothers, for instance, are
painstaking alchemists to whom samples are mere putty, the starting
point for their sonic sorcery. A song like ``Elektrobank,'' for
instance, which reportedly contains some 300 samples, is a ``molten
mass,'' as the group member Tom Rowlands put it. ``Things are
knitted together very tightly, and you can't see where one sample
is and one isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their pride in altering samples to the point of
unrecognizability, the Chemical Brothers can't resist the lure of
wholesale, undisguised appropriation. Their breakthrough hit
``Setting Sun'' meticulously copies the memorable rhythmic
underpinning of the Beatles' ``Tomorrow Never Knows.'' That the
Chemical Brothers didn't actually sample anything is beside the
point: ``Setting Sun'' is an unabashed lift.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, they would have been abused by critics
for a lapse in taste and originality. Not today. Rolling Stone
called ``Setting Sun'' ``the best single of 1996, hands down.''
Borrowing someone else's work, in other words, is no longer a
failure of imagination but a strategy, an accepted method of music
making.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a machine,'' Andy Warhol said in 1963. In part,
he was acting the provocateur against the still-powerful Abstract
Expressionist dogma that every drip and brush stroke must express
the artist's inner self. And in part Warhol was saying that he
wanted to make art that reflected its origins in late-industrial
society, both in the means of its creation and in its appearance.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted a machinelike technique and found it, to an extent, in
the photomechanical process that let him produce an unlimited
number of identical pictures. He wanted his art to look
machine-made, too, and by substituting silk-screened photograph for
painted image, he tried to banish from his pictures every trace of
his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The artist who wanted to be a machine would have been fascinated
by electronica and hip-hop, for they realize his ideal of
machine-generated art. He would have appreciated their negation of
traditional musical skills like instrumental technique, ensemble
playing and note reading, for he performed just such a negation
himself when he abandoned hand painting, thumbing his nose at the
venerable legacy of picture making.
</P>
<P>
   And just as Warhol sought to efface himself from his pictures,
the electronic pop musician, who funnels every idea through a
machine, removes his human presence, his touch, from the song.
Whether he knows it or not, he lives in a Warholian world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Warhol, anxious to distinguish his work from
Lichtenstein's, began to increase his use of repetition, or
seriality. It became one of his hallmarks. Gazing at a 6-by-8-foot
painting of 200 Campbell's soup cans, one's eye roams restlessly,
unable to find an organizing principle or focal point, which is
just what Warhol intended.
</P>
<P>
   As far as he was concerned, any immanent, organic structure
would be an artificial overlay; any sense of resolution,
artificial. Seriality, moreover, gave his work the machine-made
look he wanted; those 200 red-and-white Campbell's cans could be
fresh off the assembly line. So could the multiple Marilyns and
Elvises: celebrities are products, too.
</P>
<P>
   The same relentless seriality characterizes electronica and
hip-hop, whose songs are strung together out of endlessly repeating
one- and two-bar loops. The 32-, 16- and 12-bar choruses that have
undergirded pop music since Stephen Foster no longer apply here.
</P>
<P>
   While electronica's repetitiveness is obviously rooted in its
dance music function, a number of its stars _ the Chemical
Brothers, Underworld, Fatboy Slim _ long ago developed large
armchair audiences. Electronica's seriality has as much to do with
post-modernist aesthetics as with dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the putative gap between ``high'' and ``mass''
culture, Warhol's art, electronica and hip-hop inhabit the same
aesthetic universe. It's a reduced world, unwilling to attempt the
modernist masterpieces of a Picasso or an Ellington (or even ``A
Day in the Life''), for it holds such grandeur in suspicion. Its
own aspirations are more modest: the soup cans of Warhol, the
repetitions of dance music.
</P>
<P>
   In this universe _ ours, for better or worse _ originality no
longer matters. The challenge is not to fabricate something new but
to cast the already fabricated in a new light. Creative rummaging
for a ready-made source to reuse _ this becomes the crucial talent,
supplanting the traditional virtues of imagination and technique.
</P>
<P>
   The only aspect of the picture-making process that intrigued
Warhol was the search for the right photograph to silk-screen.
``The selection of the images,'' he told an interviewer, ``is the
most important and is the fruit of the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, the dance music producer-remixer Armand Van Helden
analyzes his work in strikingly similar terms. ``If you get the
right loop ... it's worth gold. But it's (italics)getting(end
italics) that right loop ...''
</P>
<P>
   What would Warhol say about such a remarkable coincidence of
ideas, across such an apparently wide distance? Probably
``Fabulous!'' or something equally banal. Just to throw the scent
off. Just to camouflage the acuity with which he saw our world for
what it was, and what it would become.

MIDEAST MEETING IN OSLO IN A `LAST SPRINT'
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway _ President Clinton on Tuesday began what he
described as a ``last sprint'' with Israel's prime minister, Ehud
Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to devise a peace
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   As the finale of a two day trip here, Clinton brought the two
leaders together for an arm chair session at the residence of the
American ambassador and afterwards declared that Barak and Arafat
had pledged to meet regularly in the next 100 days before a
mid-February deadline for a framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The president also held out the promise of a summit meeting
early in the New Year _ something the White House would dearly like
_ if enough progress had been made to point toward a framework
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timetable is the middle of February that they've agreed to
have the framework agreement,'' Clinton said. ``So you won't have
to wait long for answers to the details. We'll all be in high gear
between now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, as well as the Israeli and Palestinian
delegations, said Tuesday that they felt imbued by the occasion
that beckoned them here _ the fourth anniversary of the
assassination of Yitzak Rabin, who was Barak's mentor and Arafat's
partner in the historic peace agreement that was forged in Oslo in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Barak and Arafat attended a commemoration service for
Rabin, where his widow, Leah, gave a moving address imploring the
parties to plunge ahead with her husband's unfinished work. The
ease with which Barak and Arafat sat in the front row, separated
only by Barak's wife, Nava, was striking. The two men exchanged
handshakes as though it was now commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unknowable whether, six years later, the springboard
of Oslo will work again in the effort to seal the most difficult
issues that have eluded the parties.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials said they believed that Barak and
Arafat were aware that a rare moment had arrived in the combination
of a new Israeli leader, an aging Palestinian leader and a
departing American president. The possibility of a summit meeting,
but only on condition that serious work preceded it, would be an
inducement to the Palestinians, who would like the reward of a
White House embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both leaders focused on the fact that they would have very
difficult, fateful decisions to make, but they were determined to
press ahead,'' a senior American official involved in the
negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, mechanisms for reaching the framework accord
_ in essence a general statement on how the future Israeli state
and Palestinian entity would look _ were agreed upon. Teams of
negotiators from both the Israeli and Palestinian sides are to meet
regularly, as much as three times a week, according to Nabil
Shaath, a senior Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stressed that one of the important outcomes Tuesday was
an understanding between the two leaders that they would avoid
inflammatory statements. ``They have agreed to work very hard to
avoid public comments or actions which will cause enormous
difficulty for the other side'' in the lead-up to mid-February,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But after the session with Clinton and the two leaders, a senior
Israeli official suggested that his government did not feel
compelled to refrain from frank discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed that we will try to speak publicly in a way that
will not hide or cover the gaps in our opinions but yet will not
insult or hurt the other side,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed at Tuesday night's session with Clinton, the
quibbling started. Barak informed Arafat, an Israeli official said,
that the Palestinian's speech at the service for Rabin was not
constructive. In fact, the speech as delivered was toned down from
the transcript distributed to the press. A reference to the issue
of the Israeli settlements as a ``cancer'' was scratched.
</P>
<P>
   Other elements of the speeded-up and more organized process
settled on here included trips to the Middle East by the
administration diplomat, Dennis E. Ross, and at least one or
perhaps two by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said that both sides were
aiming for a sweeping framework agreement that would cover all the
final status issues: boundaries of a Palestinian entity, the future
of 3.6 million Palestinian refugees, the fate of settlements on the
West Bank, and the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   After the framework is reached, how it would be carried out and
the details would be worked out in a final status agreement,
scheduled for mid-September. It is this agreement that would be the
biggest prize for Clinton, as a spectacular conclusion to his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides had not yet had a substantive discussion on
these hard issues, the American official said. Thus, whether by
February the framework agreement would cover all issues, as the two
sides have pledged, or whether for the sake of time some would be
dropped, depended on the negotiations ahead. ``We'll have to wait
and see,'' the American said.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton, Arafat and Barak steered away from talking about
the substantive issues in public during their two days here, there
was some discussion in private, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, for example, told Clinton that he had three categories of
issues: those that were non-negotiable, those that were vital, and
those where there could be flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   According to several accounts, Barak made clear that Israeli
sovereignty over Jerusalem was not negotiable. For the
Palestinians, the right to a state was nonnegotiable, officials
here said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a generalized understanding between the Israelis and
the Palestinians that they would approach the negotiations by
discussing all issues all at once, ``as a package,'' the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   This approach is preferable, the officials said, to taking a
single issue at a time, which is too time consuming and prevents
the notion of ``swapping'' one item for another.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ``red lines'' put down by both sides, a diplomat
involved in the process said that past experience showed that ``red
lines are not red, but pink. There is always some flexibility.''

 &HT;    Challenger Bradley turns eyes to south
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After having virtually ignored Georgia and the rest
of the South, presidential hopeful Bill Bradley is taking his first
steps to organize in the Peach state.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign chairman, Doug Berman, was in Georgia Tuesday
to lay the foundations for a fund-raising trip Bradley will make to
Atlanta on Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the state's top leadership, from Gov. Roy Barnes on
down, is backing Vice President Gore, forcing Bradley to rely on
whatever grass roots support he can muster. Democratic state Rep.
Terry Coleman, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, is
the highest ranking state official to endorse Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's running against the tide here in Georgia,''
Coleman said Tuesday. ``There are people that are looking for an
alternative to Gore, not because he's not a capable candidate, but
there are some people who just don't warm up to the vice president.
Bradley's sincerity and thoughtfulness will make the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   What Bradley may lack in official endorsements, however, he is
trying to make up in fund-raising. Anne Cox Chambers, the richest
Georgian and the 15th richest American according to Forbes
magazine, is hosting a fund-raiser for Bradley in her Atlanta home
Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, chairman of Atlanta Newspapers and a director of Cox
Enterprises Inc., which owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, is
one of the country's top individual contributors to the Democratic
Party, and she played an influential role in President Carter's
1976 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She is the daughter of James M. Cox, a former Democratic
governor of Ohio and the Democratic nominee for president in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers was a prominent supporter of the Clinton-Gore
administration. She gave $90,000 to the Democratic National
Committee in 1992 when Clinton and Gore were elected and another
$100,000 to the DNC in 1996 when the pair stood for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Chambers held a fund-raiser at her home for the
Democratic Party. Gore was the host for the event. This year,
however, Chambers has given nothing to Gore and donated $1,000 to
Bradley, the maximum allowed under the law for the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers did not return phone calls seeking comment about her
support for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign is hoping to raise between $150,000 and
$200,000 for Bradley at Chambers' home, Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's upcoming trip to Georgia will be the second since the
former New Jersey senator announced for president late last year.
Bradley's wife, Ernestine Schlant, campaigned on behalf of her
husband in Atlanta Oct. 26
</P>
<P>
   The front-loaded primary schedule has forced Bradley to devote
most of his time to New Hampshire, Iowa and a few of the larger
primary states such as California, Illinois and New York. The
Georgia primary is March 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign has about 700 Georgia volunteers who have
registered with the candidate's Web site. Vicki McLennan, the state
lobbyist for the National Organization for Women, is spearheading
the grass roots organizing. She said the Bradley campaign contacted
her about six weeks ago to explore fund-raising possibilities for
Bradley in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'Don't write off Georgia,''' McLennan said. ``When
people find out that I'm involved with Bradley, they say, 'Oh, I
want to get involved.'''
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising figures for Gore and Bradley illustrate Gore's
advantage in Georgia. Through the end of September, Gore had
collected $460,200 from 632 contributors in Georgia, while Bradley
had raised only $75,000 from 114 donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see Bill Bradley getting much traction other than from
a core of people who are going to be against the vice president,''
said Keith Mason, Gore's volunteer state co-ordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably won't hear from Bill Bradley again until sometime
in late February before the primary,'' Mason said. ``Whenever that
is, he'll need a good map and a guide.''

DISGRUNTLED XEROX EMPLOYEE KILLS 7 CO-WORKERS IN HONOLULU 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An apparently disgruntled worker for the Xerox Corp. in Honolulu
drove to his company's offices early on Tuesday morning and, with
murderous precision, shot and killed seven co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, identified by the police as Byran Uyesugi, 40,
surrendered peacefully later in the day to the police, who coaxed
him out of a Xerox van that he had driven from the scene of the
shootings to a public park in an isolated area, said Carol Costa,
the press secretary for Mayor Jeremy Harris. Uyesugi had been
sitting in the van for about three hours, but shortly after 3 p.m.
Honolulu time, he moved over to the passenger seat, opened the door
and stepped out, Ms. Costa said.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the deadliest attacks in a series of such mass
killings with guns in recent years, and it left Hawaiians
particularly shocked because of the island's idyllic surroundings
and historically low crime rates. In 1998, there were just 17
homicides in Honolulu, which, with nearly a million residents, is
the nation's 11th largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said in an interview that Uyesugi was in the process of
being dismissed by Xerox, perhaps on Tuesday morning, and that he
walked into the company offices not far from the airport and
shortly after 8 a.m. opened fire with a 9mm pistol. He killed five
people in a conference room and two in an office nearby on the
second floor of the warehouse-like building. All the victims were
men, ranging in age from 33 to 58, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Soo, a Fire Department captain, said the victims were
already dead by the time he arrived at 8:30 a.m., and that no one
else in the building had been wounded, indicating that the gunman
had killed each of his targets before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that after the shootings, Uyesugi climbed into
the van and drove to the Hawaii Nature Center, a public botanical
garden and park in a rustic part of Oahu known as Upper Makiki
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The police found the van there later in the morning, sealed off
the area and began negotiating with him through a megaphone. They
eventually brought in his brother, who is reportedly a state
employee, the mayor said. Uyesugi appeared calm, even walking
around outside the van at times.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Lipari, a Xerox official at the company's headquarters in
Stamford, Conn., said the building where the shootings took place
was for parts, maintenance and service training. She added that
only four people worked there normally, but more were there on
Tuesday because of a staff meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The incident ranks among the 10 most deadly workplace shootings
in the United States. In 1986, Pat Sherrill locked himself inside
the post office where he worked in Edmond, Okla., killing 14 people
and wounding at least 20 others, the single deadliest episode of
workplace violence in the nation's history. Last July, in the most
recent case with high fatalities, Mark O. Barton opened fire inside
two stock trading firms in Atlanta, killing nine people. He had
previously killed his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's attack left many Hawaiians, even those used to dealing
with crimes and injuries, stunned. ``I've been with the Fire
Department for 23 years and this is definitely the worst I've
seen,'' Soo said. ``You just don't see this in Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the people at the Xerox building were quiet and in shock
after the attack. The shootings took place at a technical support
center at 1200 North Nimitz Highway, in a light industrial area
called Kalihi-Kai, about 10 minutes from the Honolulu International
Airport. The police closed the highway shortly after being called,
causing massive traffic jams in the morning rush hour on a major
highway linking downtown Honolulu and the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Uyesugi was a gun enthusiast and was registered
as the owner of 17 guns, but a neighbor said there was no sign he
might commit such crimes. Dorothy Kameda, who lives across from
Uyesugi on Easy Street, in the Nuuanu district of Honolulu, said:
``He was a very quiet person, very nice. No trouble, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that he had lived in the neighborhood all his life,
and that he was not married and lived in the house with his brother
and his father. Uyesugi was known, Ms. Kameda said, for the rare
tropical fish he raised.

INDONESIA RELEASES BANK AUDIT, HASTENING IMF HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Indonesia's Parliament published a long-awaited
report Tuesday on a banking scandal that had helped bring down the
administration of former President B.J. Habibie, and the
International Monetary Fund said the move cleared the way for it to
resume a $43 billion economic rescue package by the middle of
December.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to pressure from the IMF, the World Bank and the newly
elected Indonesian president, Abdurrahman Wahid, Parliament Speaker
Akbar Tanjung agreed not to wait for two committees to deliberate
on the report, a process that had been expected to take more than a
month. The senior economics minister, Kwik Kian Gie, handed the
report to the IMF's Asia-Pacific director, Hubert Neiss, at a news
conference in Jakarta on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Its release was likely to help allay foreign investor concerns
about Indonesia's commitment to economic change. More immediately,
it lessened the chances that the Indonesian government would run
out of money, something Kwik and other officials had warned was
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and the IMF cautioned, however, that the release of the
audit was only the beginning of a long process of ensuring that the
corruption underlying the scandal was eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not at all over,'' said Anoop Singh, the monetary fund's
deputy director for the Asia-Pacific region. Subject to approval
from IMF headquarters, he said, a team would visit Jakarta next
week to begin drafting a new letter of intent for the next aid
disbursement.
</P>
<P>
   The banking audit, conducted in August by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, examined the movement of 546 billion
rupiah, or about $80 million, that had been transferred out of Bank
Bali, a major commercial bank nationalized in June. The money went
to a company controlled by Indonesia's former ruling party and
later made its way into dozens of bank accounts in the country and
abroad, some of them belonging to the party and to former
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers recommended further investigation of a
number of officials, including the central bank governor, Sjahril
Sabirin; the former finance minister, Bambang Subianto; and the
former state enterprises minister, Tanri Abeng.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the money had been intended to help finance
Habibie's election campaign. The funds had originally been paid to
Bank Bali by the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency, the
government agency set up to help rebuild the nation's banking
industry under terms of the IMF-led rescue package. The
misappropriation of the money undermined the core of Indonesia's
efforts to resuscitate its economy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``You've seen paralysis of economic policy-making while the Bank
Bali affair grew,'' Singh said.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and the World Bank suspended talks on releasing roughly
$2 billion in loans in September, hoping to exert pressure on
Jakarta to stop militias from rampaging in East Timor after a
referendum vote there in favor of independence. But the pressure
shifted back to the Bank Bali scandal after Indonesian officials
released only an abridged version of Pricewaterhouse's report,
arguing that publication of the full report would violate
Indonesia's bank secrecy laws. Amid accusations of a cover-up, the
international lending agencies demanded the release of the full
report and prosecution of those responsible for wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank Bali scandal also illustrated the difficult choices
faced by international lenders to Indonesia. Having already handed
over $10 billion of the promised aid, the IMF and the World Bank
could ill afford to let the country's economy fail. Withholding
aid, moreover, made foreign investors in Indonesia even more
nervous and increased Indonesia's need to raise funds _ meaning
that the country might eventually need even more money from the IMF
and the World Bank.

IN CRASH INQUIRY, AGENCIES LEARN FROM MISSTEPS
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mysteries still dominate the investigation into what
caused EgyptAir Flight 990 to plunge suddenly into the sea as it
headed from New York City toward Cairo early Sunday. No cause has
been determined. Little evidence has been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But aviation and law enforcement officials pursuing clues in the
crash say that one thing is crystal clear: They intend to learn
from missteps made during the protracted, often contentious,
sometimes mishandled inquiry into the crash of another jumbo jet
departing on the same flight path 40 months ago, Trans World
Airlines Flight 800.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the remarkable efforts involved in retrieving,
reassembling and analyzing thousands of shards of airplane were
often overshadowed by disputes between investigators seeking hints
of a criminal act or a mechanical flaw. And the feat of recovering
and identifying the remains of as many of the 230 victims as
possible was often overshadowed by rancor over delays and by
relations with the families of victims.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions that built in the confounding months after the TWA
crash have persisted for years, and in recent months the National
Transportation Safety Board and the FBI, the two federal agencies
that worked so imperfectly three years ago, were at work on a set
of protocols for future joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The future, it turned out, arrived with tragic suddenness on
Sunday. There is no formal agreement between the two agencies, but
their commitment to doing this investigation differently has been
evident, in ways both striking and subtle.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Hall, the chairman of the safety board, who for weeks
did not go to the site of the Flight 800 crash, has appeared in
person at virtually every news briefing, giving cautious answers,
trying to limit speculation and, at every opportunity, underscoring
the primacy of the safety board in the investigation. By contrast,
the top FBI official in the investigation, Lewis D. Schiliro, has
remained in New York and appeared at no news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the board, which had never before been seriously
involved in dealing with the families of victims, has used its
newly created office of family affairs to deal with the emotionally
charged question of how to give those families comfort and
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we can do it a lot more clearly than the last
time,'' Schiliro, the assistant director in charge of the New York
FBI office, said in an interview Monday night. Before Flight 800,
the agencies had never had to deal with each other so intensively,
he said, adding: ``It took such a while to kind of figure out. That
was the first time we had been exposed to that.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior NTSB official echoed the sense that things were
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has clearly been a learning process about the fact that
it's an aviation accident until proven otherwise,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Flight 800 crash, investigators eventually concluded that
an explosion in the center fuel tanks was responsible for the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   While the NTSB, with its engineers and radar specialists, has
begun its traditionally methodical and careful collection and
examination of information, its chairman, Hall, has been emphatic
in his effort to establish his agency as the lead investigative
outfit, a status he believes it is granted under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first 48 hours of the investigation into the crash
of EgyptAir Flight 990, Hall dominated the news briefings. Indeed,
in the first news conference last Sunday, he firmly requested that
two FBI officials steer clear of the podium. The changed tenor has
been impossible to miss.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said the Clinton administration had
pressed for the agencies to work more effectively in the aftermath
of the TWA Flight 800 crash, and this week saw encouraging signs of
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage, things are moving much more smoothly, and we
are very pleased with that,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The problems with the TWA Flight 800 investigation, which were
given a full airing at congressional hearings last spring, revolved
around the often conflicting styles and needs of the FBI and the
safety board.
</P>
<P>
   The board felt outnumbered and strong-armed, and its
investigators complained that too much speculation was going on,
that interviews with witnesses were being mishandled and that they
were, on occasion, denied access to evidence. The FBI, the board
felt, was convinced the plane had been brought down by a bomb and
was determined to prove that was so.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, for its part, felt it had a responsibility to move
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed up with very little staff for weeks,'' James K.
Kallstrom, the former FBI official who ran the bureau's Flight 800
investigation, said of the safety board. ``They had five or six
people there. We had thousands of leads. I didn't even see Jim Hall
for a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 in some ways presents
eerie echoes of TWA Flight 800, and while the investigators are
making an effort to conduct the inquiry differently, there are many
factual differences that have colored the responses to the two
disasters, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities are that a jumbo jet left Kennedy International
Airport and abruptly fell into the ocean with no distress call and
no radar pattern indicating the crew had any control of the
aircraft. The abrupt destruction, combined with the fact that it
involved an airliner from a country with a history of terrorism
problems, naturally led to the involvement of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   But the differences are profound, according to investigators
involved in the two cases. TWA Flight 800 crashed when the United
States was on the ``highest state of alert for terrorism in
decades,'' said Kallstrom, who is now an executive of an insurance
company in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   It exploded shortly after sunset within sight of the crowded
south shore of Long Island, Kallstrom said, producing dozens of
witnesses, some of whose accounts cited the possibility that a
missile had downed the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happened there is that pretty much everybody
thought -- including the NTSB -- that that was a bomb,'' Kallstrom
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said those facts justified the FBI's dominance of public
discourse in the early days of the Flight 800 inquiry. In contrast,
the EgyptAir plane crashed late at night and far from shore.
</P>
<P>
   But if the facts are different in certain respects, the handling
of the current investigation reflects a switch in conduct driven by
much more than differing circumstances. It reflects a stronger
stance, and broader role, by the transportation safety board.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most noticeably, there has been an effort to limit
conjecture, best guesses and promises of early answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the other thing -- not only with the FBI, across the
board -- is to fight the tendency to speculate,'' Schiliro said.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the TWA case, treatment of the families of
victims has substantially changed, as well. After TWA Flight 800,
families of dozens of victims were sequestered at the Ramada Inn at
Kennedy International Airport, where instead of finding sanctuary
and a stream of reliable information they chiefly encountered
confusion. They soon grew angry at the pace of the investigation
and delays in identifying victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ballroom was like a convention selling something, with
these poor families sitting around, surrounded by police
organizations,'' recalled Hans Ephraimson-Abt, a spokesman for the
Air Crash Victims Family Group, an informal association of
relatives of victims of the Flight 800 crash, the 1998 crash of
Swissair Flight 111 and several other aviation accidents.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, families of some victims of Flight 990 were taken to
the same Ramada Inn. This time, though, victims' families were
quickly surrounded by teams of grief specialists from the safety
board, EgyptAir, and the Red Cross. Within a day, they began moving
to Newport, R.I., where their numbers swelled Tuesday to more than
270 people, Red Cross officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A law passed after the TWA Flight 800 crash, the Aviation
Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1996, broadened the mandate of
the safety board to include not just crash investigation, but also
to assist survivors of crashes, if any, and families of victims.
The law also firmly established the role of the Red Cross in
providing counseling and other aid in the hours and days after a
disaster, said Phil Zepeda, a Red Cross spokesman at the Newport
family assistance center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before 1996, it was all kind of ad libbed, and now our
position in providing grief counseling is solidified,'' he said.
``With each case, we become more efficient and effective.
Unfortunately, our training ground is a plane crash.''

 &HT;    McKeon wins AP manager of year
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ His team didn't win its division, let alone make it
to the playoffs or the World Series, but Associated Press writers
coast-to-coast recognized what Jack McKeon did for the low-budget
Cincinnati Reds in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   By a large margin, McKeon was named Associated Press Major
League Manager of the Year, easily outdistancing runner-up Jimy
Williams of the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   After falling one victory short of winning the National League
Central division championship with a team most predicted would be
fortunate to finish .500 with its middle-of-the-road $34 million
payroll, McKeon's work was rewarded by the AP in his 50th season of
professional baseball.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon, who turns 69 on Nov. 23, third oldest manager in
baseball history behind Connie Mack (88) and Casey Stengel (77),
received 43 votes, 16 more than Williams. Atlanta's Bobby Cox
received 10, while Oakland's Art Howe and Arizona's Buck Showalter
each received six.
</P>
<P>
   The New York managers, the Yankees' Joe Torre and the Mets'
Bobby Valentine each received three and fired Cleveland manager
Mike Hargrove received one.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've been in the game as long as I have, you're not
surprised or disappointed by anything,'' McKeon said. ``That way,
you aren't surprised when something happens and you aren't
disappointed when it doesn't. I appreciate the guys who voted for
me, guys who were able to see who had the hardest way to go and
finished the strongest. I guess they realized 96 wins is pretty
impressive for a team without a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon won more games than any Cincinnati team since the 1976
Big Red Machinists, who won 106 regular-season games, then seven
straight in the postseason. The 1990 World Series champions won
only 91 and the 1995 division champions won only 85.
</P>
<P>
   It is McKeon's first Manager of the Year award and he is the
front-runner for the Baseball Writers Association of America
Manager of the Year award, recognized as the top prize. It will be
announced next week.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon also had managerial stops at Kansas City, Oakland and San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've changed with age and experience,'' he said. ``I've
learned to be patient. If you yell at and criticize them, they stop
being aggressive and won't be themselves. We just let players do
their thing. You come to realize no one wants to make mistakes. All
you do is correct those mistakes and let the players gain the
experience they need.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Jim Bowden credits McKeon's soft-glove approach
to the quick development of young players Sean Casey, Pokey Reese,
Dmitri Young, Aaron Boone, Mike Cameron and Scott Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lets the players play and the coaches coach ... everybody
do their own thing,'' Bowden said. ``He isn't afraid to delegate
authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't happen to a nicer man, a man with a passion and a
love for the game of baseball,'' Bowden added. ``He lives,
breathes, eats and sleeps baseball and he loves nothing better than
to sit in his office, smoking his cigars, and talking baseball with
the writers, players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said all summer he should be National League Manager of the
Year, but this is even better ... top manager in baseball,'' Bowden
said.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon last week signed a one-year contract extension for
$550,000, fourth lowest in baseball, a $34,000 raise from his 1999
contract.

   Stefan senses unreal expectations
</P>
<P>
   By Jeff Schultz
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It occurred to Patrik Stefan about three weeks ago
that he might be setting himself up for a fall.
</P>
<P>
   When you score two goals as a 19-year-old against your native
country's hero and this era's greatest goaltender, people will come
to expect such heroics. Record five points in your first four NHL
games and logical projections go out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I scored against Buffalo (and Dominik Hasek), it was
great for me,'' Stefan said. ``After that game, I had a couple of
nice games, too. But I thought, `I hope everybody doesn't think I
always will score like that.'''
</P>
<P>
   For those who did, reality has struck like a cross-check to the
head. After that fast start, the Thrashers' rookie center went
pointless in his next five games. Then he missed Sunday's game
against Ottawa after suffering a severe cut on his right ear when
hit by a puck in practice and requiring plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Stefan's ear is healing, and the Thrashers hope his stick is as
well. Tonight's game against Tampa Bay at Philips Arena is the
first test.
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers coach Curt Fraser is not surprised by Stefan's slump.
The experience is not abnormal for an NHL rookie, even one who
played two years in a pro league such as the IHL.
</P>
<P>
   But Fraser was concerned enough about Stefan at practice last
week that he pulled him aside for a combination lecture and
motivation speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's not contributing offensively, I don't want him to
become frustrated or worrying that he's not contributing to our
hockey club,'' Fraser said. ``This is a big jump for him. We're
playing against a lot of good players. But he's going to have to
learn how to be patient and continue to work on his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good things are going to happen for him,'' the coach said.
``But when they don't happen, maybe because the other team is
focusing on him a little bit more, he's got to learn from that and
grow as a player. He can't get down about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser sensed just that last week against Calgary when Stefan
failed to record a shot on 17 shifts. ``He was coming off the ice
with his head down,'' Fraser said. ``It was a pretty physical game,
and he wasn't getting a lot done.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen in the Czech Republic, and it didn't happen
in the IHL, where Stefan generally faced slower or smaller or less
physical players. To quote assistant general manager Les Jackson,
``He's used to being the best player, and now he has to start back
at the bottom again.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefan says he understands that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just my first year,'' he said. ``I got off to a great
start. But this happens even to the stars of the NHL. I'll just try
to play like I played before. If I do that, I think I'll get some
chances, and some goals and assists will come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is fine,'' Stefan said. ``I still have to learn
lots of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Speed is the biggest difference in the NHL and IHL, he said.
``Everything is faster. Everything. Not just the skating but moving
the puck. The players are the best players in the world, so if you
make a mistake they can score.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser said Stefan is waiting for the action to come to him
instead of just jumping into the play to create scoring chances. It
hasn't helped that linemates have seemingly switched every game,
but Fraser said the changes have nothing to do with a player's work
habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some times the other night when he didn't look like
he was working for his opportunities,'' Fraser said. ``Patrik has
to be accountable and we have to make him accountable for his
performances on the ice because we want him to grow. He has to
learn to work hard every shift. But he's a mature kid. He knows
what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that Stefan is going through a problem particularly
common with young skill players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had it with Mike Modano (in Minnesota, then Dallas),'' he
said. ``They just need time and have to play through it. There's
nothing you can do but wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrik's like every other kid,'' Jackson said. ``He's in the
best league in the world, and he's up against some top competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he doesn't produce, particularly because he's going
through growing pains or he's going against teams who look at us
and think he's the guy they have to stop, he has some frustrations.
That's just part of his development.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of the 30 years Bernie Thiel has been growing squash,
he has battled an invisible but potent adversary: viruses that can
turn his neat rows of sunny-yellow vegetables into a mottled,
sickly green harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see a virus in your fields, it makes you sick,'' said
Thiel, showing a visitor a patch of ruined squash in his fields in
Idalou, Texas, outside Lubbock. ``There is no cure for it. You're
done.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, Thiel fought back, trying out a yellow
crookneck that genetic engineers had armed with resistance to two
devastating viruses. In doing so, he has joined hundreds of other
American farmers embarking on what some scientists say is an
uncontrolled ecological experiment carrying unknown risks _ the
planting of millions of acres of genetically engineered crops on
American land.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agriculture Department, the primary agency responsible
for assuring the ecological safety of such plants, has never
rejected a single application for a genetically engineered crop.
Scientists who studied the approvals say the department has
frequently relied on unsupported claims and shoddy studies by the
companies producing the seeds. Department officials acknowledge
that their system for weighing applications is ``evolving.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, dozens of biotechnology crops have been approved for
sale to American farmers and hundreds more are in the pipeline,
with genes borrowed from every form of life _ bacterial, viral,
insect, even animal. American farmers like Thiel, seeking greater
yields and profits, have enthusiastically adopted the new plants,
using biotech seeds for 20 to 45 percent of the country's corn,
soybean and cotton last year. Most Americans have probably eaten
some food made with genetically modified soy or corn. But Thiel's
squash, produced by Asgrow Vegetable Seeds, was the first approved
bioengineered crop with the potential to spread its doctored genes
into the larger environment.
</P>
<P>
   While fears that such crops are unsafe to eat have stirred
popular alarm in Europe, and to a lesser extent in the United
States, some biologists say the more immediate concern is this:
that genetically modified plants could interact with the
environment in hazardous ways, and that federal regulators are not
demanding the proper studies to assess the risks.
</P>
<P>
   A close look at how the Asgrow squash made its way from the
laboratory to the dusty fields of West Texas, based on documents
and interviews, shows that the virus-resistant strain was approved
without rigorous study, setting what critics say is a lax standard
for assessing environmental risk.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment they first heard of the squash, scientists
worried most about the possibility that it could breed with wild
squash plants, creating a ``superweed'' that would proliferate in
the wild or in farmers' fields, comparable to relentless invaders
like the South's kudzu vine or the Great Lakes' zebra mussels.
</P>
<P>
   The critical question was whether viruses keep the population of
wild squash in check. Asgrow determined that they do not by
conducting a survey involving lab tests of 14 plants selected from
nine sites. None had the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in environmental risk say the study proved nothing.
``What if we asked if the most important disease controlling human
population sizes, malaria, was in fact an important disease?'' said
Dr. Norman Ellstrand, an evolutionary biologist at the University
of California at Riverside. ``If you took 14 random individuals
from around the world, the chances of picking one that has malaria
would be relatively low, making the chance of getting a misleading
result really high.''
</P>
<P>
   Even scientists at Asgrow admitted that they could have done a
more thorough job of providing information to the Agriculture
Department on the plant's ecological safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a learning process for all of us,'' said David
Tricoli, managing research scientist at Seminis Seeds, which now
owns Asgrow Vegetable Seeds. ``I'm a molecular biologist. I'm not
an ecologist.'' Tricoli said, however, that he believed the squash
posed no risks.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department officials involved in approving the
squash stand by their decision and note that there are no signs of
environmental damage. But five years after farmers were allowed to
begin planting the squash, another agency of the department funded
a study to determine whether the genetically engineered squash
could create superweeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we're making the best decisions that can be made
on the basis of the information that we have,'' said Keith Pitts,
policy adviser to the secretary of agriculture, who described the
agency's regulatory process as ``evolving.'' The Agriculture
Department announced Sept. 29 that the National Academy of Sciences
would be conducting a review of the agency's regulatory process.
Pitts added, ``We don't claim to have this system totally worked
out.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of studies suggest that the genetically
engineered crops could lead to rapid evolution of
pesticide-resistant insects, creation of new plant diseases and
harm to insects that benefit mankind. A recent laboratory study,
for example, showed that corn pollen engineered to carry a toxin
against the European corn borer can kill monarch butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually we are going to have some problems,'' said Dr.
Allison Snow, a plant ecologist at Ohio State University. ``I don't
think the risks are being taken seriously or addressed seriously by
the system we have now.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of genetically engineered crops say such fears are
overblown and are creating roadblocks for a technology that could
feed the world and offer a host of other benefits. For example, Dr.
Charles Arntzen, president and chief executive of the Boyce
Thompson Institute for Plant Research Inc., is developing bananas
that grow medicines and could act as child-friendly delivery
systems for vaccines. Arntzen compared the risk posed by
genetically engineered crops to the risk of getting hit by an
asteroid while sitting in his New York office. ``The real risk is
the hysteria,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The supporters say critics ask the impossible: technology
without risks and a promise of unconditional safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world you'd know all the risks and all the
benefits before you use something,'' said Dr. Herb Aldwinckle, a
plant pathologist at Cornell University, ``but we'd be very slow to
progress if we had to know all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, risks posed by these crops must be weighed against
the benefits they offer farmers, consumers and the environment. But
even as the first large-scale studies of benefits of genetically
modified plants appear, more questions than answers remain. Even
for Asgrow's squash, the plant that Tricoli called ``the most
highly regulated and reviewed squash product ever produced,'' the
costs and benefits to farmers and the environment remain unclear.
</P>
<P>
   In Idalou, Thiel, who has been planting and picking squash all
his life, was philosophical. ``We've got a long way to go before we
know whether it's good or bad,'' he said. ``The way I see it,
whenever you get something, you lose something else. We just don't
know what we'll lose yet.''

CONGRESS BLESSES A 1 PERCENT BUDGET CUT, BUT CLINTON WON'T

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The final battle of this year's budget war was
joined Tuesday, as President Clinton rejected as ``blind'' and
``mindless'' an across-the-board budget cut passed by Congress and
his negotiators hunkered down with congressional chairmen to shape
the federal budget behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, Senate Republicans, after cloakroom cajoling
and last-minute maneuvering, held their noses and voted 49-48 for
the nearly 1 percent cut for federal agencies, which was attached
to the year's last spending bill for labor, health and education
programs.
</P>
<P>
   By afternoon, Clinton dismissed the budget cut as a carelessly
wielded meat ax and called the spending bill ``a catalog of missed
opportunities, misguided priorities and mindless cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not let it become law,'' he said in a written statement
from Oslo, Norway, where he was part of the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks. ``This debate is not just about how much we spend but
how wisely we spend.''
</P>
<P>
   And that debate began in earnest Tuesday. With final passage of
the spending bill, the last of 13 to clear Congress, legislating
was done with and real negotiating began.
</P>
<P>
   The president's budget and policy experts were negotiating with
the chairmen of major congressional committees over the final bill
and four other spending measures that Clinton has vetoed or refused
to sign. Those four have to do with financing foreign operations;
the Departments of Commerce, State and Justice; the Interior
Department; and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president wants more money,'' said Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``There are some disagreements.'' But, he said,
``they can be worked out in the next couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere upward of $6 billion and a half-dozen thorny policy
issues separate the two sides. The issues involved include disputes
over what type of education programs to finance, money for hiring
more local police officers and riders to the Interior Department
bill. The administration is also seeking money to pay past U.N.
dues and to help pay for the Wye River accord.
</P>
<P>
   Money is not the main problem; political policies embedded in
the bills are the sticking points.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has already blown past the spending limits it swore to
this year _ $580 billion for federal agencies _ by at least $31
billion. It will not be loath to add a few billion more to end the
struggle over the spending bills and adjourn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bills have plenty of money,'' said the White House budget
director, Jack Lew. ``The problem is that the funding doesn't go to
the right priorities. We have to go through the bills and see about
the policies, which is where the real problems are.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, chairman of the Senate Republican
Policy Committee, was optimistic, saying: ``The stars are
aligning.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., warned that real
fiscal and political differences remain. ``There's a lot of work to
be done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the spending bill passed Tuesday has about $300
million more for education programs than Clinton requested. But it
has a key provision he opposes: instead of providing $1.4 billion
to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class sizes in public schools,
it has $1.2 billion that states and school districts could use for
other educational purposes. Clinton has said he will not compromise
on this issue, but may have to accept education cuts elsewhere to
win.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also wants hundreds of millions of dollars to buy up
wilderness and park lands to protect them from development, which
he calls his ``Lands Legacy'' initiative. But the bill that would
finance it, the Interior Department measure, contains Republican
riders, opposed by the White House, favoring the oil, gas, mining
and ranching industries, like a measure allowing gold mines to dump
thousands of tons of waste on public land.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said he sensed a developing deal to trade money for the
president's initiative in exchange for a rider or two being signed
into law. Lew said there would be no tit-for-tat on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also say the White House may give up some key
domestic policy provisions in exchange for money for international
programs it values. These include the $1 billion in back dues that
the United States owes the United Nations and hundreds of millions
of dollars to help implement Mideast peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   This year the president has signed into law bills that finance
the Agriculture Department; the Pentagon and a separate bill on
military construction; energy and water development; congressional
operations; transportation; the Treasury Department and the postal
service, and the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and
Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The 49-48 vote on the across-the-board cut and the labor, health
and education measure showed how hard it has been for Republicans
to achieve the only legislative task the Constitution requires of
Congress, passing spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the measures won 218 votes _ the barest majority _
in the House. Tuesday, final passage came only after Sen. Chuck
Hagel, R-Neb., switched his vote from nay to yea. Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., who opposed the across-the-board cut, chose the campaign
trail over the chamber; he was absent.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Had the bill failed, Republican senators said, their strategy
for completing the budget would have been destroyed. Without a
final bill, the budget talks could have become a free-for-all. That
happened last year, and Clinton won policy points while Congress
tarred its public image and bloated the budget with $21 billion in
new spending stuffed into an omnibus bill.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans voted with distaste. ``I'm one of those that
had difficulty voting Tuesday,'' Craig said. ``But that was the
horse that got me across the river. And I prefer staying dry.''  &QL;

A PARIS ARTS FESTIVAL THAT LOOKS OUTWARD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ International arts festivals usually offer eclectic
programs of music, dance and theater meant to squeeze maximum
excitement into a few weeks. Thus, if Salzburg, Edinburgh or
Lincoln Center in New York is any guide, festivals often become
ends in themselves: they, rather than their host cities, are the
stars.
</P>
<P>
   And at least in Europe, which is home to hundreds of arts
festivals today, they busily compete with one another for attention
and acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   The Festival d'Automne a Paris never fitted this mold. In its
first year, 1972, it lasted four weeks; now it starts in late
September each year and continues for three months. Further, its
founder, Michel Guy, was concerned less with creating a festival as
such than with filling holes in the Paris cultural scene.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, he once noted, Paris was floundering in
``self-sufficiency, mediocrity and chauvinism.'' Guy was
particularly alarmed that Paris seemed unaware of the postwar
artistic explosion in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy, then, was to reach out for the best contemporary
creation to be found beyond France's borders. And it succeeded. By
the 1980s, not only was the fall festival regularly commissioning
new music and presenting innovative productions from Asia and
Africa, but top American choreographers (like Merce Cunningham and
Trisha Brown) and theater directors (like Robert Wilson and Richard
Foreman) had also become household names here. Guy died in 1990,
but his spirit still guides the festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can now see that the festival served as a transmission belt
that brought contemporary American culture to Europe,'' said Alain
Crombecque, who was the festival's director general from 1974 to
1976 (when Guy was minister of culture) and who returned to the
post in 1992. ``Since then, the Paris-New York link has remained
solid, with the Brooklyn Academy of Music, with Lincoln Center,
with many artists.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just Paris that has benefited.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, the festival was supporting American artists
who weren't being supported in their own country, so it was very
important for them,'' said Harvey Lichtenstein, the former
president and executive producer of the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
``There was more understanding and tolerance of American
avant-garde work in Europe, and I think the festival has been
leading that charge for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the festival served as something of a model for
Lichtenstein's own Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy,
although there it was often avant-garde European fare that was
offered to New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Paris festival is typically diverse, with a strong
emphasis on contemporary music. (In the past, the festival has also
worked closely with the likes of Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz
Stockhausen and Iannis Xenakis.)
</P>
<P>
   Two concerts of music by Luigi Nono at the Cite de la Musique
last month are to be followed by an evening of works by the German
composer Wolfgang Rihm at the Theatre du Chatelet on Nov. 18 and
the premiere of ``A,'' an 85-minute choral work by the young French
composer Brice Pauset, also at the Chatelet on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Although the festival commissioned two short pieces by Rihm as
well as ``A,'' its role is usually that of a co-producer. On
occasion, it works with other festivals in Europe and the United
States, but more often it uses its $4 million annual budget to
encourage Paris theaters to present offbeat works.
</P>
<P>
   ``With contemporary music, there is more risk, so we need each
other,'' Crombecque said.
</P>
<P>
   The new production of Luciano Berio's opera, ``Outis,'' which
opens at the Chatelet on Nov. 15, is a case in point. Josephine
Markovits, the festival's respected music director, attended the
opera's premiere at La Scala in 1997 and immediately contacted
Jean-Pierre Brossmann, the Chatelet's new director, who traveled to
Milan to see the work. They then agreed to create a new production
together, keeping several of the original soloists as well as the
conductor, David Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have probably done it without the festival, but the
festival makes a big difference,'' Brossmann said. ``Apart from the
money it contributes, about 10 percent of the cost of the
production, it brings its own audience. The festival has a
significant following of its own. So here we can draw on the
Chatelet's public and the festival's public.''
</P>
<P>
   But as always, the festival is eager to import existing fare
from abroad. Laurie Anderson, another festival regular, will
present her theatrical meditation ``Songs and Stories From
Moby-Dick'' (seen last month at the Brooklyn Academy) at the MC 93
cultural center in Bobigny, outside Paris, beginning on Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Theatre de l'Odeon last month presented the
French premiere of Heiner Goebbels' ``Eislermaterial,'' a choral
work inspired by the German composer Hanns Eisler, who died in
1962.
</P>
<P>
   But the musical high point this fall is Chen Shi-Zheng's
production of the epic 16th-century Chinese opera ``The Peony
Pavilion,'' which was also the centerpiece of the Lincoln Center
Festival last summer. Like Lincoln Center, the Paris festival had
planned to present the 19-hour opera last year but was frustrated
when the Shanghai cultural authorities kept Chen's original cast
from leaving China.

 &HT;    Forget the nickname _ Hampton's play says it allBy Suzanne
Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Casey Hampton was having a good-natured
conversation earlier this week with a member of the Texas sports
information staff. The talk was about postseason honors and how a
player sometimes needs a hook, a catchy nickname or distinctive
appearance to separate himself from the rest of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Last year UT could hype Ricky Williams' records and dreadlocks.
The year before, James Brown could say ``I feel good'' whenever he
threw a touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   This season, it's Kwame ``Cadillac'' Cavil and his silky-smooth
69 catches.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's nickname of Big Hamp, while fitting for a guy who
weighs 305 pounds, doesn't lend itself to a memorable slogan that
can be printed on a postcard and mailed to potential media voters.
He has no sack dance, no signature style.
</P>
<P>
   All he does is make tackles. Lots and lots of tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I don't understand,'' said Hampton, a junior who
is a three-year starter at defensive tackle _ ``why your play just
can't speak for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's play does scream ``All-American'' in deafening volume.
More than likely he'll have to settle this year for All-Big 12
Conference and the opportunity to link his name with other Longhorn
greats.
</P>
<P>
   He has 64 tackles, tops on the team and six ahead of free safety
Greg Brown. The last Longhorn interior lineman to lead the team in
tackles was Brian Espinosa, whose 118 stops in 1986 still weren't
good enough to make All-Southwest Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Former Longhorn standout and Chicago Bear Steve ``Mongo''
McMichael is the only other interior lineman to lead Texas in
tackles since UT officially began keeping such stats in 1975.
McMichael had 142 in 1978 to cap his first of two All-America
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Linemen rarely lead a team in tackles, especially in a 4-3
scheme like the Longhorns use. Tackles typically are the
blue-collar workers who tie up blockers so that the linebackers can
clean up the play, corral the runners and show up on the stat
sheets.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, only one other lineman has led UT in tackles. But Tony
Brackens, who is now with the NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars, could
claim only a tie with linebacker Tyson King in 1994. Each had 90.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hampton is listed as a tackle in UT's four-man line, he
spends most of his time at noseguard, directly over center or on
the center's shoulder. Teams have had the unenviable task of
picking which of UT's tackles to double-team, leaving either
Hampton or Shaun Rogers to have a banner afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday against Iowa State, it was Hampton, whose 10 tackles
led all Longhorn defenders. It was his best game, statistically,
since he had 14 against Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you draw up the blueprint for a noseguard, you get
Casey,'' said UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese. ``He's built
like a Brahma bull.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could only choose one guy, you choose Casey because he
hates to lose. He always gives his best effort. With his work ethic
and pride, he's not going to let himself down, and in turn, he's
not going to let his coach down.''
</P>
<P>
   Work ethic aside, Hampton has talent that other linemen envy. He
can bench press 485 pounds, making him the strongest Longhorn
defender. At a tad over 6 feet tall, he has a low center of gravity
that allows him to hunker underneath the offensive linemen assigned
to get in his way.
</P>
<P>
   And he has speed, which might not show up on a stopwatch but is
evident on a playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casey has such explosive speed,'' UT Coach Mack Brown said.
``He has such a low base that he's able to penetrate. He just
shoves the guards back. And he is fast. Against Nebraska, on an
option left, he comes all the way across the defensive line, hits
the quarterback and knocks the ball out.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only knock against Hampton _ and it is a small one _
is whether he has an effective pass rush. He has only two of the
Longhorns' 26 sacks this season, but his 17 quarterback pressures
are tied for the team lead with Aaron Humphrey and Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's pressures are a bit different from Humphrey's. Against
Iowa State, Hampton, figuring that he couldn't get to quarterback
Sage Rosenfels in time, simply shoved a 280-pound linemen into
Rosenfels' gut, with the impact forcing an incompletion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They double-team me, they double-team me,'' said the
good-natured Hampton, as he talked of another sack that just got
away. ``There was this quarterback and I was looking dead at him. I
hit him, and I thought he was just going to curl right up. But he
just stood back up. Man.''

 PARIS: leaving China.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The current production, with 20 percent of its financing coming
from the Paris festival, will be presented twice, over the last
weekend in November and the first in December, in the Grande Halle
de la Villette.
</P>
<P>
   While hardly contemporary, ``The Peony Pavilion'' fits into a
parallel tradition of the Paris festival. From its inception, Guy
was eager to look beyond Western culture. And over the years, the
festival has presented music, theater and dance from Australia,
Africa, Japan and India.
</P>
<P>
   In September, in the one event this year created entirely by the
festival, it was the turn of women villagers from six different
regions of Morocco to perform their traditional songs. Dressed in
rich costumes and accompanied by drums, flutes and string
instruments, they performed to good audiences at the Theatre des
Bouffes du Nord.
</P>
<P>
   Dance, too, has long been central to the Festival d'Automne,
with Americans highly visible. This year, the Merce Cunningham
Dance Company is making its ninth festival appearance, presenting
11 performances at the Theatre de la Ville beginning on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Martha Graham Dance Company, another frequent guest of the
festival, will perform at the Maison des Arts in Creteil, outside
Paris, beginning on Nov. 23. The Japanese troupe Dumb Type
performed in Creteil last month. Two young French choreographers,
Mathilde Monnier and Boris Charmatz, are also part of the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Collin, the director for dance and theater, said the
festival gives special importance to accompanying artists on their
creative voyage, which explains why so many are frequently invited
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some, like Merce Cunningham, are in perpetual creativity,''
she said. ``At the age of 80-plus, he has all the brio and talent
of a young man. He's the oldest around and perhaps the most
remarkable in his use of new technologies onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Foreman, the American playwright and director, whose
``Paradise Hotel'' was presented in Creteil last month, has been
appearing at the festival regularly since it began and may well be
better known in Paris than in New York. In contrast, the New
York-based Wooster Group, which is presenting ``House/Lights'' here
in December at the Theatre de la Bastille, is making its first
appearance at the festival.
</P>
<P>
   The theater program also includes Claude Regy's production of
``Quelqu'un Va Venir'' by the Norwegian playwright Jon Fosse,
Robert Lepage's ``Zulu Time,'' and three Shakespeare plays,
``Hamlet,'' ``Measure for Measure'' and ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream,'' directed by Carlo Cecchi and performed in Italian with
French surtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, every year the festival sponsors one work of
contemporary art at the Chapelle St. Louis de la Salpetriere.
Artists who have used the cavernous circular former chapel in the
past include Rebecca Horn, Bill Viola and Anish Kapoor. This year,
the American artist Martin Puryear has created ``This Mortal
Coil,'' a stunning wooden sculpture resembling a spiral inside a
frame that makes exciting use of the unusual space.
</P>
<P>
   And yet given the variety of international productions now
presented in Paris and nearby suburbs throughout the year, the
question arises: is the Festival d'Automne still necessary?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it is less crucial than, say, 20 years ago, yet the
consensus here is that it still has a role to play. With a budget
one-quarter of that of the summer opera festival in
Aix-en-Provence, its funds are limited, but it can still influence
whether or not a performance takes place. (For example, it is
picking up half the cost of Laurie Anderson's show at Bobigny.)
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, in their different fields, Ms. Markovits
and Ms. Collin are constantly looking out for new talent and
avant-garde productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They find the support to make things happen,'' Lichtenstein
said of the festival's two artistic directors. ``Josephine
Markovits, for instance, was a huge supporter of `The Peony
Pavilion.' But they also come up with ideas that others might not
have. They are conceptualizers, and that's not easy to find.''

SENATE BACKS LOWER IMPORT TAX   ON AFRICAN AND CARIBBEAN GOODS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Miss., S.D., Del.)   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A popular package of trade bills for African and
Caribbean nations escaped a procedural thicket in the Senate on
Tuesday and advanced toward final approval when the senators voted
to limit debate and consider amendments to the far-reaching
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The senators voted 74-23 to end one of a series of filibusters
led by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., who fears that African
exports will hurt his state's politically powerful textile
industry. Organized labor, worried over the impact on jobs in the
apparel industry, also opposes the bill.
</P>
<P>
   A final vote on the measure is expected later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The bills would reduce or eliminate duties on a wide range of
goods made in sub-Saharan Africa, Central America and the
Caribbean, mostly those assembled with fabric made in the United
States. President Clinton and a large majority in Congress support
the measures.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the measure's importance to the White House,
Clinton issued a statement from Oslo, Norway, where he is taking
part in a two-day summit meeting on the Middle East peace talks,
calling the vote Tuesday ``an important milestone in our effort to
build a new economic relationship with sub-Saharan Africa and
deepen ties with our Caribbean and Central American neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also keen to take a deal with him to Seattle on Nov.
30, when he is to open a meeting of the world's top trade
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's action breathes life into a measure that seemed in
jeopardy just last Friday, when all 40 Democrats joined together to
oppose a Republican effort to cut off debate. That Democratic vote
was in protest of a parliamentary move by Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
the majority leader, to bar Democrats from offering amendments to
the bills.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott and the Democratic leader, Sen. Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, both strong supporters of the bill, agreed to allow
trade-related amendments and to consider unrelated amendments, like
raising the minimum wage, on a separate bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lott had said last week that if Tuesday's vote failed to end the
filibuster _ a process called cloture, which needs 60 votes _ he
would pull the measure from the Senate agenda and the trade bills
would be dead for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., who heads the Finance
Committee, proclaimed Tuesday's vote a sign of the ``strong
bipartisan support for the legislation.'' After last Friday's vote,
Roth angrily accused Democrats of ``isolationism.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, his top national security aides and Senate Democrats
have emphasized the issue of isolationism since the Senate's
rejected a treaty to ban underground nuclear testing three weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate approves a trade package this week, it still must
reconcile differences with the House, which approved a bill, for
Africa only, by a vote of 234-163 in July.

SCHOOLS MUST TEACH RIGHT AND WRONG, `CULTIVATE CONSCIENCE,' BUSH
SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GORHAM, N.H. _ Seizing on public anxiety over recent episodes of
school violence, Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Tuesday that, as
president, he would make moral values and discipline a central
focus of the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children must be educated in reading and writing, but also
in right and wrong,'' the Republican presidential candidate said.
``Our schools should not cultivate confusion. They must cultivate
conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech to the Northern White Mountain Chamber of Commerce
was the third education proposal unveiled by the candidate in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the latest proposal is moral values. Bush
said teachers should make values as much a part of the curriculum
as math and English. He called for tripling, from $8 million to
about $25 million, the annual federal investment in ``character
education'' programs.
</P>
<P>
   Such programs train teachers to incorporate lessons in virtues
and morality into the school curriculum. He said he would boost
spending on sexual abstinence efforts from $62 million to at least
$135 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also called for a crackdown on guns in schools, a federal
law to protect educators from student lawsuits over discipline and
a zero-tolerance policy for disruptive behavior in America's
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of timid pleading and bargaining and legal haggling
with disruptive students must be over,'' he said. ``We do not need
tort lawyers scouring the halls of our schools, turning every
classroom dispute into a treasure hunt for damage awards.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hepp, Fort Worth area representative for the Texas State
Teachers Association, said teachers have had the right to remove
students from the classroom since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   That power was revised four years ago through the Texas Safe
School Act, which allows teachers to remove students from their
classrooms after documenting persistently disruptive behavior, said
Larry Shaw, director of United Educators Association.
</P>
<P>
   Texas law also protects teachers from frivolous lawsuits and
grants them immunity from paying damages to students and parents
who accuse them of wrongdoing, Shaw and Hepp said. However, the
immunity does not apply to proven abuse or neglect by a teacher,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A parent can still sue for neglect. You're never going to get
away from that,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush urged school administrators to permit the
voluntary expression of religion, he did not propose any laws or
constitutional changes to encourage school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools must never impose religion, but they must not oppose
religion either,'' Bush said. ``Students have a right to say grace
before meals, read their Bibles, wear Stars of David and crosses,
and discuss religion with other willing students.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats dismissed his package as ``education lite.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush offered an explanation for the recent wave of violence at
schools across the country. He said some students become infected
with ``a virus of apathy and cynicism'' that blurs distinctions
between right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see it in shrugged shoulders and you can hear it in
the watchword of a generation: `Whatever,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the Sept. 15 church shooting in Fort Worth to make the
point that a large majority of teen-agers are responsible
individuals. Bush said one 17-year-old victim at Wedgwood Baptist
Church shielded a handicapped friend after being wounded in the
attack that left seven dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are finding, in the midst of tragedy, that our children can
be heroes too,'' he said.

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO GREENSPAN: RISING HOME PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said
Tuesday that in some ways surging home prices give a greater kick
to the economy than rising stock prices do.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has pointed out with increasing frequency that the
real estate market influences the personal finances of many
households as much as, if not more, than the stock market does. In
a speech Tuesday to America's Community Bankers, the trade group
for the savings and loan industry, Greenspan fleshed out his point,
relying in part on data from internal Federal Reserve studies.
</P>
<P>
   By most measures, he said, gains in the stock market remain more
important to increases in consumer spending than those from housing
or any other asset market. The appreciation of stock prices has
been ``vastly greater'' than that of home prices, he said, noting
that housing accounted for one-sixth of what economists call the
wealth effect _ the tendency of consumers to spend rather than hold
or reinvest some of the gains they reap from rising asset values.
The rest came overwhelmingly from Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the influence of rising home values on the economy
would most likely grow in coming years. And he said that on a
dollar for dollar basis, gains from the sale of a home translate
into bigger increases in consumer spending than do gains from
rising equity values, probably because consumers view rising house
prices as much more of a sure thing than rising stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Stock market gains permanently lift the level of consumer
outlays by 3 percent to 4 percent of the value of the gain, while
the permanent increase in spending that results from gains in
housing wealth appears to be about 5 percent, Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major reason for these significant differences in spending
out of household wealth is doubtless that, while home prices do on
occasion decline, large declines are rare,'' Greenspan said. The
general experience for most homeowners, he said, ``is a modest but
persistent rise in home values that is perceived to be largely
permanent.''
</P>
<P>
   The consistency of gains from housing stands in sharp contrast
to ``volatile and often ephemeral gains in stock market wealth,''
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, most big gains in the stock market go to
people in the highest income groups, whose spending patterns do not
change much based on how their investments are doing. Capital gains
from housing are concentrated further down the income scale, where
they are more likely to be translated into higher spending levels.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan did not make any comment on the level of stock prices,
and he did not give any clue as to whether the central bank will
raise interest rates for a third time this year when its
policy-setting committee meets in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his remarks took a long-term view of trends in the
housing industry and amounted to another session in Greenspan's
long-running seminar on the forces reshaping the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Fed chairman said, the portion of all home
sales accounted for by newly built homes has declined, to about 16
percent in the last five years from 40 percent three decades ago.
The reason is that new-home building tracks the growth rate in
household formation, which has been declining.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, single-family home starts have averaged 1.10
million a year, down from 1.14 million in the 1970s, Greenspan
said. Annual sales of existing homes have averaged about 4 million
during the 1990s, he said, up from 2.8 million in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend has important implications for economic activity
beyond its impact on home building, because the sale of a newly
constructed home does not generate capital gains financed through
the mortgage market,'' Greenspan said. ``Sales of existing homes
almost always do, and the purchasing power released through
converting home equity to unencumbered cash can affect overall
consumer demand and the economy, just as the stock market gains of
recent years have boosted consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's research shows that the average capital gain over the
last five years on the sale of an existing home, after accounting
for transaction costs, was more than $25,000. Homeowners also
tapped into their equity through home equity loans and by
refinancing their loans in a way that allowed them to take some of
their equity gains as cash, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the average seller of an existing home, the equity
extracted net of transaction costs generally far exceeds the down
payment on his or her next home purchase,'' Greenspan said. A
significant amount of the money, he added, ``is spent on consumer
goods, especially on big ticket items in a manner not materially
different from windfall income in general.''

CLINTON VOWS TO VETO `FLAWED' SPENDING PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The last and largest appropriations bill for the
2000 fiscal year was approved by the Senate on Tuesday, clearing
the way for a final round of budget talks aimed at producing a
federal spending plan that Republicans and President Clinton can
live with.
</P>
<P>
   The $314 billion bill financing the District of Columbia, labor,
education and health programs squeaked by the Senate 49-48 after
passing the House last week 218-211.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, in Norway to promote the Middle East peace process,
called the measure ``a deeply flawed spending bill,'' and said he
would veto it because it contains a nearly 1 percent
across-the-board spending cut that Republicans attached to it at
the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the cuts, which would total about $4 billion
overall, ``mindless,'' saying they would force agencies and
departments to trim vital programs. He described the entire bill as
``a catalog of missed opportunities'' and ``misguided priorities,''
and characterized its lack of specific funding for hiring more
teachers as particularly troubling. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``It forces America's schoolchildren to pay the price for
Congress' failure to make responsible choices. I will not let it
become law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was the last of 13 appropriations measures needed to
fund the federal government through the 2000 fiscal year. Its
passage will enable Republicans to say they finished work on all
spending measures for the year, as promised, although the job
didn't get done until more than a month after the Oct. 1 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans hope to turn their budget effort into campaign
fodder next year by claiming the across-the-board cut and other
accounting techniques prevented Social Security money from being
tapped to help fund government operations.
</P>
<P>
   That claim, however, is in some dispute, given an assessment by
the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that says the
Republican budget will still end up borrowing $17 billion next year
from the Social Security Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the 2000 budget will or will not spend Social Security
money is expected to be at the heart of talks over the next week
between Republican leaders and Clinton. Although both sides are
only about $5 billion apart on what the overall 2000 spending level
should be, there are still significant differences over how the
money should be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for example, wants $1.4 billion earmarked for the U.S.
Education Department to help implement his plan to reduce class
sizes by hiring 100,000 more teachers. The Republicans signed off
on that plan last year, but chose not to designate funding for that
purpose in the 2000 budget. Instead, they included $1.2 billion for
state education departments to spend as they choose. Clinton
worries that the GOP funding provision would give states a green
light to use the federal money to underwrite local voucher programs
that would subsidize parents who send their children to private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton is demanding more money for hiring as many
as 50,000 more local police officers. The president also wants
nearly $1 billion to help pay overdue U.S. financial obligations to
the United Nations, and foreign aide to help implement the Wye
River peace agreements between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also objects to a provision in the bill that would
prevent the National Institutes of Health from awarding $7.5
billion in grants next year until the last two days of September
2000. The move would in effect roll over thousands of important
medical research awards, many of them earmarked for Houston-area
hospitals and universities, into the 2001 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has a profound impact. It's like not funding research for
that 12-month period of time. So, we've got a serious problem here
that has to be addressed,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said nearly all of
the items Clinton wants ``are negotiable.'' But he and other
Republican leaders are insisting that Clinton come up with ways,
short of raising taxes and tapping Social Security, to pay for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Added together, the 2000 appropriations bills total about $618
billion. Clinton has signed eight of the 13 bills into law. By this
weekend, he will have rejected five.
</P>
<P>
   The vetoed bills, including the one passed Tuesday by the
Senate, will likely be rolled into one big package accounting for
more than half of the government's spending next year.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he was hopeful that White House and Republican
negotiators will be ``able to come to a conclusion on this by ...
Friday or this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of issues that are outstanding. But I do
think, in the big scheme of things, they can be worked out in the
next couple of days,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Lott added that members are eager to adjourn for the year by
Veterans Day, Nov. 11. But Senate Appropriations Chairman Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska, cautioned that ``it will take a miracle'' to get
the remaining budget work done by then, primarily because of the
across-the-board cut Republicans are insisting on.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders say the cuts are designed to eliminate
wasteful spending. But Democrats charged Tuesday that the
across-the-board approach is one step in a GOP plan to eliminate
entire government departments, such as education and energy.

<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ The horror of what happened to the 217 men,
women and children on EgyptAir Flight 990 left relatives of the
dead screaming and crying with grief Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some fainted as they were told by investigators there was little
hope of finding intact bodies amid the pieces of wreckage nearly
300 feet beneath the stormy waters of the Atlantic off Nantucket
Island, a spokesman for the families said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no bodies left, only parts,'' said George Arian, who
has been helping the victims' families at a Newport hotel.
</P>
<P>
   One person had to be taken away in an ambulance after crash
investigators met with the families to update them on recovery
operations for their loved ones. The briefing was closed to the
media, who have not been allowed inside the Doubletree Hotel on
Goat Island here. Arian later came out and spoke with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 next of kin were in the hotel at the time. Another 70
arrived later in the day after a long flight from Cairo, Egypt,
where the doomed plane was bound when it crashed.
</P>
<P>
   They were accompanied by 39 Egyptian aviation and government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Mohammed Fahim Rayan, the chairman of EgyptAir,
who told reporters in Cairo before leaving, ``I wish it had been me
who had been sacrificed.''
</P>
<P>
   Another 100 or more relatives are expected to arrive at the
hotel, according to the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Arian described hours of unimaginable anguish for the 80 or so
family members who spent Monday night in the hotel. Some walked
hallways all night crying. Many carried pictures of their loved
ones who died, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One person sat on a hallway floor, banging his head on the wall,
asking, ``Why God? Why God?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had any sleep last night,'' he said of the families.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst came hours later, when investigators painted the
grim scene they have found as remains are slowly recovered from the
ocean. Few body parts larger than an arm have been found, Arian
quoted investigators as telling the family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the pieces are no bigger than fingers,'' he said.
``This is not what they expected to hear. They came here to see
their loved ones, to be able to touch them for the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian jetliner bound from New York to Cairo apparently
hit the ocean at a high speed. It may have even broken up in the
air moments before impact.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was about 30 minutes into its flight, cruising at an
altitude of 33,000 feet, when it suddenly dropped in a clear night
sky at more than 23,000 feet per minute.
</P>
<P>
   The victims also included 106 Americans, many of them retirees
embarking on tours to Egypt. Among them were a mother and daughter
from Washington state. Dorothy Allen, 57, and her daughter Jean,
27, lived in Port Orchard.
</P>
<P>
   An Edmonds, Wash., couple flew to Newport Monday after being
notified that two family members were aboard EgyptAir Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   Jeri Sides Crow and her husband, Michael Crow, learned Sunday
night that her uncle, Dr. Leroy Sides, a Denver internist, and a
cousin, Michael Sides of California, were among the victims. They
were traveling with two friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going to go down the Nile on a cruise and all of
them were looking forward to it,'' said Michael Crow. ``And it
wasn't to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crows paid a Halloween night visit to the Bothell, Wash.,
home of Jeri Crow's father, Don Crow. Moments before, the father
received a call from a relative notifying him of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had tears in his eyes and he said Uncle Roy (Leroy) and
cousin Mike were on that plane,'' said Michael Crow, 47, who works
in building maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Crow reacted Tuesday to word from the NTSB that there were few
bodies being recovered from the debris.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the families here are wanting their loved ones to be
returned and wanting to know what happened,'' Crow said. ``And a
lot of people are Muslim and need a body to bury, and they have
found that they will not be able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nada Eissa lost his brother-in-law in the crash. Hechem Farok
was a co-pilot for EgyptAir but was returning to Cairo as a
passenger, Eissa said Tuesday as he read a prayer book outside the
hotel and spoke with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He said he called his sister in Cairo and told her there was no
hope of finding her husband alive. Eissa said the Red Cross paid
for his ticket from Calgary, Canada, so he could fly to Rhode
Island and be near the recovery.
</P>
<P>
   He said his sister is on to way to Newport and his bringing the
oldest of her three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a feeling they are going to find his body,'' he
said of his brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Another family member, Sayed Gabr of Los Angeles, also spoke
with reporters outside the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   He had a photo of his sister, Fatima, waving just before she
boarded the airliner in Los Angeles on the first leg of the trip
back to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here hoping I get my sister out of the water. I'd like
to take her back home _ I'd like to bury her body back in Egypt,''
he said through tears.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators told family members blood samples may be needed to
help identify their loved ones using DNA, according to Arian.
Dozens of Red Cross workers are helping family members with any
needs they may have. Grief counselors and clergy are available.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth major air crash for Bob Hayes, a disaster
mental health officer with the Red Cross and leader of its aviation
response team. He was there for the family members of TWA Flight
800 and Swiss Air Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to do therapy but to mostly be supportive,''
he said. ``You can do that without saying a word. Just a hand on a
shoulder, being close, being present, can often be enough.''

EXCLUSIVE: ADMINISTRATION SHIFTS POSITION ON LIFTING OF SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, in a move intended to
bolster opponents of President Slobodan Milosevic, has agreed to
lift economic sanctions on Serbia as soon as there is a free
election there, senior administration officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had previously vowed that it would not lift
the sanctions until Milosevic had been removed from power.
</P>
<P>
   But officials calculate that the new strategy should allow the
Serbian opposition to increase popular pressure on Milosevic, to
call early elections, since holding a free election would mean an
end to an oil embargo, an air-travel ban and other sanctions that
have weakened an already devastated Serbian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is expected to make the
announcement Wednesday, but it carries a risk: that bickering
opposition parties would so fragment the election results that
Milosevic might be able to cling to power or, far less likely, that
he would win outright in the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   In either of those situations, the United States might find
itself compelled to lift sanctions on a government still led by
Milosevic, who has been indicted for war crimes by an international
tribunal in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say that Albright and her aides have
determined that the risk is tiny and that an internationally
monitored election would end Milosevic's political career.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Milosevic has remained in power as the Yugoslav president
even after some Western leaders predicted that his country's
battlefield losses and economic collapse meant his days were
numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Polls in Serbia indicate that nearly 70 percent of voters want a
new government. But the United States cannot be certain that voters
will have the nerve to cast ballots for change and that the
opposition can capitalize on popular discontent to win control of
the government.
</P>
<P>
   If he were to remain in power after an election, the
administration would almost certainly try to prove that the vote
had not been free and fair, and thus the United States would not be
compelled to lift the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot imagine, based on our analysis, that a genuinely
free and fair election would allow Milosevic to remain as
president,'' said a senior administration official. ``We have come
to the conclusion that he cannot win.''
</P>
<P>
   A delegation of leading Serbian opposition figures now visiting
Washington had pressed for the policy change, arguing that it would
allow them to increase popular pressure on Milosevic to call an
election _ an election that they are certain they can win.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that the White House and State
Department had decided on the policy shift because it has become
convinced that the long-fragmented opposition in Serbia, the larger
of two republics remaining in Yugoslavia, is now unified in its
determination to hold early elections and to oust Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our assumption is that Milosevic will only hold elections as a
result of the pressure of the opposition's efforts,'' one official
said. ``And we are bolstering the opposition's efforts by taking
away from Milosevic the idea that the sanctions are the result of
American evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has agreed to another request from the
delegation: that the United States support a European-run pilot
program to allow about $5 million worth of oil to be delivered this
winter to two cities in Serbia that are governed by opponents of
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had initially been hesitant to support the
program for fear that the oil might be diverted to Milosevic's
business cronies or to the military. American officials had also
hoped that economic privations and the prospect of a freezing
winter might lead to a new wave of public unrest against the
Milosevic government.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials said they were convinced to support the
program, both for humanitarian reasons and because of safeguards
that should make it difficult for the oil to be diverted elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is confronting a devastating energy shortage as a result
of the destruction of petroleum refineries by NATO bombers during
the crisis in Kosovo earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's concessions this week to the delegation are
considered vital to the public standing of the opposition leaders,
who are being portrayed in the government-controlled news media in
Serbia as pro-Western traitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can now return home and announce _ with conviction _ that
they helped convince the United States to shift its policy and
speed up the timetable to end Serbia's isolation,'' an
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Wednesday, officials said, Albright is
also expected to hold out the possibility that, in exchange for
free elections, the United States would commit itself to
reconstruction aid for Serbia _ to help rebuild the country after
the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the constitution of the Yugoslav federation of Serbia
and neighboring Montenegro does not grant Milosevic direct power to
call new elections, the reality is that his powers are dictatorial.
``He snaps his fingers, and there will be elections,'' said a
senior administration official. ``We're trying to increase the
pressure on him to snap his fingers.''

THE YOUNG MOZART'S INITIATION IN ITALIAN OPERA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In March 1770, when the governor general of Lombardy, an Italian
province then under Austrian control, announced that the
14-year-old Mozart had been invited to compose an opera for one of
the country's most renowned opera houses, the Teatro Regio Ducale
in Milan, there was an uproar among the personnel and patrons of
the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was well aware of the prodigy from Salzburg who had
charmed empresses, archdukes and cardinals all over Europe with his
astonishing musical skills. But pleasing demanding Milanese opera
audiences was a job for professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The singers, players and directors of the Regio Ducale knew from
long experience how to make an opera seria succeed, and they were
not about to be told what to do by some pimply-faced kid who wasn't
even Italian and had never written for an Italian theater.
</P>
<P>
   That opera, ``Mitridate, Re di Ponto,'' Mozart's third, but the
first written for a major company, is little known today. So a fine
new recording of the work, with Christophe Rousset conducting the
period-instrument orchestra Les Talens Lyriques (Decca 460 772-2;
three CDs), is a valuable addition to the Mozart discography.
</P>
<P>
   The illustrious international cast includes the superstar
Italian mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli, the French coloratura
soprano Natalie Dessay, the American countertenor Brian Asawa and,
in the title role, the Italian tenor Giuseppe Sabbatini.
</P>
<P>
   Once he had accepted the commission, Mozart had little say in
the subject matter of the opera. The scenario he was given was
loosely based on the historical Mithridates VI, the King of Pontus,
a Hellenic kingdom on the southern shores of the Black Sea.
Mitridate leaves his betrothed, the Greek princess Aspasia, in the
care of his two sons while he goes to war against the Roman general
Pompey. Believing their father dead, the young men compete for the
love of the bereft and confused Aspasia.
</P>
<P>
   The adolescent, inexperienced opera composer was given Vittorio
Amadeo Cigna-Santi's libretto only five months before the opera's
premiere, which occurred on Dec. 26, 1770. While Mozart composed
under this daunting deadline, his paranoid father, Leopold, saw a
conspiracy at work to foil his son. Writing to the composer Padre
Martini, Mozart's former teacher, Leopold complained that Italians
had been bad-mouthing the opera for weeks, ``enemies and
detractors, who before hearing a single note had spread the rumor
that it was a barbarous German composition.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out the opera was a great success and ran for 22
performances, the first three led by Mozart from the harpsichord.
Fears that the Austrian had written a ``German'' work proved
unfounded. If anything, Mozart was slavishly attentive to Italian
styles and traditions, and eager to please his Milanese cast, so
much so that this nearly three-hour opera can seem a numbing
succession of some two dozen arias with interconnecting recitative.
For all the skill and beauty of the arias, they are solidly
traditional, and they seldom plumb character.
</P>
<P>
   Yet you have to learn a tradition before you can find your own
voice within it, let alone change it. Composing ``Mitridate'' was
Mozart's trial by fire in the ways of opera seria. To appreciate
his considerable achievement, the work must be taken in context:
the untested youngster could not afford to be original; he was
under intense pressure to prove himself to the doubting defenders
of the status quo at Italy's most prestigious theater.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, opera seria in Italy was essentially beholden to
the late-Baroque model of opera as a numbered series of showcase
arias for virtuosic singers. The soprano Antonia Bernasconi, who
was to sing the role of Aspasia, was reportedly so worried that
Mozart's arias would not be sufficiently dazzling that she
seriously considered substituting arias from an earlier setting of
the same libretto by Quirino Gasparini.
</P>
<P>
   When she finally looked over the arias Mozart had written for
her _ elaborate numbers with beguiling melodic lines, dramatic
contrasts of expression and ample opportunity for coloratura
display _ she pronounced herself delighted.
</P>
<P>
   Guglielmo d'Ettore, the tenor taking the title role, was a
rising star determined to make a big impression. He forced Mozart
to rewrite Mitridate's entrance aria, ``Se di lauri,'' five times
before he gave his approval. He, too, had in mind the Gasparini
setting of the story. Showing a savviness for the machinations of
musical theater that would serve him well in later life, Mozart
slipped the bass line and the general melodic contour of the
Gasparini entrance aria into his fifth and final version, and
apparently d'Ettore never knew the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra at the opera house was one of the most renowned in
Europe, and Mozart eagerly fulfilled the Milanese public's taste
for brilliant orchestral accompaniments. The grand and ebullient
overture was his most deftly wrought and richly scored orchestral
music to date.
</P>
<P>
   What we know about the habits and protocols of operagoing at the
Regio Ducale make one wonder why any composer could bear the place.
According to the reports of the English music lover and insightful
diarist Charles Burney, every box in the theater's five tiers had
an adjoining room with a fireplace and everything needed to serve
refreshments. There were tables for faro, a popular card game, at
either side of each tier. There was also a restaurant; meals
brought from home could be heated there and consumed in the boxes.

YAHOO CENSORING SOME `CHAT BOARD' COMMENTS ON COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yahoo Inc. has begun censoring controversial material from its
popular Internet ``chat boards'' even when the subjects of these
messages haven't complained.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, the big Internet portal operator, says that in recent
months it has stripped off its message boards on the World Wide Web
several postings, including detailed information about defense
contractor Lockheed Martin Corp. and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The truthfulness of these message wasn't in dispute, said Yahoo
chief executive Jeff Mallett. But the company took down the
material to reduce its impact. Yahoo has to ``be careful'' because
``what we publish can influence a lot of people's lives,'' Mallett
said in an recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   While Yahoo's philosophy of its chat boards as a place for open
debate hasn't changed, Mallett said, ``there has been a change in
the process'' by which content is reviewed and sometimes removed.
Mike Riley, senior producer of Yahoo's finance section, said
postings now can be banned, even if they are true, ``if the message
causes confusion'' or violates Yahoo's terms of service.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo in the past has said it will remove messages that break
securities laws or contain libelous statements. But those actions
have usually come as a result of specific complaints. Now, critics
such as David Sobel, a lawyer for the Electronic Privacy
Information Center in Washington, D.C., say Yahoo's willingness to
block material unilaterally suggests the company isn't serious
about promoting open discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems they are willing to exercise editorial control over
what I can say,'' he said. ``From the user's perspective, it's the
worst of both worlds,'' he added, noting legal cases in which Yahoo
has disclosed the real names of people who believed they were
posting material anonymously on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's Riley said the recent action reflects the growing
traffic on the company's message boards. More postings overall
increase the likelihood that some ``are going to be
inappropriate,'' he said. He declined to quantify the increase in
total postings.
</P>
<P>
   The practices of financial chat-board operators have become a
hot topic lately because the boards have become an important forum
for small investors and day traders armed with the latest
do-it-yourself software for securities trading.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's message boards are organized to allow users to comment
on specific stocks. Not surprisingly, this material has generated
controversy, with Raytheon Co., Stone &AMP; Webster Inc., and others
filing lawsuits alleging specific messages disclosed private or
proprietary data.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Raytheon nor Stone &AMP; Webster named Yahoo as a defendant,
and in any case, federal law protects portal companies from being
held responsible for information they transmit. Like its smaller
chat-board competitors, TheStreet.com and RagingBull.com, Yahoo
says it prohibits posting of content the user isn't entitled to
share ``under any law or under contractual or fiduciary
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo and the other two financial chat-board companies
differ in how they enforce their rules, with the smaller ones
generally requiring investigations and contact with a message's
author before taking down material.
</P>
<P>
   ``We err on the side of protecting the member who posted,'' said
Tara Burgess, spokeswoman for RagingBull. She said the Andover,
Mass. company has yet to remove a message.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could come to us and say `This info is wrong.' But unless
you can prove it's falsified, misrepresented, or confidential,
we're going to be conservative about what we take off the boards,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's more flexible policy was illustrated in its handling of
an e-mail posted Oct. 15 to one of the company's message boards
related to Lockheed Martin Corp., the Bethesda, Md., defense
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bloomberg News, which first reported the incident,
the e-mail accurately described notes taken by a Lockheed official
at a meeting with an Air Force procurement officer, principal
deputy assistant secretary Darleen Druyun, who reportedly said
certain Lockheed operations were characterized by ``arrogance'' and
a lack of creativity.
</P>
<P>
   The message's author used the screen-name of ``LMTDude.''
Efforts to reach this person were unsuccessful. The message was
later removed by Yahoo, even though Lockheed didn't complain about
its content or otherwise contact the Internet company, according to
Lockheed spokesman James Fettig.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force, through a spokeswoman, said it didn't contact the
Internet company, either. Neither Lockheed nor the Air Force would
discuss the content of the message.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's Riley said he couldn't discuss the specifics of the
message or why it was taken down, except that it violated
unspecified parts of Yahoo's terms-of-service agreement with users.
Riley also declined to discuss how the message gained the company's
notice, except to say it was ``called to our attention in some
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   But the message's truthfulness wouldn't have been an issue, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo doesn't assess the veracity of messages. We don't and we
can't,'' he said. ``It's an issue of legality,'' he added, although
he said he was speaking generally and not about the Lockheed
message.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude seems to fit a general softening of Yahoo's
position in other cases involving controversial content, said Carl
Solomont, a lawyer with Bingham Dana in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Solomont said most of about a dozen requests he has made to
Yahoo in the past year seeking removal of objectionable postings
have been successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem recently they're more receptive to requests to
remove information,'' he said.

 UNDATED: the boxes.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The noise here during the performance was abominable,'' Burney
wrote of one experience, ``except while two or three arias and a
duet were singing, with which everyone was in raptures.''
</P>
<P>
   Every report suggests that the audiences who attended
``Mitridate'' were pleased with what they heard and unusually
attentive. Today's listeners who come to the work knowing the full
range of Mozart's later achievements might find the music lacking
in originality if not, at times, formulaic. Yet the arias are
consistently accomplished, attractive, harmonically interesting,
melodically felicitous and full of bravura vocal writing.
</P>
<P>
   The first aria of the score, for Aspasia, here sung by Ms.
Dessay, is a good example. Aspasia has just learned that Mitridate
is feared dead in combat. When the king's kind son, Sifare, pledges
his support and love to her, Aspasia sings an aria of
determination: ``Free, O God, this oppressed heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The bracing music, with its sometimes asymmetrical phrases, is
enriched through energetic motifs in the strings, horn flourishes
and subtle writing for winds. The vocal line is replete with
coloratura flights. After some four minutes, it builds to a climax
and a cadenza for the soprano.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that it were about to end. But a reflective
contrasting section begins. The original music returns, and the
aria, nearly seven minutes total, concludes with another cadenza
and coda.
</P>
<P>
   The next aria, for the now smitten Sifare _ originally a role
for castrato, here sung by Ms. Bartoli _ is equally elaborate and
offers similar sentiments: ``My heart endures calmly a tyrannical
beauty.'' This energetic music, with bustling string writing and
intricate inner lines for winds and horns, takes Ms. Bartoli
through spiraling, high-lying coloratura passage work.
</P>
<P>
   Again, after four minutes or so, you think the aria is ending
with a dramatic climax and cadenza. But another slower middle
section begins, and the aria finally clocks in at more than seven
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the remaining 21 arias work according to this pattern.
When Act II concludes with the opera's only duet, a lovely
six-minute piece for Aspasia and Sifare, it comes like a stroke of
genius. The same is true when the third and final act ends with the
only ensemble in the score, a peppy quintet of less than a minute.
That Mozart did not try to vary the thing by introducing more duets
and ensembles indicates how strongly opera composers were obliged
to maintain the form as a vehicle for solo singing.
</P>
<P>
   Now and then, Mozart eschews the requisite vocal display and
writes arias of dramatic concision and impact, like the short,
fiery ``Nel sen mi palpita'' for Aspasia, with its hints of the
vocal fury that would come much later in the Queen of the Night's
vengeance aria. ``In my breast my heart throbs sadly,'' Aspasia
sings. The various states of everyone's heart are a continuing
concern of Cigna-Santi's libretto.
</P>
<P>
   The singers in this recording obviously found as much to engage
them in Mozart's arias as did his original cast. Ms. Bartoli sings
with her customary animation, virtuosity, impeccable musicianship,
and responsiveness to texts. Ms. Dessay seems more and more the
important new coloratura of our time. Her tone is lustrous and warm
even when she effortlessly soars up to high Es and E flats.
</P>
<P>
   Asawa brings his bright, alluring sound to the role of Farnace,
the rival brother. Sabbatini has a slightly nasal but pinging,
Italianate tenor voice, and he dispatches Mitridate's virtuosic
flights deftly. Sandrine Piau, Juan Diego Florez and Helene Le
Corre, in smaller roles, are also strong.
</P>
<P>
   Rousset conducts a buoyant, nuanced and incisive performance.
</P>
<P>
   The singers and players treat the opera not as some curiosity
but as a full-fledged work deserving of the most cultured and
mature realization. It's hard to imagine a more persuasive account.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ``Mitridate'' would be effective in the opera house is
another matter. Stylistically, this is a work of its own time. It
might be hard to sit through a performance today. Unless, of
course, like the audience in 1770, we had access now and then to
strong drinks, warmed-up meals from home, and a nearby faro table.

STUDIES RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT GENETICALLY ENGINEERED CROPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SCI-GENE-CROP and SCI-GENE-CROP-ABRIDGED) 
(mk) 
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since genetically engineered crops came on the American
agricultural scene in 1992, farmers have enthusiastically adopted
these plants, last year harvesting genetically altered corn,
soybeans and cotton from 50 million acres _ an area one and a half
times the size of New York state. Meanwhile, a number of studies
have been published pointing toward ecological risks from
genetically modified plants.
</P>
<P>
   A major concern is that foreign genes from these plants could
escape into wild plants by interbreeding. The fear is that wild
plants endowed with new genes and potent new abilities, for
example, to produce insecticide or withstand herbicide, might
spread quickly, becoming difficult or costly to remove.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, researchers talked about the movement of foreign
genes into wild plants as unlikely, but the picture emerging today
is that with many crops it will be inevitable. Recent studies of
radishes, grain sorghum, canola and sunflower found that genes, in
one case foreign genes, move quickly and easily from crops to wild
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Ecologists say the potential for the production of a superweed
from such interbreeding is real, since, even without foreign genes,
traditional crops have a long history of producing invasive weeds
by interbreeding with wild relatives. Johnson grass, one of the
most noxious weeds worldwide, was produced by hybridization between
a crop and a wild relative.
</P>
<P>
   Corn, soybeans and cotton pose no such risks in this country, as
there are no plants with which they can interbreed. Other
genetically engineered crops in development, however, do have wild
relatives in the United States with which they can interbreed,
including rice, beets, canola, sunflowers, cranberries and
strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been a number of recent reports suggesting that
the popular crops that produce the insecticidal toxin known as Bt
may pose previously unsuspected risks. Bt corn, cotton and potatoes
are already on the market, but many more Bt crops are in
development.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Bt is sprayed on plants to kill pests and is thought
to remain active for a matter of days. But in sharp contrast to
industry studies, Dr. Guenther Stotzky, a soil microbiologist at
New York University, has found that Bt toxin in the soil, as it
might be found after a crop is plowed under, can remain active for
at least eight months.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were surprised,'' said Stotzky. ``I'm sure it hangs around
longer. We just terminated the experiment after eight months.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, recent studies of insect genes and insect
development suggest that resistance to Bt may evolve more quickly
than expected and that current resistance-management schemes for
these plants may be ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Other new studies suggest that Bt crops may have adverse effects
on non-pest species. A study published earlier this year showed
that, in the laboratory, monarch butterfly caterpillars can be
killed by eating Bt corn pollen. Again in contrast to industry
studies, Swiss researchers have published evidence that beneficial,
predatory insects get sick when they eat Bt or eat pests that have
eaten Bt corn.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, as with any new technology, risks must be weighed
against benefits. So far, researchers have found that some crops
can provide striking financial and environmental benefits, but only
under some conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agriculture Department released a report in July
showing that many farmers planting Bt cotton enjoy increased yields
and decreased insecticide use, but many also do not. Other studies
have shown that Bt corn can be extremely valuable to farmers _ but
only in years when European corn borer, the pest which the Bt
kills, heavily infests crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proponents of the technology would like it to be all things to
all people,'' said Ralph Heimlich, deputy director for staff
analysis at Economic Research Service, which put out the new
Agriculture Department study. Opponents prefer to claim it does
nothing. The messy truth, however, lies somewhere in between.
Heimlich said, ``It really is a mixed bag.''

CLINTON URGES RUSSIAN PREMIER TO MOVE TO DIALOGUE ON CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway _ At a meeting here Tuesday with Russian Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin, President Clinton expressed strong concern
over the Russian air and artillery bombing of Chechnya and the
suffering of civilians in the breakaway region, a senior
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged Putin to move toward a ``political dialogue'' or
risk serious damage to his country's international reputation, the
official said. Putin was in Oslo, along with Clinton, to attend
ceremonies for the fourth anniversary of the assassination of
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has paid increasing attention to the Chechnya
conflict, in part because it is quite likely to cloud a meeting in
Istanbul this month of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. Russia and the United States are members of
the 54-nation group.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's military offensive in Chechnya, which has already
caused an estimated 150,000 refugees to flee to neighboring
Ingushetia, can only widen the gulf between the United States and
Russia, said administration and European officials.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told Putin that the United States recognized Russia's
territorial integrity and its right to protect its people from
terrorism, the senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops entered Chechnya in October to put down
separatists whom Moscow accuses of masterminding a series of
bombings in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton warned Putin that Moscow was pursuing a policy that
would certainly result in huge civilian casualties, particularly
because the rebels are intermingled with civilians. And that would
only make a political solution more difficult to achieve, the
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, whose popularity in Russia has risen on the back of the
Chechnya campaign, did not promise to pursue the the dialogue that
Clinton suggested. The prime minister said, however, that Moscow
had agreed to let the European group send an aid mission to
Ingushetia, northern Chechnya and Dagestan, the administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent calls by European countries for Russia to allow the
security organization to serve as mediators to resolve the conflict
have been rebuffed, European diplomats said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton also raised with Putin, the administration official
said, Russia's failure to comply with the Conventional Armed Forces
in Europe Treaty, a accord from 1990 that limits troop and
conventional weapons deployment in NATO and parts of the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's buildup of military hardware on its southern flank for
use in Chechnya has put the Russians over their limit, officials
said. A revised treaty had been due to be signed at Istanbul
summit, but that is now in doubt because of Russia's increased
weaponry in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official said Putin committed himself in a
statement Monday to comply with the treaty levels and to be
``transparent'' about the level of forces in the northern Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   Another area in which Russia is not complying with the 1990
treaty is the presence of Russian forces in Moldova and Georgia.
Both countries have indicated that they wanted to negotiate
withdrawal schedules for Russian troops. ``We expect there to be a
serious dialogue on these issues,'' the official said after
Clinton's meeting with Putin.
</P>
<P>
   In recent discussions between Washington and Moscow on Chechnya,
Russian officials have drawn an analogy between NATO strikes in
Kosovo last spring and the Russian actions in Chechnya. It was not
clear whether Putin made a similar case with Clinton on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official said Washington had responded to
such statements by saying NATO had focused on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic as part of a strategy of forcing him to back
down. In Chechnya, the official said, the Russians are told that
because the rebels are so integrated in the population that the
fighting is highly likely to kill many innocent people without
achieving a political goal.

   Yahoo, the big Internet portal operator, says that in recent
months it has stripped off its message boards on the World Wide Web
several postings, including detailed information about defense
contractor Lockheed Martin Corp. and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The truthfulness of these message wasn't in dispute, said Yahoo
chief executive Jeff Mallett. But the company took down the
material to reduce its impact. Yahoo has to ``be careful'' because
``what we publish can influence a lot of people's lives,'' Mallett
said in an recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   While Yahoo's philosophy of its chat boards as a place for open
debate hasn't changed, Mallett said, ``there has been a change in
the process'' by which content is reviewed and sometimes removed.
Mike Riley, senior producer of Yahoo's finance section, said
postings now can be banned, even if they are true, ``if the message
causes confusion'' or violates Yahoo's terms of service.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo in the past has said it will remove messages that break
securities laws or contain libelous statements. But those actions
have usually come as a result of specific complaints. Now, critics
such as David Sobel, a lawyer for the Electronic Privacy
Information Center in Washington, D.C., say Yahoo's willingness to
block material unilaterally suggests the company isn't serious
about promoting open discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems they are willing to exercise editorial control over
what I can say,'' he said. ``From the user's perspective, it's the
worst of both worlds,'' he added, noting legal cases in which Yahoo
has disclosed the real names of people who believed they were
posting material anonymously on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's Riley said the recent action reflects the growing
traffic on the company's message boards. More postings overall
increase the likelihood that some ``are going to be
inappropriate,'' he said. He declined to quantify the increase in
total postings.
</P>
<P>
   The practices of financial chat-board operators have become a
hot topic lately because the boards have become an important forum
for small investors and day traders armed with the latest
do-it-yourself software for securities trading.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's message boards are organized to allow users to comment
on specific stocks. Not surprisingly, this material has generated
controversy, with Raytheon Co., Stone &AMP; Webster Inc., and others
filing lawsuits alleging specific messages disclosed private or
proprietary data.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Raytheon nor Stone &AMP; Webster named Yahoo as a defendant,
and in any case, federal law protects portal companies from being
held responsible for information they transmit. Like its smaller
chat-board competitors, TheStreet.com and RagingBull.com, Yahoo
says it prohibits posting of content the user isn't entitled to
share ``under any law or under contractual or fiduciary
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo and the other two financial chat-board companies
differ in how they enforce their rules, with the smaller ones
generally requiring investigations and contact with a message's
author before taking down material.
</P>
<P>
   ``We err on the side of protecting the member who posted,'' said
Tara Burgess, spokeswoman for RagingBull. She said the Andover,
Mass. company has yet to remove a message.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could come to us and say `This info is wrong.' But unless
you can prove it's falsified, misrepresented, or confidential,
we're going to be conservative about what we take off the boards,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's more flexible policy was illustrated in its handling of
an e-mail posted Oct. 15 to one of the company's message boards
related to Lockheed Martin Corp., the Bethesda, Md., defense
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bloomberg News, which first reported the incident,
the e-mail accurately described notes taken by a Lockheed official
at a meeting with an Air Force procurement officer, principal
deputy assistant secretary Darleen Druyun, who reportedly said
certain Lockheed operations were characterized by ``arrogance'' and
a lack of creativity.
</P>
<P>
   The message's author used the screen-name of ``LMTDude.''
Efforts to reach this person were unsuccessful. The message was
later removed by Yahoo, even though Lockheed didn't complain about
its content or otherwise contact the Internet company, according to
Lockheed spokesman James Fettig.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force, through a spokeswoman, said it didn't contact the
Internet company, either. Neither Lockheed nor the Air Force would
discuss the content of the message.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's Riley said he couldn't discuss the specifics of the
message or why it was taken down, except that it violated
unspecified parts of Yahoo's terms-of-service agreement with users.
Riley also declined to discuss how the message gained the company's
notice, except to say it was ``called to our attention in some
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   But the message's truthfulness wouldn't have been an issue, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo doesn't assess the veracity of messages. We don't and we
can't,'' he said. ``It's an issue of legality,'' he added, although
he said he was speaking generally and not about the Lockheed
message.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude seems to fit a general softening of Yahoo's
position in other cases involving controversial content, said Carl
Solomont, a lawyer with Bingham Dana in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Solomont said most of about a dozen requests he has made to
Yahoo in the past year seeking removal of objectionable postings
have been successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem recently they're more receptive to requests to
remove information,'' he said.

ALAN HEIMERT, HARVARD PROFESSOR OF AMERICAN LITERATURE, DIES AT
70  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ill., Conn., Calif, South Africa)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Heimert, a longtime Harvard professor whose scholarship
about 18th-century America was influential and controversial, died
on Monday in Washington. He was 70 and lived in Winchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Heimert had cardiovascular problems, said his son, Andrew, whom
the professor and his wife were visiting in Washington. He was
pronounced dead at Georgetown University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, Heimert (pronounced HIGH-mert) had been for 30
years the Powell M. Cabot professor of American Literature at
Harvard, where he had been on the faculty since 1959.
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement of his death, the Harvard news office noted,
``His major work, `Religion and the American Mind: From the Great
Awakening to the Revolution' (1966), has had a significant, and
ongoing, impact on historical understanding of American culture in
the 18th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached at Yale University, Harry S. Stout, the Jonathan Edwards
professor of American Christianity and an authority on American
religious history, said Tuesday that in his opinion ``Religion and
the American Mind'' is ``the most significant and provocative book
on American religious history.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Heimert ``took all of the existing categories for
understanding religion, the American Revolution and what he called
`the meaning of America' and stood them on their heads,'' Stout
said. ``Conventional wisdom up until Heimert's book suggested that
the only connection between religion and the American Revolution
was to be found among a handful of Unitarians and deists that we
associate with the Founding Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   What was most notably new in the book, Stout said, was the
greater importance that Heimert ascribed to the impact of
evangelical preaching as a cause of the American Revolution. That
thesis ``shattered the consensus'' that prevailed at the time the
book was published, Stout said.
</P>
<P>
   The initial response to the book was almost universally
negative. Eminent historians of both religion and the American
Revolution were quite uncomfortable and even angry at Heimert's
bold view. It was not until the late 1970s that a group of his own
students and other admirers, including Stout, ``rescued his
reputation,'' according to Stout, ``and showed through careful
empirical work the many ways in which his view is deeply true.''
</P>
<P>
   Heimert was also founding director of the Harvard South Africa
Fellowship Program, which began in 1981 and has brought more than
100 young, nonwhite South African professional people to Harvard
for a year study. He was an honorary life member of the South
African Institute for Race Relations.
</P>
<P>
   The administrative posts he held at Harvard included the
chairmanships of the Department of English and American Literature
and Language and also of the Committee on Higher Degrees in the
History of American Civilization. He was master of Harvard's Eliot
House for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades Heimert taught a popular survey
course in which thousands of Harvard undergraduates were introduced
to American literature.
</P>
<P>
   The honors he received included a lifetime achievement award
from the Modern Language Association for his scholarship and
teaching in the field of colonial literature.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Oak Park, Ill., and received a bachelor's degree
in 1949 from Harvard, a master's degree from Columbia and a
doctorate in the history of American civilization from Harvard. He
served in the U.S. Army from 1952 to 1955 in Japan and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Arline; a
daughter, Lara, of New Haven, Conn., and a sister, Marian Rees of
Los Altos, Calif.

MARKS &AMP; SPENCER ANNOUNCES EARNINGS PLUNGE, MAJOR OVERHAUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Marks &AMP; Spencer, the troubled British retailer that
owns the Brooks Brothers chain in the United States, reported a 43
percent drop in first-half earnings Tuesday and announced a major
restructuring that includes property sales and use of cheaper
overseas suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The company has suffered recently because of management turmoil
and its insistence on buying goods from British suppliers, at a
significantly higher cost than do its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were not surprised by the poor results because the
London-based company had warned that the onslaught of competition,
mainly from companies like Gap Inc. of San Francisco, which is now
almost as ubiquitous in London as it is in New York, would cut into
the company's core business. Marks &AMP; Spencer also blamed what it
called fashion miscalculations with the company's winter clothing
line and even Britain's unusually warm weather this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a major product cost problem,'' said Tony Shiret,
an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. ``At the end of
the day, they need to drive sales growth and lower costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The company earned 192.8 million pounds, or about $322 million,
in the first six months of its fiscal year ended Sept. 25, down
from 337.4 million pounds the year earlier. Sales fell to 3.7
billion pounds, or about $6.18 billion, from 3.8 billion pounds a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive Peter Salsbury said Marks &AMP; Spencer's
restructuring would slash costs partly by using overseas suppliers,
with the goal of saving (PS)450 million, or $750 million, by 2002.
Last month the company cut 700 jobs and dropped one of its longtime
suppliers, William Baird PLC, ending a 30-year relationship and
unnerving other Marks &AMP; Spencer suppliers. The company also said it
would sell 400 million pounds, or about $668 million, of its
nonstore property to raise cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``These actions are designed to improve radically the ability of
our business to compete with the world's best retailers without
losing the qualities unique to Marks &AMP; Spencer,'' Salsbury said.
``The relevance of these changes is strongest in the U.K., but they
are just as essential to the success of our overseas business.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the performance of Brooks Brothers
continued to be a disappointment, losing $8.4 million in the last
six months. ``I must say, I think Brooks Brothers is a
distraction,'' Shiret said. ``Basically, Brooks is on trial over
the Christmas season.''
</P>
<P>
   Marks &AMP; Spencer said it planned to bring Brooks Brothers to
Europe in the next two years, but analysts now question how
extensively the stores will be introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most overshadowed detail of the restructuring may be
its most important, at least to customers. The company said it
would begin accepting credit cards. Previously, customers had to
pay in cash or use a Marks &AMP; Spencer charge card. ``It really just
shows how out of date they are,'' said Shiret. ``They are kind of
like dinosaurs.''

COMMENTARY: THE ALPHA-BETA MACARENA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I will say this in Naomi Wolf's favor: You've got
to respect a woman who gets a vice president to pay her a salary
higher than his own.
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine revealed that Al Gore hired Ms. Wolf, who has
written extensively on women and sexual power, as a $15,000-a-month
consultant to help him with everything from his shift to earth
tones to his efforts to break with Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolf has argued internally that Gore is a `beta male' who
needs to take on the `alpha male' in the Oval Office before the
public will see him as the top dog,'' write Time's Michael Duffy
and Karen Tumulty.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when a man has to pony up a fortune to a woman to
teach him how to be a man, that definitely takes the edge off his
top-dogginess.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolf is the moral equivalent of an Armani T-shirt, because
Gore has obscenely overpaid for something basic. It is advice given
to all vice presidents: Be your own guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's baby biology, for heaven's sake,'' says Lionel Tiger, the
anthropologist and author of ``The Decline of Males.'' ``In two
months the vice president has paid Naomi Wolf the annual salary of
an assistant professor of zoology at a decent university to tell
him something so elementary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gore actually was a dominant male, he wouldn't need to be
told how to have gusto.''
</P>
<P>
   The deliberate Gore had seven years to get his team together,
and yet his pack of gurus becomes ever wackier, like the portal to
John Malkovich's head.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the scene when the earthy campaign manager, Donna
Brazile, learned that the airy Naomi was receiving consulting fees
that could have totaled $180,000 for a year, compared with the vice
president's annual salary of $175,400. Ms. Brazile cut Ms. Wolf's
fee down to $5,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old Ms. Wolf, who was a Rhodes scholar, wrote ``The
Beauty Myth,'' a 1991 book about how the obsession with looks was a
conspiracy perpetrated by the beauty industry. ``She came onto the
stage all glossy-eyed and glossy-mouthed, telling all the ugly
girls that it didn't matter if Prince Charming wasn't attracted to
them,'' Tiger says. ``But beauty is a real force, not a myth. And
it's cruel to say otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   She alarmed critics by drawing parallels between the Holocaust
and anorexia.
</P>
<P>
   In her next book, ``Fire With Fire,'' she drew a parallel
between apartheid and the gender wars and urged women to release
their inner sluts.
</P>
<P>
   Her thesis was that feminism needed to be more fun: ``Rape, of
course, must never be thought of as fun. But should it be heresy to
suggest that changing attitudes about rape should sometimes be fun?
This must not be taken out of context, but there is no other way to
say it: The rape crisis center starved for lack of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Wolf has to make the unfun Gore fun. She has come up
with her most un-feminist notion yet: Urge a gentle, new-age beta
male to act like a Fight Club macho alpha male, the sort who bares
his teeth and drags women off to his cave.
</P>
<P>
   She has a point. Women are impressed by swagger and paternalism
in presidential candidates, just as men are.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Ms. Wolf helped Dick Morris woo straying female voters
back to the Clinton fold. Morris, the master of alternating smart
and flaky ideas, said that Ms. Wolf had alternating smart and flaky
ideas. ``Once she showed up at my office with a whole wall full of
angel cutouts from Time magazine and other places, saying angels
were in the United States,'' he said on Fox News. ``And I said,
`What are we supposed to do, y'know, appoint one to the Cabinet?'''
</P>
<P>
   She devised the Good Father model for Bill Clinton. It was an
obvious idea. But we live in a time when politicians don't trust
the contents of their own minds, when externalities are more
important than internalities.
</P>
<P>
   And the style consultants can't even agree about the
externalities. In the '96 race, Harry Thomasson told Clinton to
wear lighter suits. Then Morris told Clinton not to. Now Ms. Wolf
approves of Gore's switch from navy to tan.
</P>
<P>
   It's deliciously Byzantine. Gore, whose shot at the presidency
is in jeopardy because Clinton had a preoccupation with sex, has
turned to an author with a preoccupation with sex to save him.
</P>
<P>
   And now, after turning Clinton, the predator, into the Good
Father, Ms. Wolf will try to turn Gore, a good father, into more of
a predator.

SUPREME COURT CONSIDERS WHETHER RUNNING AWAY WARRANTS SUSPICION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There was general agreement during a Supreme Court
argument Tuesday that there might be reason to be suspicious of a
person who runs away at the mere sight of a police officer. But the
question before the justices went beyond that everyday observation
to whether unprovoked flight, by itself, is so inherently
suggestive of wrongdoing as to turn a person into a potential
suspect who can be chased, stopped, questioned and frisked by the
police.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois, backed by the Clinton administration and by 17 other
states, argued for a ``bright-line rule'' under which ``flight from
a clearly identified police officer, without provocation'' would
justify what the court calls a ``Terry stop.'' Taking its name from
a 1968 case, such a stop permits officers who have only a
``reasonable suspicion,'' rather than the more fully developed
probable cause, to detain someone briefly for further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois Supreme Court refused last year to create such a
rule, declaring that ``flight upon approach of a police officer may
simply reflect the exercise _ at top speed _ of the person's
constitutional right to move on.'' The state court added that the
``exercise of this constitutional right may not itself provide the
basis for more intrusive police activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Its decision affirmed a lower court's ruling that overturned the
conviction, on gun possession charges, of a man who fled a Chicago
sidewalk at the sight of four police cars converging on the block.
Two officers, who were on a narcotics patrol through the high-crime
neighborhood, caught and cornered the man, Sam Wardlow, finding a
loaded gun during a pat-down search. The investigatory stop was
unjustified, the state Supreme Court said in a decision based on
the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable search and
seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Although the justices agreed to hear the state's appeal,
Illinois vs. Wardlow, No. 98-1036, they appeared during the
argument Tuesday to doubt the desirability of giving the police the
blanket authority the state is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``How high is the risk that innocents are going to be stopped?''
Justice David H. Souter asked Richard A. Devine, the state's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough question, it seems to me,'' the justice
continued, adding that he himself might have run, had he been in
Wardlow's place, from what looked like an imminent shoot-out. ``I
don't know whether I would run or duck into an alley, but I'd want
to get out of the way,'' Souter said.
</P>
<P>
   The lively argument resonated with recent concerns about largely
white police forces harassing minority inner-city residents. The
NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. filed a brief in the
case asserting that the street crimes unit of the New York City
Police Department stopped and frisked 45,000 people in 1997 and
1998, disproportionately members of minorities, with only a small
fraction of the encounters turning up evidence of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   People can be afraid of the police and ``there can be a racial
element involved,'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility provided all the more reason for a bright-line
rule, the state's lawyer replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start to classify when you can do a Fourth Amendment
stop, by taking race into account, the Fourth Amendment becomes
unworkable and the police are unable to do their job,'' Devine
said, adding, ``It's important for this court to speak clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy both asked, in
variations of the same question, whether under the state's proposed
rule, the police could use a strategy of coming up to a group of
people just to see who might flee, and then catching and frisking
those individuals. Yes, Devine replied.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm L. Stewart, an assistant solicitor general arguing for
the federal government on behalf of Illinois, said that while
people may have innocent reasons for running, ``innocent people
typically don't flee upon the arrival of the police.'' He said the
court's 1968 precedent, Terry vs. Ohio, applied to just such
``ambiguous situations'' where probable cause is lacking. ``It
allows the police briefly to freeze the status quo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James B. Koch, representing Wardlow, said his client's flight
was ``a reasoned judgment to avoid a confrontation with whatever
drew four cars to the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia was openly skeptical. If someone is
``clearly running from the police,'' he said, ``you don't seriously
contend that it doesn't give rise to reasonable suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch said that while an onlooker might have ``a hunch that
something's amiss,'' the act of flight ``in and of itself is not
sufficient.'' He said there had to be other circumstances, like an
earlier call to the police from the neighborhood reporting a crime,
or a sighting of the suspect running from a store.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very important constitutional point here,'' Koch
said. ``My client can come and go as he pleases absent some
concrete evidence of criminal behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   When Illinois filed its initial Supreme Court appeal, the state
argued that flight in a high-crime neighborhood was inherently more
suspect than in other locations, but neither Illinois nor the
solicitor general's office is now emphasizing the point.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy asked whether it might be just as suspicious if the
police saw someone running from them ``in an elegant neighborhood
near a country club,'' and Stewart acknowledged that it might be.
However, he said, a neighborhood known for crime ``somewhat
reinforces the suspicion.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Sayed Gabr emerged into the cold late afternoon
fog clutching a batch of color photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the latest picture of her, the last moment before she
got on that plane,'' he said, standing in a stairwell Tuesday
outside the hotel here where the families of the EgyptAir crash
victims have been cloistered. And there, in the much-thumbed
picture in his hand, was his sister, Fatma Gabr, a plump middle-age
government worker, beaming straight at the camera at the Los
Angeles International Airport gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's her kids,'' Gabr added, pulling out another photo
of smiling young adults. ``I told them, `I'm going to bring your
mom to you.' '' Then he crumpled, a stocky man in a gray pinstriped
suit who seemed to crack from somewhere deep inside, and he began
to weep. ``I want to carry her body back to Egypt,'' he wailed.
</P>
<P>
   But for Gabr and other relatives of the 217 people who died on
EgyptAir Flight 990, the likelihood of having an intact body to
bring home to bury is slim.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Doubletree Islander Hotel, a modern complex on a dot
of land off Newport called Goat Island, officials of the National
Transportation Safety Board told family members that only body
parts may be recoverable because of the force of the aircraft's
impact when it hit the waters off Nantucket early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talked about the remains from this kind of crash and what
has so far been recovered,'' said Bob Hayes, a psychologist and
mental health officer for the Red Cross who was present at the
briefing, which was closed to reporters. ``What they were trying to
do was prepare people for the briefings to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who were in the hotel conference room at the time said
the dozens of relatives reacted with predictable anguish. ``Some
started to cry,'' said Michael Murray, a counselor with Spiritual
Care Aviation Response Team, a clerical volunteer group working
with the Red Cross. ``Others were very quiet and sat there in
silence, kind of stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   One relative, described by the Red Cross officials as having
``an anxiety attack,'' was taken away from the hotel in an
ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem now is the body,'' said Mohammed Yehya, a New
Jersey man who said his cousin was on the flight. ``Anything we
will take will be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The 70 or so family members already at the hotel since Monday _
those living in the United States _ were joined on Tuesday by 100
exhausted relatives, most of whom arrived early in the morning from
Cairo and were flown to Rhode Island on a Boeing 727 chartered by
EgyptAir. Other relatives are arriving on commercial flights, said
the authorities at the airport in Warwick, near Providence.
</P>
<P>
   Greeting them in the hotel lobby with a gentle welcome _ ``May I
help you with anything?'' _ were dozens of grief counselors,
members of the clergy, Red Cross officials and employees of the
safety board, who are obligated by a 1996 law to provide up-to-date
information and emotional support for families of airplane crash
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The law was passed by Congress in response to widespread
criticism of the way relatives were treated by airline and
government officials after the crash of TWA Flight 800 in 1996.
Among its provisions is a requirement that the authorities hold a
memorial service for the victims of an airline disaster; such a
service has not yet been scheduled, but Jewish, Protestant and
Roman Catholic services have been organized and Muslim clergymen
have been holding daily prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the relatives have been asked to prepare for
individual interviews with forensic experts who will ask them to
provide medical and dental records of the victims and to give blood
samples to aid in DNA analysis of any remains that are recovered
from the ocean depths.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors have been trying to offer what comfort they could to
the families, but said that for many, the grief is too raw to be
assuaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stages that people go through are similar to what we have
learned from any grief process or any disaster situation, whether
it's an air or train disaster or something that occurs in a trauma
center of a hospital,'' said Murray, who is the director of
pastoral care at Cambridge Health Alliance in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The long voyage of the Cairo relatives, most of them men, began
at 4 a.m. Cairo time. As they left, many said they still had not
accepted that the passengers on the doomed flight were really dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still hope that he might be among the survivors,''
declared a cousin of one of the Flight 990 passengers, Muhammad
Abdul Khalek Shaheen, a major in the Egyptian Army who was part of
a military group on a training mission in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived at Kennedy after a flight of nearly 12 hours. On
the plane were 37 Egyptian government and airline officials,
including the chairman of EgyptAir, the head of the Egyptian
aviation authority and five Egyptian crash investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Cairo passengers erupted into tears when they saw
relatives waiting for them in a passenger lounge cordoned off from
the public. But others who had no one in the United States to help
told aid workers they felt overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who were alone or people who felt alone seemed to
have a very difficult time,'' said a social worker, Dennis Damato,
who was working with the relatives. He said they told him they were
worried about whether ``they were up to the task.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman, Irin Kamel, whose mother died on Flight 990, was
taken from the plane to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens,
N.Y., apparently suffering from dehydration as well as stress. Her
husband, Emir, said the ordeal had left his wife in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard when this happens to someone you love,'' Kamel
said about his mother-in-law, Nama Mossad, who lived in Alexandria
and was director of the Egyptian Navigation Corporation. ``She was
only 52. Nobody can believe that such a good person, an angel of
God, could have died in this unbelievable way. No one can figure
out the reason.''

MILLENNIAL HOPE WITH A TINCTURE OF HOPELESSNESS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kurt Masur is an unabashed idealist, a man who turns all misty
in the face of big, life-affirming sentiments. His idealism is not
just talk. During his prominent tenure as the music director of the
Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, he spoke out against the repressive
communist government in East Germany and became a political hero in
his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Masur's idealism pervades his talk about music. He professes to
believe that music can contribute to a dialogue about life and
liberty. So with the approach of the year 2000, he decided to ask
six composers from around the world to write works expressing their
visions for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   As music director of the New York Philharmonic, Masur would
conduct the pieces in a full evening's program to be called
``Messages for the Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea might have struck many musicians as somewhat grandiose
and gimmicky. Not the irrepressible Masur. In a letter to each
composer he wrote, ``I would hope you would write a musical message
for the year 2000, a universal message of hope to the people of the
world.'' The composers were asked for pieces lasting from 10 to 15
minutes and invited to add to the Philharmonic's standard
instrumentation anything else they needed: a chorus, a children's
chorus, solo singers, a narrator, a solo instrument.
</P>
<P>
   One of the selected composers, the brilliant young iconoclast
Thomas Ades, from England, readily accepted the commission but
balked at Masur's request for a universal message of hope. It must
have seemed to him an idea just begging to be debunked. The message
for the millennium that Ades provided was an apocalyptic 15-minute
work for mezzo-soprano, chorus and orchestra, called ``America: A
Prophecy.''
</P>
<P>
   The first movement, which sets ancient poetry of the Mayans from
the ``Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel,'' would seem to be a bleak
prediction for a metaphorical America: ``Oh my nation/Prepare./The
people move as in dreams./In his bed the governor weeps./It is the
end for all our ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Invaders will come from the east, the text warns: ``Your cities
will fall./Your tress will be scaffolds./They will rule from the
backs of your fallen./Prepare.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest there be any doubt about the outcome, the second part of
Ades' work, which draws from ``La Guerra,'' a poem by Matteo Flexa,
states: ``Burn, burn, burn,/On earth we shall burn./We shall turn
to ash,/Drift across the land, over the mountains, out to sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Masur, stunned by the piece at first, had to revise his
conception for the program, which turned out to be two programs.
The main program will be presented beginning on Thursday evening at
Avery Fisher Hall, the second a week later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all hope for peace and harmony in the new millennium,''
Masur said recently by telephone. ``On the other hand, the youngest
composer, Thomas Ades, believes that peace will not be, there will
always be confrontation.'' Pausing, he resumed pensively, ``It is
very interesting.'' But he added, trying to sound positive, ``This
work and the others will give us such an insight, with such
different messages from around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be a simpler explanation for Ades' message. Since the
call to hope would presumably be made by others, perhaps he just
wanted to make sure that the darker side of human nature got its
due. Whatever the case, he is apparently content to let his piece
to speak for itself. Through a spokeswoman, Ades declined to be
interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   A perusal of the score makes ``America: A Prophecy'' seem
intriguing. It begins with a soft, tonal, almost banal fanfare.
Soon it segues into kinetic music more typical of Ades. Jittery
instrumental riffs collide with sustained vocal lines, broken by
refrains for chorus in block harmony.
</P>
<P>
   In the first program, Ades' musical message joins those by four
other composers: Hans Werner Henze, from Germany; Kaija Saariaho,
from Finland; Somei Satoh, from Japan, and John Corigliano, from
the United States. The work by the sixth composer, Giya Kancheli,
from the Republic of Georgia, will be performed beginning on Nov.
18, with Bruckner's Seventh Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Kancheli's piece, ``And Farewell Goes Out Sighing,'' for violin
soloist (Gidon Kremer), countertenor (Derek Lee Ragin) and
orchestra, was too long to be included with the others. Like most
of the composer's music, it is steeped in mysticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kancheli's music is bound to nature,'' Masur said. ``He has
the philosophy of someone who lives in Tbilisi, in the Caucasus,
bordering Turkey, for centuries a symbol of meeting and
confrontation between forms of consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   This seems a lot of content for one piece to carry. And the
text, which the composer says he fashioned from bits and pieces of
Shakespeare sonnets, may not provide the listener with clear
guidelines to Kancheli's intentions, being rather Gertrude Steinian
in character.
</P>
<P>
   One passages reads: ``Always now, always now/Welcome ever,
smiles, ever, ever/Welcome ever, welcome ever smiles.''
Occasionally a phrase is almost lucid: ``Truth may seem, truth may
seem/Truth may seem but cannot be.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saariaho responded decisively in the spirit Masur had
envisioned with ``Oltra Mar: Seven Preludes for the New
Millennium,'' for orchestra and chorus. Speaking from her home in
Paris, Ms. Saariaho characterized the millennium as ``a good
occasion to think about humankind and its history and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   She certainly did not flinch from grappling with life's big
themes in her piece. The three even-numbered movements are called
``Love,'' ``Time'' and ``Death.'' The odd-numbered movements are
preoccupied with traveling, the sea, and birds of flight, she
explained. The text about love is from the Arab poet Abu Said, who
lived at the beginning of this millennium. The text about death is
from a traditional mortuary lament of African Pygmies. And the text
about time is a single sentence from a novel by the French-Lebanese
writer Amin Maalouf, with whom Ms. Saariaho is writing an opera.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The musical idea was very clear to me from the beginning,''
Ms. Saariaho said. ``I wanted to represent traveling, waves, coming
back, leaving and arriving somewhere. In a sense the piece is like
one wave in slow motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Two composers avoided specificity entirely, by writing strictly
instrumental works, which may have been wise, given the abundance
of meaning the audience will be presented with in this program.
</P>
<P>
   Henze's 10-minute ``Fraternite: Air Pour l'Orchestre,'' the
score suggests, is steely music with inexorable slow marches in
dotted rhythms, and restless outbursts. Satoh's 15-minute work,
``Kisetsu,'' is a time-stands-still meditation, marked, ``As
delicate and quiet as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Corigliano would seem to have been a natural choice for this
project. In many of his works, even purely instrumental ones, he
tries to tell stories or depict precise emotions. Most notably, his
widely performed Symphony No. 1 was inspired by the struggles and
deaths of Corigliano's numerous friends with AIDS. The first
movement is subtitled ``Of Rage and Remembrance.'' But when asked
to write a message of hope for the millennium, Corigliano felt
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not want to preach to the world about my immortal
thoughts,'' he said. ``My first response, quite honestly, was
fairly inane. I thought of having Mel Brooks on stage in his old
vaudeville persona as the 2,000-year-old man, declaiming with Kurt
Masur. But my publisher had a stern talk with me and said, `Hey,
this is a real project.'''
</P>
<P>
   The theme Corigliano came up with was strictly musical but still
a sizable undertaking. Called ``Vocalise,'' the piece, for soprano,
electronics and orchestra, boldly tries to depict the ways in which
the elements of music have both stayed the same and changed during
the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with the first instrument, the voice,'' Corigliano
explained. ``First humming, then intoning. Then the percussion, the
oldest instruments, enter. As the orchestra grows, a kind of
progression of materials unfolds. But they are the same materials,
treated differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, electronic instruments and amplified traditional
instruments are introduced, to represent what Corigliano calls the
``only contribution to sound of the 20th century.'' Certain
electronic and acoustical effects, like reverberation, are mimicked
in the orchestral instruments. ``A clarinet plays something,'' he
explained, ``and the other two clarinets echo it a little behind in
pulse.''
</P>
<P>
   His goal was to integrate the natural and electronic
instruments. ``I didn't want a piece where electronics, like an
upstart, are used to shake things up,'' he said. ``I wanted them to
add to the beauty of the orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   The soprano soloist, who will be Sylvia McNair, sings vocalized
syllables, not a text. ``All words have associations,'' Corigliano
said, ``and I didn't want the piece to be text-driven.''
</P>
<P>
   There will actually be one additional millennium piece, which
Masur has asked Krzysztof Penderecki to write. But this famously
long-winded Polish composer, who exults in humanitarian themes and
overt philosophical messages, said that any piece he could conceive
of writing for the New York Philharmonic on the occasion of the
millennium would have to be big. Masur agreed. So Penderecki's
piece, not yet complete, will be performed in a future season.
</P>
<P>
   Masur is convinced that the cumulative effect of the five works
to be heard in the first program will be powerful and meaningful,
which is why he asked the composers to keep them short. Of course,
a more jaded explanation might be that by squeezing the works into
one program and half of another, the orchestra will increase its
tally of world premieres by six but get the new works out of the
way in one swoop, freeing slots elsewhere in the season for
standard repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Corigliano is concerned that hearing five new works together
will confuse rather than enlighten the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may just be too much to take in,'' he said. ``I'm worried
that people will be fried eggs by the last piece or two. Do you
know where my piece comes in the program?''
</P>
<P>
   Such are the understandably pragmatic concerns of one musical
messenger for the millennium.

KENNETH SCHNITZER, TEXAS REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER, DIES AT 70  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenneth L. Schnitzer, a visionary Texas real estate developer
and civic leader whose 30 commercial buildings form much of the
Houston skyline, died on Monday after a six-month battle with lung
cancer. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   Casting out on his own after a stint as salesman for his
family's Magnolia Paper Co., Schnitzer, still in his 20s, began a
career that over almost five decades produced such Houston
landmarks as Greenway Plaza, the 71-story Wells Fargo Bank Plaza,
the 50-story Enron building, the Mcorp Plaza and Citicorp Center.
</P>
<P>
   Another monument was the Houston Summit, a sports arena now
known as the Compaq Center that, as a public-private joint venture,
served as a model widely copied elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his projects, particularly the 127-acre Greenway Plaza,
were also among the nation's first large-scale, planned urban
developments to emphasize greenbelts and extensive landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   A third-generation Houstonian who attended the University of
Texas and the University of Houston, Schnitzer started in 1967 to
assemble the land for the Greenway Plaza project by negotiating
separate purchases of 300 homes for an average price of $45,000 and
five years of rent-free occupancy. Few homeowners held out in those
negotiations, which his sons said he regarded as one of his
proudest achievements.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1980s, the complex had a 400-room hotel, an
underground shopping mall, the Summit home of professional sports
teams and a workday population exceeding 12,000 spread through 10
office towers. He won a political fight to have the city build the
arena, which opened in 1975, at Greenway Plaza instead of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   In the arena's early years, Schnitzer was co-owner and managing
partner of the Houston Rockets basketball team and the Aeros hockey
team, both Summit tenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could see things others miss,'' said Don Jordan, chairman
of Reliant Energy. ``He really changed the skyline in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Schnitzer was a founding director of Houston
Proud, which was created to spur a rebound from the oil price
collapse in the 1980s; founding chairman of the Houston Economic
Development Council, and director of the Greater Houston
Partnership and the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation as a civic leader and a philanthropist survived
charges that he and two other local businessmen committed fraud
involving an ailing savings and loan in Pasadena, Texas, an
industry that suffered acutely in Texas when the price of a barrel
of oil plunged to single digits. A federal jury convicted the men,
but the judge, in a rare intervention, acquitted them and was
upheld on appeal. The land deal central to the case, it was ruled,
had been a substantive transaction and not the ``cash for trash''
exchange that prosecutors maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lanier, a former mayor of Houston, said Schnitzer ``was
scapegoated'' by the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency
responsible for selling distressed savings and loan assets. ``It
was a business transaction that backfired because the value of the
property went down,'' Lanier said.
</P>
<P>
   In his mid-60s, a vacation in Mexico inspired Schnitzer to
create and develop a master-planned resort in Los Cabos, near the
tip of Baja California, raising his sights from a handful of units
to a $200 million luxury community called Villas del Mar
overlooking the Sea of Cortez that is to be completed in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Schnitzer is survived by his second wife, Quinlan Quiros
Schnitzer of Houston; two sons, Kenneth L. Jr. of Dallas and
Douglas W. of Houston; four grandchildren, and three stepchildren.
His first marriage, to the former Joan Weingarten, ended in
divorce.

   WASHINGTON _ A committee of lawmakers from the House and Senate
approved legislation Tuesday repealing Depression-era laws that had
restricted the banking, securities and insurance industries from
entering one another's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was approved when 56 of the 66 members of the
conference committee signed the legislation. It came after a week
of wrangling between Democrats and Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, over
the language of both the bill and an accompanying report on
community lending standards.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of the legislation were approved in a tentative
deal struck by the Clinton administration and Gramm two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials said Tuesday that Clinton would
sign the measure, which is expected to be introduced on the floors
of the House and Senate as early as Wednesday.

U.S. PROTESTS, BUT U.N. AIDE IN BAGHDAD IS TO STAY ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan has asked the U.N.
relief coordinator for Iraq to stay for another year, despite
pressure from the United States and Britain to dismiss him.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain have said the official, Hans von
Sponeck of Germany, has exceeded his role in his criticism of the
economic sanctions against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard recalled that there were similar
complaints about Sponeck's predecessor, Denis Halliday, adding,
``It kind of comes with the territory of his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Halliday, an Irishman, resigned last year to protest what he
said was the damage inflicted on ordinary Iraqis by the sanctions,
which he said were incompatible with the U.N. Charter. Halliday
contended that 6,000 Iraqi children were dying every month because
of sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The post of coordinator was established in October 1997 to
administer programs that permit Iraq, despite the sanctions, to
sell $5 billion worth of oil every six months to buy food, medicine
and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies maintain that the sanctions,
imposed by the Security Council, cannot be lifted until Iraq shows
that it has destroyed its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
and the means of making new ones.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for the United States to criticize a U.N. official by
name. But diplomats said the chief U.S. delegate to the United
Nations, Richard Holbrooke, and the undersecretary of state for
political affairs, Thomas Pickering, have expressed concern about
Sponeck to Annan. They are reported to have questioned his
objectivity, as well as his ability to deliver food and medicine to
the intended Iraqi recipients.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sponeck is in Baghdad and could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said Tuesday that the
United States had no confidence in Sponeck's ability to administer
the oil-for-food program objectively. Rubin said Sponeck allowed
the Iraqi government to stockpile large quantities of supplies
urgently needed by the Iraqi people and refused to confront the
authorities about distributing the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Briefing reporters at the United Nations last Tuesday, Sponeck
said it was important to take concerns about human welfare out of
the mainstream of political discussion. ``One should try to de-link
the humanitarian discussion from the disarmament discussion,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin said Sponeck, as U.N. coordinator of the oil-for-food
program, ``has no business advocating changes to a sanctions regime
that the Security Council has imposed and reaffirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard responded that the relief coordinator in Iraq must be
concerned about the people he is there to serve. ``The fact that
the humanitarian issue in Iraq becomes a political football, I
think, is obvious to anyone,'' Eckhard said. ``So it becomes a very
fine line for any humanitarian coordinator to walk.''

HOLIDAY SPENDING EXPECTED TO CLIMB
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Giddy from a strong economy, consumers this
holiday season plan to vent that glee on their wallets, concludes
an annual shopping forecast released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And Southern California shoppers seem to be a little more
excited this holiday season than their counterparts nationwide,
said the 14th annual holiday shopping survey conducted by Deloitte
&AMP; Touche LLP in conjunction with the National Retail Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-one percent of Southland residents plan to meet or beat
last year's holiday spending, a slight improvement from the 1998
survey. Nationwide, 79 percent of the consumers surveyed said they
will spend the same or more than they did last year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Left Coasters will just be a little more
chintzy, lavishing $752 worth of holiday cheer on friends, family
and co-workers vs. $735 last year. The national average outlay will
reduce net worth by $849, up from $814 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte &AMP; Touche based its conclusions on a research company's
mail and telephone poll of 1,087 consumers _ 59 percent of them
women _ during September and October.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that shoppers are confident these favorable
economic conditions will prevail into next year. Locally, consumers
are more confident about the economy this year than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to shopping, women will shoulder most of the
load.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the survey's history, women are planning
to spend more on gifts than men: on average $907 vs. $773.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the figures were almost reversed.
</P>
<P>
   And look for a jump in e-tailing this year as shoppers become
more comfortable with making purchases on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect the growth rate of online shopping this holiday
season to be substantial,'' Nate Franke, a partner of Deloitte &AMP;
Touche in Orange County, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that established retailers are moving aggressively to
create an online presence.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is less optimism behind the cash register,
although retailers are more upbeat this year than last.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, about 60 percent of retailers expect the economy to
improve or stay the same, while 40 percent anticipate a slowdown.
Last year, retailers were much more pessimistic, with 78 percent
expecting the economy to worsen during 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp., predicted Tuesday that consumers will shop
smart, waiting until retailers cut prices to make their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of jingle in the jeans but behind the scenes,
it's going to be a real cat fight among retail venues,'' Kyser
said. ``The longer you wait the better price you get. So it's a
very merry Christmas for the consumers and for the retailers, it's
few `ho-ho's.'''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At 11:14 on a recent Friday morning, as students
in Irma Mendoza's fifth-grade class at Victory Boulevard School in
the North Hollywood section were receiving handouts, a small timer
went off, sending everyone under their desks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the earth is shaking,'' Ms. Mendoza told the
children. ``Hold your desk.''
</P>
<P>
   They did not have to reach too far back in their memories to
recall the sensation. Nearly all the students had been awakened
Oct. 16, when a 7.0-magnitude earthquake in the Mojave Desert about
100 miles east of here jolted the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary,'' said David Dubon, 10. ``It was easier today to
think it was really happening.''
</P>
<P>
   At Victory Boulevard, no one is waiting for ``Shake '99,'' the
Los Angeles-wide earthquake preparedness drill scheduled for the
schools next Tuesday, to test whether they are ready for the big
one. The school has earthquake drills twice a month, even though
that many drills are not required.
</P>
<P>
   It is just a little something extra administrators at Victory
Boulevard have added to try to stay ahead of the unknown. And they
are not alone. While California schools have strict standards to
live by when it comes to preparedness, many districts and
individual schools add their own touches in an evolving process to
get ready for the next earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   In Laurel Canyon, south of here, the elementary school requires
every child to have an individual one-gallon resealable bag of
necessities like water, nonperishable foods, a disposable
flashlight and a comforting note from the parents. At a magnet
school in East Los Angeles, the school librarian has experimented
with sloping the shelves so books will not fall in an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody who lives out here understands there's going
to be more earthquakes,'' said Pete Anderson, director of emergency
services for the Los Angeles Unified School District. ``We stress
the fact that we want each school to be able to manage the
emergency with no support systems whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the district requires every Los Angeles public
school to have teams of teachers trained in search and rescue and
firefighting, and to have detailed emergency plans, right down to
where the morgue would be, to follow in a catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Each school is also required to have on hand a three-day supply
of water and food for each student and to make frequent inspections
for hazards like unsecured file cabinets or boxes stored on shelves
where they could fall. And each school is supposed to hold monthly
earthquake drills.
</P>
<P>
   While fire drills have been around for years, earthquake drills
grew out of exercises conducted during the Cold War when concerns
focused on nuclear attack. Eventually those fears subsided, making
way for what is now known as ``drop, cover and hold'' exercises.
</P>
<P>
   These exercises are simple: slip under a table, cover the back
of your neck with one hand and hold onto the leg of the table with
the other. That last step, Anderson said, was made part of the
procedure after the earthquake in Mexico City in 1985 when
officials learned how easily tables danced away in a big quake.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first quake to raise awareness in Los Angeles, he said, came
in 1971 when an earthquake in the San Fernando Valley killed 65
people. Then, there was the Whittier Narrows earthquake in 1987,
which killed at least eight people. In 1994, the Northridge
earthquake killed more than 60 people and left $20 billion in
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That got the state and school board to commit unprecedented
money to start preparing for the so-called big one,'' Anderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   That money has enabled schools to give additional training to
teachers and administrators to buy more supplies and to prepare
reports outlining what to do in an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   At Victory Boulevard, where a bank shoot-out left the school in
a lockdown for 14 hours about two years ago, the principal, Dr.
Charles Webb, said that being prepared was crucial in dealing with
any emergency, and that for earthquakes, he intended to focus on
drills so that everyone would act instinctively.
</P>
<P>
   After all, no bell is going to go off in the event of a real
earthquake. The first child to feel the earth shaking will go under
a desk and the other children will follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   If the events of last month are an example, it is not something
the children feel shy about doing. Two days after the earthquake
here, Dr. Webb said, four teachers reported that their classes went
under the tables though there was no quake.
</P>
<P>
   Although their response was mainly the result of jitters, he
said, ``We praised them.'' He added, ``It was exactly what they
were supposed to do.''

FBI NOTES SHED LIGHT ON A DONOR'S CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Democratic fund-raiser who emerged as a central
figure in the long-running investigations of Democratic fund
raising told the FBI in an interview that Bill Clinton reacted with
``surprise'' when a wealthy Indonesian businessman told him that he
wanted to raise a million dollars for the president's first
campaign in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser, John Huang, said that the businessman, James
Riady, later told him that he had been excited about his
conversation with Clinton. Riady had said that his approach to
political giving was that ``if you are going to do something, don't
do it small.'' Riady, according to Huang, said that he could afford
to donate a million dollars himself, but felt that such a large
donation ``would not look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Huang pleaded guilty in August to engaging in a conspiracy to
defraud the Federal Election Commission by arranging for employees
of the Lippo Group, the Indonesian-based conglomerate run by the
Riady family, to be reimbursed for campaign contributions during
the 1992 and 1994 elections. Huang was later an official at the
Commerce Department before becoming a Democratic Party fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Huang's recollections were contained in official notes of
interviews earlier this year between Huang and FBI agents who were
investigating possible campaign finance violations. The notes were
made public Tuesday by the House Government Reform Committee,
headed by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's long-running investigation of fund-raising abuses has
been dismissed by the White House as a misguided and politically
driven effort against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said he was releasing the notes in advance of testimony
by Huang, who has been granted immunity to appear before the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Burton had announced last week that he would make the notes
public, highlighting some revealing passages. For example, Burton
cited the conversation between Riady and Clinton. The notes did
provide more details about the conversation, which took place in a
limousine in 1992, even though its occurrence was the subject of
earlier news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Burton has said the interview notes provide powerful evidence of
political financing improprieties. He said they support what he has
long contended, that Attorney General Janet Reno was wrong in
repeatedly refusing to refer the Justice Department's campaign
fund-raising inquiry to an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, in keeping with the bitter partisan debate that
has split the panel, said the notes turned up little new. Most
notably, the Democrats said, the notes did not show that Clinton,
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al Gore or any
other senior official engaged in illegal fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   The notes are not an authoritative account of events. They are
raw summaries of FBI agents' interviews with Huang. They reflect
his recollections of events without any effort to reconcile them
with other accounts. Moreover, as Democrats pointed out Tuesday,
Huang has not reviewed the notes to determine whether they
accurately reflect what he told the agents.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the notes provide an insight into the perceptions
of a key witness to events central to the allegations of abuses
that arose after the 1996 elections, including the disguising of
contributions from overseas donors by using the names of
intermediaries who were falsely listed in campaign reports as the
contributors.

GONZALES TRADED TO TIGERS; GRIFFEY REQUESTS MARINERS TRADE HIM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With teams already trying to position themselves for the
incredible class of free agents next fall, the Texas Rangers
Tuesday swapped the star slugger Juan Gonzalez to the Detroit
Tigers in a nine-player deal, and the Seattle Mariners announced
that Ken Griffey Jr. has requested a trade and that they will try
to comply with the demand of the center fielder, who seems destined
to break Henry Aaron's career home run record.
</P>
<P>
   Deals of such magnitude may become common this off season. About
two dozen stars will be eligible for free agency after next season,
including Gonzalez, Griffey Jr., Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez,
the Cleveland slugger Manny Ramirez and Toronto's Carlos Delgado
and Shawn Green.
</P>
<P>
   Many clubs have been trying to sign their established stars in
recent months _ Griffey turned down an eight-year, $135 million
deal, for example _ and some are determined to trade their stars if
they cannot reach an agreement quickly, for fear that a star player
would walk away as a free agent next fall and the team would get
nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made Delgado and Green multiyear offers,'' Gord Ash, the
Toronto general manager, said in a phone interview Tuesday night.
``Our first priority is to sign them, and if we can't, we'll trade
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers moved first, but other teams may follow quickly,
because, as Ash acknowledged, there is a limited number of suitors
who would be willing and able to part with the necessary players in
a trade for a star, and also be willing to take on a high-salaried
player who might command a salary in excess of $12 million next
season. The market for stars, Ash agreed, may shrivel.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' he added, ``players of immense talent are
always going to be sought after.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, 30, was the American League most valuable player in
1996 and 1998 and averaged 140 runs batted in over the last four
seasons, hitting .326 with 39 home runs and 128 RBI in 1999. But
the Rangers, who have scored a single run in getting swept by the
Yankees in the first round of the playoffs each of the last two
seasons, traded the right fielder, along with reliever Danny
Patterson and catcher Gregg Zaun _ two spare parts _ to Detroit,
which is seeking a headline player with whom they can open their
new ballpark next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers did not receive marquee value in return for
Gonzalez, but did get a package of players including the
left-handed pitcher Justin Thompson (9-11 with a 5.11 earned run
average in 1999), the talented young outfielder Gabe Kapler (.245,
18 home runs), reliever Francisco Cordero, catcher Bill Haselman,
infielder Frank Catalanotto and a player to be named, who is
expected to be pitcher Alan Webb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we're not getting back a star player, some of
these young players we're talking about have the potential to be
stars,'' Rangers General Manager Doug Melvin said. ``We're piling
up some good young players and we still have a good nucleus.
Sometimes you're forced to make some tough decisions, and this is a
big one.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey turns 30 later this month and he already has 398 career
home runs and is already regarded as one of the greatest players of
all time. But Griffey told the Mariners he wants to be closer to
his home in Orlando
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an extremely difficult decision for me,''
Griffey said in a statement he released with the team. ``Mariners
fans throughout the Pacific Northwest have been very loyal and
devoted to me. I will truly miss them.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's agent did not rule out the possibility that an
arrangement could be made with the Mariners, but the Seattle
chairman, Howard Lincoln, indicated that the team will make a
sincere attempt to deal the slugger.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides worked hard to portray the situation as
unavoidable, there has been an underlying tension between the team
and the star in recent years _ the souring relationship between
Griffey and Rodriguez has been a problem _ and it stands to reason
that a player earning in excess of $100 million could figure out a
way to keep his kids nearby. And currently, no major league
baseball team exists in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves, who have made the playoffs in every season
since 1990, may be in the best position to make a deal for Griffey.
They have a relatively deep farm system, and could use the talented
young center fielder Andruw Jones to anchor a deal for Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets could get involved _ the Mariners undoubtedly would ask
for infielder Edgardo Alfonzo, while the Mets might be far more
willing to build a deal around pitcher Octavio Dotel _ even though
many who know Griffey say he would not be interested in playing in
New York. Griffey has already made it clear he does not want to
play for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners, the Blue Jays and any other team account for
what may quickly become a buyer's market. The Yankees certainly
would love to have Green, a star outfielder, but they already must
pay Bernie Williams $12.5 million and will soon have to cope with
the cost of keeping Derek Jeter, who may eventually earn in excess
of $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   There would be a real question if the Yankees, or any team,
would be willing to pay more than two or three stars eight-figure
salaries in the near future. &QL;

GIVE UP TAPES OR GO TO JAIL, JUDGE TELLS CBS PRODUCER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ A state judge has ordered a CBS producer to
report to jail if she refuses to provide outtakes of an interview
of a white man on trial for capital murder in the brutal dragging
death of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Joe Bob Golden allowed Dallas-based
producer Mary Mapes to remain free pending the outcome of an
appeals court hearing Thursday in Beaumont on his earlier order
that she produce a transcript of the same interview.
</P>
<P>
   The interview of Shawn Berry, 24, appeared on the CBS news
magazine ``60 Minutes II`` on Sept. 28. Prosecutors contend Dan
Rather interviewed Berry for two hours in the Jasper County Jail
and only about 10 minutes of the interview was used on the air.
</P>
<P>
   A state court in New York City has ordered Rather to appear at a
hearing there Thursday to explain why he shouldn't be ordered to
appear in the Jasper court with the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The story told by Berry in the interview may differ
significantly from seven written statements Berry gave
investigators after the slaying of James Byrd Jr., prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said he and two friends, John William King, who turns 25
Wednesday, and Russell Brewer, 32, picked up Byrd, 49, as the older
man walked along a Jasper street in the early morning hours of June
7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He said King and Brewer later beat Byrd, chained him to the back
of Berry's pickup and dragged him for almost three miles. Along the
way Byrd's head, right shoulder and arm were ripped off.
</P>
<P>
   Juries earlier convicted King and Brewer and sentenced them to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Mapes testified Tuesday that the tapes are in New York and that
she couldn't produce them even if she was ordered to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that if the New York court rules that the tapes
are protected and that CBS does not have to produce them, that Mary
Mapes, who does not have possession of these tapes, would not be
committed to jail as some sort of ransom for the tapes,'' said her
attorney, Charles Babcock of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Mapes said she considered the tapes to be part of the work
product owned by her employers. Her attorneys have contended that
they are privileged information, much like reporter's notes.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Brit Featherston, who is assisting
prosecutors, said reporters have no right to withhold information
in a criminal case in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a capital case, a life-and-death matter, as serious as
a heart attack,'' said Jasper County District Attorney Guy James
Gray. ``Everybody ought to try to do what is right.''
</P>
<P>
   He called Mapes' answers ``evasive.'' ``First she says she has
the tapes, then she says she doesn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no doubt there has been a clear pattern of
contempt for this trial, for Jasper County and for this particular
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Berry's attorney, Joseph Hawthorn of Beaumont,
reminded prospective jurors that his client is taking no part in
the issue between the district attorney's office and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day Tuesday, Golden had certified 39
prospective jurors, 10 of them African-Americans, to be in a group
of 50. Both sides will be given chances to strike some of those
jurors. The first 12 who remain will be on the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony is scheduled to begin early next week. If convicted,
Berry faces either life in prison or death by injection.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When John F. Welch Jr. resigns from General Electric in April of
2001, he will actually leave two vacancies: those of GE's chief
executive and corporate America's most-admired manager.
</P>
<P>
   The first post will be filled quickly, the appointment will
likely be announced months before Welch steps aside. For the second
job, however, there is no clear successor, management experts said
Tuesday, and that is a testament to the rarity of Welch's nearly
two-decade run at the top of one of America's biggest companies.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, who announced his retirement date on Monday night, is not
the most famous chief executive in the country. That title probably
belongs to Bill Gates of Microsoft or Warren Buffett of Berkshire
Hathaway. But among board members, executives, and business-school
students and professors, Welch's name is a touchstone for smart
corporate management in a way that no other chieftain matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best manager in America,'' said Gerard R. Roche, the
chairman of the executive search firm Heidrick &AMP; Struggles. ``What
he's done at GE has become the benchmark for other companies,''
said Christopher A. Bartlett, a professor at Harvard Business
School. ``I'm on four boards of directors,'' added John O. Whitney,
a former consultant to GE who now teaches at Columbia Business
School, ``and at every other meeting, someone brings up what Welch
would do.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates to take Welch's place on this score are familiar
names in corporate America. They include Gates, Louis V. Gerstner
Jr. of IBM, John Chambers of Cisco Systems, and Jacques A. Nasser
of Ford Motor Co. But other than Gates, who recently cut back his
control of day-to-day operations and is known for his company's
antitrust trial as much as his management theories, none has nearly
the profile that Welch does. As a result, the management experts
said, none is on the verge of being so influential.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the decade's popular management theories got their
start, or became widely known, after GE adopted them. In the 1980s,
Welch said every GE unit should be No. 1 No. 2 in its field. He
then sold or closed those that he thought could not be fixed,
laying off some 100,000 employees in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Mirroring the shift in the U.S. economy, he also moved the
company's focus from making products to selling services, and he
preached the importance of global business. More recently, he
launched a quality initiative to improve manufacturing efficiency
and watched many of his proteges become chief executives at other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Even during a bull-market run, the results have stood out. When
Welch took over on April 1, 1981, GE was worth $13 billion. At the
close of business Tuesday, its market capitalization was $425
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnificence of the story of Jack Welch is the longevity
of his success, ``said Hobson Brown Jr., the chief executive of
Russell Reynolds Associates, a New York headhunter.
</P>
<P>
   Welch has his critics. He earned the nickname Neutron Jack after
ordering the layoffs in the 1980s. A 1998 book by a former Wall
Street Journal reporter contended that under Welch, GE's obsession
with profit led to questionable accounting practices and ethical
lapses.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the allegations in the book, and Welch
has often said he believes that closing unprofitable businesses is
both financially and morally sound.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is no debate, however, about whether other managers use
Welch's tenure as a model, and that is the standard that anybody
filling his unofficial job would be judged on, professors and
executives said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The first place to look, they said, are the technology companies
that have captured so much of the popular imagination. Gates and
Michael Dell, of Dell Computer, are good examples of executives who
understood the importance of the Internet long before many others
did, and mainstream companies are now following in their tracks.
But Gates and Dell founded their companies, and the vast majority
of chief executives take control of organizations that have at
least some history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task is very different,'' said Bartlett of Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Gerstner and Nasser are similar to Welch in that they took over
large companies and set about changing them. IBMs Gerstner is
frequently mentioned, along with Welch, as an executive who changed
an old, enormous company by making service businesses more
important. Ford's Nasser, meanwhile, has received attention lately
for overhauling a company that was long associated with industrial
decline.
</P>
<P>
   But until now his successes have been only occasionally cited at
other companies, management experts said.
</P>
<P>
   A chief executive who both hails from the high technology sector
and took over a company after its founding is Chambers of Cisco.
Adrian J. Slywotzky, a well-known author and vice president at
Mercer Management Consulting, said Chambers understands the
fundamental premise of business today: Technology must be at the
center of everything, but it cannot replace time that executives
spend with their customers and employees.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude, Slywotzky said, ``is very Welch-like.''

   DETROIT _ Buyers snapped up cars and trucks with foreign
nameplates in October, forsaking some of their past favorites _
U.S.-made sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every foreign brand reporting sales results Tuesday
showed increases, and many notched double-digit gains. Toyota sales
rose 12.6 percent in October compared to the same period a year
ago. Honda sales rose 3.2 percent and Nissan jumped 27.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
DaimlerChrysler's American brands had a disappointing month. Ford
sales sagged 4.9 percent and GM sales fell 3.6 percent. However,
their foreign brands posted increases: GM's Saab saw its sales rise
6.5 percent, while Ford's Volvo and Jaguar divisions posted
increases of 37.8 and 75.8 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's Dodge, Jeep, Plymouth and Chrysler brands
dropped 3.8 percent, while Mercedes sales rose 12.2 percent.
Foreign makes won buyer's hearts because they offered ``lots of new
products,'' said David Healy, an auto analyst at Burnham
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The strong showing from foreign brands helped the industry's
sales rise 2.8 percent in October, compared to the same period a
year ago. But the Big Three's lackluster results dragged down
seasonally adjusted sales of cars, pickup trucks, sport utility
vehicles and minivans for the industry as a whole. The industry's
seasonally-adjusted annual sales rate plunged to 16.6 million, the
weakest since January. While the industry has been enjoying record
sales levels all year, and an annual rate of 16.6 million is still
considered terrific, the annualized rate was 17.0 million in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Asian and European automakers were the big winners in
October. Asian automakers watched their collective slice of the
U.S. market climb to 28.4 percent in October, up from 24.9 percent
in the same period a year ago. European automakers _ excluding
DaimlerChrysler _ saw their market share increase to 3.8 percent
from 2.6 percent, largely on the strength of Volkswagen's strong
sales. GM's market share dropped to 28 percent, down from 29.9
percent a year ago. Ford's drop was almost as large: Ford's share
was 23 percent in October, down from 24.9 percent. And
DaimlerChrysler's market share hit 16.8 percent, down from 17.7
percent a year ago. DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes brand added 1.3
percentage points to the parent company's results.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most popular American sport utility vehicles saw
their sales slide. Ford Explorer sales dropped 11.7 percent in
October compared to the year-ago period. And sales of the larger
Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator fell 14.5 and 8.6 percent
respectively. Ford's newest entry, the giant Excursion sport
utility vehicle, registered 4,373 sales in its first month, perhaps
attracting some would-be Expedition and Navigator buyers. Ford's
total sales of sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickups fell
6.0 percent in October. Ford's car sales fell 4.1 percent. Sales of
the Oldsmobile Bravada sport utility vehicle plunged 32.4 percent,
but other GM sport utility vehicles saw their sales increase. That
left sales of GM's light trucks up 9.1 percent, while GM's car
sales fell 13.7 percent, dragging down the company's results.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of DaimlerChrysler's Dodge, Plymouth, Jeep and Chrysler
brands fell 3.8 percent overall, with car sales dropping 9.3
percent while truck sales slipped just 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industry demand continues to be brisk,'' said Roy Roberts,
GM's group vice president of sales, service and marketing in North
America. ``The challenge for all manufacturers involves coping with
twin pressures _ intense competition and robust consumer demand
that has resulted in tight inventories in some market segments.''
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler said its sales were still strong, despite a
decline, since the year-ago period set a record for October sales,
and October 1999 was the second-best. ``This is like two runners
going across the finish line, both breaking the world record, but
the second guy is still the second guy,'' said Jamie Jameson, vice
president of sales and marketing operations. ``It was still a
terrific month.''
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's economists have increased their industry sales
forecast for next year, said Jameson. The new forecast is for sales
of 16.4 million cars, light trucks and commercial trucks, up from a
previous forecast of 16.0 million.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler is expected to go into next year with one fewer
brand sold in the United States, former employees of the company
said. The company is expected to announce tomorrow that it will
drop the Plymouth brand from its stable, just as it discontinued
the Eagle brand a few years ago.

HOLIDAY SPENDING EXPECTED TO CLIMB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Giddy from a strong economy, consumers this
holiday season plan to vent that glee on their wallets, concludes
an annual shopping forecast released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And Southern California shoppers seem to be a little more
excited this holiday season than their counterparts nationwide,
said the 14th annual holiday shopping survey conducted by Deloitte
&AMP; Touche LLP in conjunction with the National Retail Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-one percent of Southland residents plan to meet or beat
last year's holiday spending, a slight improvement from the 1998
survey. Nationwide, 79 percent of the consumers surveyed said they
will spend the same or more than they did last year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Left Coasters will just be a little more
chintzy, lavishing $752 worth of holiday cheer on friends, family
and co-workers vs. $735 last year. The national average outlay will
reduce net worth by $849, up from $814 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte &AMP; Touche based its conclusions on a research company's
mail and telephone poll of 1,087 consumers _ 59 percent of them
women _ during September and October.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that shoppers are confident these favorable
economic conditions will prevail into next year. Locally, consumers
are more confident about the economy this year than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to shopping, women will shoulder most of the
load.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the survey's history, women are planning
to spend more on gifts than men: on average $907 vs. $773.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the figures were almost reversed.
</P>
<P>
   And look for a jump in e-tailing this year as shoppers become
more comfortable with making purchases on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect the growth rate of online shopping this holiday
season to be substantial,'' Nate Franke, a partner of Deloitte &AMP;
Touche in Orange County, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that established retailers are moving aggressively ate an online presence.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is less optimism behind the cash register,
although retailers are more upbeat this year than last.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, about 60 percent of retailers expect the economy to
improve or stay the same, while 40 percent anticipate a slowdown.
Last year, retailers were much more pessimistic, with 78 percent
expecting the economy to worsen during 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp., predicted Tuesday that consumers will shop
smart, waiting until retailers cut prices to make their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of jingle in the jeans but behind the scenes,
it's going to be a real cat fight among retail venues,'' Kyser
said. ``The longer you wait the better price you get. So it's a
very merry Christmas for the consumers and for the retailers, it's
few `ho-ho's.'''

AS A NEW ENGLAND TOWN MOURNS, 3 DEATHS LOOM LARGE  
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn. ) (fb) 
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Conn. _ In this pristine slice of small-town New
England, where the village green nearly resembles what it looked
like two centuries ago, the modern intrusions of jet crashes and
long-distance grief seem particularly jarring.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of three esteemed residents, part of a tragedy that
has touched several nations, leaves a very large hole in a town
that fills only five pages in the telephone book.
</P>
<P>
   Gene and Barbara Billings and their friend Henrietta Mead, all
longtime residents, died in the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 on
Sunday, on a trip they were taking to help Mead recover from her
husband's death a year and a half ago. And just as almost everyone
in town shared in Mead's mourning at that time, they shared a new
kind of grief today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a much greater impact here, where everyone is so
greatly connected, than in New York or even Winsted,'' said Michael
Day, the principal of Botelle Elementary School, where Mrs.
Billings taught for 30 years, until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This Litchfield County town, with trim white houses set close to
the street around the village green, grew along the Blackberry
River, at first thriving on the manufacturing of linseed oil and
cheese boxes, then becoming a summer colony in the 1870s. It has
attracted people from the arts and publishing worlds, and is home
to the Yale Summer Music Festival. Mrs. Billings and Mead were
active in the Isabella Eldridge Club, which was named for the
library's founder and would stage plays that Mead wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone who worked behind a counter or stopped at the
town hall to vote on Tuesday knew the three victims. Mrs. Billings,
71, worked at the only elementary school, teaching most of the
children in town. Mr. Billings, 70, who served a term as president
of the Norfolk Library, wrote several books on bird-watching in
Connecticut. Mead, 61, was a reading specialist at a local private
school.
</P>
<P>
   Many people first heard the news Sunday morning at the
Congregational church, when someone offered a prayer for three
townspeople who were presumed lost in the crash. Outside the
Billingses' white clapboard home, a white ribbon adorned a tree,
and friends left bouquets of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   When Mead's husband, Robert, died, said her daughter-in-law,
Katrina Heron, ``The whole town mobilized to help get her through
that, bringing over food not just for a weekend, but for a year.''
They brought books on tape for Robert Mead while he was ill with
cancer, and would sit with him so his wife could go to a movie,
Heron said.
</P>
<P>
   The Billingses helped Mead then, and after she was widowed.
``Part of that was taking her on this trip. She was kind of
resuming her life, and having a fun adventure with them,'' Heron
said. Norfolk, population 2,300, now must pull together again.
</P>
<P>
   A woman checking out books at the library was reticent in her
grief. ``They were active in walking, biking and canoeing,'' she
said of the Billingses. ``They were pillars of the community. I
just can't talk about it. Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Billings was on Tuesday's ballot, as one of two candidates
for alternates to the zoning board of appeals, and she had
organized people to water planters in town. Mr. Billings had been
on the conservation committee and was one of the founders of the
Norfolk Land Trust, said Anne Moses, the town clerk. Mead was
learning to become a volunteer ambulance driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community is really built on the strength of people like
her,'' Heron said from her home in Berkeley, Calif. ``They really
were very involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson Grosjean, 16, who works at the local pharmacy,
remembered how Mrs. Billings would take the fifth-grade class to a
rug in the back of their classroom when they needed to talk about
being picked on by the sixth graders. ``She really cared about how
the students were feeling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Marianne McCullagh, pastor of the Church of Christ
Congregational, spoke to The Register Citizen newspaper for its
front-page obituary, she expressed the grief of the town's
residents most accurately: ``Goethe said, `The highest cannot be
said.' I think he's right. It's felt. Language comes up short.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Navy searchers said Tuesday that they had definitively
determined the location of both the flight data recorder and the
cockpit voice recorder belonging to EgyptAir Flight 990, an
essential discovery in the quest to learn why the Boeing 767
plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean off New England early Sunday
morning, killing all 217 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investigators on Tuesday night provided further
details about the aircraft's final moments. Once something went
wrong, they said, the twin-engine jet began a tortured and
ever-faster descent so precipitous that it reached supersonic
speeds of more than 660 mph. Radar sweeps tracking the aircraft's
plunge from Nantucket Island show that in the last 37 seconds of
its flight, Flight 990 twisted away from its assigned northeast
heading to make a long right-hand turn.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they hoped to integrate data from two other
radar centers _ on Long Island, N.Y., and in New Hampshire _ to
evaluate what, for now, is an eerie detail.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also said that interviews with the crews that had
flown the jet to the United States from Cairo had determined that
the plane had experienced only one recent problem: Questions about
a thrust reverser _ which redirects exhaust to slow a plane at
takeoff or landing _ had caused the airline to disable it. But they
emphasized that there was no way as yet to determine the
significance of that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Any sense of accomplishment over locating the black boxes was
quickly tempered by the reminder that natural elements would
dictate the investigation's pace, as rainstorms and 50-mph gusts
raised 10-foot waves at the accident scene, about 50 miles south of
Nantucket Island. The storm delayed some aspects of the search and
recovery mission; for example, it forced the Navy ship Mohawk,
which detected the pinger signals emanating from the two so-called
black boxes, to return to shore Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. James Graham of the Navy acknowledged Tuesday that the
storm would hamper the development of a sonar-aided grid of the
debris field. But he said the weather should not delay plans to try
to retrieve the black boxes with a remote-operated vehicle that
would be lowered about 250 feet to the ocean floor. He said he
expected that equipment to arrive at the site late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the inclement weather signaled the added pressures
brought by time's passage: drops in water temperature as the New
England fall deepens, shifts in sands that might cover aircraft
debris, and the effect that deep-sea life will have on human
remains on the ocean floor. There were also pressures brought by
the anger and sorrow of victims' relatives.
</P>
<P>
   As those relatives gathered Tuesday at the Doubletree Islander
Hotel in Newport, R.I., officials from the National Transportation
Safety Board, which is heading the crash investigation, informed
them that only pieces of human remains had been found so far and
advised them not to expect the recovery of intact bodies. The grim
advice prompted both tears and stunned silence; one relative, Red
Cross officials said, had to be taken away by ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivity of the subject was palpable at a news conference
held by investigators in Newport on Tuesday afternoon. Graham said
that the recovery of remains, which had continued throughout the
day, would be done ``with dignity and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were seeking to answer a basic but complex
question: Why did EgyptAir Flight 990, a 10-year-old airplane with
no prior problems, suddenly drop from a clear night sky and fall
33,000 feet into the Atlantic, leaving only teddy bears, shoes and
debris to bob in the fuel-slicked water?
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 767 took off from Kennedy Airport in New York at 1:19
a.m. for a routine 11-hour flight to Cairo. Radar tracks indicate
that 31 minutes later, the twin-engine jet began its inexplicable
two-minute plunge without any reports of problems from its crew.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hundreds of federal investigators, as well as the crews of
Navy and Coast Guard vessels, are working to determine the
tragedy's cause. Officials continue to warn that there is no
evidence of foul play; nevertheless, until a definitive cause is
determined, they said they must investigate the possibilities of
terrorism and other crime.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the safety board also said they planned either to
send American investigators to Cairo to look at the maintenance
records of the plane or to have those records sent to the United
States. The first group of investigators from Egypt arrived in
Newport on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   There was no elaboration Tuesday on reports that an EgyptAir 990
crew member had complained that a briefcase had been tampered with
in Los Angeles, where the doomed flight had originated Saturday
evening. But just as that tantalizing tidbit seemed to fade,
another surfaced: James Hall, chairman of the safety board, said
Tuesday night that two people on Nantucket had told investigators
that they witnessed the final plunge of the jet.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators deflected further questions about the witnesses'
claims Tuesday night, so the potential value of those reports could
not be determined. Many people witnessed the mid-air explosion and
crash of TWA Flight 800 in 1996, largely because it occurred close
to sunset and a few miles from the southeastern shores of Long
Island. By comparison, EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed in the middle of
the night, 50 miles from Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   In establishing reasonable lines of inquiry, investigators
indicated Tuesday night that they will most likely examine any role
that the aircraft's thrust reversers might have played in the
disaster. They said that one of the plane's thrust reversers was
inactive.
</P>
<P>
   The accidental deployment of a thrust reverser in midflight led
to the crash of another Boeing 767, operated by Lauda Air, near
Bangkok, Thailand, in May 1991; the 233 people on board were
killed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal investigators pulled back Tuesday from their
reports Monday that the Coast Guard cutter Juniper had recovered a
``piece of the aircraft structure'' so large that a crane was
needed to hoist it aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Capt. Russ Webster clarified the discovery at
Tuesday's press conference. He said that the piece of debris was
actually a luggage container. In addition, he said that the item
had not been recovered; it sank before Juniper's crew could salvage
it.
</P>
<P>
   The minor embarrassment had little to do with the definitive
location of the two black boxes. The cockpit voice recorder would
include a tape of the last 30 minutes of conversations by the
aircraft's pilots. But it is the flight data recorder that may
provide the most valuable information regarding the plane's final
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane's flight data recorder, which EgyptAir officials
described as among the most sophisticated of its kind, contains
most of the airplane's technical data _ from the positioning of its
various parts to its speed and direction.

 &HT;    Bush supports teaching of values
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GORHAM, N.H. _ Gov. George W. Bush, laying out his case for
teaching moral values in the nation's classrooms, called Tuesday
for tougher enforcement of gun laws to make schools safer and
linked character education to student safety.
</P>
<P>
   In the final installment of his plan to overhaul public schools,
the Republican presidential front-runner promised to triple the
federal government's spending for character education to $25
million, so schools can teach ``the moral landmarks that guide a
successful life.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposing an array of initiatives to counter school violence,
Bush said he would ban kids convicted of serious gun offenses from
buying or carrying guns for life, and said students should be
allowed to transfer out of chronically violent schools to nearby
charter or public schools. If those alternatives don't exist,
students could go to private schools paid for with federal
education money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The excellence of a school is not measured by declines in
robbery, murder and aggravated assault,'' Bush told the audience at
the Northern White Mountain Chamber of Commerce. ``Safety is just
the first and urgent step toward our second order of business _
instilling in all our public schools the virtue of discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush challenged educators to set limits and enforce boundaries
and decried the ``mixed and muddled'' moral message put out by some
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Gorham appearance was the centerpiece of a two-day visit to
New Hampshire, host to the first primary and a state Bush has been
criticized for not courting ardently enough. He did not participate
in last week's town forum with other GOP candidates, inviting
attacks from rival Malcolm ``Steve'' Forbes and others. In a poll
last week, Arizona Sen. John McCain narrowed Bush's lead here from
35 to 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to show that he isn't taking the state for granted, Bush
took questions after his speech, something he has done on his last
two or three visits to New Hampshire. Bush usually sticks to
prepared texts.
</P>
<P>
   When a woman asked how he would help two-parent families, Bush
said he would cut taxes. To another woman who wanted to know what
he would do about the high cost of health insurance, Bush said he
supports increasing tax deductions for small businesses and
establishing medical savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   He meandered when he tried to explain how he would help ailing
rural communities, promising that the Internet would help improve
education and eventually bring in jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only point is it's a really optimistic time,'' he said. Pat
Munroe, a real estate agent from nearby Berlin, wasn't so sure.
Facing a $300 health insurance bill, she was the person who earlier
asked what Bush would do to make insurance more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an answer,'' she said. ``Not until I see something
done.''
</P>
<P>
   In two earlier education speeches, Bush outlined a plan long on
testing and accountability, with ideas imported from Texas and from
advisers on both the right and left.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush continued the softer, centrist tone he has
adopted throughout the campaign, offering character education and a
continued emphasis on teen abstinence along with a plea for
diversity and tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, schools and districts that get federal money
under the $6 billion Safe and Drug Free Schools program would have
to set and measure safety standards and publish the results.
Parents could compare school safety records, which would be posted
on the Internet. Students in schools that don't improve after three
years could transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that teachers should be freer to punish unruly
students and that the federal government should more aggressively
prosecute children who carry guns.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers could throw persistently disruptive kids out of class,
and teachers, principals and school board members would be shielded
from lawsuits that may result. A similar initiative exists in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would spend more money _ but didn't say how much
more _ to help prosecutors and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms keep kids from bringing guns to school and prosecute those
who do.
</P>
<P>
   Critics tore into the speech, attacking Bush's ideas as
unoriginal and criticizing Texas as a gun-toting state.
</P>
<P>
   ``His record in Texas is grounded on elected officials who came
before him,'' said Patricia Ewing, strategist for the Democratic
National Committee. ``And now the national program is taking a
piece from here and a piece from there and has no overall vision.
It's vouchers, vouchers part two, and then he says, basically,
we've got a problem with values in our schools. Where's the vision
for the nation? It's education lite.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush signed the Safe Schools Act in Texas in 1995. Under the
act, students who bring guns to school can be expelled for one
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush generally opposes gun control but has said he would back
raising the minimum age for gun ownership from 18 to 21, banning
certain high-capacity ammunition clips and doing instant background
checks on gun purchasers from unlicensed dealers at gun shows.
Democrats want three days to do the checks.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he said schools should not impose religion, but
should be ``allies in the moral education of our children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious groups have a right to meet before and after
school,'' he said. ``Students have a right to say grace before
meals, read their Bibles, wear Stars of David and crosses, and
discuss religion with other willing students. Students have a right
to express religious ideas in art and homework. Public schools that
forbid these forms of religious expression are confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Denton, a Bush supporter from nearby Bethlehem, N.H., liked
what he heard. But he said Bush needs to pound the pavement a tad
more often in New Hampshire if he wants to win more converts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't hurt, let's put it that way,'' Denton said. ``I
saw McCain over in Littleton and he was pretty good. He works the
room good. That's the thing here in New Hampshire, you've got to be
out there, see people. He's got a great message. There's no reason
to hold back.''

UMPIRES MEET TO SEEK A WAY TO BREAK POWERS' INFLUENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Preparing for an election that will determine their
collective bargaining future, 52 umpires met Tuesday in an all-day
session that was clearly aimed at abolishing the power of Richie
Phillips as the umpires' labor leader.
</P>
<P>
   Even members of the pro-Phillips faction participated, though
the purpose of at least some of them was not to support a new
union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we come out of this with a new union,'' John
Hirschbeck, an American League umpire, said. ``Our biggest goal is
to have a union that's led by umpires for umpires, where umpires
lead this union and attorneys advise us. We want a union that's
free and open and accountable, all the things that a union is
supposed to be. Most important, we want a democracy where every
member is important, and every opinion and every voice of each and
every member is important.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question at a news conference at an inner
harbor hotel, Joe Brinkman, another veteran AL umpire, said,
``There's no room for Richie Phillips in this new organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck and Brinkman are two of the leaders of the insurgent
group of umpires who successfully petitioned the National Labor
Relations Board for an election. The board's New York office will
mail ballots to 93 umpires on Friday, asking them to vote for the
existing union, the proposed new union or no union at all. The
winner needs a majority of the votes cast in the mail ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The existing union, headed by Phillips, sent a delegation of
umpires who were among the 22 who lost their jobs in Phillips'
failed resignation strategy. Hirschbeck said that Terry Tata, Joe
West and Mark Johnson were part of a delegation sent to the meeting
by the Major League Umpires Association and its president, Jerry
Crawford, a National League umpire, to report back to him.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Evans, Ed Hickox, Larry Vanover and Sam Holbrook, four
others who lost their jobs, also attended the meeting, as did Angel
Hernandez and Jeff Kellogg, two working umpires who have supported
Phillips. Kellogg was part of the Crawford delegation; Hernandez
attended on his own, other umpires said. Twenty of the 25 umpires
the leagues hired after more than 50 umpires submitted letters of
resignation were at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkman said four of the terminated 22 came on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were worried a little bit about it taking away from their
arbitration,'' Brinkman said. ``I don't think there will be a
problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to the arbitration hearing that is scheduled to
begin Friday in the union's attempt to win back the 22 jobs. The
league presidents accepted the umpires' resignations after they had
hired 25 new umpires. Phillips had invoked the resignation strategy
in an attempt to induce baseball officials to initiate early talks
to replace the labor agreement that expires Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips and his supporters have blamed the dissident umpires
for the strategy's failure, but they, in turn, say new leadership
is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened in the past has been confrontational,''
Brinkman said, ``always getting into situations where baseball
couldn't deal with us and we couldn't deal with baseball. I think
the new union is going to allow us to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Umpires who oppose Phillips said they had heard from some of the
lawyer's ostensible supporters who expressed their support for a
new union but who chose not to attend the meeting so they could
avoid pressure from the Phillips faction before the vote.
Hirschbeck also cited a letter Crawford sent to umpires last week
as being an attempt to discourage union members from attending the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we would have had more at the meeting without that
letter from Jerry Crawford,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Crawford decried the attempt to form a new union
while the jobs of the 22 umpires were at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We therefore cannot encourage umpires to attend,'' the
president wrote. ``We will, however, as a sign of our willingness
to explore every possible avenue of detente, send designated
representatives to attend.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the Major League Umpires Independent Organizing
Committee stressed at their news conference that they fully
supported the effort to get the resigned umpires back to work.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also expressed confidence that they would prevail in
their attempt to get a new union to represent all of the umpires.

YANKEES DECIDE TO KEEP O'NEILL AND STRAWBERRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees retained outfielder Paul O'Neill and
designated hitter Darryl Strawberry for next season, exercising
contractual options, as expected. O'Neill will receive $6.5
million, Strawberry $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the first decisions emanating from the second of
three days of the Yankees' organizational meetings in Tampa, Fla.,
which began in earnest Tuesday. Club executives may have to
identify a new third-base coach soon, because last season's, Willie
Randolph, is a finalist for the managerial opening with the
Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph went through what was expected to be the final round of
interviews in Milwaukee Tuesday, and the Brewers will probably
choose between Randolph and the San Diego coach Davey Lopes, both
former second basemen. The two competed against each other in three
World Series, when Randolph played for the Yankees and Lopes for
the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The status of the coaches would be a natural topic for
discussion in the meetings, because their contracts expired Monday.
A month ago, there was much talk in the organization that the
hitting coach Chris Chambliss was going to be fired, but the fact
that the Yankees won their third championship in four years seems
to have cooled that talk.
</P>
<P>
   The next player move likely to be addressed by the Yankees will
be the status of designated hitter Chili Davis. The Yankees will
probably buy out Davis' option for the 2000 season, paying him
$800,000; Davis has said he intends to retire if the Yankees don't
want him back.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, 36, had just 73 at-bats during the 1999 regular
season, a result of his difficulty recovering from colon cancer,
his relapse into drinking, his arrest for possession of cocaine and
solicitation, and his subsequent suspension. But Strawberry
surprised the Yankees with his quick bat in his one month of
playing time, and it figures he will be the left-handed half of a
platoon at designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, 36, hit 19 home runs and drove in 110 runs, but he
struggled at times, leading to questions about whether he would
play another season. O'Neill finished well, however, with some big
hits in the post-season despite a broken rib.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill learned of the Yankees' decision Tuesday afternoon in a
call from his agent, Joe Bick, and reacted almost mutely; O'Neill's
father, Charles O'Neill, died last week, and the outfielder's
family returned to Ohio for a memorial service last weekend. ``He's
so humble,'' said Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, who
called O'Neill Tuesday. ``He was, like, `Thanks for having me
back.' Sometimes I don't think he understands just how important
he's been to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Yankees played the Red Sox in the American League
Championship Series, Nevalee O'Neill, Paul's wife, asked a reporter
if he thought the Yankees would exercise her husband's $6.5 million
option. The reporter told her that the Yankees would almost
certainly bring O'Neill back for another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' she replied, ``because I already told him we're not
going anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relieved in a way because I didn't want to go anywhere
else,'' O'Neill said. ``I'm excited because we go to spring
training as the defending World Series champs. I was happy they
picked it up because that made it easy for me. I'm where I want to
be. It's a mutual thing between us. It'll be fun being back trying
to defend what we've won. They've made the right decisions on who
to bring back in the past.'' &QL;

HILARY TJADER HARRIS, EXPERIMENTAL FILMMAKER AND SCULPTOR, DIES AT
69  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hilary Tjader Harris, an experimental and documentary
filmmaker and kinetic sculptor, died on Oct. 26 at Mount Sinai
Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was kidney failure, said David Hollister, a friend and
collaborator, adding that Harris had contracted an undiagnosed
illness three years ago in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   A filmmaker influenced by the work of Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Harris
explored the possibilities of abstract motion in two early short
films, ``Longhorns'' (1951) and ``Generation'' (1956). His third
film, ``Highway,'' used a rock 'n' roll score to accompany
fast-moving images filmed from a speeding car on highways and
bridges around New York City. The work received a bronze medal at
the Brussels International Experimental Film Festival in 1958 and
led to an offer from the Scottish Film Board to direct a
documentary on shipbuilding on the Clyde River in Glasgow. That
film, ``Seawards the Great Ships,'' won an Academy Award for best
short subject in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s and '70s Harris had a studio in Greenwich Village,
where he made experimental, documentary, industrial and animated
films. One, ``Nine Variations on a Dance Theme'' (1966), a study of
the dancer Bettie de Jong, received prizes at several film
festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was a pioneer in the development of time-lapse
photography, which was the basic technique of his 1975 film,
``Organism.'' It compared the patterns of activity in New York City
to the rhythms of nature.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s he moved to Woodstock, N.Y., where he designed and
built his own house, shaped like a spaceship, and worked at
designing a computer-oriented ``drawing machine.'' He was still
working on this invention when he became ill.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his third wife, Dena Crane, and by two
daughters, Branwyn and Rhana, and a son, Morgan, from his previous
marriage to Maxine Barnes Rochlin. &QL;

GIULIANI SAYS JUDGE RUSHED DECISION IN BROOKLYN ART MUSEUM CASE
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani accused a federal judge on
Tuesday of rushing to issue her ruling in the Brooklyn Museum of
Art case to block city lawyers from fully investigating the
finances of the museum's ``Sensation'' exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani stepped up his attacks on Judge Nina Gershon of U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn one day after she ruled that he had no
right to cut the museum's city financing because he believed that
``Sensation'' was offensive and blasphemous. The exhibition
includes displays of dead animals and a painting of the Virgin Mary
that includes some elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has continued to condemn the art in ``Sensation,'' but
this week he began to shift the focus of his criticism to the
unorthodox financial arrangements that made the exhibition
possible. The New York Times reported on Sunday that museum
officials had solicited hundreds of thousands of dollars in
donations from companies and individuals with a direct commercial
interest in the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the facts we knew, some we didn't know,'' Giuliani
said of The Times article. ``We didn't know that there virtually
had been a total sellout of the museum to millionaires and
multimillionaires trying to make money off this exhibit.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor accused the museum of concealing documents from
lawyers for the museum who had raised questions about the
exhibition's financing but then all but dropped the matter during
arguments before Gershon.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, after reading the article in The Times, directed his
lawyers on Monday to ask Gershon to give the city more time to
investigate the exhibition's finances before issuing her ruling.
The judge refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might recall that we objected some time ago _ I did
publicly _ to their concealing documents,'' Giuliani said of museum
officials. ``Well, it turned out they concealed a lot more than a
few documents. They concealed a lot of documents. And we asked the
judge to reopen discovery, and then it appeared as if she rushed
the decision and cut that off to protect the people of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge almost seemed to rush to a decision to cut off any
discovery of those facts. She had originally not allowed us very
much discovery, which is why we didn't find out about it on our
own. And now as soon as these facts were revealed, within a day she
releases her decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Gershon declined to respond, but Floyd Abrams, a lawyer for the
museum, dismissed the mayor's comments as ``literally filled with
falsehoods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very lucky that he lives in a nation with the First
Amendment,'' Abrams said. ``If he were in England, he would be in
prison tonight for contempt of court for the false charges he has
made about Judge Gershon.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams said the museum had turned over 3,000 pages of documents
in response to requests from the city. Indeed, in preparing their
case, lawyers for the city questioned Arnold L. Lehman, the
museum's director, about several documents, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``No documents were concealed,'' Abrams said. ``All relevant
documents were turned over to the city and were reviewed by lawyers
for the city before they took the deposition of Arnold Lehman. The
suggestion that documents were withheld or concealed is absolutely
false.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's attack on Gershon also prompted a critical response
from the Association of Trial Lawyers of America. ``It has become a
disturbing trend that a few public officials and candidates try to
make political points by unfairly attacking the judiciary and the
fair administration of justice,'' the association said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the city would continue to seek more information
about the financial support behind ``Sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   That support included $160,000 from Charles Saatchi, the owner
of the ``Sensation'' collection; $50,000 from Christie's; tens of
thousands of dollars from art dealers; and a substantial donation
from David Bowie, the British musician whose Internet company was
awarded the right to display ``Sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of New York has a right to know about how this museum
sold out for money,'' Giuliani said. ``This is supposed to be a
public museum for the public good.''

TEXANS LEAN TOWARD APPROVING EDUCATION, OTHER AMENDMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT and JOHN MORITZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas voters appeared to be giving thumbs up to a series of
constitutional amendments Tuesday, including measures freeing up
money for higher education and liberalizing the rules governing
reverse mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   And in an election that could set a record for low voter
turnout, early returns indicated that voters were endorsing a
measure that makes clear that the lieutenant governor moves up if
the governor's office becomes vacant.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, early returns indicated that voters were
approving an initiative to devote tax money to build a new arena
for the San Antonio Spurs basketball team; preliminary vote totals
showed Houston voters were rejecting a similar arena proposal.
Houston Mayor Lee Brown easily won a second two-year term.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-cent sales tax increase to finance part of a
drag-racing facility in Grand Prairie was losing in early returns,
but two other propositions _ a 2 percentage point increase in the
hotel-motel tax to pay for a convention center on Joe Pool Lake and
a quarter-cent sales tax increase for parks improvements _ appeared
to be passing.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, unofficial returns showed that Texans were split on
the question of expanding the governor's powers to make two key
appointments. Voters appeared to be rejecting a special commission
to make recommendations on how much state judges should be paid.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the fate of 17 proposed amendments to the state's
123-year-old Constitution were decided by voters. One, Proposition
3, to eliminate a slew of arcane and outdated sections of the
Constitution, was emerging as the most popular item on the
statewide ballot, according to early returns.
</P>
<P>
   Odd-year elections in Texas are generally devoted to considering
amendments to the state's already cumbersome constitution, a
document that had already been amended 377 times.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike past amendment elections when voters were asked to
consider such high-profile issues as a state lottery or pari-mutuel
wagering, this year's ballot offered little to boost voter turnout.
Based on early voting, officials predicted that only about 800,000
of the state's 11.5 million registered voters would cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight's turnout, if it is in line with what we projected,
would be near a record low for a November constitutional amendment
election, which we saw in 1979, when turnout was 7.7 percent,''
said Jane Dees, spokeswoman for the Texas Secretary of State's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the lowest turnout for a constitutional amendment
election was in August 1997, when only 6.9 percent of registered
voters cast ballots in a referendum on lowering property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 presidential election did add some significance to
Proposition 1, which clarifies the succession process if the
governor's office becomes vacant.
</P>
<P>
   If Gov. George W. Bush is successful in his quest for the
presidency, the measure makes clear that the lieutenant governor
assumes the governor's office and vacates the state's No. 2 post.
The 31 state senators would select one of their own to become
lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 2 would raise the age from 55 to 62 for homeowners
seeking reverse-mortgage loans. The change would allow seniors to
remain in their homes and receive a monthly or periodic payment for
the home's value.
</P>
<P>
   Voters appeared to be approving Proposition 6, which would
expand the definition of an urban homestead from one to a maximum
of 10 acres, making homes on more than one acre eligible for home
equity lending.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns showed voters endorsing Proposition 7, which
allows the state to garnishee wages to pay delinquent spousal
maintenance payments in those instances in which the courts impose
alimony.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 9, meanwhile, was getting the cold shoulder. It
would have established a commission to recommend to the Legislature
how much state judges should be paid. Legislators have come under
criticism for determining judges' pay because state law ties
lawmakers' pensions to those of state judges.
</P>
<P>
   Propositions 8 and 10 would give the governor more latitude in
hiring and dismissing the state's top military officer and the
commissioner of health and human services. Early returns showed
those in a virtual dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Proposition 12, the only proposal to become the
subject of a significant advertising campaign, remained unclear in
early returns. The measure would authorize the Legislature to
exempt motor vehicles leased for personal use from property taxes.

 &HT;    Vote on King papers ownership could hinge on pricetag,
copyrightsBy Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service WASHINGTON _ The House could vote as
<TEXT>
early as todayto authorize the purchase of the private papers of
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. from his family, but political
maneuvering on Capitol Hill could delay that purchase.
<P>
   The vote would authorize the Library of Congress to purchase or
acquire through private donations the papers of the slain civil
rights leader for $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   While the Senate unanimously authorized the purchase last week,
some House Republicans are concerned about the price tag and about
setting a precedent of using taxpayer dollars to purchase private
papers.
</P>
<P>
   They also are concerned about who would control the copyright of
about 80,000 documents contained in the cache of King's private
papers now housed at the Martin Luther King Center in Atlanta and
at Coretta Scott King's private home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think $20 million is an outrage,'' said Rep. John Linder
(R-Ga.). The papers are clearly valuable, he said, but the price is
too much to pay. ``That is what I call a payoff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The action taken by the Senate and the impending action in the
House would merely authorize the purchase of the papers. Congress
must still scramble to find a way to actually pay for it _ a
difficult task given a targeted adjournment date of Nov. 10 and the
ongoing feud over passing a budget for the current fiscal year,
which began Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations between the Library of Congress and the King
family stretch back to 1967, one year before King was assassinated.
The price would be the largest amount that the library has ever
paid for a collection, but some lawmakers say the historical
significance of the papers is well worth the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a tragedy if these papers were scattered or sold
by an auction house,'' said Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights
leader and trusted confidant of King. ``The price may be high, but
the papers are priceless. They should be kept and preserved for all
Americans to see, feel and learn from.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, first reported by Congressional Quarterly's
daily publication on Capitol Hill, the King family would receive
$20 million. That is $10 million less than the appraisal conducted
by Southeby's auction house in New York, which reviewed the papers'
value at the family's request.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators now are trying to settle whether the King family
should retain any copyright control over the papers, which include
transcriptions of King's speeches, handwritten notes, letters and
personal items such as report cards from school.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a House committee overseeing the Library of Congress
unexpectedly questioned James Billington, the Librarian of
Congress, about the deal Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) said he wanted to know if this would
set a precedent where other prominent families would try to sell
collections to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the library made such a purchase was in 1930 when
it spent $1.5 million to buy a book collection that included three
copies of the Gutenberg Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is what is it that we get if we buy them?'' said
Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Administration
Committee. And it is not just lawmakers who have some questions
about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   King's private papers represent less than 10 percent of the of
documents held at the King Center. The question that historians
have about the sale is who has the legal authority over the papers
of civil rights groups such as the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those (the SCLC and the SNCC papers) are more valuable to
scholars,'' said David Garrow, a historian at Emory University and
noted biographer of King. Garrow is concerned that Dexter Scott
King, the son of King who heads the center, wants to close the
center's library for economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Garrow said that the family's desire to sell the papers goes
against King's legacy of selflessness. He noted that King, gave
away his 1964 Nobel Peace Prize money to civil rights
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (the King family) were going to take the money and
help run food programs for the poor, Dr. King would be perfectly
happy,'' Garrow said. ``But that is not likely the track record.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the deal say the King family has every right to
receive money from the papers' sale. They point out that Congress
has purchased the papers of Thomas Jefferson and other American
icons in the past. They say the Library of Congress is the best
location for the papers, because it already is the repository for
the papers of other civil rights leaders such as Frederick
Douglass, Booker T. Washington and Thurgood Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't hear a lot of people raising cain about giving all
these ex-presidents time on the public payroll to raise money to
build their libraries,'' said Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), who
initiated the negotiations. He noted that the King family is
selling the papers for $10 million under their appraised value.
</P>
<P>
   The papers are ``virtually priceless,'' said Sen. Max Cleland
(D-Ga.). ``They show the evolution of the thinking of this seminal
figure in our history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The wording in both the Senate and House measures allows for the
library to raise funds for the purchase from private donations, a
move applauded by Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   Collecting private contributions to offset or pay for the papers
is ``laudable and appropriate,'' Coverdell said. Preserving the
papers is preserving a critical part of the nation's history, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is you could find that this precedent has already
been set beginning with Jefferson,'' Coverdell said.

IDEAS INTO ACTION: A PRIMER ON WEATHERING TECHNOLOGY'S STORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRED ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Round 1, the giants of the old bricks-and-mortar economy took
their lumps from their new Internet rivals on several notable
fronts: books, toys, stock trading. Now, in Round 2, they are
fighting back with their own incursions into the Internet, most
prominently the online services established by the big Wall Street
firms.
</P>
<P>
   The counteroffensive is much too diverse to follow a single
battle plan. But to the extent that any one doctrine is shaping the
climate of corporate opinion, it is a sweet piece of business
scholarship by Clayton M. Christensen, a professor at the Harvard
Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen's study, ``The Innovator's Dilemma: When New
Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail'' (Harvard Business School
Press, 1997), has become the book to read among mainstream managers
trying to dope out an Internet strategy. It is now in its 12th
printing, with sales of 125,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   What attracts Christensen's scrutiny are ``well-managed
companies that listen astutely to their customers, invest
aggressively in new technologies and yet still lose market
dominance.'' It is almost a compliment to be numbered among his
distinguished flops.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, the professor issues a warning to today's
corporate success stories: ``Lose at the low end today, lose at the
high end tomorrow,'' he said in an interview. But he offers a
prescription for escaping that fate: ``Create a separate
subsidiary; free it to attack the parent.''
</P>
<P>
   That advice has hit a chord in corporate boardrooms.
Christensen's fans include Michael Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg
LP; Michael Dell, chairman of Dell Computer; David Pottruck,
co-chief executive of Charles Schwab; George M.C. Fisher, chairman
of Eastman Kodak, and George Gilder, the futurist.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Grove, the chairman of Intel, has credited Christensen's
ideas with helping to propel Intel's painful but pivotal decision
to develop the Celeron chip, its cheaper microprocessor for the
sub-$1,000 personal computer. The embrace of an inferior product,
however strategic, ran so counter to Intel's perfectionist culture
that Grove turned development over to a special project team in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   For all its high-profile following, and for all the
information-age ring of its ``principles of disruptive
innovation,'' however, ``The Innovator's Dilemma'' makes no mention
of the Internet. It is a curious omission, yet the book succeeds in
spite of it because it offers the e-perplexed a familiar way to
think about the puzzling Internet economy. It will probably unfold
as new technology always has _ which is to say, unpredictably.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Innovator's Dilemma'' rests on a study of the disk drive's
rapid evolution through six generations of architecture, from
mainframe computers through hand-held devices. Only twice has the
leading manufacturer maintained its place from one technology to
the next; thus, Control Data gave way to Shugart Associates,
Shugart to Seagate, Seagate to Connor Peripherals and Connor to new
entrants.
</P>
<P>
   What explains the turnover? The professor distinguishes between
``sustaining'' and ``disruptive'' technologies. Sustaining
technologies improve existing products, either marginally (fuel
injection instead of carburetors) or dramatically (color
television). Pioneering those advances is red meat for managers at
dominant companies.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, products from disruptive technologies perform
poorly at first. But even as these ugly ducklings are shrugged off
by the industry's big players, they catch on with fringe customers,
often new to the industry, who value some aspect lacking in the
more sophisticated alternatives, like simplicity or low price.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, the substitute shoves the industry leader
aside. Inkjet printers, far slower than laser printers, inferior in
both resolution and cost per copy, improved enough to satisfy most
customers and drive more costly laser printers into the uppermost
corner of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Something is reassuring in a business scholar who writes as
sure-footedly about steam shovels as about disk drives. Replacing
steam with gasoline power was sustaining. Early backhoes were
disruptive; simple hydraulic lifts attached to tractors, they were
so puny they appealed only to home builders, who used them to dig
sewer trenches previously dug by hand. But in 20 years, hydraulic
excavators became the rule.
</P>
<P>
   How does one tell a genuine disruptive threat from just another
techno-fizzle? Not very easily, the professor says. Markets that
don't exist can't be analyzed. What typically opens the window of
opportunity for low-end competitors is ``performance oversupply,''
that is, products with costly features that buyers don't need. The
cheaper Celeron chip, it turns out, is perfectly fine for most home
computer users.
</P>
<P>
   What gives Christensen's research its bite is his conclusion
about the inflexibility of big companies. Paradoxically, the more
ably a company serves its bread-and-butter customers, the more
likely it is to bungle the test of change. Up and down the line,
managers recoil from chasing after small beer. Disruptive products
promise lower margins (and smaller commissions) in insignificant
markets. The company's best customers don't want them, can't use
them. Who needs the distraction from serious work? The corporate
organism resists all efforts to change its nature.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do? The professor's answer is to create a small unit
entirely focused on the emerging market. Staff it with people whose
careers depend on its success. Give it the bare-bones cost
structure necessary to make money in the bush leagues. Be prepared
to court an unorthodox customer base. Be probing and nondogmatic,
poised to learn from mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds a lot like an Internet operation.

NEW YORK IS NEGOTIATING TO SELL ITS TWO NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The New York State Power Authority said Tuesday
that it was negotiating to sell its two nuclear power plants, which
would be one of the largest asset sales ever by the state, and
signals the continuing, rapid evolution of the electric power
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The authority said it had begun talks with the Entergy Corp., a
major energy company based in New Orleans, for the sale of the
Indian Point 3 reactor on the Hudson River, 35 miles north of
Manhattan, and the James A. FitzPatrick plant on Lake Ontario. The
Indian Point 2 reactor, neighboring Indian Point 3, is owned by
Consolidated Edison.
</P>
<P>
   Power Authority officials would not say how much they expected
to reap from a sale, but industry analysts said the figure would
almost certainly be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and
perhaps more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The authority said that as a condition of any sale, it would
continue to provide low-cost power to certain corporate clients
under the state's economic development programs, and to local
government agencies like New York City, the city's Housing
Authority and the subway system. Last year, the two nuclear plants
accounted for 32 percent of the electricity produced by the Power
Authority, which also runs several hydroelectric plants.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two years ago, there was no market to speak of
for power plants, but in New York and many other states, state
regulators have forced utilities to sell off their plants to
encourage competition in an industry that has been dominated for a
century by government-sanctioned monopolies. For the utilities,
that has produced a windfall, as plants powered by gas, oil and
coal have fetched prices several times the values that the
companies have listed for them on their books.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear plants are generally considered less desirable because
they can be expensive to operate and, later, to decommission. Only
a few companies have actively shopped for nuclear plants, and the
handful that have been sold have gone for a small fraction of their
book value. But industry analysts say the FitzPatrick and Indian
Point plants are better properties than most nuclear plants that
have gone on the market so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to start to see more attractive plants
like these being sold, and more bidders, and at more attractive
prices,'' said Stephen Fetter, an energy industry analyst at Fitch
Investors Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Power Authority, a quasi-independent agency whose board is
appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki, did not set out to sell its
nuclear plants, according to Mike Petralia, a spokesman. ``But over
the past 18 months or so, we've been approached by several
companies expressing interest in purchasing the plants,'' he said,
while refusing to name any but Entergy.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Shapiro, a lawyer for the New York Public Interest
Research Group who follows energy issues, said he was troubled that
the authority did not select a buyer through a formal, competitive
process.
</P>
<P>
   But Petralia said the authority had made its standards clear to
each of its prospective suitors, including an idea of its asking
price and its insistence on job security for plant employees and a
continuing role in economic development programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entergy seems to be the only one willing and able to meet
those conditions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Paul D. Tonko, a Democrat who heads the Energy
Committee, applauded the proposed sale, which he has advocated in
the past, but he complained that the process had so far been
cloaked in secrecy, making it difficult to determine whether the
state was getting the best possible deal.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Indian Point 3 went into operation in 1976 and has a
980-megawatt capacity, making it one of the largest-output power
plants in the country. FitzPatrick began operation in 1975 and has
a capacity of 800 megawatts.

FANFARE FOR AIDS LAB AT QUEENS COLLEGE TURNS TO WHISPERS OF DOUBT
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two years ago, Queens College announced with great
fanfare that it had snared Dr. Luc Montagnier, co-discoverer of the
AIDS virus, to become a professor and the linchpin of a big new
AIDS research center on the campus in Flushing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with no sign of any private money beyond an initial $4.5
million donation from an alumnus, Dr. Bernard Salick, the future of
the $30 million molecular biology research center appears to be in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a well-intentioned gift has become an
embarrassment, one that few people are willing to talk about on the
record. And the lab has become an expensive enterprise for a
financially stretched college.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that the additional money needed to build and equip the
research center might never materialize, the City University of New
York has given Allen L. Sessoms, the president of Queens College,
until the end of this month to raise the money.
</P>
<P>
   If Sessoms fails in raising $6 million to $9 million in private
money for the AIDS center in the next few weeks, CUNY officials
would like to explore how they might scale down the project and
possibly do without the new building that Queens College had
envisioned, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am committed to try to assist the president and Queens
College to find a way to restructure the plans to fit within
whatever money is available,'' Matthew Goldstein, CUNY's
chancellor, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He met with Sessoms, Salick and several members of the Queens
College Foundation on Monday to discuss the outlook for the center.
One possibility, he said, might be to link the Queens researchers
with the structural biology center being created at City College,
which will be home to a consortium of 10 New York medical
institutions, including CUNY's medical school.
</P>
<P>
   With strong lobbying from the Queens borough president, Claire
Shulman, New York state had agreed to put up $15 million, but the
money was contingent upon Queens College raising a matching amount
from other sources. Besides the Salick gift _ $3 million to endow a
chair for Montagnier and another $1.5 million for the lab _ the
only other money raised was $4.5 million from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Sessoms has told CUNY's trustees that he would raise substantial
money privately _ $10 million or more _ from pharmaceutical
companies. But despite repeated assurances that the money was
forthcoming, it has not materialized and trustees and other CUNY
officials have lost confidence that it will.
</P>
<P>
   Sessoms said in an interview on Tuesday that he was still
confident of raising the money by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   It is not entirely clear why, when biological research is
proliferating, Queens College has been unable to raise less than
$10 million in private donations. Some medical researchers in the
government and in the corporate world, who spoke on the condition
that they not be identified, said that pharmaceutical companies
prefer to back active research, and that Montagnier was seen as
someone who is now more active on the lecture circuit than in the
lab. (He was in Japan on Tuesday and not available for an
interview.)
</P>
<P>
   The Bernard and Gloria Salick Center for Molecular and Cellular
Biology was formally established two years ago, when Montagnier
arrived on campus, but in many respects, it is still in a startup
phase. The center is tucked into about 4,000 square feet of
refurbished space on two floors of the college's old science
building, Remsen Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Montagnier, 67, who is paid $158,000 a year plus
$100,000 for housing, automobile expenses and travel, the center
has another senior researcher, Dr. David Cohen, two postdoctoral
fellows and two technical assistants. The total staff budget is
more than $500,000 a year; the Queens College operating budget is
about $70 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who joined the center in April after working as a
researcher at National Institutes of Health for 20 years, was
recently asked by the NIH to conduct a clinical trial on how
quickly a protein works in disarming the body's immune system, a
plum project for the center.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Cannava, the college's spokesman, said he could not say
whether Montagnier had attracted any major research grants since
his arrival, but his name does not appear on a list of research
grants from the NIH, according to a spokesman for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The biology research center was to have been a major coup for
Queens College and for Sessoms, 53, a physicist who has been its
president since 1995. The campus is already one of the more
selective among CUNY's 11 senior colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The idea's architect was Salick, a doctor-turned-entrepreneur
who developed for-profit 24-hour cancer clinics first in California
and now in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Sessoms remains optimistic about the biology
research center, and he said on Tuesday that he hoped to begin
construction soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will persuade people this is very important,'' he
said.

AS YEARS INCREASE, HER MARATHON TIMES GET FASTER
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If there were still an East Germany, 38-year-old
Katrin Dorre-Heinig says she would be a doctor specializing in
cancer research. Instead, in a unified and democratic Germany that
allows her to do what she wants, she has become history's fastest
female marathon runner over age 35 and a favorite in Sunday's New
York City Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   She started running marathons in 1982 and won 10 straight major
marathon races from 1982 to 1986. In all, she has run 42, more than
any other elite female runner, and has won 23. She has run in three
Olympics, finishing third in 1988, fifth in 1992 and fourth in
1996, and she hopes to be on the German team for the 2000 Games in
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In April, in Hamburg, Germany, at age 37, she ran her fastest
marathon _ 2 hours 24 minutes 35 seconds. She has run her last
eight marathons faster than 2:29. As Dorre-Heinig gets older, she
is getting faster, and even her husband and coach, Wolfgang Heinig,
has trouble explaining it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her career has been patterned for endurance,'' he said Tuesday
at a news conference. ``Like a good wine, the older she gets, the
better she gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorre-Heinig was a product of the East German state sports
machine. At 9, she started attending a special sports school as a
hurdler and sprinter, and at 14 she graduated to the 800 and 1,500
meters. After a knee operation in 1982, her speed diminished, so
she was moved up to the marathon. Success brought rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you wanted to buy a car in East Germany,'' she said,
``you had to wait 10 to 13 years. I got mine in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   There were negatives, too, notably a lack of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't able to say I will run this race or that race,'' she
said. ``I had to go to training camp without my husband. It was
difficult until reunification.''
</P>
<P>
   Her only New York City Marathon came in 1990. It was her first
race after the birth of her daughter, Katarina, 14 months earlier,
and she finished third in 2:33:21.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first race in America,'' she said. ``I didn't know
where to eat or where to train. After 10 kilometers, I thought I
could not get to the finish line. It was so difficult for me, and I
said I would not come to New York again.''
</P>
<P>
   When Katarina was born, Dorre-Heinig thought it might mean the
end of her running career. East German officials had little
patience with older runners when there were so many promising young
ones, and they had her channeled for medical school. But when East
Germany and West Germany reunited in 1990, she decided to keep
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to medical school for two years,'' she said, ``but
there was not enough time for family and running and school. I had
to train at 8 o'clock at night. It was too much. So now I have my
family and I am still running. I used to be a government runner.
Now I am a professional.''  &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A blue-ribbon panel has selected 51-year-old Bill Rodgers and
46-year-old Grete Waitz as the outstanding male and female runners
in the 30-year history of the New York City Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers won the race four consecutive years starting in 1976. He
was the first-place choice of six of the 12 voters. The panel,
consisting of sportswriters, television commentators and Allan
Steinfeld, the race director, voted the American Alberto Salazar
second and German Silva of Mexico third. Juma Ikangaa of Tanzania
and Fred Lebow were tied for fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Waitz of Norway, who won the race nine times between 1978 and
1988, was a unanimous choice among the women. Tegla Loroupe of
Kenya was second, Lisa Ondieki of Australia third, Allison Roe of
New Zealand fourth and Nina Kuscsik fifth.
</P>
<P>
   As the greatest moment in the history of the race, the panel
chose the 1992 marathon in which Lebow, the longtime race director
then in remission from the brain cancer that would kill him two
years later, ran his race for the first time. Waitz, who had
retired as an elite runner, ran with him, and they received
tumultuous cheers the entire route.
</P>
<P>
   This year's marathon honors Lebow, who turned a race that was
run entirely in Central Park for 200 runners into a five-borough
extravaganza for 30,000 runners and crowds that exceed one million.
The back of the medal given to each finisher will bear a likeness
of Lebow.  &QL;

<P>
   HONG KONG _ On Aug. 23, 1998, a delegation from the Walt Disney
Co. arrived at the office of Hong Kong's chief executive to pitch
the idea of building a Disneyland here. That summer day, Hong Kong
was far from the happiest place on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Its economy was in the depths of a recession, unemployment was
soaring and financial markets around the world were gripped with
panic. Just a week earlier, the government had spent billions of
dollars to buy shares of companies in its own stock market to fend
off what it called predatory foreign speculators.
</P>
<P>
   A new Disneyland was just the tonic this downtrodden city needed
_ and the team from Disney knew it. What followed was 13 months of
grinding negotiations as Hong Kong struggled to achieve two
seemingly irreconcilable goals: win the Magic Kingdom without
losing its shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Disney and Hong Kong announced their long-awaited plan
to open a theme park here by 2005. The total cost of the park and
related projects is $3.6 billion, of which Disney will contribute
only $316 million. Hong Kong may not have lost its shirt, but
critics say it has given away the sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a substantial upfront cost to the Hong Kong
administration, no question about it,'' said Ian K. Perkin, the
chief economist of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. ``But
in the long run, the fact that we'll be one of five cities in the
world with a Disneyland is a huge positive.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here Tuesday, Hong Kong and Disney talked a
lot about the long run. Hong Kong's leaders said the park would
help it fashion a new identity as a tourist destination in the wake
of its return to Chinese rule in 1997. Disney executives see it as
a powerful launch pad into China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the world's largest market, despite a temporary
financial crisis or a temporary political problem,'' said Judson C.
Green, the chairman of Disney's theme park division. ``We think
it's the right time to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Anson Chan, the chief secretary of Hong Kong, said, ``You cannot
put a price on the message that the Walt Disney Company sends the
world in choosing Hong Kong for its third international theme
park.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind these upbeat comments, however, is the tale of how a
small government made hard choices to win over a big corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong, which desperately sought some good news to offset the
gloom of the Asian economic crisis, squared off against Disney, a
company with a reputation as a fearsome negotiator and a long list
of suitors. Shanghai and several other Chinese cities were also
lobbying for a Disney park.
</P>
<P>
   Making the job even harder for Hong Kong, Disney's chairman,
Michael Eisner, has been in a slump of his own, as he struggles
with slack earnings, difficulties grooming a successor and troubles
at the ABC network. Having purchased big-ticket items like two $350
million cruise ships, the company, analysts said, was under
pressure to keep a lid on spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Eisner has been telling the Street he's going to cut
capital spending,'' said an influential media investor. ``That
makes them an even tougher negotiator.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing Disney across the table was Mike Rowse, Hong Kong's
commissioner of tourism. Rowse, a bluff, 50-year-old Englishman, is
used to tense negotiations. He represented Hong Kong when it was
engaged in talks with Britain over how much it should pay to take
over the British military garrison after the colony returned to
China.
</P>
<P>
   But even Rowse admitted that was poor preparation for Disney.
``It was by far the hardest thing I've ever done,'' he said,
recalling the negotiations, which finally ended at 3 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The company's initial proposal, according to people involved in
the talks, was to build a park on land donated by the government.
Disney would have made no upfront investment in the project, and
its involvement would have been mainly to collect license fees for
the use of its characters.
</P>
<P>
   With property in Hong Kong among the most expensive in the
world, accepting such a proposal would have been politically
untenable for the government. But Disney told Hong Kong it would be
unable to finance the park if it had to pay for the land, people
involved in the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff almost doomed the negotiations. In early June,
however, Hong Kong officials proposed a compromise: the government
would accept shares, rather than cash, for the land. Hong Kong
valued the land at $516 million and agreed to accept subordinate
shares in the joint venture that will build the park.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Hong Kong demanded that Disney also invest in the
joint venture, rather than simply license its characters. Much of
the period from late June until last weekend was consumed by the
negotiations over the respective equity contributions of Disney and
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government thought it was important for us to take a stake
in the project, and we were happy to do so,'' Green said. ``But at
the same time, we felt it was important for the government to play
a role as well.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Disney agreed to invest $316 million for a 43
percent stake in the joint venture. Hong Kong will contribute $419
million for 57 percent. In addition, the government will extend a
$787 million loan and arrange an additional $296 million in
commercial loans. That puts the total cost of the 315-acre park at
$1.8 billion, of which Hong Kong is contributing $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's costs do not end there. It has also agreed to spend
$1.75 billion to construct roads, a rail link, and other services
to connect the park to the rest of Hong Kong. Disneyland will be
built on reclaimed land in Penny's Bay, a secluded cove on Lantau
Island, just west of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Rowse noted that Hong Kong would have had to spend this money to
develop Lantau into a tourism destination, regardless of whether
Disney was the main attraction. But economists are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   As for Disney, the company pointed out that it does not put
money into all its parks. Tokyo Disneyland, for example, was
financed and built entirely by a Japanese developer. Disney
invested $140 million in Disneyland Paris. But the company later
had to spend millions more to rescue that park after it ran into
crippling financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   The checkered history of the Paris park, originally called Euro
Disney, was clearly on the minds of negotiators during the talks.
Green said Disney would build a smaller-than-usual park, with only
2,100 hotel rooms. That would enable it to operate profitably with
only five million visitors a year _ a number that analysts said was
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris operation, by contrast, needs 10 million visitors a
year to fill its hotels and operate profitably. After a strong
first year, it drew well short of that for several years. The park,
after a substantial write-off, is now profitable.
nn
</P>
<P>
   In defending its deal Tuesday, Hong Kong officials said
Disneyland would bring vast benefits to the local economy. They
said it would attract 1.4 million additional visitors a year to the
city in its first year. Hong Kong now has 10 million visitors a
year, though its tourism industry has been lagging.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also claimed that the park would generate 18,400
new jobs, either directly or indirectly, in its first year, and
35,800 in later years. That is an alluring prospect in a city with
an unemployment rate of 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists were also encouraged that the government said it
might sell off part of its investment in a few years, either
through a stock offering or to an investor. Several local
developers, notably Sun Hung Kai Property Ltd., have expressed
interest in the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside is fairly low and the upside is large, in terms
of giving Hong Kong a new arrow in its quiver,'' said David
Dodwell, co-author of a book about the local economy, ``The Hong
Kong Advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the bottom line, though, some local business people say
there was an unseemliness to the way Hong Kong pursued the deal
with Disney. Senior officials publicized the talks as early as last
March, which gave the impression that Hong Kong was hungry for a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely nothing wrong with Disney coming to Hong
Kong as an investor,'' said David Tang, the founder of Shanghai
Tang, an upscale boutique. ``But do they require a subsidy of $2.5
billion?''
</P>
<P>
   Tang also worries that Hong Kong's embrace of Disney could
exclude the development of Chinese attractions in China's newest
city. He seems to be in a minority here, however, in worrying about
the suffocating effect of American popular culture. In a daylong
series of briefings on the project, the question of Disney's impact
on the cultural life of Hong Kong scarcely came up.
</P>
<P>
   Critics were more worried that Disney is not barred from
building another theme park in Asia, perhaps even in China, that
could compete with Hong Kong. Green affirmed that Disney would
continue discussing other projects. But he added that Hong Kong
would be its main focus for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the quibbles, Hong Kong officials were in the mood
to savor their victory Tuesday. Even Tung Chee-hwa, the stolid
former shipping tycoon who is Hong Kong's chief executive, smiled
gamely when Mickey Mouse threw a brightly colored arm around him
during the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Rowse spoke for many in Hong Kong, which was handed over to
China two years ago, when he said: ``We kind of faded out of the
spotlight after 1997, and everybody wrote us off. This project
tells the world that we are alive and kicking.''

   ABBOTT LABORATORIES TO PAY $100 MILLION OVER TEST KITS

<P>
   Abbott Laboratories, the nation's largest maker of medical
diagnostic tests, on Tuesday agreed to pay $100 million to settle
allegations that the company failed to meet federal quality
standards when it made hundreds of varieties of medical test kits.
</P>
<P>

SENATE PANEL APPROVES BILL ON PATENT SYSTEM REVISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Vt., Utah.) (fb) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Legislation that would revamp the U.S. patent
system and bring it closer in line with European and Japanese
practices is moving quickly through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the measure, which overwhelmingly passed the
House in August and unanimously cleared the Senate Judiciary
Committee on Tuesday, would hurt the livelihood of small-scale
inventors, subjecting them to greater risk of theft and litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're ripping up our patent system and giving away our
future,'' said Beverly Selby, executive director of the Alliance
for American Innovation, a coalition of independent inventor groups
and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would establish new protections for inventors,
who are often victims of predatory promoters, and set a guarantee
of 17 years' protection after the Patent and Trademark Office
grants a patent. The current protection is 20 years from when an
application is filed, which can be shorter than 17 years if the
Patent Office takes longer than three years to process the
application.
</P>
<P>
   Critics point to one measure that they say would force some
inventions to be made public before they are fully protected by a
patent. But supporters say the changes will help level the
international playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this will do is improve the operation of the patent
system for American business, and therefore improve American
competition,'' said Michael Kirk, a former deputy commissioner of
the Patent Office who is executive director of the American
Intellectual Property Law Association, an advocacy group whose
members include patent experts at major corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. patent system dates to the Founding Fathers, and
tinkering with the practices that rewards innovation and protects
the exclusive rights to discoveries, has proved emotional and
divisive.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States is out of sync with the rest of the world
when it comes to patents, many business groups contend, and a
growing number of major American corporations, including IBM, Ford
and Xerox, have pressed Congress to overhaul the rules to keep pace
with the fast-changing global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation died in the Senate in 1997 after clearing
the House. But supporters of the measure have brokered new
compromises, including watering down challenges to existing
patents, to win broad bipartisan backing for the legislation this
year.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress in its waning days before its end of the year
recess, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, who heads the Judiciary
Committee, said on Tuesday there is only a ``50-50'' chance the
measure will be enacted this year. The Clinton administration
supports the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a high-tech patent bill that will make us competitive
with the rest of the world,'' Hatch said after his panel approved,
by an 18-0 vote, a bill that he sponsored with Sen. Patrick J.
Leahy, D-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the legislation's provisions are contentious. Under
the House and Senate bills, the American system would track its
Japanese and European counterparts by publishing applications after
18 months, even if a patent had not yet been awarded. Inventors who
sought patents only in the United States could still claim
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk said this provision would end an advantage extended to
foreign companies seeking a patent here. Under the current American
system, applications are not published until and unless a patent is
awarded, which can extend beyond the 18-month period that European
and Japanese systems give confidentiality to American inventors'
applications. The change would also inform potential rivals that
someone had already staked a claim, Kirk said. Critics say this
would gut the confidentiality of an inventor's idea.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also contend that the legislation would allow greater
challenges to Patent Office decisions by third parties, typically
wealthy corporations who could steal a small inventor's idea. Kirk
said this provision was narrowly focused to prevent such abuses.

<P>
   Democrats captured the mayor's offices Tuesday in both
Indianapolis and Columbus, Ohio, two major Midwestern cities that
had been in Republican hands for almost three decades.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gov. Paul Patton of Kentucky, also a Democrat,
was elected to a second term.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic victories came on a day in which off-year
elections were held in dozens of cities and states all around the
country, with party leaders watching carefully for hints, if any,
of things to come in Election 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In Indianapolis, Bart Peterson, a developer, captured most of
that city's growing minority vote to become the first Democratic
mayor in 30 years. He beat Sue Anne Gilroy, a Republican serving
her second term as Indiana's secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   In the Columbus race, the Democratic winner was Michael Coleman,
a city councilman who, when he takes office next year, will be the
city's first black mayor. Coleman defeated Dorothy Teater, a
Republican who has been a county commissioner for the past 15 years
and was trying to become the first woman mayor of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   In elections elsewhere, Mississippians elected a governor,
Virginia and New Jersey got new Legislatures and there were
important mayor's races in Philadelphia, San Francisco and
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, the ballot carried referendums on banning late-term
abortion procedures and legalizing medical uses of marijuana, and
in the San Francisco area there were referendums on banning ATM
fees and slowing growth. Voters in Colorado and Kansas City, Mo.,
voted on referendums to finance urban transit systems and those in
Houston, San Antonio, St. Paul, Minn., and Scottsdale, Ariz., voted
on financing new sports centers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kentucky governor's race, Patton, the first Kentucky
chief executive eligible to seek a successive term in two
centuries, thanks to a recent change in state law, captured about
60 per cent of the vote in easily sweeping past his two leading
challengers, Peppy Martin, a Republican, and Gatewood Galbraith, a
member of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a message in the Patton victory in a state in which
both parties have been competitive in recent years, it was that
taking on an incumbent is almost always an uphill proposition and
taking on an incumbent with a job approval rating close to 65 per
cent is close to impossible, especially for challengers with low
name recognition and fringe issues.
</P>
<P>
   Patton, a moderate, did not bother to start campaigning until
September and did not run his first television commercial until
last week. Mainly, he pitched his record of pushing for jobs,
education reform, government efficiency, better health care and
tougher penalities for lawbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martin, a freelance publicist, was shunned by many prominent
members of her party after she charged, without offering any
evidence, that 80 per cent of Kentucky's sheriffs and 30 percent of
its state police officers were involved in the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith, a lawyer, called for the legalization of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The Indianapolis mayor's race was the most expensive in the
city's history, with more than $5 million spent overall by
Peterson, who pushed downtown development and crime control, and
Ms. Gilroy, who hoped her promise to shrink government would make
her the city's first woman mayor. Peterson won by about 10
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   But equally as important as the money poured into the campaign
was the changing makeup of the city. Many whites, especially
Republicans, have moved to the suburbs in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent mayor, Stephen Goldsmith, a Republican who had
been in office since 1991, chose not to run for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   In the contest in Columbus, where Republicans had held the
mayor's office since 1972, Coleman beat Ms. Teater by almost 10
percentage points after campaigning on a promise to improve city
neighborhoods. Ms. Teater sought to paint Coleman as a city
councilman who had cast votes that wasted city money. The incumbent
mayor, Greg Lashutka, first elected in 1991, chose not to run.

<P>
   Everyone knew it was coming, but now they know when: John F.
Welch Jr., the chairman of General Electric, will retire after the
company's annual meeting in April 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, who announced the date on CNBC on Monday evening, will
turn 65 on Nov. 19, 2000, and had always indicated he would step
down then. But few read much more than symbolism into the later
date. Welch became GE's chief executive in April 1981, so the date
will mark his 20th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack still plans to announce his successor in mid-2000, so
this is business as usual for us,'' said Beth Comstock, a GE
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Welch will be both a difficult and an easy act to
follow. Corporate wags have long referred to GE as ``the House that
Jack built.'' Welch has turned what had been a $25 billion
manufacturing company in 1981 into a $100 billion behemoth that
derives huge portions of its revenues from more profitable
services.
</P>
<P>
   He whittled away at GE's bloated staff long before downsizing
became a buzzword, earning him the rubric of Neutron Jack _ someone
who kills off the people but leaves the physical assets intact.
</P>
<P>
   He divested all businesses in which GE was not dominant _ a
strategy that has been adopted by numerous American companies. He
made attention to quality and customer relations a guiding mantra.
He is pushing all of GE's divisions into e-commerce with such
fervor that many analysts say that GE will soon be the most
Internet-savvy of the non-dot-com companies.
</P>
<P>
   Welch has also turned GE into what he calls a ``boundary-less''
organization, a place where executives are rewarded for sharing
insights and customer contacts and castigated for keeping good
ideas to themselves. Only people whom Welch deemed to be team
players were propelled up the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He turned GE away from the idea of supreme rulers and
introduced it to team structures,'' said Nicholas P. Heymann, an
analyst with Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the next chief will be inheriting a company that has
consistently been one of the most profitable in the country. ``The
businesses have a momentum in market share and profitability that
will persist when Jack is retired,'' said Russell A. Leavitt, an
analyst at Banc of America Securities. ``And Jack will personally
introduce him to the major customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The new chief, who is all but guaranteed to come from inside the
company, can probably count on help from his defeated rivals as
well. When Welch was named chief executive in 1981, most of the
also-rans quit. Stanley C. Gault, for example, left to run
Rubbermaid, while Thomas A. Vander Slice went to the GTE
Corporation. This time, most analysts expect all the contenders to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``These men would rather be part of a team at the country's No.
1 company than No. 1 at some lackluster company,'' Heymann said.
</P>
<P>
   But who, in fact, will be the next No. 1 at GE? Welch has made
it clear in the past that whoever succeeds him will have
demonstrated proficiency in globalization, in moving the revenue
stream from manufacturing to services, and in employing Six Sigma,
a complex system that uses statistical analyses to all but
eliminate defects in products and processes. It is also a good bet
that the new chief will have more than a dollop of Internet
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the long list of must-haves, analysts cite a pretty long
short list. Gary M. Reiner, 45, GE's chief information officer, has
led many of the company's initial forays onto the Web. W. James
McNerney Jr., 50, has had an excellent year with his aircraft
engine division. Robert L. Nardelli, 51, has turned around the
power-systems unit. David L. Calhoun, 42, the new head of GE
Capital, GE's biggest and most profitable unit, is often cited as a
dark horse candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, although no one will say so for the record, the odds-on
favorite is Jeffrey R. Immelt, head of GE Medical Systems. Welch
has often said he thinks chief executives should stay for 10, even
20 years, to live with the results of their long-term decisions. At
43, Immelt could conceivably serve as long as Welch has.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first GE executive to use Six Sigma not only to
refine processes but to design a product. He has expanded the
profitable medical division's presence worldwide. He has used the
Web to sell services as well as products. Analysts say he is an
inspirational leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the other guys think it would be the end of the world
to work for Jeff,'' said one analyst who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's reaction is hard to discern. Shares of GE have
ridden a roller coaster over the last week. They hit an all-time
high of $135.50 on Friday, only to plunge $6.125 on Monday in what
analysts interpreted as a move by jittery investors to take
profits. GE fell 93.75 cents Tuesday, to $128.4375.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this market, there's a tendency for things to bounce,'' one
analyst said.  &QL;

CLERGYMAN BEGINS CAMPAIGN TO PROMOTE CORPORATE COMPASSION
WORLDWIDE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Rev. Leon Sullivan, the Baptist minister
who drew up the so-called Sullivan principles to hold U.S.
companies in South Africa accountable during apartheid times,
announced Tuesday that he is taking his gospel of compassionate
corporate responsibility worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human rights and social and political justice in communities
and nations of the world will not be possible in the future without
the global efforts of companies,'' Sullivan said to an audience at
U.N. headquarters that included executives from corporate giants
like General Motors, Chevron, Sunoco and Colgate Palmolive.
</P>
<P>
   The global Sullivan principles, as their author describes them,
promote ``equal opportunity for employees of all ages, races,
ethnic backgrounds and religions. They call for adequate
compensation, fair competition, safe and healthy workplaces, and
freedom of association. And they condemn exploitation of children,
abuse of women, physical punishment and involuntary servitude.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan expressed belief that the principles would in time
guide hundreds of thousands of companies ``from China to Cairo, to
Bogota to California.''
</P>
<P>
   He drafted his code of conduct for U.S. companies in South
Africa in 1977 in an attempt to end workplace discrimination
against blacks there. In 1987, Sullivan urged American business to
disinvest and leave.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-general Kofi Annan, who joined Tuesday's meeting,
said that putting Sullivan's principles into practice around the
world would be ``a big step'' toward carrying out the values in the
U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview later, Sullivan, 77, described the start of his
campaign Tuesday as ``a millennium event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will spread in the next year to thousands and tens of
thousands of companies,'' he said. ``Companies of the world, spread
your wings.''

CIA'S GAFFE A MALE FAILING?

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the unwritten rules for Cabinet members
testifying in Congress is not to be too candid about how your
colleagues stumbled into really big mistakes. Apparently, no one
conveyed that to the U.S. trade representative, Charlene
Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday,
Barshefsky was questioned by Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who
heads the committee, on the delicate question of why negotiations
have dragged on and on with China over its entry into the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky paused for a moment, and then said, ``What happened,
as I said to my staff, is that men never ask for directions, and we
mistakenly bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.'' That,
Barshefsky said, ``really chilled relations for almost five
months.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the White House would argue with Barshefsky. But in
public the White House has gone to some lengths not to blame the
people who refused to ask for directions _ most of whom work at the
CIA, which identified the target as a Serbian site.

SETTING THE RE CORD STRAIGHT ON MCCAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   We seem to have kicked up a bit of a dust storm with our
editorial on Sunday titled ``McCain's temper is legitimate issue:
Hull's account of outbursts not unusual.'' It's been the topic of
national television and print news accounts for several days now.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the networks' new focus on what most Arizonans
consider to be an old issue has been riddled with inaccuracies and
misinformation. Let's set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his band of backers have sought to spin this
editorial as evidence of a ``grudge match'' this paper has with the
senator. Several in the national media have jumped on board,
portraying the editorial as part of a ``vendetta'' against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Vendetta?
</P>
<P>
   McCain has run for office five times since he moved to Arizona.
This newspaper has endorsed his candidacy all five times, most
recently just a year ago, shortly after I became editor of these
pages. McCain sat down with editorial board members and his
Democratic opponent for nearly two hours to discuss key issues in
the race and our questions about the candidates' positions on them.
At the conclusion of the meeting, McCain thanked us for the
``fairness'' we accorded him. Two of his staffers later caught up
to me to convey precisely the same message.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we've applauded McCain on these pages many times over
the years, including just last week for his role in seeking an
amendment to legislation having to do with quiet aircraft over the
Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   We supported McCain's efforts to open several major airports to
certain long-distance flights and to deregulate certain aspects of
the telecommunications industry. We've backed McCain's bold and
dignified leadership on re-establishing relations with Vietnam,
made all the more poignant by McCain's personal experiences as a
prisoner of war. We've commended his strong and knowledgeable
leadership on many national defense issues, most recently during
the Kosovo upheaval. We've lauded McCain's stances against
congressional pork and embraced portions of his call for campaign
reform.
</P>
<P>
   This newspaper published an exceptionally evenhanded 16-page
special section on McCain just last month titled ``The Life Story
of Arizona's Maverick Senator'' that provoked not a peep of peeve
from the McCain camp. Heck, we even sported a front-page feature
last June on McCain's spunky mom _ a piece McCain critics blasted
as a puffery designed to promote the candidacy of the hometown
candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   Vendetta? Right, and the Grand Canyon is in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we've also been critical of McCain. We criticized his role
in the Keating Five scandal, in which McCain was cited by the
Senate Ethics Committee for exercising ``poor judgment.'' And we
chastised his handling of the announcement of his wife's drug
addiction _ a problem that McCain acknowledged he didn't know about
until after Cindy McCain kicked the habit. (Cindy McCain's
admission that she stole painkillers from her own charity to
support her habit was the subject of a hard-hitting but hardly
unfair cartoon on these pages, so enraging McCain that it was years
before he returned phone calls from ``Republic'' staffers.) We've
banged on him more recently for a tasteless joke about Chelsea
Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we've been critical of McCain's volatility and his public
belittling of people with whom he disagrees _ whether they are
former Gov. Rose Mofford at a hearing in Washington, the Jewish man
he lambasted for objecting to McCain's speech referring to
``Christian'' compassion for the homeless, or a public reference to
the Leisure World retirement community as ``Seizure World.'' If
McCain comes unglued over this sort of local scrutiny, what can we
expect once the national scrutiny kicks in?
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his backers also have sought to paint Sunday's
editorial as part of an orchestrated campaign by Texas Gov. George
W. Bush to undermine McCain's campaign for president. Again,
patently untrue. Here are the facts:
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the ``New York Times'' published a front-page story
about McCain's testy relations with Arizona Gov. Jane Hull, the
state's other top Republican officeholder, who described McCain's
difficulty in controlling his temper. It was followed by a critical
column by a member of the ``Wall Street Journa''l's editorial
board. In those pieces, McCain pleaded guilty to passion but
insisted he doesn't ``insult anybody or fly off the handle or
anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a debate about the virtues of passion. There are
many. This was an editorial correcting a statement McCain made
about his own conduct in those national pieces, a statement that
many in Arizona who have worked with him over the past 17 years
know to be simply untrue. We at ``The Republic'' may be
old-fashioned, but we believe that, as the major newspaper that
probably knows McCain best, we have an obligation to set the record
straight and provide as full and complete a picture of John McCain
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is McCain has ``insulted'' people and ``flown off the
handle.''
</P>
<P>
   To portray responsible journalism as puppetry to a rival
candidate is yet another example of the unfounded, sarcastic and
condescending charges to which McCain, unfortunately, is prone.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. McCain is alleging that the ``New York Times''
news pages, the ``Wall Street Journa''l's editorial pages (we all
know how close those two are), ``The Arizona Republic,'' Gov. Hull
and just about anybody else who criticizes him all take their
marching orders from the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   That's absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the national discussion of all this so far has been
exceedingly disappointing. It's been characterized by half-truths
and untruths.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about passion, vendettas or candidate manipulation.
It's about character _ the issue around which McCain himself has
wrapped his campaign. It shouldn't come as a surprise that there
are more faces to McCain's character than the simplistic one he and
his backers are working so hard to put forward. &QL;

REVLON REPLACES CEO WITH NUGENT OF NEUTROGENA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Financially troubled Revlon Inc. said Tuesday that it
was replacing its president and chief executive, effective Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of George Fellows, and the appointment of a
manager from a key competitor, comes as Revlon management has been
sagging under the weight of $1.6 billion in debt, a glut of
inventory as drugstore chains have reduced orders and weakness in
key international markets like Russia and Latin America. Large
rivals have also introduced new lines this year that threaten the
cosmetic giant's position in the mass market makeup business.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that stopped just short of saying it needed
leadership with new vision and skills, the maker of Revlon, Ultima
II and Almay blush, lipstick and eye shadow said that it had hired
Jeffrey Nugent, formerly worldwide president of Johnson &AMP; Johnson's
Neutrogena unit to replace Fellows.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment is significant not only because Nugent comes
with strong operations skills, but also because Revlon snagged a
top executive from one of its strongest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Procter &AMP; Gamble with its new Oil of Olay
cosmetics line, and Neutrogena, which extended its well-known name
beyond skin care products to cosmetics, have been chipping away at
Revlon's market share. The brands are sold on the same store
shelves as Revlon's Almay line.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Revlon is counting on Nugent to put out is various fires
while lighting a new competitive spark at the company. ``His
expertise in product development, domestic and international
marketing and the running of cost-efficient operations will be
critical in helping Revlon build for the future,'' said Ronald O.
Perelman, Revlon's chairman. Nugent, he said, will ``vigorously
address all the challenges and opportunities facing this company.''
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman said Nugent and Fellows declined to comment
beyond the company's written statement.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, Nugent, 53, said his priorities would be to
control costs and increase margins.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that even with that skill set, though, Nugent
faces a formidable challenge in turning Revlon around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is going to have to roll up his sleeves,'' said William
Steele, a managing director of Banc of America Securities. ``This
is not going to be a situation that is fixed overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Revlon was in need of a leader who could get a tighter
grip on the internal operations of the business, Steel said. ``I'm
cautiously optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors, weary of Revlon's earnings disappointments, were even
less enthusiastic. The stock barely budged, closing at $10.625, up
25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are still reeling from Revlon's announcement last
month that because of its competitive pressures, international
weakness and inventory problems, the company expects to report an
operating loss for the year, before charges, of $70 million to $80
million.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the time, Revlon, which had been looking for a buyer for
the business, failed to find a taker for the entire company and
instead would seek to sell two units. If a deal for those
divisions, Revlon's Latin America brands and salon-style hair care
products, is consummated, the company said it expects to generate
at least $500 million for the sales and use the proceeds to reduce
debt. Revlon said it expects to compete a sale by March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that shedding some of the debt would certainly be
a major improvement, and added that better management was a step in
the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a serious loss of credibility over the past
year,'' said Al Alaimo, a fixed-income analyst at Banc of America.
``Unfortunately the company needed a change at the top.'' &QL;

NEW AIR-BAG RULES WOULD AGAIN REQUIRE CRASH TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Federal safety regulators said Tuesday that automakers
should be required to install frontal air bags that deploy fast
enough to protect adult men who are not wearing their seat belts,
and they proposed stringent rules that would take effect in the
2003 model year.
</P>
<P>
   The rules would require automakers to resume crashing
automobiles into walls to test on dummies whether the bags inflate
fast enough to protect an unbelted man of average height and
weight. Since the 1998 model year, regulators have allowed
automakers to use a much gentler test using sleds mounted on rails,
in response to worries that earlier air bags deployed so quickly
that they could strike and kill any children in the front seats as
well as very short adults who sit close to the steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's proposal by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration did not satisfy manufacturers or safety groups.
Manufacturers warned that to pass tests that involve crashing
automobiles into walls, they might need to make the air bags so
powerful that they would again pose dangers to children and very
short adults. Regulators said this problem could be avoided through
recent technological developments, including the use of sensors
designed to slow or halt air bags' deployment when children or
short adults are in the front seats.
</P>
<P>
   Safety activists complained because the NHTSA indicated it might
resume the crash tests into walls at speeds as slow as 25 mph
instead of the tests at 30 mpt done until 1997. Though the agency
said it had not decided what the new speed should be, a speed
slower than 30 mph would allow manufacturers to retain somewhat
less powerful air bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``This change could reduce the effectiveness of air bags in the
worst crashes, particularly for people not wearing belts, such as
many teenagers,'' said Joan Claybrook, who was the head of the
federal safety agency during the Carter administration and is now
the president of Public Citizen, the advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, regulators have allowed automakers to
meet air bag safety standards by putting dummies and air bags on
sleds that are mounted on rails. The sleds are accelerated to 30
miles per hour on the rails and then stopped abruptly using brakes,
with the dummy flying forward into the air bag. The sled does not
actually hit anything.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of this relatively gentle test has allowed
manufacturers to install less-powerful air bags since the 1998
model year, reducing the danger to very short adults and children.
Manufacturers also like the test because it is much cheaper than
crashing expensive automobiles into walls. But safety activists
have contended that the less-powerful air bags may provide less
protection for larger, heavier motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules proposed Tuesday, the sled test will no longer
be allowed beginning in the 2003 model year. The agency sought
public comment by the end of the year on the proposal, which is
then slated to take effect March 1. The proposal represents a
refinement of a broad proposal in September 1998 to revise air bag
regulation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The regulations proposed Tuesday cover only frontal air bags,
which are typically in the steering wheel and in the dashboard, on
the passenger side. The rules do not cover the increasingly popular
side air bags, which are usually installed in the outer sides of
the front seats or above a car's doors and are designed to protect
occupants whose vehicles are hit from the side.
</P>
<P>
   Air bags saved the lives of more than 4,700 people through Oct.
1, but they also killed 146 people, according to regulators. The
dead included 84 children who had been riding in the front seats as
well as 62 adults, mainly short women drivers who sat very close to
the steering wheel and did not wear seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers are 31 percent less likely to die in a crash and
front-seat passengers are 27 percent less likely to die if their
cars have air bags, the agency said. Rae Tyson, an agency
spokesman, said that regardless of what regulators end up doing,
``People need to continue wearing seat belts and need to continue
putting children in rear seats.''

NEWBRIDGE SHARES LOSE 25 PERCENT AFTER ANOTHER EARNINGS WARNING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Shares of the Newbridge Networks Corp. fell 25 percent
Tuesday after the Canadian maker of communications switches warned
of unexpectedly weak fiscal second-quarter results, mainly because
of sluggish sales in the United States. Hoping to regain momentum
and investor confidence, the company replaced its president.
</P>
<P>
   Newbridge, which is based in Kanata, Ontario, near Ottawa, said
profit for the quarter ending on Oct. 31 would be 8 to 10 cents a
share, roughly half the 19 cents a share many securities analysts
had forecast. It was the seventh time in the last 11 quarters that
Newbridge had warned of disappointing earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, Newbridge's chairman,
Terence H. Matthews, indicated that profit for the next two
quarters might fall short of forecasts as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the recent three months are expected to total $480
million, down from $495 million in the first quarter, but higher
than a year earlier. Profit in the comparative quarters, though,
was 18 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Alan G. Lutz, who had been brought in with much fanfare from
Compaq only 16 months ago to be president and chief operating
officer, left the company, replaced by Pearse Flynn, who came from
Compaq in January. Flynn has been running Newbridge's successful
European unit, which increased second-quarter sales by 40 percent
while sales in the United States were flat.
</P>
<P>
   Newbridge's previous profit warnings have mainly reflected
unexpectedly rapid declines in the sales of outdated switches or a
failure to make deliveries of promising new equipment. This time,
though, ``it's not an operational problem,'' Flynn said. ``It's a
sales problem that we have got to address, and we will do it
rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   As analysts began lowering their profit estimates for this year
and next, Newbridge shares tumbled $5.25 Tuesday, to close at
$15.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. Some analysts have cut their
profit forecasts for the year ending in April to about 75 cents a
share from 90 cents, and for the next fiscal year to figures as low
as $1 from $1.30.
</P>
<P>
   Robert MacLellan, an analyst at CT Securities in Toronto, said
Newbridge's latest warning was significantly different from
previous ones because it admitted that sales of asynchronous
transfer mode switches _ ATM in industry shorthand _ which are
considered the key to its growth, had stalled in the United States.
``I couldn't think of a worse possible scenario,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Urlocker of Scotia Capital Markets said this technology
would continue to lose ground to the Internet protocol alternatives
sold by such companies as Cisco Systems.

PROSECUTORS SAY COLONEL'S WIFE SENT HEROIN FROM COLOMBIA 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An American army colonel's wife who was charged with
mailing illegal drugs from the U.S. Embassy in Colombia to New York
City smuggled heroin, and not, as originally thought, cocaine,
according to federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Laurie Ann Hiett, is at the center of a highly
sensitive case during efforts by the United States and Colombia to
combat drug trafficking from that country. She was charged in
August with mailing six packages from the embassy earlier this year
that federal authorities at first said contained a total of nearly
16 pounds of pure cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hiett, who admitted sending the packages but insisted that
she did not know their contents, is the wife of Col. James C.
Hiett, who at the time was in charge of U.S. military operations in
Colombia. The colonel has left that post because of the accusations
against his wife, but army investigators have said they found no
evidence that he was involved in the alleged drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter that a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn sent recently
to Mrs. Hiett's lawyer and that became public Tuesday, the
government said that while initial field tests showed that the drug
in two of the packages was cocaine, more thorough laboratory tests
showed it was heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Those two packages were the only ones of the six that law
enforcement agents intercepted, but the U.S. attorney's office in
Brooklyn, which is prosecuting the case, has charged that all six
packages contained the same drug.
</P>
<P>
   If the content of the packages, which Mrs. Hiett is accused of
mailing to co-conspirators in New York, was heroin, Mrs. Hiett
would face a somewhat longer prison term if tried and convicted _
as much as 12 to 15 years _ than the 10 to 12 for cocaine
trafficking. That is because the value of heroin is considerably
higher than that of cocaine, and the value is one factor in
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the drugs were sent, according to the original
prosecution papers in the case, the total quantity of what was then
deemed cocaine had a wholesale value of about $180,000. The
wholesale value of heroin is about five times as much, experts said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hiett's lawyer, Paul D. Lazarus, of Miami, said Tuesday
that the discovery that the drug was heroin rather than cocaine did
not affect his client's position of not knowingly sending drugs.
Investigators say that Mrs. Hiett, 36, told them she had been
unaware of the true contents of the packages, which she said she
had mailed at the behest of her husband's chauffeur, Jorge Alfonso
Ayala, a Colombian national. He has also been charged in the case
and is a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Lazarus dated Oct. 21, Lee G. Dunst, an assistant
U.S. attorney in Brooklyn who is prosecuting the case, said the
fact that the contents were heroin rather than cocaine did not
affect the pending federal charges because the laws ``only require
that a defendant be aware that she possesses some controlled
substance and that she need not know the exact nature.''

 Cliffs Notes Now Available to Help Dummies Everywhere  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
IDG Books Worldwide, the Foster City company that publishes the
``Dummies'' guides to everything from computers to sex, has
overhauled the venerable Cliffs Notes line and introduced a series
of business and technology titles for people too busy to read even
a dumbed-down how-to manual.
<P>
   Is IDG cornering the market on stupid?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not stupid,'' responded John Kilcullen, the company's chairman
and chief executive. ``Our customers include CEOs, bankers, people
backed by venture capitalists. Are they stupid? No. They're just
pressed for time. They're feeling left out.''
</P>
<P>
   IDG purchased Cliffs Notes in December for about $17 million.
Kilcullen said he knew from the start that the line of book
summaries, which have rescued more than a few students from
term-paper hell, could be expanded to capitalize on growing demand
for information shortcuts.
</P>
<P>
   IDG has since come up with 16 new Cliffs Notes titles ranging
from ``Getting Out of Debt'' and ``Understanding Health Insurance''
to ``Going Online with AOL.''
</P>
<P>
   Each 128-page book sells for $8.99 and features the familiar
yellow-and-black stripes that have been a hallmark of the series
since its introduction in 1958. Cliffs Notes were the brainchild of
a Nebraska book salesman named Clifton Hillegass.
</P>
<P>
   For Kilcullen, it's all about brand. Get him started about how
Cliffs Notes fits in with the ``Dummies'' guides and other IDG
properties, and he'll go on at length about ``brand building'' and
how ``branding is about understanding the psychographics of
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   What that apparently means is that Cliffs Notes is an excellent
way of promoting the ``Dummies'' franchise to on-the-go readers who
may not have the inclination to dip into more extensive tomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cliffs Notes was on my hit list 10 years ago as a brand that
could be a perfect fit for the information technology space,''
Kilcullen said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, is convinced that what the world needs is
yet another line of books for readers with microscopic attention
spans.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are nothing more than the how-to books of years gone
by,'' said Jason Klein, a publishing-industry analyst with
Blackford Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Dummies' guides are essentially shortcuts to other
guides,'' he observed. ``With Cliffs Notes, it seems like they're
getting one more step removed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cliffs Notes on AOL is a good case in point. It is written
by Jennifer Kaufeld, who co-authored ``America Online for
Dummies,'' and contains much of the same information as the
``Dummies'' book, albeit in more concise form.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it is a shortcut to a shortcut to an online
service that prides itself on being easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this formula has served IDG Books poorly. &UR;  &LR; Last week,
the company reported record quarterly revenue of $56.3 million, up
59 percent from a year before. Its net income was $2.4 million, an
increase of 73 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Other IDG technology series include the ``Secrets'' and ``3-D
Visual'' books.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Dummies'' titles account for the bulk lion's share &LR; 
 &LR; of the company's earnings _ about 50 percent of total sales in the
most recent fiscal year. There are now more than 75 million
``Dummies'' books in print, translated into 31 languages.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Dummies'' will remain IDG's anchor, Kilcullen hopes to
build on the Cliffs Notes acquisition by adding titles on topics
such as upgrading one's computer and bidding for goodies on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   He is also pumping more resources into the Cliffs Notes Web
site, where last-minute scholars can now download crib sheets for
the likes of ``Beowulf'' and ``Middlemarch.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, IDG said last month that it has teamed with Ask
Jeeves, a popular online search service, to provide answers to tech
questions via a new Dummies Help Desk.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only thing that could hinder the company's success
would be _ God forbid _ people growing tired of so-called moron
manuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could very well be a fad,'' said Gred Wiegand, associate
publisher of Que, the division of MacMillan U.S.A. that serves up
the ``Complete Idiot's Guide'' series of books. ``I hope not.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Kilcullen is banking on there always being dummies
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's a dummy at something,'' he said. ``We're part of
the solution, not part of the problem.''

 Barnes &AMP; Noble Buys Interest in Online Publisher  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Hoping to rewrite the way books are published, Barnes &AMP; Noble
Inc., the nation's largest book retailer, yesterday bought a 49
percent stake in Internet self-publishing company iUniverse.com
Inc. of Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will expand iUniverse's ability to publish the works of
thousands of wannabe authors who can't get in the doors of the
major commercial publishing houses. IUniverse iUniverse  &LR; also
provides on-demand reprints of previously published tomes that are
out of print.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the saddest secrets in book publishing is that so many
worthwhile books fall through the cracks,'' said Steve Riggio,
Barnes &AMP; Noble vice chairman. ``IUniverse iUniverse  &LR; is really
going to break the market wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Tam, iUniverse founder and chief executive, hopes to tap
a ``pent-up demand'' from an estimated 23 million people in the
United States who are involved in some form of creative writing but
can't get published. He said of some 98,000 books submitted to
standard publishers each year, 98 percent are rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Barnes &AMP; Noble, we are poised to take advantage of that
untapped market,'' Tam said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble, which operates 969 bookstores under the names
Barnes &AMP; Noble and B. Dalton, bought the stake in iUniverse for an
undisclosed amount.
</P>
<P>
   The deal moves Barnes &AMP; Noble into the realm of ``on-demand
books,'' an emerging trend in the publishing industry that uses
computers to quickly and cheaply print paperbacks when they are
ordered by a customer.
</P>
<P>
   IUniverse launched October 18 as a successor to a year-old
on-demand book publishing company in Campbell called toExcel cq &LR; ,
which concentrated on out-of-print books. IUniverse uses its Web
site at www.iuniverse.com to promote titles, take readers' orders
and accept writers' submissions.
</P>
<P>
   Tam said with iUniverse, new and previously published writers
pay as little as $99 to have their manuscripts printed and
distributed in about 30 days. The company also sells cover design
and marketing services to the authors, who get to keep 20 to 50
percent of the royalties from book sales.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble agreed to set up in-store displays touting
iUniverse books starting November 22 at its Barnes &AMP; Noble stores.
Although its online site, www.barnesandnoble.com, will feature
iUniverse books, there's no guarantee that the books will get space
on Barnes &AMP; Noble retail shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The Barnes &AMP; Noble-iUniverse tandem joins eMatter, a
self-publishing portal also launched October 18 by online
bookseller Fatbrain.com Inc. of Santa Clara. Like iUniverse,
eMatter splits royalties with the authors.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying idea for both is similar, giving writers a
publishing venue they wouldn't normally have. For example, eMatter,
which is trying to lure writers of short stories, white papers and
speeches, yesterday featured a story called ``The Day All the
Toilets in the World Got Clogged,'' by a Topeka, Kan., cab driver.
</P>
<P>
   Tam maintains that some authors are rejected not because their
work isn't good, but because they write about subjects that won't
sell enough books to make a profit. While a publishing house wants
to sell thousands of copies of a title, Tam said books on demand
can make a profit on just 100 books sold.
</P>
<P>
   But book publishing experts say there's a reason so many book
ideas are rejected: Many just aren't any good.
</P>
<P>
   Jean V. Naggar, a veteran New York literary agent, said she
receives about 6,000 book inquiries each year but only finds two or
three worthy of publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a literary agent, everybody I meet believes they have a
book in them, if only someone would just help them make it
happen,'' said Naggar, who represents writers like thriller author
Phillip Margolin. ``The truth is, not everybody has a valid book in
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Bayse Sander, a publishing industry consultant and
author of the ``Complete Idiot's Guide to Getting Published,'' said
serious authors will find a way to get commercially published,
while writers who just want to print up a few copies for themselves
can still do it more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   The iUniverse offer ``is just a high-tech version of vanity
publishing,'' she said. ``There are less-expensive ways to do it.''

 _ SF CHRON   Benefit Plan Can Cut Taxes Out 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I have heard there is a self-directed defined-benefit plan that
will let me put up to 100 percent of my annual earnings in the
plan, thus having NO tax liability for 1999. (I would pay living
expenses from my savings accounts.) Do you know of such a plan, or
am I just dreaming?
<P>
   &QL; 
A: It turns out, there is a way to shelter your entire income in
certain circumstances. But it is not through a self-directed plan.
A defined-benefit plan cannot be self-directed since the employer
has the responsibility for the performance of the plan, says
Barbara King, a CPA with Blanding, Boyer &AMP; Rockwell in Walnut
Creek.
</P>
<P>
   In basic terms, a defined-benefit plan is designed to pay out a
specific amount at retirement to each of its participants. The
amount of the current contribution is calculated by the pension
administrator, based on the number of years to retirement, the life
expectancy of the participant (taken from actuarial tables), the
current investment rate of return and the amount to be received at
retirement. The amount that has to go into the plan in a current
year could equal 100 percent of earnings, particularly if it is a
new plan and retirement is close at hand.
</P>
<P>
   As a simplified example, let's assume you are 58 years old, plan
to retire at 65 with $80,000 per year, your pension plan has a
current (and future expected) rate of return of 8 percent and your
life expectancy is to age 85. King says you would need to
contribute between $85,000 and $90,000 per year for the next seven
years to accumulate enough funds to pay out $80,000 per year for
your remaining 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Pension plans are an extremely complex area of the labor and tax
laws, so you should be sure to consult a qualified pension plan
professional to help you determine the most suitable plan for your
situation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Tips for Self-Employed
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have some follow-up questions to your column last week on
reducing the tax bite: As a self-employed individual (consultant)
with no employees, which retirement plan would be most beneficial?
Which organizations should I approach to set up a plan and what are
the typical costs? And if a percentage or maximum annual amount
applies, is one ``locked in'' to this in future years?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: The most tax-effective and simplest plan to administer is the
Simplified Employee Pension (SEP), according to Chris Yahng, a
partner of Benson &AMP; Yahng, CPAs in Oakland. Under this plan, you
have until the filing date of your return (including extensions) to
establish the plan and make the contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, for 1999, you have until October 15, 2000, to
establish and fund the plan. With these plans, you can contribute
up to 13.0435 percent of your self-employment earnings, with a
maximum annual contribution of $24,000. There are other plans where
you may contribute up to $30,000, but they require more
documentation and administration.
</P>
<P>
   To set up an a  &LR; SEP, you need to complete Form 5305-SEP and keep
it on file in your office. (This form is not filed with the
Internal Revenue Service but is for internal purposes only.) The
simple form is available from the IRS and most brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   An SEP account is like an individual retirement account and any
brokerage firm will establish it for you. There is normally no
setup charge, and the annual fee, if any, is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   You can change the amount you want to contribute each year so
long as the total annual amount does not exceed the amount
permitted by the IRS.

FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO THE OFFICE, A PASSION FOR COMMUNITY

<P>
   I spent seven years as an outdoor leadership instructor,
starting at age 19. I took people through storms, over passes, up
technical rock climbs. I once climbed 70 feet with no rope
protection to get a rappel rope that was snagged on a little piece
of rock. In Yellowstone, I rescued two people with frostbite; I had
to get them out before their feet thawed, because when that happens
you're in screaming pain.
</P>
<P>
   I was responsible for the group's safety, but also for their
thriving as a community. A lot of my passion for community came
from seeing these strangers come together, help transform one
another, then part. I carried this idea forward to iVillage.com.
It's the real issues that make it happen. Thousands of things in a
person's life go right to the bone: Your child has an illness, you
hate your job, you have breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it's not your friends who can help you, but others
who have been through the same experience. When I adopted my second
daughter, my friends didn't think it was a good idea. I'm single,
and very busy. I found people through iVillage.com who'd had the
experience. They became my natural community.
</P>
<P>
   In the mountains, your job as an instructor is to get people out
of their own way. The mountains are just there. If you have a
problem, it's yours. You learn to look at yourself. As a manager, I
try to figure out what people's dreams are. In most cases, the only
thing holding them back is themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When people are in the wrong culture, they lose 50 percent of
their creativity right off the bat. When I was at American Express,
it was very formal. But I'm not formal. So a lot of my energy went
into trying to behave like a formal person. Getting my MBA at
Harvard was also an eye-opener. There was a small contingent who
were ambitious in a linear way, hell-bent on making it. We had a
lot of foreign students, very smart, who were not fluent in
English. I suggested we help them by forming study groups for them,
and this small contingent of people refused, because they were
being graded on a curve. That's when I knew what people were
capable of on the downside, and it toughened me up.
</P>
<P>
   In an Internet company, you need talent faster than you can hire
it. You have to take whoever is in the company and move them at the
speed of light in terms of their abilities. You have to compress 10
years of learning and making mistakes into two. I call it radical
mentoring.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tough-minded and demanding, and sometimes the press has
misinterpreted that. I demand people look at themselves clearly,
know their strengths and weaknesses. Eventually, if I'm lucky
enough to live to 100, I want to work with kids, maybe run a
school. And I want six kids of my own, because I've always longed
for a big Irish family where the party is always at my house. I
guess that comes from my time in the mountains, when I was always
in a big group. I like being part of a tribe.

EDITORIAL: IN SEARCH OF A CHINESE TRADE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 3:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's new efforts to salvage a trade deal with
China enabling it to join the World Trade Organization come as
welcome news. The initiative, begun with a phone call last month
from Clinton to President Jiang Zemin, seeks to repair what
administration officials now concede was a policy blunder in April
when Washington rejected market-opening terms offered by Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji on his visit to the United States. Worse yet,
publication of the Chinese terms by the administration triggered
opposition by opponents of Zhu's reforms inside China, making any
deal more difficult to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton wins terms this time around as favorable as those he
rejected in April, he will have performed a remarkable feat of
recovery. More likely, China will offer less, and the
administration will have to accept it as the price of getting a
deal. It may then be difficult to sell the arrangement to Congress,
where skepticism of Chinese intentions is running high just as the
presidential campaign has begun heating up.
</P>
<P>
   The April deal, according to the administration's own summary,
would have propelled Chinese economic institutions toward market
discipline. Zhu agreed to cut tariffs below those of most American
trade partners, eliminate export subsidies, permit foreign
investors to buy substantial shares in insurance and
telecommunications companies, protect foreign investors and
intellectual property rights and commit state-owned enterprises to
make purchases on the basis of price and quality, thereby
eliminating discrimination against foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   These terms were seen as concessions to the West. In fact, they
would benefit the Chinese economy over all, though some parts of
that economy might suffer. The U.S. economy is already open to
Chinese products, and consumers reap the benefits of unfettered
trade. But China's borders are often closed. Opening them would
bring Chinese consumers attractive imports and force domestic
companies to compete with foreign ones.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the narrow impact of trade, China's admission to the
WTO could have dramatic political impact. Zhu, like economic
reformers throughout the Third World, wants to use commitments to
the WTO to make it hard for domestic opponents to overturn reforms.
Violations of China's commitments to the WTO invite retaliation by
China's trade partners.
</P>
<P>
   The administration faces an obstacle to reaching a deal because
of congressional opposition and anxiety about foreign competition
in the labor movement. Congress can scuttle the deal by refusing to
relinquish its right under current U.S. laws to deny China trading
rights that it would automatically enjoy as a member of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   The most vigorous opponents of China in Congress represent
Southern textile and apparel industries that fear cheap imports.
But recent studies show that these fears are exaggerated. Chinese
exports to the United States would rise by a modest amount. But
almost all would come at the expense of exports from other Third
World countries rather than from American manufacturers and
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton must also deal with a Chinese demand that the United
States promise not to invoke ``anti-dumping'' rules to drive out
low-priced Chinese exports. If China won this demand, it might
cause distress among a small number of American workers but would
do low-income American consumers an enormous favor.
</P>
<P>
   The administration faces the challenge not only of reaching a
good deal with China but of then selling it to Congress and to
anxious workers.

ENGINE THRUST REVERSER PROBLEM REPORTED ON EGYPTAIR JETLINER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC BERGER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ EgyptAir Flight 990 had an ``outstanding
maintenance issue,'' an inoperative reverse thruster on one of the
aircraft's two engines, investigators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The same engine component was responsible for the 1991 crash of
another Boeing 767, but federal investigators could not say Tuesday
whether the problem contributed to the EgyptAir crash.
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules allow 767s to fly even if the component is out of
service. Thrust reversers are deployed to slow planes after they
land.
</P>
<P>
   On May 26, 1991, a Lauda Boeing 767 was climbing after takeoff
from Bangkok. At 10,000 feet a warning light showed a problem with
an engine thrust reverser. Minutes later an engine reverser
activated, sending the plane into an uncontrollable plunge.
</P>
<P>
   The EgyptAir crew member reported the reverse thruster problem
before the plane took off from Los Angeles bound for New York on
Saturday, said Jim Hall, head of the National Transportation Safety
Board, at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The new information only added to the puzzle of what caused
Flight 990 to plunge into the sea 62 miles off Nantucket Sunday
after leaving John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York for
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather Tuesday interrupted an intense surface search of a
40-square-mile area for debris and bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy said weather conditions would likely preclude further
underwater search operations until at least Saturday, as a storm
had moved into the area.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being hampered by high seas, searchers were able to
locate the acoustic signals that should lead them to the aircraft's
data and voice recorders.
</P>
<P>
   The pings were coming from an area about one-half mile west of
where new radar data shows the plane struck the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   On shore, families of the 217 passengers and crew lost in the
crash began arriving, only to be told by officials that the force
of the crash meant few bodies would be recovered intact. One man
was hospitalized after a panic attack, and several women fainted
when they were told the grim news at a local hotel.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 family members arrived Tuesday afternoon in
Newport. Many of the family members traveling from Egypt were
evidently told by their government they would be able to see the
bodies of their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   However, during a private briefing, a National Transportation
Safety Board director told them, ``I don't want to lie to you, you
have to know the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   George Arian, a spokesman for the Egyptian families, said:
``It's a really terrible situation inside. No one was expecting
this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought they were going to come here and look at a
face, and you would know that that's my brother or my sister. All
of a sudden they find out it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Tuesday, investigators changed from sea-surface
recovery to searching the ocean floor, where the bulk of the
airplane remains, although officials could not say how many or what
size pieces the plane had broken into.ew radar data released Tuesday night showed the plane traveling
with a ground speed of 483 knots (555 mph) at an altitude of 33,000
feet before it began dropping.
</P>
<P>
   Forty seconds later, the plane was at 16,700 feet, a fall rate
of 400 feet per second.
</P>
<P>
   At that point the plane was traveling at 690 mph. Officials
would not say Tuesday night if any observers had heard a sonic boom
at the time of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators stressed that they are looking into all crash
possibilities: human error, mechanical failure and sabotage. About
600 FBI agents, including bomb technicians, have joined in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, one NTSB source said the plane's rapid rate of decent
keeps the possibility of sabotage a ``very viable option,'' but so
far investigators have uncovered no links to foul play.
</P>
<P>
   Paper records show continuing concerns about the reverse
thrusters on some 767s. As late as Sept. 15 of this year, the U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration proposed fixing problems with
thrust reversers on 767s, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA issued a proposed airworthiness directive, obtained by
Reuters, calling on airlines to replace a deactivation pin and
other components on thrust reversers on 767s and 747-400s with
certain Pratt &AMP; Whitney engines.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800 in the same region,
where myriad eyewitnesses reported seeing a streaking light prior
to the midair explosion, there have been no firsthand accounts of
the EgyptAir crash.
</P>
<P>
   Through Tuesday afternoon four U.S. Coast Guard cutters had
returned to a staging area near Newport, where NTSB officials will
attempt to reconstruct the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The small pieces of wreckage have yet to reveal any indications
of what may have caused the crash, officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   One large metal piece of debris described as ``significant'' by
coast guard officials Monday sunk before a cutter could retrieve
it, Capt. Russell Webster said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter pilot who spotted the debris said it appeared to
be a luggage container.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday an HU-25 Falcon aircraft found the oil sheen
where Flight 990 crashed into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy will wait for the USS Grapple, which arrived in Newport
on Tuesday afternoon with 30 divers aboard, to be fitted with a
remotely operated vehicle and special dive equipment before it
attempts to retrieve the black boxes, said U.S. Navy Capt. Jeff
Graham. Bad weather Tuesday night halted the equipment installation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were not concerned that the ongoing foul weather would
prevent them from eventually locating the data and voice recorders
because the devices are designed to emit their locator pings for 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   But an approaching winter, and water depths up to 270 feet, are
likely to substantially hinder salvage efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very bad time of year for weather out where we
are,'' Graham said. ``We're 65 miles off and the seas build quite
rapidly. This will impact how fast we can do operations, or how
long.''
</P>
<P>
   More human remains were found Tuesday, but family members have
yet to begin the identification process.
</P>
<P>
   Some brought dental records and other evidence to help identify
victims. With the condition and small size of remains, family
members were to begin providing blood and DNA samples to aid the
efforts Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The grieving process, as well as identification, will keep most
of family members in the area until at least the middle of next
week, said one Red Cross official.
</P>
<P>
   Arian, the Arabic newspaper owner turned spokesman, said any
healing done earlier by coming to Newport and being near the
accident site was destroyed by Tuesday's news.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I think it was helping, but now it's getting worse,''
he said. ``The people were coming to see the bodies and touch the
bodies to help make themselves feel better. Now it's not helping
anybody, and everyone is really suffering.''

 &HT;    Southern gubernatorial races highlight both ends of spectrum
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark

<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. _ The race to succeed the first Republican
governor in Mississippi since Reconstruction was too close to call
with more than 50 percent of the precincts reporting by late
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Ronnie Musgrove, the state's lieutenant governor, and
Republican Mike Parker, a former U.S. congressman, each had 49
percent of the votes. The two have been in a dead heat for several
weeks in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   In another gubernatorial race in the South, Kentucky Gov. Paul
Patton, a Democrat, easily beat two opponents and won a second
term. He is the first Kentucky governor able to serve a second term
in nearly 200 years, thanks to a change in the state constitution
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   With 92 percent of the precincts reporting, Patton had 62
percent of the vote. Republican challenger Peppy Martin had 22
percent and Reform Party candidate Gatewood Galbraith had 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi, Gov. Kirk Fordice was barred by law from running
for a third term. Fordice's two terms were controversial, marked by
his combative relationship with the Legislature and his affair with
a high school sweetheart. After years of rumors, the governor made
the affair public last summer and announced his intention to
divorce his wife, Pat.
</P>
<P>
   Parker and Musgrove distanced themselves from Fordice during
their campaigns, and both stressed similar agendas, with education
and economic improvement the top priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Musgrove, 43, served as a state senator before he was elected
lieutenant governor in 1995. Parker, who turned 50 on Sunday,
served in Washington for 10 years before quitting to run for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins will work with a Democrat-controlled Legislature on
re-configuring congressional districts after the 2000 Census.
</P>
<P>
   Musgrove and Parker ran clean campaigns and touted extremely
similar platforms. Musgrove spoke of specific programs to improve
education, such as putting a computer on every student's desk.
Parker promised to bring ''accountability'' back to schools and he
promised not to run for a second term if test scores do not go up
in the next four years.

 &HT;    Vote on King papers ownership could hinge on pricetag,
copyrights
 &HT;    (EDS: Changes House Administration Committee ref. to Oversight
Committee.)
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House could vote as early as todayto authorize
the purchase of the private papers of the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr. from his family, but political maneuvering on Capitol Hill
could delay that purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The vote would authorize the Library of Congress to purchase or
acquire through private donations the papers of the slain civil
rights leader for $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   While the Senate unanimously authorized the purchase last week,
some House Republicans are concerned about the price tag and about
setting a precedent of using taxpayer dollars to purchase private
papers.
</P>
<P>
   They also are concerned about who would control the copyright of
about 80,000 documents contained in the cache of King's private
papers now housed at the Martin Luther King Center in Atlanta and
at Coretta Scott King's private home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think $20 million is an outrage,'' said Rep. John Linder
(R-Ga.). The papers are clearly valuable, he said, but the price is
too much to pay. ``That is what I call a payoff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The action taken by the Senate and the impending action in the
House would merely authorize the purchase of the papers. Congress
must still scramble to find a way to actually pay for it _ a
difficult task given a targeted adjournment date of Nov. 10 and the
ongoing feud over passing a budget for the current fiscal year,
which began Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations between the Library of Congress and the King
family stretch back to 1967, one year before King was assassinated.
The price would be the largest amount that the library has ever
paid for a collection, but some lawmakers say the historical
significance of the papers is well worth the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a tragedy if these papers were scattered or sold
by an auction house,'' said Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights
leader and trusted confidant of King. ``The price may be high, but
the papers are priceless. They should be kept and preserved for all
Americans to see, feel and learn from.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, first reported by Congressional Quarterly's
daily publication on Capitol Hill, the King family would receive
$20 million. That is $10 million less than the appraisal conducted
by Southeby's auction house in New York, which reviewed the papers'
value at the family's request.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators now are trying to settle whether the King family
should retain any copyright control over the papers, which include
transcriptions of King's speeches, handwritten notes, letters and
personal items such as report cards from school.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a House committee overseeing the Library of Congress
unexpectedly questioned James Billington, the Librarian of
Congress, about the deal Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) said he wanted to know if this would
set a precedent where other prominent families would try to sell
collections to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the library made such a purchase was in 1930 when
it spent $1.5 million to buy a book collection that included three
copies of the Gutenberg Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is what is it that we get if we buy them?'' said
Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Calif.), Chairman of the House Oversight
Committee. And it is not just lawmakers who have some questions
about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   King's private papers represent less than 10 percent of the of
documents held at the King Center. The question that historians
have about the sale is who has the legal authority over the papers
of civil rights groups such as the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those (the SCLC and the SNCC papers) are more valuable to
scholars,'' said David Garrow, a historian at Emory University and
noted biographer of King. Garrow is concerned that Dexter Scott
King, the son of King who heads the center, wants to close the
center's library for economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Garrow said that the family's desire to sell the papers goes
against King's legacy of selflessness. He noted that King, gave
away his 1964 Nobel Peace Prize money to civil rights
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (the King family) were going to take the money and
help run food programs for the poor, Dr. King would be perfectly
happy,'' Garrow said. ``But that is not likely the track record.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the deal say the King family has every right to
receive money from the papers' sale. They point out that Congress
has purchased the papers of Thomas Jefferson and other American
icons in the past. They say the Library of Congress is the best
location for the papers, because it already is the repository for
the papers of other civil rights leaders such as Frederick
Douglass, Booker T. Washington and Thurgood Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't hear a lot of people raising cain about giving all
these ex-presidents time on the public payroll to raise money to
build their libraries,'' said Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), who
initiated the negotiations. He noted that the King family is
selling the papers for $10 million under their appraised value.
</P>
<P>
   The papers are ``virtually priceless,'' said Sen. Max Cleland
(D-Ga.). ``They show the evolution of the thinking of this seminal
figure in our history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The wording in both the Senate and House measures allows for the
library to raise funds for the purchase from private donations, a
move applauded by Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   Collecting private contributions to offset or pay for the papers
is ``laudable and appropriate,'' Coverdell said. Preserving the
papers is preserving a critical part of the nation's history, he
added.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Permits Online Save Time  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Several new online permit programs are letting roofers, plumbers
and other contractors get on with their jobs rather than waste time
driving to city hall and waiting in line to fill out applications.
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network, a San
Jose nonprofit devoted to economic growth and quality of life
issues, unveiled its ``Smart Permit'' product after five years of
development.
</P>
<P>
   Seven cities, starting with Sunnyvale, will use the program to
allow building owners and contractors to file applications online
for projects like water heater installations and new roofs and even
get approvals e-mailed back, all in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NetClerk Inc. of South San Francisco is kicking off a
pilot program as early as mid-November in San Francisco to ease the
permit application chores of contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Department of Building Inspection will accept
NetClerk's faxed (and eventually e-mailed) applications as a &LR; 
viable  &LR; an alternative to sending in permit forms by mail or filing
them at the the  &LR; counter at 1660 Mission St.
</P>
<P>
   For projects requiring simple permits rather than detailed
plans, property owners and contractors will be able to log on to
the NetClerk Web site (www.netclerk.com), choose the appropriate
permit, fill out the application online and submit it to the city.
The company may start charging for this service but says it won't
do so before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a very helpful service to San Franciscans and the
city,'' said Crystal Pearl, chief building inspector. She expects
that the collaboration with NetClerk could save staff time and
costs to the city.
</P>
<P>
   For the past month, NetClerk also has been testing its permit
management service with 50 Bay Area roofers, plumbers, electricians
and heating, ventilation and air conditioning contractors
throughout six Bay Area counties. This service lets contractors
submit and track permits with more than 100 communities by whatever
avenue the municipalities allow _ e-mail, fax, postal delivery or
showing up in person.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; So Far, a Success
</P>
<P>
   Some of the early users of NetClerk's permit management service
offer rave reviews:
</P>
<P>
   _After testing NetClerk's online product for two weeks, John
Gilroy, president of Just Water Heaters, said, ``It's a hell of a
concept.'' He expects it will save his company considerable time,
money and aggravation.
</P>
<P>
   Gilroy, whose Hayward company does an $8 million annual business
selling and installing hot water heaters, calls the current permit
process ``a considerable annoyance.'' His company charges customers
a standard $15 application fee. (That's on top of the permit fees
charged by cities, which range from $15 in Larkspur to $116 in
Orinda.)
</P>
<P>
   Two employees of Just Water Heaters do nothing but shepherd as
many as 1,000 permit applications a month. ``A lot of cities want a
wet signature, and it can take hours to drive out to the sticks and
make a personal appearance,'' Gilroy griped.
</P>
<P>
   _Aaron Sanders, owner of Sanact Inc., which operates a
Roto-Rooter franchise in the East Bay, says NetClerk has saved him
considerable time over the past few weeks, and he expects to be
anticipates being  &LR; able to pass these savings along to customers
and make more competitive bids on projects.
</P>
<P>
   His company normally applies for 10 or 20 permits a week for
plumbing modification permits and charges customers a flat $75 fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I bid on a project that requires plumbing changes, I
include one hour to pull a permit,'' said Sanact owner Aaron
Sanders. ``Getting permits accounts for 10 to 15 hours of overhead
a week.''
</P>
<P>
   _Precision Roofing, which operates from San Francisco to Menlo
Park, applies for about 10 permits a week and includes in each bid
about $50 to $100 to cover its permit application chores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filing for permits over the Web is a great idea,'' said Rick
Garcia, office manager for Precision Roofing. ``Using NetClerk, I
recently applied for a roofing permit in Colma. It took about five
minutes and I never had to leave the office.''
</P>
<P>
   NetClerk has yet to establish prices for its services, but CEO
Jon Fisher figures that the company will charge a monthly fee to
contractors ranging from $50 to $2,500 a month. Low-volume users
might pay as much as $10 per application, high-volume subscribers
as little as $4 each.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, 27, said he got the idea for the company while serving
as a technology director for Michaela Alioto's failed campaign for
California secretary of state a year ago. ``Contractors, union
members and others kept complaining about all the red tape involved
in the permitting process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NetClerk has a blue chip-list of investors including Oracle
Corp. President Ray Lane, BroadVision CEO Pehong Chen, VeriSign CEO
Stratton Sclavos and Keynote Systems CEO Uman Gupta, who is also
chairman of NetClerk's board of directors. The company has raised
$1.3 million and is about to close a $10 million venture capital
investment round.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Many Cities Excited
</P>
<P>
   Some city officials also are enthusiastic about NetClerk's new
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to require zero visits to City Hall and
NetClerk's service allows this for simple permits,'' said Hamid
Pouya, director of building and neighborhood services for Concord
and an unpaid adviser to NetClerk.
</P>
<P>
   But not all public servants are sold on NetClerk. Brian Moura,
assistant city manager of San Carlos, which is part of the Joint
Venture: Silicon Valley Network Smart Permit project, wonders why
contractors would want to pay NetClerk for something they can do
for free.
</P>
<P>
   San Carlos, for example, not only provides free online
applications for simple permits but lets contractors and others
track their progress through the approval process.
</P>
<P>
   Although simple permits account for more than 50 percent of the
workload of city building permit departments, that is not the only
major focus of Smart Permit. Randy Tsuda, director of the project,
said it includes the filing of paperless blueprints and plans and
use of digital instead of hand-written signatures that let
architects and engineers avoid trips to government offices.
</P>
<P>
   While the project has focused on providing free and
comprehensive online permit filing services to a select group of
cities, Tsuda said NetClerk might provide a useful complementary
service that lets contractors submit filings in whatever format
required by cities in a much broader area.
</P>
<P>
   NetClerk's Fisher similarly applauded the Smart Permit process.
But since it works in only a few areas, he noted, ``It's not of
much use to contractors who do business across the whole Bay
Area.''
</P>
<P>
   By early next year, NetClerk plans to roll out its service to
2,000 cities across the country. Although it is starting with
simple permits, NetClerk hopes eventually to provide electronic
delivery of blueprints and other complex plans.

Rangers' only concern was saving money 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers took care of one of their fans'
biggest concerns for next season yesterday when they included
future Hall of Famer Juan Gonzalez in a nine-player trade to
Detroit: They won't have to worry about the Yankees next October.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a deal based strictly on money _ and please, don't buy
anything else you may hear _ the Rangers woke up today younger and
cheaper, but certainly not better.
</P>
<P>
   At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this deal had anything to do with money,'' club
president Jim Lites was overheard telling a TV interviewer shortly
after last night's news conference at The Ballpark in Arlington. I
quickly moved out of lightning-strike range.
</P>
<P>
   This deal had ``everything'' to do with money. You don't trade a
guaranteed 135 RBI a year for an iffy, sore-armed left-hander, a
shaky second-year outfielder who drove in 49 runs last year, a
middle reliever and a utility infielder unless you're saving on the
money side.
</P>
<P>
   This trade was general manager Doug Melvin basically doing what
owner Tom Hicks told him to do the day after the Rangers had been
swept out of the playoffs by the Yankees: Cut the payroll and get
rid of Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin wasted no time in following orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't tell me I had to make this kind of a deal,'' Melvin
insisted. ``We're trying to avoid losing players without getting
anything back.''
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the Rangers will save big time. They come up $3.5
million better in salary on this exchange alone for next year, but
it's the future dollars they save by not re-signing Gonzalez that
make the big difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever mentions numbers,'' Melvin said of what he
expected it would take to re-sign Gonzalez. ``Everybody always
wants to talk `market value.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But we figured it was going to take somewhere between $12
million to $15 million a year for six years to re-sign Juan.''
</P>
<P>
   When Melvin asked Gonzalez's agent Jim Bronner in New York last
week if Gonzalez would take the same contract Colorado's Larry
Walker signed (six years, $75 million), Bronner said no.
</P>
<P>
   But he told Melvin yesterday, when the Rangers' GM called to
tell him about the trade: ``I wish you'd have made us a proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Rangers didn't make a proposal because they didn't
want to risk Gonzalez, who desperately wanted to stay in Texas,
accepting it. It's a shame that they never found out and that they
didn't get Gonzalez involved personally. It might have made a
difference, like it did with Pudge Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't think the Rangers ever had any intention of
re-signing Gonzalez. They couldn't afford to do that, address other
team needs and stay within the parameters of Hicks' budget.
</P>
<P>
   It was Melvin who pushed Tigers general manager Randy Smith to
conclude the deal quickly, before the general managers' meetings
begin in California next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him, `There's a match here. Let's get it done.' I
didn't want to get out to the GM meetings and get a lot of rumors
going about Juan being traded,'' Melvin said. ``I didn't want
\RGonzalez\S to do to us what Alex Rodriguez did to Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, the Mariners' shortstop whose contract also expires
after next season, announced that he would not re-sign with any
team that traded for him.
</P>
<P>
   If Gonzalez had made the same statement, the Tigers almost
certainly would not have been able to make this trade. As it is,
they are gambling that they'll be able to sign Gonzalez to a new
contract. If they can't, the Tigers, who were looking for a marquee
name to help draw fans to their new stadium next season, will have
given up six players for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   For the Rangers, there are several risks, none more critical
than the condition of starting pitcher Justin Thompson's left
shoulder. He underwent surgery for a torn labrum in late August and
there's a question whether he'll even be ready for Opening Day next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we don't want to do,'' Melvin said, ``is rush Justin in
an effort to justify this trade.''
</P>
<P>
   What this wasn't about was Gonzalez's minor problems last year
with manager Johnny Oates. It wasn't about Juan's lack of
leadership in the clubhouse. It wasn't about his attitude, his
defense or any of that other nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   This was simply a cruel lesson in baseball economics. Gonzalez,
a two-time MVP, two-time home run champ and future Hall of Famer,
had reached a point where, in Melvin's estimation, the money he can
demand outweighed his value to the team. There's something wrong
with that kind of system.
</P>
<P>
   There's something wrong when the Rangers put out the word that a
player of Gonzalez's stature is on the trading block, and the only
team that calls is the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe, if we'd have had to sign Juan at market value, we
would have been a stale club with no flexibility to do anything
else for three or four years,'' Melvin said. ``It's the system that
forces you to make these kinds of deals more than it is the
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the system stinks.

RANGERS TRADE GONZALEZ TO TIGERS IN NINE-PLAYER DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1996 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Juan Gonzalez, a two-time American League
Most Valuable Player and possible future Hall of Famer, is no
longer with the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to pay him $15 million a year, the Rangers sent
Gonzalez and two others to the Detroit Tigers on Tuesday in a
nine-player trade that ranks among the biggest in club history.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers received six players in return, including
left-handed pitcher Justin Thompson, who was an All-Star in 1997
but underwent shoulder surgery at the end of last season, and
outfielder Gabe Kapler, who will replace Gonzalez in right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult deal to do,'' Rangers general manager
Doug Melvin said. ``Especially when you're trading a player of
Juan's caliber. He's the franchise's best player ever and a good
person. But I felt it was a deal that I had to do that was in the
best interests of the franchise's future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has one year left on his contract at a salary of $7.5
million. He can be a free agent after next season and the Rangers
were concerned that he would command $15 million to $20 million a
year on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't feel good about that,'' Melvin said. ``We didn't
feel we could put a competitive team on the field paying that kind
of money to one player.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin talked to Gonzalez's agent, Jim Bronner, at the World
Series and brought up Colorado's Larry Walker, who signed a
six-year, $75 million deal before last season. When Bronner said
$12.5 million per year wouldn't be enough to sign Gonzalez, Melvin
said he was motivated even more to make the trade.
</P>
<P>
   The trade sent Gonzalez, reserve catcher Gregg Zaun and
right-handed relief pitcher Danny Patterson to Detroit for
Thompson, Kapler, right-handed relief pitcher Francisco Cordero,
reserve catcher Bill Haselman, utility infielder Frank Catalanotto
and minor league left-handed pitcher Alan Webb.
</P>
<P>
   When all salaries involved are added up, the trade allows the
Rangers to reduce payroll by about $3 million. That's the first
step in owner Tom Hicks' desire to cut the Rangers' $76 million
payroll from last year and shake up the team after again being
swept by the New York Yankees in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, reached at his home in Puerto Rico, said he was
shocked by the news when Melvin called him Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hurt a little bit,'' said Gonzalez, who was 16 when he
first signed with the Rangers on May 30, 1986. ``I played 13 years
with the Rangers. But I guess it's part of the game. It's a
business. Doug called me, said, `We've traded you for six players.'
He said the market is going up, they would have to pay me a lot of
money and they don't have the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `OK, thank you, I appreciate the opportunity to play
in a great place.' I want to thank the fans for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal came quickly after the season because a number of
high-priced superstars can become free agents after the 2000 season
and could be traded this winter. Seattle center fielder Ken Griffey
Jr. is among those players. Tuesday, he formally asked for a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible free agents in 2000 include Seattle shortstop
Alex Rodriguez, Cleveland outfielder Manny Ramirez, Houston second
baseman Craig Biggio and pitchers Roger Clemens of the New York
Yankees, Mike Mussina of Baltimore and Mike Hampton of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers said they did not want to miss a chance to trade
Gonzalez and be left with only draft picks as compensation if he
signed with another team as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough situation,'' Rangers president Jim Lites said.
``But if we're standing here a year from now and we've got nothing
for Juan Gonzalez, Doug Melvin and I could be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordero should help the Rangers' bullpen and Haselman and
Catalanotto will likely help their bench. But the key to the deal
for the Rangers will be Thompson and whether he can overcome his
injury, and Kapler's ability to replace Gonzalez in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 27, was 15-11 with a 3.02 earned-run average in 1997,
a performance good enough to make the All-Star team and have people
believing he was a possible Cy Young Award candidate. But he has
yet to match that season, going 9-11 with a 5.11 ERA in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   His season was cut short because of an arm injury and he
underwent arthroscopic surgery on Aug. 24 to repair a torn labrum
in his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a risk involved,'' said Melvin, who said he talked to
both Dr. James Andrews, who performed the surgery, and Rangers
orthopedist Dr. John Conway. ``They both feel very confident. We're
hoping he can be ready by Opening Day. If he's not quite ready,
we're not going to rush him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler, 24, was a Minor League Player of the Year and Southern
League Most Valuable Player when he hit .322 with 28 homers and 146
runs batted in for Double-A Jacksonville, (Fla.) in 1998. That
earned him a promotion to the Tigers last season and he struggled,
hitting .245 with 18 homers and 49 RBI in 130 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably wasn't quite ready,'' Melvin said. ``But with that
season under his belt, we think he'll step up and be a real good
ballplayer for us.''

RANGERS TRADE GONZALEZ TO TIGERS IN NINE-PLAYER DEAL

six-year, $75 million deal before last season. When Bronner said
$12.5 million per year wouldn't be enough to sign Gonzalez, Melvin
said he was motivated even more to make the trade.
</P>
<P>
   The trade sent Gonzalez, reserve catcher Gregg Zaun and
right-handed relief pitcher Danny Patterson to Detroit for
Thompson, Kapler, right-handed relief pitcher Francisco Cordero,
reserve catcher Bill Haselman, utility infielder Frank Catalanotto
and minor league left-handed pitcher Alan Webb.
</P>
<P>
   When all salaries involved are added up, the trade allows the
Rangers to reduce payroll by about $3 million. That's the first
step in owner Tom Hicks' desire to cut the Rangers' $76 million
payroll from last year and shake up the team after again being
swept by the New York Yankees in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, reached at his home in Puerto Rico, said he was
shocked by the news when Melvin called him Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hurt a little bit,'' said Gonzalez, who was 16 when he
first signed with the Rangers on May 30, 1986. ``I played 13 years
with the Rangers. But I guess it's part of the game. It's a
business. Doug called me, said, `We've traded you for six players.'
He said the market is going up, they would have to pay me a lot of
money and they don't have the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `OK, thank you, I appreciate the opportunity to play
in a great place.' I want to thank the fans for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal came quickly after the season because a number of
high-priced superstars can become free agents after the 2000 season
and could be traded this winter. Seattle center fielder Ken Griffey
Jr. is among those players. Tuesday, he formally asked for a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible free agents in 2000 include Seattle shortstop
Alex Rodriguez, Cleveland outfielder Manny Ramirez, Houston second
baseman Craig Biggio and pitchers Roger Clemens of the New York
Yankees, Mike Mussina of Baltimore and Mike Hampton of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers said they did not want to miss a chance to trade
Gonzalez and be left with only draft picks as compensation if he
signed with another team as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough situation,'' Rangers president Jim Lites said.
``But if we're standing here a year from now and we've got nothing
for Juan Gonzalez, Doug Melvin and I could be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordero should help the Rangers' bullpen and Haselman and
Catalanotto will likely help their bench. But the key to the deal
for the Rangers will be Thompson and whether he can overcome his
injury, and Kapler's ability to replace Gonzalez in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 27, was 15-11 with a 3.02 earned-run average in 1997,
a performance good enough to make the All-Star team and have people
believing he was a possible Cy Young Award candidate. But he has
yet to match that season, going 9-11 with a 5.11 ERA in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   His season was cut short because of an arm injury and he
underwent arthroscopic surgery on Aug. 24 to repair a torn labrum
in his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a risk involved,'' said Melvin, who said he talked to
both Dr. James Andrews, who performed the surgery, and Rangers
orthopedist Dr. John Conway. ``They both feel very confident. We're
hoping he can be ready by Opening Day. If he's not quite ready,
we're not going to rush him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler, 24, was a Minor League Player of the Year and Southern
League Most Valuable Player when he hit .322 with 28 homers and 146
runs batted in for Double-A Jacksonville, (Fla.) in 1998. That
earned him a promotion to the Tigers last season and he struggled,
hitting .245 with 18 homers and 49 RBI in 130 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably wasn't quite ready,'' Melvin said. ``But with that
season under his belt, we think he'll step up and be a real good
ballplayer for us.''

RANGERS TRADE FAMILY COW FOR BAG OF BEANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Now playing right field ... Gabe Kapler?
</P>
<P>
   The family cow was traded for the proverbial bag of beans
Tuesday. Like the fairy tale's Jack, Texas Rangers general manager
Doug Melvin said it was the best deal that the club was offered.
</P>
<P>
   Ponder that for a moment. The Rangers had an odds-on
Hall-of-Fame right fielder as trade bait, a slugger who's a cinch
for about 40 home runs and 130 runs batted in every season.
</P>
<P>
   And the best that they were offered was:
</P>
<P>
   a starting pitcher whose future hangs by the thread of a
surgeon's needle;
</P>
<P>
   two middle relievers with mostly minor-league credentials;
</P>
<P>
   an Italian version of Jeff Huson;
</P>
<P>
   a backup catcher they could have kept two seasons ago;
</P>
<P>
   and a young outfielder who might have trouble beating out
Roberto Kelly for a starting spot before the 2000 season is
through?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of clubs had heard rumors that the Rangers might have to
trade Juan Gonzalez,'' Melvin sought to enlighten at The Ballpark
last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``And nobody called me except for (Detroit GM) Randy Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said, ``Clubs sort of tiptoed through it,'' but only the
Tigers were willing to put warm bodies on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Which is stunning news, of course. It bespeaks the kind of
mega-million contract that Gonzalez is expected to command, and
most clubs' trepidation in being able to negotiate it.
</P>
<P>
   But from here, the question is why now? If the market is slow,
you wait. A rare gem like Gonzalez wasn't going to diminish in
value.
</P>
<P>
   Why now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt that if we go to the general managers meetings
next week,'' Melvin said, ``and people would start throwing names
out there, it was only going to confuse things. That's why I told
Randy that there's a match here and we need to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin envisioned a worst-case scenario similar to what happened
last year with the Mariners and shortstop Alex Rodriguez. A-Rod
heard the rumors and, in effect, short-circuited any potential deal
by announcing that he would veto any trade without a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to be a step ahead than a step behind,'' Melvin put it.
</P>
<P>
   I see the reasoning. I've also seen what happens to teams who
wait too long to trade potential free agents like Mo Vaughn, Jose
Offerman, Dean Palmer, Darryl Kile and Kevin Brown. You don't even
get the bag of beans.
</P>
<P>
   In Gonzalez' case, complicating the issue was his heretofore
unannounced list of Teams Juan Would Not Be Happy Playing For _
Yankees, Mets, Dodgers and, in effect, every other team that Juan's
agent, Jim Bronner, would rather squeeze free-agent dollars out of.
</P>
<P>
   The list of 10 teams narrowed Melvin's options considerably. But
it begs another question.
</P>
<P>
   With free agency on the horizon, did anyone ask whether
Gonzalez' list was now negotiable? That would have given the
Rangers a greater pool of players to settle for.
</P>
<P>
   And if it wasn't negotiable, I still don't understand why the
first week of November was the best time to trade Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't he have brought more in the last week of July, 2000,
with the trade deadline sirens beckoning would-be pennant
contenders?
</P>
<P>
   But we're second-guessing. It's a done deal. Now playing right
field ... Gabe Kapler.
</P>
<P>
   Why not Juan Encarnacion? There are baseball people who think
he's going to be the Tigers' next great outfield star.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler? Even with hitter-friendly Tiger Stadium inflating his
numbers, he hit only .245 with 18 home runs and 49 RBI. Gonzalez
surpassed those numbers in just two months, May plus June.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Detroit organization in early September
expressed the fear that Kapler, though only 24, had reached a point
where he had ``quit learning'' and seemed reluctant to accept the
staff's coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, great. I can see the marketing campaign now _ ``The 2000
Texas Rangers: We Already Have It All Figured Out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler, granted, is not the key to the deal on the Rangers' end.
That heavy load falls on the mending shoulder of lefty Justin
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said last night that Thompson probably won't be ready to
pitch by the start of next season.
</P>
<P>
   My question is, if the Tigers offered a six-player package
including Thompson, why not instead a five-player (or four) package
that included Brian Moehler?
</P>
<P>
   Just wondering, because trading for pitchers with arm problems
and surgeries in their pasts seems a foolish risk when you're
surrendering a future Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for Gonzalez, the Rangers also did deepen their
bullpen (Francisco Cordero, mostly), but you have to wonder when
new team president Jim Lites says, ``A year from now, we're going
to be happy with this trade.''
</P>
<P>
   A year from now, I say we're going to be wondering if the new
guy, Thompson, is ever going to pitch. I say, too, we're going to
be wondering what happened to those 130 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but I thought the family cow was worth more than that.

EDITORIAL: PRIVACY IN FINANCIAL DEALINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 3:
</P>
<P>
   The financial services bill that will overhaul the nation's
banking laws is a good deal for financial institutions but a bad
deal for consumer privacy. The bill would allow banks, brokerage
houses and insurance companies to merge into financial
conglomerates, a long-overdue reform. The banking industry stands
to gain from the right to expand into other businesses, and
consumers could benefit from the ease of one-stop shopping and the
creation of new financial services. But protecting consumers'
financial privacy should also be central to financial
modernization. This bill is weak on that score.
</P>
<P>
   In an electronic world where businesses can effortlessly
collect, compile and mine personal data for marketing and other
purposes, consumers should have the right to control the spread of
their financial information. Under current federal law, consumers
have almost no rights in this area. The bill adds some limited
protection, but it does not go far enough, particularly since
conglomeration will greatly accelerate the sharing of private
information in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require that a financial institution provide
customers with general notice about its privacy and disclosure
policy. But the institution would remain free to share a customer's
personal information with affiliates of the company and with
unaffiliated companies that sign marketing agreements, without the
customer's consent and without giving the customer the right to
object to having that information transferred.
</P>
<P>
   The bill places no restrictions on the kind of detailed personal
information _ such as customer bank balances, credit card account
numbers, income and investments, insurance records, purchases made
by check or credit card _ that can be swapped among affiliated
companies. New regulations proposed by the Clinton administration
on medical privacy would prohibit a health insurance company from
disclosing medical records to a bank. But nothing in this bill
would stop a bank or life insurance company, for example, from
sharing equally personal information about customers.
</P>
<P>
   The bill allows consumers to ``opt out'' of disclosure of
private information to unaffiliated companies. But that provision
contains a big loophole. It would not apply if a financial
institution enters into a joint agreement with an unrelated
financial institution to market products or services. That means
even corporate entities that have no business relationship with a
customer could get private information without the customer's
consent.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates have argued that financial institutions should
be required to get a customer's consent before they transfer or
sell personal information. But the banking lobby contends that
getting affirmative authorization is too costly. At the very least,
consumers who want to keep their records private should be allowed
to opt out of having that information disclosed to others.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton had supported a strong opt-out provision, but
in final negotiations in Congress the administration acceded to the
loopholes that narrow the opportunities to opt out. Most consumers
do not want their banks to share or sell personal information to
other businesses, whether under one corporate umbrella or not.
Their concerns about privacy will only grow as the new
conglomerates begin to cross-market their products. If Clinton
signs the bill, as expected, he must push for separate privacy
legislation that actually gives consumers the right to protect
personal data.

EDITORIAL: DIPLOMACY IN OSLO

<TEXT>
<P>
   The hard bargaining lies ahead. But the important players in the
Mideast peace talks did their best Tuesday to convert the good will
surrounding a memorial service in Oslo for the pioneering Israeli
peacemaker Yitzhak Rabin into renewed efforts to reach a final
agreement between Arabs and Israelis by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat proclaimed their willingness to take the courageous
decisions that will be necessary to achieve this ambitious
timetable, beginning with a framework agreement by mid-February.
For his part, President Clinton pledged to do whatever he could to
help, including possibly a Camp David-style summit meeting early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   These promises set the right tone for next week's detailed talks
on a set of deeply emotional issues that have long defied solution.
Much has been achieved since Rabin and Arafat signed their first
interim agreement in 1993, an achievement for which both men, along
with Shimon Peres, were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994. The
next year Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli extremist. Most of
the Palestinian population in the West Bank and Gaza is now under
Palestinian rule, and last week a corridor guaranteeing
Palestinians safe passage through Israel was opened.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining issues are difficult. They include the future of
Jerusalem, the future of Jewish settlements on the West Bank and
the future of the Palestinian refugees, as well as issues involving
boundaries and Palestinian statehood. For example, Israel has
always insisted on an indivisible Jerusalem under Israeli control,
whereas Arafat has demanded some part of Jerusalem as the capital
of a future Palestinian state. Other issues touch on the
fundamental conflict between Israel's yearning for security and the
Palestinians' quest for contiguous territory.
</P>
<P>
   Though the main purpose of Clinton's trip was to help energize
the Mideast talks _ and in so doing honor Rabin's memory in a
tangible way _ he found time to meet with Russian Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin to discuss Russia's objections to modifying the
Antiballistic Missile Treaty and to seek a diplomatic solution to
the increasingly brutal conflict in Chechnya. Putin said after the
meeting that Chechnya was an ``internal Russian matter'' _ an
assertion, Clinton suggested, that does not absolve Russians of
responsibility for the many innocent people caught in the conflict.
In return, Putin expressed dismay over U.S. plans to build a
missile defense system against renegade nuclear states, a plan that
Moscow fears would undercut an ABM treaty that has served both
sides well for nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton packed a lot of important diplomacy into a very short
period. Whether it turns out to be fruitful diplomacy remains to be
seen. But on the Middle East, at least, he can be heartened by
broad declarations by Israelis and Palestinians that they mean to
translate Rabin's vision into reality.

HIS HEART ELSEWHERE, GRIFFEY BREAKS A FEW IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ What do you say to Ken Griffey Jr., who after 11 years
and a thousand thrilling plays wants to move on from the only
baseball team he has ever known?
</P>
<P>
   You say, ``Thanks, Ken, for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   And where does the bidding start for the old blue-cushioned wall
from center field in the Kingdome, where Griffey climbed and
slugged his way to greatness before our amazed and grateful eyes?
</P>
<P>
   We all knew what we were watching, each and every day. But we
also knew, deep down, we could be living on borrowed time.
</P>
<P>
   So what do you say to Griffey, who talks about staying close to
his family in Florida, but who is suddenly and mysteriously no
longer talking about those World Series rings he covets?
</P>
<P>
   You say, ``Who told you to build a home in Orlando?''
</P>
<P>
   You say, ``What major leaguer can be Mr. Mom when he's on the
road most of the year anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   You say, ``Maybe the Mariners will get to a World Series anyway,
especially now that all that money and all that energy won't be
poured into one single, sensational player.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, sadly, quickly, you move on.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, these are no longer the days for sentimentality,
even for an All-Century Team selection like Griffey, whose
statistics and stature and popularity push him into a rare
category.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't just a baseball player, which has its benefits and its
problems. He is an icon. He is ``The Show.'' He is the main
attraction, and therefore he is bigger than the team, bigger than
the stadium, bigger than the franchise, even when he insists he is
only one of 25 players.
</P>
<P>
   Handling a player with this much talent, clout and control comes
with its own special set of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Not that your first choice wouldn't be to keep him in a Mariners
uniform his entire career.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this isn't a substantially monster blow to a sense of
place and baseball history that even Griffey understands is
important.
</P>
<P>
   But at age 30, with the clock ticking and his heart somewhere
else, the pressures and demands on a modern sports superstar like
Griffey have foiled any hope of him sticking with one team his
whole career.
</P>
<P>
   Not once but twice that was a quaint notion that Griffey's own
father implored Junior to consider during contract extensions. And
Griffey stayed. And stayed.
</P>
<P>
   But after consecutive losing seasons, Griffey's loyalty and
sense of history chafed. He was downright ornery and clearly
struggling with this decision, especially over the final two months
of this last season.
</P>
<P>
   He never said anything nice about Safeco Field. He was angry,
and rightfully so, about the way his contract status was used as a
negotiation ploy by the Mariners, who were fighting with the Public
Facilities District over stadium cost over-runs.
</P>
<P>
   Could the Mariners have done anything to make this decision by
Griffey different.
</P>
<P>
   Could they have done more to pick up free agent players last
winter, when Griffey and Alex Rodriguez all but issued ultimatums
that the team had to prove it was willing to do what it takes to
win?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. And maybe now, with Pat Gillick as general manager, the
Mariners will make better moves in living up to ownership's promise
to field a championship-caliber team and Griffey won't be here to
reap the rewards.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mariners, there will always be the question about how
come they could not provide Griffey the reason, the environment to
make it impossible to go.
</P>
<P>
   What hurts now is not just the idea of letting Griffey go, but
what Seattle will miss out on.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, as the Mariners begin to seek a trade for Griffey,
team officials are talking about how much they hope he will wear a
Mariners uniform when he enters the Hall of Fame. No doubt Griffey
has struggled with this very issue.
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell if this is the Red Sox selling Babe Ruth. In
the hearts and minds of some of Griffey's biggest fans, it might
feel this way.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems just as likely that, even for a star as bright as
Griffey, this request for a trade will turn out to be another
startling but not unexpected chapter in modern sports history.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens left Boston after 13 seasons and finally won his
ring with the Yankees this October. Clemens looks like an outsider
wearing other than a Red Sox uniform, as he did in Toronto and
again in New York this season.
</P>
<P>
   But the message is clear. The big guys move on. Clemens, Randy
Johnson, Kevin Brown, Matt Williams, Mark McGwire, Mo Vaughn and
everyone who isn't Tony Gwynn or Cal Ripken all serve to remind us
of the transience of sports heroes.
</P>
<P>
   By now, we are well past the time when it's worth agonizing over
losses like the one Seattle is about to experience.
</P>
<P>
   And frankly, there is reason to suspect that somewhere inside
Gillick's passionate baseball soul, there is a sense of excitement
a sense of a challenge:
</P>
<P>
   How to turn this historic decision by one of the game's biggest
stars into an opportunity for the future of the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Gillick is probably not the least bit daunted, even as he says
he has never had to trade a player like Griffey _ at least not for
the reason that Griffey is giving about wanting to be closer to his
family.
</P>
<P>
   If the NHL's greatest hockey genius, Wayne Gretzky, can be
traded from the Edmonton Oilers, and if Kareem Abdul-Jabbar can
decide to seek his destiny in L.A., then Griffey can walk away from
the Mariners to follow his destiny and his heart.
</P>
<P>
   All any of us can say is ``Thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   And, if you're a real and realistic baseball fan, maybe: ``See
you in the postseason.''

POWER FOR POTENTIAL: RANGERS HOPE PLAYERS DEVELOP, IMPROVE TEAM IN
LONG RUN
</HEADLINE>

By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The San Francisco Giants shocked the baseball
world in 1996 when they traded All-Star third baseman Matt
Williams, one of baseball's premier power hitters, to the Cleveland
Indians for four unheralded players.
</P>
<P>
   They won the National League West in '97, and just missed the
wild-card berth in '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Giants traded Matt Williams and everyone went, `Ooh, aah,
how could they trade Matt Williams?'' Rangers general manager Doug
Melvin said. ``They were in the playoffs the next couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin hopes the same thing happens to his club after trading
two-time American League Most Valuable Player Juan Gonzalez,
reliever Danny Patterson and catcher Greg Zaun on Tuesday to the
Detroit Tigers for pitchers Justin Thompson, Francisco Cordero and
Alan Webb, outfielder Gabe Kapler, infielder Frank Catalanotto and
catcher Bill Haselman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal makes us a better ballclub,'' Melvin said. ``We
think some of these young players have the potential to be stars in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The key word is potential. The three key players in the deal,
Thompson, Cordero and Kapler, all have it. They also have question
marks.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a 26-year-old left-handed starter, won 15 games in
1997. But he has had arm problems the past two seasons and is
coming off shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero, a 22-year-old right-handed reliever, can be a future
closer, but he's unproven.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler, a 24-year-old outfielder who's expected to replace
Gonzalez in right field, entered the season as a rookie-of-the-year
candidate, but had a lackluster season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's risk involved,'' Melvin acknowledged. ``Our risk is
probably Justin Thompson, and younger players. Can they reach the
potential that you hope they can and feel they can?''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said the potential outweighed the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson showed in 1997 he has the potential to be a frontline
starting pitcher. He went 15-11 with a 3.02 earned-run average as a
rookie using a 93-mph fastball, an outstanding changeup and a good
curveball.
</P>
<P>
   He had surgery after the season to remove loose deposits from
the elbow, however, and wasn't the same in '98. He went 11-15 with
a 4.05 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was 8-8 with a 4.57 ERA before the All-Star break this
year, but 1-3 with a 6.96 ERA after it as his shoulder bothered
him. The Tigers rested him from August on, and he had surgery Aug.
27 to repair a torn labrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping he could be ready by Opening Day,'' Melvin said.
``If he's not quite ready, we're not going to rush him into that.
We feel like he's a valuable pitcher for us, presently but also for
the future. We're not going to rush Justin just to justify this
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordero also has arm problems in his past, but he seems
recovered. He was 6-1 with a 0.95 ERA and 35 saves at Class A in
1997, but missed most of '98 because of a stress fracture in his
right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   He came back last year to go 4-1 with a 1.38 ERA and 27 saves at
Double-A Jacksonville to earn a promotion to the majors. He went
2-2 with a 3.32 ERA, displaying a live arm. He throws a fastball
consistently in the mid-90s that can reach the upper 90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our scouts tell us he's a future closer type,'' Melvin said.
``He's something special. He was a key part of this deal, being
young with the kind of arm he has. With him and (Jeff) Zimmerman,
(Tim) Crabtree, (John) Wetteland, (Mike) Venafro, we're going to
have a pretty good bullpen with some good arms out there. It was
one of the strengths we had this year, and I think it's going to be
even deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler was considered a rookie-of-the-year candidate after
hitting .322 with 47 doubles, 28 homers and 148 runs batted in at
Double-A Jacksonville in 1998, but hit .245 with 49 RBI in 130
games his first year in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, hit 18 homers, and the Rangers hope for
improvement next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably wasn't quite ready this year,'' Melvin said. ``We
feel now that that season's under his belt he's going to step up
and be a good ballplayer for us. He's a hard-nosed ballplayer, he
has a plus throwing arm, good speed and power. We like the way he
can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto is a 25-year-old utility infielder who played first,
second and third for the Tigers. He's a left-handed hitter who
batted .276 with 11 homers and 35 RBI in 286 at-bats, but his
defense is considered average.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, a 20-year-old left-hander, was 9-9 with a 4.95 ERA at
Jacksonville last year. He was the Tigers' minor-league pitcher of
the year after going 10-7 with a 2.93 ERA at Class A in '98.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers wanted the Rangers to take Haselman, who was Ivan
Rodriguez's backup in '98, because he's due to make $1.1 million
next season. Zaun made $450,000 last year. nn

CRASH INVESTIGATORS WON`T SPECULATE ON CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Crash investigators say one of two thrust
reversers on EgyptAir Flight 990 had been deactivated before the
Boeing 767's fatal flight from New York on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators last night said the device, used to slow the big
aircraft on landing, had been pinned so that it could not open;
they did not know why. They refused even to speculate on any
possible cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   That will have to wait for more data. But Mother Nature Tuesday
intervened to further slow the difficult task of gathering it. The
Navy late Tuesday suspended operations to recover wreckage and
human remains from the ill-fated jetliner as a major storm, packing
winds of more than 60 mph, whipped up 20-foot seas at the crash
site in the Atlantic Ocean off Nantucket Island.
</P>
<P>
   Before Navy and Coast Guard ships were recalled, however, they
picked up signals from the jet's two black boxes, which could
provide investigators with important clues about the crash that
killed all 217 people on the Cairo-bound airliner.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the weather changes, however, it will be at least
Saturday before the USS Grapple with its special equipment can
begin the difficult task of trying to recover the plane's cockpit
voice and flight data recorders from nearly 300 feet of water, said
Navy Capt. Jeff Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the recovery operation is suspended, investigators
with the National Transportation Safety Board continued to gather
new information about what happened to the Boeing 767.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last night, Board Chairman Jim Hall said
operating the jet without a working thrust reverser on one of the
jet's two engines is not an unsafe condition. Jets are allowed to
fly with an inoperable thrust reverser, said Gregory Phillips, who
is in charge of the investigation for the safety board.
</P>
<P>
   But the jet's thrust reversers will be looked at closely.
</P>
<P>
   Other than a hijacked plane that ran out of fuel, the only other
fatal crash of a 767 was caused by a faulty thrust reverser that
deployed in flight on a Lauda Air jet in 1991. It crashed in the
jungle on a flight from Bangkok to Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Hall provided more detail last night about the last minutes of
Flight 990. He said the plane was flying at 33,000 feet at a speed
of 483 knots when it suddenly began a rapid descent at 1:49 a.m.
EST.
</P>
<P>
   Radar returns showed the jet descended to 16,700 feet in 40
seconds, a rate of about 24,000 feet per minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane did not turn,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   That could become an important point. Aviation experts have said
that if a thrust reverser deployed in flight, it likely would have
flipped the huge jet, as was the case in the Lauda Air crash.
</P>
<P>
   But it did gain incredible speed. When the plane was at 16,700
feet, its ground speed was about 600 knots, or 690 miles an hour,
Hall said. Had it been flying level, that means, it would have been
traveling across land at that so-called ground speed. But because
the plane was also descending rapidly, the craft had to be
traveling much faster.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the plane was flying at supersonic speed, Hall said he
would have more information Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Modern jetliners typically cruise about four-fifths of the speed
of sound, or Mach .8. They would break apart if they too greatly
exceed their design speed.
</P>
<P>
   The ill-fated aircraft's great speed would explain why
investigators told victims' family members Tuesday that recovering
what's left of the remains will be very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the plane hit the water about 54 nautical miles south
of Nantucket, a position about a half-mile west of where the Navy
search ship USS Mohawk picked up the pinger sounds from the plane's
two black boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The black boxes are located in a jet's tail. When asked, Hall
would not speculate whether the plane's tail might have come off as
it plunged toward the ocean near or over the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   Hall was asked repeatedly last night about the deactivated
thrust reverser. He said more details would be provided Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that pilots who flew the plane on earlier legs from
Cairo to Newark and then to Los Angeles reported a flickering light
on an air-conditioning system.
</P>
<P>
   ``These issues will be fully investigated,'' Hall said.

DISGRUNTLED XEROX EMPLOYEE KILLS 7 CO-WORKERS IN HONOLULU 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Rewritten and expanded with additional details throughout)  (sw) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An apparently disgruntled service worker for Xerox Corp. in
Honolulu drove to his company's offices early Tuesday morning and
shot and killed seven co-workers, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The worker, identified by police as Byran Uyesugi, 40,
surrendered later in the day after a stand-off of more than four
hours at a nature center about five miles from where the shootings
took place. Police officers finally coaxed Uyesugi out of a Xerox
van that he had driven from the company, said Carol Costa, the
press secretary for Honolulu Mayor Jeremy Harris. Shortly after 3
p.m. Honolulu time, after calmly chatting with police, Uyesugi
(pronounced yoo-SOO-gee) moved over to the passenger seat, opened
the door and stepped out, Ms. Costa said.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the deadliest attacks in a series of such mass
killings with guns in recent years, and it left Hawaiians
particularly shocked because of the islands' idyllic surroundings
and historically low crime rates. In 1998 there were just 17
homicides in Honolulu, a metropolitan area of nearly a million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said in an interview that he understood that Uyesugi was
under some kind of unusual stress at work. In his job as a customer
service engineer, Xerox said, Uyesugi serviced and repaired
printers and copiers.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said that Uyesugo walked into the company offices, not
far from the Honolulu International Airport, and that shortly after
8 a.m. he opened fire with a 9 mm pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Five people were killed in a conference room and two in an
office nearby on the second floor of the warehouse-like building.
All the victims were men, ranging in age from 33 to the 58, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Richard Soo of the Fire Department said that the victims
were already dead by the time he arrived at 8:30 a.m. and that no
one else in the building had been wounded, indicating that the
gunman had killed each of his targets before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings, police said, Uyesugi climbed into the van
and drove to the Hawaii Nature Center, a public botanical garden
and park in a rustic part of Oahu, Upper Makiki Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Police found the van there later in the morning after having
been alerted by a jogger. They sealed off the area and began
negotiating with Uyesugi through a megaphone. They eventually
brought in his brother, who is reportedly a state employee, Harris
said. Uyesugi appeared calm, even walking around outside the van at
times.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, the mayor praised the police for
bringing the standoff to an end without further loss of life, and
said: ``Our prayers and thoughts are with the families of the
victims. They have been drawn into a horror that rarely touches our
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Lipari, a Xerox official at the company's headquarters in
Stamford, Conn., said the building where the shootings took place
was for parts, maintenance and service training. Only four people
worked there normally, Ms. Lipari said, but more were there Tuesday
because of a staff meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The incident ranks among the 10 deadliest workplace shootings in
the United States. In 1986, Pat Sherrill locked himself inside the
post office where he worked in Edmond, Okla., killing 14 people and
wounding at least 20 others, the single deadliest episode of
workplace violence in American history. Last July, in the most
recent case with high fatalities, Mark Barton opened fire inside
two stock trading firms in Atlanta, killing nine people. He had
previously killed his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's attack left many Hawaiians, even those used to dealing
with crimes and injuries, stunned. ``I've been with the Fire
Department for 23 years, and this is definitely the worst I've
seen,'' Soo said. ``You just don't see this in Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   People at the Xerox building were quiet and in shock after the
attack, Soo said. The shootings took place at a technical support
center at 1200 North Nimitz Highway, in a light industrial area
called Kalihi-Kai, about 10 minutes from the airport. Police closed
the highway shortly after being called, causing huge traffic jams
in the morning rush hour on a major highway linking downtown
Honolulu and the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings are ``a comment on what a violent society we've
become,'' Harris said. ``It's really a wake-up call for all of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that Uyesugi, a 15-year Xerox
employee, had been a member of his high-school rifle team.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Uyesugi was registered as the owner of 17 guns, but
a neighbor said there was no sign that he might become a killer.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, police removed 18 guns from Uyesugi's home
with the assistance of his father. There were 11 handguns, 5 rifles
and 2 shotguns, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Kameda, who lives across from Uyesugi on Easy Street, in
the Nuuanu district of Honolulu, said: ``He was a very quiet
person, very nice. No trouble, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   He had lived in the neighborhood all his life, Ms. Kameda said,
and was not married. His brother and his father lived with him, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Uyesugi was known, Ms. Kameda said, for the rare tropical fish
he raised.

LUCKY STORES BECOME ALBERTSON'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 400 Lucky stores in California and Nevada will become
Albertson's stores today, making Albertson's the largest
supermarket chain in California and the second-largest chain in the
nation, company officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ``marriage,'' as Albertson's officials were calling it
Tuesday, marks the end of a nearly 70-year-old nameplate in the
supermarket industry. Lucky joins chains such as Alpha Beta, The
Boys, Smith's and Food Giant as former brands now swallowed up by
larger competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have entered into this marriage very seriously,'' said Gary
Michael, Albertson's chief executive officer. ``The union produces
a great new company with new strengths and new opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's acquisition of American Stores Co. of Salt Lake
City, Lucky's parent company, was announced in August 1998. The
$11.7
</P>
<P>
   billion acquisition was approved by state and federal regulators
in June.
</P>
<P>
   The combined chain now operates 470 stores in California and
Nevada, according to Michael Read, vice president of public affairs
for Albertson's. To prevent local monopolies, the company sold 140
stores before the merger received government approval.
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's officials decided to kill the 68-year-old Lucky
brand after market research showed the company would be more
successful using a single brand name in California, Michael said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky got its start in 1931 as the Peninsula Shores chain in the
San Francisco Bay area. Charles Crouch, one of five original
investors in the six-store company, often referred to them as his
``lucky stores''; the name stuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age, determining whose name to take after
getting married has become more of a real question than simply
changing your driver's license,'' Michael told reporters at a
Tuesday news conference in front of an Albertson's in West Los
Angeles. ``The fact is we need to present a consistent image to our
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those customers is C.J. Lyons, who has shopped at a Lucky
grocery store in West Hills since moving to Chatsworth in the
mid-1970s. ``It will be interesting to see if they have the quality
of Albertson's at Lucky's prices,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey McLaughlin, a former employee of both Lucky and
Albertson's who now teaches physical education at Campbell Hall
school in North Hollywood, said she hopes the marriage will lead to
lower prices. ``It is always hard when there is a change,''
McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the name change, the company plans to expand its
Bonus Buy Program to all stores and eliminate the Lucky/Sav-on
Rewards Card. The Bonus Buy program provides immediate price
discounts without the use of a club card.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today, card holders will be asked to turn in their
Rewards Cards in a designated box at all store locations.
</P>
<P>
   With each card returned, Albertson's will make a donation to the
Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, said Michael, up to
$500,000. In addition, donations in the amount of $5,000 were
announced Tuesday to several Los Angeles area charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This donation is going to help us continue the services we
provide,'' said Zola Jones, with Great Beginnings for Black Babies.
The organization provides prenatal care services to women who may
not be able to afford them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael also announced Albertson's will donate $25
</P>
<P>
   million next year in California and Las Vegas spread out over
three programs: The Community Partner Card which raises money for
various charities; grants to nonprofit organizations; and food
donations to homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's officials said Tuesday's announcement will have no
impact on the Sav-on drugstore chain, which it also acquired as
part of the American Stores purchase.Max Foods and SuperSavor
stores will continue to operate under their existing names, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Boise, Idaho, Albertson's currently operates more than
2,400 stores in 38 states, with approximately 220,000 employees.
