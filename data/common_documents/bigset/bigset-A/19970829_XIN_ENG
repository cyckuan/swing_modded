<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Holds Talks With Yugoslavia Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vice-premier and foreign
minister Qian Qichen said today that China supports Yugoslavia's
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Qian said this during his talks with Milan Milutinovic, foreign
minister of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, who is here on an
official visit to China as Qian's guest.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers reached consensus on a wide range of
issues concerning bilateral relations and international situation.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that Sino-Yugoslav relations have been restored and
strengthened totally and rapidly since the lift of UN's sanction
against Yugoslavia, with the frequent contacts between leaders of
the two countries and the increase of bilateral exchange in
various fields. China is satisfied with the development of
bilateral ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the fact that China values its ties with Yugoslavia
and is willing to establish a long-term and stable relationship of
cooperation with the country on the basis of mutual respect,
equality, mutual benefit and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Milutinoivc said that political relations between Yugoslavia
and China are "very good". Yugoslavia would work for the further
growth of the two countries' economic and trade cooperation, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the hope that the two sides would increase contacts,
promote mutual understanding and explore more ways of cooperation
to bring bilateral economic and trade cooperation to a new high.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic reiterated that Yugoslavia would continue to take
the "one China" position, for which Qian expressed his
appreciation and thanks.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic also briefed Qian on the development of the
situation in the former Yugoslavia and spoke highly of China's
stance on the issues concerning the area.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his appreciation for Yugoslavia's efforts in
realizing the peace in the former Yugoslavia. The Chinese
government is pleased to see that the peace process has been
steadily consolidated and the relations among the countries in the
former Yugoslavia have been continuously normalized, Qian said,
adding that China believes Yugoslavia would continue to dedicate
itself to the peace and stability in this region.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, an agreement on a  1997-1999 cooperation
plan in culture and education between the two governments was
signed.

<HEADLINE> Albright Plans Trip to Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright is planning a trip to Syria for talks with President
Hafez al-Assad during her first official visit to the Middle East
next month, the New York Times said today.
</P>
<P>
Although Albright's trip to the Middle East is primarily to get
the Palestinians and Israelis back on the peace track, she is also
interested in attempting to restart suspended peace negotiations
between Syria and Israel, the newspaper quoted U.S. officials and
Middle East diplomats as saying.
</P>
<P>
The State Department has not formally announced the dates or
itinerary of Albright's trip, which is expected in the second week
of September. One senior official stressed, "The final decisions
on her trip are yet to be made."
</P>
<P>
Albright has deliberately refrained from visiting the Middle
East until she felt a trip could make a difference in peace
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The current crisis between Israel and the Palestinians, and a
new American drive to press the two sides to focus on a final
settlement rather than taking interim steps, persuaded her to go,
as long as the Palestinians restore at least a limited degree of
security cooperation with the Israelis, the officials said.

<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- China's research into digital
high-definition television (HDTV) is proceeding smoothly, and
comprehensive testing is scheduled for next year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts disclosed the information during today's
opening session of the 1997 International Symposium on
Broadcasting Technology (ISBT).
</P>
<P>
Related research is divided into seven different areas such as
television chips, and transmission and receiving technology,
according to Du Baichuan, chairman of ISBT '97 and vice-president
of China Academy of Broadcasting Sciences.
</P>
<P>
However, Du said that China has not as yet determined which
approach to adopt for HDTV. China will decide whether to select ATSC
Standards from the United States or DVB Standards from Europe.
</P>
<P>
The symposium featured a demonstration by the Advanced
Television Systems Committee (ATSC).
</P>
<P>
ATSC Standards have been formally adopted in the United States
and an aggressive implementation process is currently underway.
</P>
<P>
The biennial ISBT conference provides the world's top
management in the fields of broadcasting, equipment manufacturing
and program production a venue for exploring state-of-the-art

<HEADLINE> Arafat Says Lifting of Bethlehem Closure Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat today welcomed Israel's lifting of
the internal closure of Bethlehem, but still demanded an end to
the total closure of Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a tour of the West Bank city Hebron, Arafat
said the lifting of the blockade of Bethlehem was not enough. He
repeated the charges that the continued total closure of the
territories by Israel constituted "a collective punishment" of the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Since the July 30 twin suicide bombings in Jerusalem's Mahane
Yehuda market which killed 16 people, Israel has imposed a total
closure on the territories, including a travel ban on Palestinians
living in the Palestinian cities, and frozen most of the tax
revenues owed to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
In moves to ease the rising tension caused by the closure,
Israel has gradually lifted the internal travel ban before
Wednesday on most of the West Bank cities except Bethlehem, where
Israel suspected that the masterminds of the July 30 bombings were
hidding.
</P>
<P>
The extended blockade of Bethlehem led to two days of
clashes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian protesters from
Tuesday, during which dozens of Palestinians were wounded by
rubber bullets fired by Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Israel finally decided Wednesday to lift the internal travel
ban on Bethlehem, because of the fear about an explosion of
the situation and out of international pressures.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel maintains the total closure on the Palestinian
territories, saying that its lifting was conditional on the PNA's
actions to crack down on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has stated that the security relations between the
two sides had been improved to enable the United States
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to conduct her first
visit to the region. He is expecting Albright to pressure
Israel to end all the Israeli sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Today's New York Times reported that Albright is due to
visit the region in the second week of September.
</P>
<P>
During her trip to the Middle East, Albright is to stop
in Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Syria and will work to revive
the stalled peace process on both the Israeli-Palestinian and
Israeli-Syrian tracks.

<HEADLINE> Logo, Mascot of '99 Expo Kunming Decided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The result of logo and mascot
design for the '99 International Horticultural Exposition, was
announced at a press conference held by the Information Office of
the State Council here today.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jing, Chinese Government representative and
secretary-general of the Organizing Committee of the exposition,
said the logo is a green flower cupped in a hand. "It highlights
the nature of Exposition '99, and symbolizes a harmonious
relationship between human and nature, demonstrating the theme of
the exposition -- Human and Nature, Marching Towards the 21st
Century," he said.
</P>
<P>
The mascot is a snub-nosed monkey, which is a unique and rare
species found in Southwest China's Yunnan Province, according to
Liu, also vice-governor of Yunnan. He added the personified monkey
has a "lovely and joyful" look and is "full of energy."
</P>
<P>
The monkey is holding flowers and wearing a bright-color
shirt marked with EXPO '99 China, Kunming. This implies China and
the city of Kunming warmly welcome visitors from all over the
world, Liu explained.
</P>
<P>
The respective designers of the logo and mascot were two women,
Wand Shiwen from China's National Arts and Crafts Academy and Feng
Xiaohong from China's Package Decorating and Designing corporation.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory work of the exposition is well underway, Liu
said, and the infrastructure construction is in full swing. He
said the framework of a new airport lounge is completed.
</P>
<P>
Sources revealed that the Chinese Government extended
invitations to 162 foreign countries and regions at the end of
last year. Up to now, 101 countries and regions have expressed the
willingness to attend the exposition, and 35 of them have decided
to participate in principle.
</P>
<P>
Liu described the solicitation of domestic participants as
"smooth." The participation plan of China's 31 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities will be submitted to the
Organizing Committee within a month.
</P>
<P>
This horticultural gala is a special exposition of the highest
level. It will be held from May 1 through October 31, 1999 in
Southwest China's Kunming, known as a "spring city."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing is chairman of the Organizing
Committee of the exposition.

<HEADLINE> OSPAR Meeting to Vote Against Radioactive Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Environmentalists from European
Union countries will assess at the forthcoming OSPAR (Oslo-Paris)
Commission meeting a joint initiative by Ireland and Denmark to
stop radioactive discharges in the northeast Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
"This inter-governmental meeting is the first one addressing
the issue of radioactive pollution since new governments were
elected both in France and Britain," said Remi Parmentier,
Greenpeace representative to the OSPAR Commission, in a press
release distributed here today.
</P>
<P>
The OSPAR Commission, to meet from September 2 to 5 in
Brussels, regulates marine pollution in the northeast Atlantic,
from Gibraltar to the Arctic.
</P>
<P>
The Irish-Danish initiative came after several months of
controversy over the environmental impacts of radioactive
discharges from the plutonium reprocessing facilities in La Hague
of France and in Sellafield of Britain.
</P>
<P>
Parmentier said that people would see at the forthcoming
meeting whether the claim by the new administrations in both
countries to place environmental protection atop their political
agenda is true or false.
</P>
<P>
In June, sampling by Greenpeace of the liquid waste from the La
Hague discharge pipe found that the sea-bed around the pipe had
been turned into radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
Further revelations in the ensuing month have led the new
French government to close off the area around the pipe to all
maritime activities.
</P>
<P>
In early August, research made public in Britain revealed that
plutonium discharged from the Sellafield plant had been detected
in thousands of teeth from children throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Founded in the mid-1970s, the inter-governmental OSPAR
Commission includes Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Finland,
Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal,
Ireland, the Netherlands, Britain and the European Commission.

<HEADLINE> Euro to Be Credible From Start: EU Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The single European currency,
or euro, will have to be credible from inauguration in early 1999,
the European economic, monetary and financial commissioner said
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting held by the Group of the European People's
Party (PPE) at St-Jacques de Compostelle of Spain, Yves-Thibault
de Silguy said the euro should be a credible currency from the
very beginning.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner cited as positive proof for euro credibility
the lowering and stabilizing of budget deficit and interest rate
in the 15-nation union, according to a copy of his speech
available here.
</P>
<P>
De Silguy said that in 1993 EU countries had an average budget
deficit of 6.3 percent whereas this year's figure will be 3
percent or less.
</P>
<P>
He told PPE members that in the past five years average
interest rates within the EU has been declining and now long-term
interest rates stabilized around 7 percent while short-term rates
at 4.6 percent, a result the commissioner described as commitments
by EU member states to the Amsterdam Treaty.
</P>
<P>
De Silguy also said that in the early 1980s most EU countries
suffered from double-digit inflation but now inflation has been
tamed by big margins.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday the commissioner told a forum held in Austria that
EU-wide inflation is expected to remain within 2.2 percent in 1997
and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Another positive factor de Silguy cited was the economic
development within the union. He said that growth is expected to
reach 2.4 percent this year and 2.8 percent next year, as compared
with 1.6 percent last year among EU countries.
</P>
<P>
Upwards of 2 million jobs will have been created by the
economic development this year and next.
</P>
<P>
The EU will list out in early 1998 the countries to be in the
first wave of joining the single currency mechanism.
</P>
<P>
But up till now, only Luxembourg has met both requirements
regulated by the Maastricht Treaty, that is, a country's budget
deficit cannot exceed 3 percent of its gross domestic product
(GDP) while its debt cannot exceed 60 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands are closing the gaps
toward meeting the requirements while Belgium, Luxembourg,
Ireland, Finland, Italy and the Netherlands have worked out
detailed plans concerning the transition toward the euro.
</P>
<P>
Five other countries will hand in their plans for transition
later this year, according to de Silguy.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Singaporean Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong today said that he opposes the inclusion of the Taiwan
Straits in the geographical scope of the proposed guidelines on
Japan-U.S. defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Goh, who arrived here Wednesday for a three-day visit, made the
remarks when meeting with members from the Japanese ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) and its two parliamentary allies, the
Social Democratic Party (SDP) and New Party Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
He said that Singapore considers Taiwan China's internal
affairs and urged Japan to reassure China over the Taiwan issue
when Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto visits China from
September 4-7.
</P>
<P>
Goh also expressed concern over a possible change in Japan's
military posture from its current emphasis on defense to a more
aggressive role under the proposed closer military ties between
Tokyo and Washington.
</P>
<P>
On August 17, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama
said that the new Japanese-U.S. guidelines would cover the Taiwan
Straits, which prompted immediate condemnation from China.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were later confirmed by a series of senior
government officials in Japan, including Foreign Minister Yukihiko
Ikeda who said the remarks were in line with the consistent
position of the Japanese government.

<HEADLINE> Lufthansa Posts Record Pre-Tax Profit in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The German airline Lufthansa today
posted a record pre-tax profit of 397 million marks (220 million
U.S. dollars) in the first half of this year, more than double the
previous high achieved in the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The result, compared to the 119 million marks (65.9 million
dollars) in the same period last year, came on revenues of 10.7
billion marks (5.9 billion dollars), up 9.1 percent over the first
half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to Lufthansa, it has greatly benefited from a strong
dollar, otherwise the earnings would have been 275 million marks
(152.4 million dollars) less and its air cargo unit Lufthansa
Cargo would not have turned to be profitable during the period.
</P>
<P>
The German airline also attributed the strong first-half result
to cost cutting efforts, noting that operational costs had been
reduced by 2 percent despite a 25 percent rise in fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of long-range flight services and a new pricing
policy at the Lufthansa Cargo were also contributing factors, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa said that strong performance continued in July and
August and it expected the positive trends would continue
throughout this year.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. President: Netanyahu Brings Setback to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter
today voiced concern over the stagnant Mideast peace process,
saying that the election of Benjamin Netanyahu as Israeli Prime
Minister signaled a "dangerous setback" in the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Carter, who was making a stop-over at the Cairo International
Airport on his way back home from Ethiopia, lamented the
five-month peace impasse, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu has not achieved any further progress towards peace
as did his predecessors Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli former Labor government leaders Rabin and Peres have
been the architects of the Arab-Israeli peace process which
started in 1991.
</P>
<P>
During the two-hour stopover here, Carter said the peace drive
must not be halted, emphasizing that negotiations are the sole way
for attaining peace.
</P>
<P>
He further said he is personally concerned over happenings in
the Palestinian territories, expressing hope that Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and other Arab leaders would succeed in
getting the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's launching of a 6,500-unit Jewish settlement in East
Jerusalem in March threw into deep crisis the Mideast peacemaking,
which was compounded by the July 30 suicide bombing attacks in
Jerusalem which killed 16 people.
</P>
<P>
Israel slapped economic sanctions and overall closure on the
West Bank and Gaza in the wake of the bombings.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is scheduled to
travel to the region in September with a major U.S. initiative
to revive the stalled peace process.

<HEADLINE> Belarusian President Promises to Free Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said Belarusian President had promised to free two journalists
working for a Moscow television station detained for a border
violation.
</P>
<P>
Interfax news agency quoted Yeltsin as saying Alexander
Lukashenko said in their telephone talks that he needed "a couple
of days to settle the problem" and then the journalists would be
released.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also said he would further discuss the matter with
Lukashenko when the Belarusian president came to Moscow in early
September to attend the celebrations of the city's 850th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Another report from Belarusian capital of Minsk quoted
Lukashenko as saying the issue would be settled after he met with
Yeltsin. Their meeting was planned for September 6 or 7 in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko noted that "the key to resolving the situation is
not in Minsk." ORT must review their approach to relations with
Belarus and must at least apologize, he said.
</P>
<P>
Seven Journalists from Russia's ORT television were detained
recently in Belarus after filming on the Belarusian-Lithuanian
border.
</P>
<P>
Five Russian journalists were released last week but the rest,
who are Belarusian citizens, remain in jail pending trial for
allegedly trying to violate the Belarusian border.
</P>
<P>
The detentions angered Moscow, and some Kremlin officials
hinted that Minsk's reluctance to free the crews could hurt a
loose union the two former Soviet republics have been building
under an agreement signed in April.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who was dispatched
to sort out the incident, arrived in Minsk on Wednesday and had
two rounds of talks with Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks were "very useful and productive" and both
sides stressed that they would not let the matter affect their
union.
</P>
<P>
Belarus, sandwiched among Russia, Ukraine and Poland, has
enjoyed close bond with Russia. Most of the 10 million Belarusians
hope the union with some 150 million Russians could end their
economic hardships.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Rejects Turkish Claim on Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Government Spokesman
Manolis Christofides today categorically denied Turkish claims
that the first components of the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft
missile system will be installed in Cyprus by December.
</P>
<P>
He told delegates at the 10th World Conference of Overseas
Cypriots that the surface-to-air missiles "will arrive in the
middle of 1998, but they will not arrive at all if agreement is
reached on President (Glafcos) Clerides' proposal for
demilitarization, or if there is progress on the Cyprus problem
which would justify such a decision."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks following reports that Turkey
entered a state of alert Tuesday after receiving information that
Russia has begun shipping to Cyprus components of the missile
system.
</P>
<P>
According to the Turkish daily Hurriyet, stringent security
measures have been taken along the Bosporus Strait by Turkish
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government signed an agreement in January with
Russia to purchase the missiles, saying they will be used to
protect the military bases at the western coast of the island.
</P>
<P>
The agreement triggered criticism from the U.S. and some other
western countries. Turkey has threatened it will launch
preemptive strikes against Cyprus if the Russian-made missiles are
deployed.
</P>
<P>
However, the Cypriot government has repeatedly stated that no
missiles will arrive in Cyprus if enough progress is made in
ongoing U.N.-led efforts to solve the protracted Cyprus problem,
or if Clerides' proposal for the complete demilitarization of the
island is accepted by the Turkish side.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops invaded and took over the
northern third in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained 35,000 troops in Cyprus' northern third
since its invasion of the island.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference of overseas Cypriots began on Monday in
Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Canada Asked to Buy New Subs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain and the United States are
encouraging Canada to buy four Upholder submarines to replace its
aging sub fleet, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
To lure Canada into the deal, Britain has offered Canadian
companies special access to its defense-procurement programs for
eight years.
</P>
<P>
And the British Ministry of Defense would waive rules that
require a minimum of work on defense contracts to be performed in
that country, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the builder of the submarines has promised to give
some work to Canadian firms.
</P>
<P>
As a sign of support for the purchase, the U.S. has offered to
pay Canada to allow U.S. forces to train with the new subs, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government has been grappling with the issue since
July 1995 when it first considered a British offer of four
mothballed Upholder-class subs.
</P>
<P>
The subs, worth about 360 million U.S. dollars each, were
retired soon after delivery in the early 1990 when Britain decided
to focus on a nuclear-powered sub fleet.
</P>
<P>
The Upholders use diesel-engine and electric-motor technology.
They have a life span of 30 years.
</P>
<P>
At present, Canada has three Oberon-class diesel-electric subs
dating from the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
A final decision on the Upholders will be made by the end of
this year, according to Canadian Defense Minister Art Eggleton.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes U.S. Statement on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today expressed welcome
to a U.S. State Department statement to the effect that the
United States recognizes only the legal government of the
Republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin was quoted as
saying Wednesday that "the U.S. recognizes the government in
Nicosia as the legitimate government of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. maintains contacts with both Greek
Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders on the island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Cypriot government
spokesman Manolis Christofides expressed satisfaction with the
U.S. State Department's statement, saying that the statement
"complies with all U.N. resolutions which call upon all
governments to recognize the Republic of Cyprus and its legal
government."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. statement was made one day after Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini spoke about the existence of two
governments in Cyprus, following a meeting in Rome Tuesday with
his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem.
</P>
<P>
Dini's remarks prompted an angry response from both Nicosia
and Athens, which will lodge protest against the Italian
government on the issue.
</P>
<P>
A written statement issued by Italian Foreign Ministry later
tried to clarify Dini's statements and reiterated that there is
no change in Italy's policy toward Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, in a
telephone conversation Wednesday with Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis, pledged that Italy remains firm in its positions and
reiterated that a Cyprus solution should be based on relevant
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Christofides described Prodi's announcement as a development
which satisfied the Cypriot government and restores political
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides will be visiting Rome soon for a meeting with his
Italian counterpart Dini to seek clarification from the latter
on the matter.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Prodigy Inc., the fourth
largest internet service provider in the U.S., is making big
progress by entering into the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The Investor's Business Daily reported today that the company
grew faster in the second quarter than any of the other top
players. It said that White Plains, N.Y.-based Prodigy grew 18
percent to 1 million subscribers from 850,000. America Online
(AOL), the largest in all, rose 9 percent to 8.6 million.
</P>
<P>
No. 2 CompuServe Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, fell 6 percent to 5.4
million members. And Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft Corp.'s
Microsoft Network stayed at 2.3 million members. Prodigy's gain
moved it ahead of New York-based AT&AMP;T Corp's WorldNet service,
which rose 6 percent to 900,000.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that Prodigy will have trouble making
inroads in the U.S. and Europe, where AOL and CompuServe are
entrenched, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Prodigy has become the first non-Chinese Internet service
provider in China, according to the report. And it is going into
Mexico and South America.
</P>
<P>
Analysts agree that international growth will continue to lead
the way for U.S. Internet service providers to expand their market
shares.
</P>
<P>
In addition to China, Mexico and South America, Prodigy has
begun service in several African countries and is exploring
ventures in Central America, the paper said. The company expects
international business eventually will account for 40 percent of
revenue. It now accounts for just a fraction of sales, a company
spokeswoman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Unlike building a local infrastructure in the U.S., the company
is partnering with foreign phone companies to develop a network of
Internet access points in their market.

<HEADLINE> Strong Growth Predicted for German Car Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The German automobile production is
expecting a strong growth this year thanks to increasing domestic
demand and strong exports, Bernd Gottschalk, president of the
German Automobile Association (VDA), said in Frankfurt today.
</P>
<P>
For 1997 as a whole, the country's car production would
increase "by at least 4 percent" to a total of 5 million passenger
cars and commercial vehicles, said Gottschalk.
</P>
<P>
The VDA chief said that Germany's domestic demand is picking
up. He predicted the country's new car registrations this year to
grow by 1 percent to reach 3.53 million.
</P>
<P>
In addition, exports in the first seven months of this year had
risen by a further 8 percent, Gottschalk noted. Exports now
account for about 60 percent of overall car production in Germany,
compared with 47 percent in 1991, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
As a result of expanded production, Gottschalk also said that
the German car industry was for the first time since 1993 creating
additional jobs. The sector employed 669,500 workers by the end of
June, 14,000 more than at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Gottschalk, during the first half of this year,
Germany's car plants abroad had also boosted output by 13 percent
to 1.37 million.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The fertility rate in
Tanzania has declined by 7 percent to 5.8 children per woman at
present from 6.3 children in 1992, acting director of census

</P>
<P>
On fertility preference, only 5 percent of women and men
regard a two-child family as ideal, Ngalaba said, noting that if
unwanted births could be eliminated, the total fertility rate in
the country would be 5.1 births per woman instead of the present
5.8.

Seventy one percent of women and 67 percent of men know at
least three modern family planning methods. Sixteen percent of
Tanzanian women are currently using contraceptives while the use

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations today adopted a draft resolution, deciding to
impose sanctions on the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Expressing its grave concern at the serious difficulties in the
peace process of Angola, the Security Council reiterated its firm
commitment to preserve the unity, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The council urged the government of Angola and in particular
UNITA to complete without further delay the implementation of
their obligations under the Lusaka Protocol and the relevant
resolutions of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
It urged UNITA to implement immediately its obligations,
including demilitarization of all its forces, transformation of
its radio station Vorgan into a non-partisan broadcasting facility
and full cooperation in the process of the normalization of state
administration throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called on all states to prevent the entry
into or transit through their territories of all senior officials
of UNITA and adult members of their immediate families except
those officials necessary for the full functioning of the
Government of Unity and National Reconciliation, the National
Assembly, or the Joint Commission.
</P>
<P>
The council also called on all states to suspend or cancel all
travel documents, visas or residence permits issued to senior
UNITA officials and the adult members of their immediate families.
</P>
<P>
It urged all states to deny permission to any aircraft to take
off from, land in, or overfly their territories and to close
immediately and completely all UNITA offices in their territories.
</P>
<P>
The council called on all states and all international and
regional organizations to act strictly in accordance with this
resolution.
</P>
<P>
It expressed its readiness to consider the imposition of
additional measures such as trade and financial restrictions if
UNITA does not fully comply with its obligations under the Lusaka
Protocol and all relevant Security Council resolutions.

<TEXT>
<P>
MESSINA, Sicily, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Cuba won two gold medals on
the third day of the Universiade swimming tournament through Olympic
bronze medalist Neisser Bent and Marcos Hernandez on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Beng, a black swimmer who won the men's 100 meters backstroke
bronze medal at the Atlanta Olympics, took the title of his specialty
in a time of 55.82 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the men's 100 meters freestyle final, Hernandez became
the winner after clocking 50.50.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which had won the most golds since the beginning of the
swimming tournament, won two more titles in the women's 400 meters
freestyle and 200 meters backstroke.
</P>
<P>
Eri Yamanoi, who won a bronze medal in the 800 meters freestyle on
Tuesday, got her first gold at the Universiade by winning the 400
meters freestyle final at 4:16.30.
</P>
<P>
Sachiko Miyaji, also from Japan, took the silver of the event at
4:16.40, followed by Juile Varozza of the United States in the third
place at 4:16.49.
</P>
<P>
Russia claimed the gold and silver medals of the men's 100 meters
breaststroke. Stanislav Lopoukhov won the title at 1:02.74, followed
by preliminaries leader Alexandre Tkachev in the second place at
1:02.77. The bronze medal was taken by Chikara Nakashita of Japan who
was timed at 1:03.05.
</P>
<P>
The Americans kept their winning streak in the relay events by
adding a gold in the women's 4X100 meters freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
The American quartet, apparently in an effort to break the
Universiade record of 3;46.41 set by their Chinese counterparts at
Sheffield in 1991, were out of the record-setting pace and clocked
only 3:47.80.
</P>
<P>
But the result was good enough to bring them the gold, the third
relay title the Americans won in the Universiade swimming tournament.

ALGIERS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A bomb parcel exploded here

Eye witnesses said the explosion took place at Abdul Qadir Ouda

There is no immediate claim of responsibility for the terrorist
attack but it is believed to be part of a series of violent acts

<HEADLINE> Chinese Representative Speaks at UN on Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- China said here today
that peace and stability can be truly achieved in Angola and its
people reenjoy a peaceful and stable life only when the Lusaka
Protocol and other agreements reached by the Government of Angola
and UNITA are implemented in real earnest.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Wang Xuexian, deputy permanent representative of
China to the United Nations, was speaking at the Security Council
before voting in favor of a draft resolution to impose sanctions
on the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Wang said China felt deeply anxious and sad at the current
difficulties on the peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that two years ago, China was elated at the signing
of the Lusaka Protocol, which brought hope of peace to the
war-torn Angolan people. Just four months ago, China hailed the
establishment of the Angolan Government of Unity and National
Reconciliation, which China regarded as the start of a new era for
Angola, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that regrettably, what China had seen in Angola over
a period of time were renewed conflicts in some parts of the
country, further delay in the normalization of state
administration and failure to complete the demilitarization of
UNITA forces.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the Angolan people had waited for peace for a long
time. The international community had also made tremendous efforts
to settle the Angola question. At this final juncture of the
Angolan peace process, any irresponsible action to the peace
commitment went against the fundamental interests of the Angolan
people.
</P>
<P>
Wang added China was of the view that it was necessary to the
Council to take further measures against UNITA in conformity with
the will of the Angolan people to ensure smooth progress and
ultimate completion of the Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
Wang said China had always taken a very prudent approach toward
sanctions. However, for the purpose of an early realization of
peace in Angola and as a special case, China did not take
exception to the measures contained in the draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
Wang said China hoped that UNITA would seize up the situation,
change its course of action against the popular will on the
question of peace, renounce separatist rule and complete
demilitarization of its forces at an early date, thereby avoiding
the implementation of the above-mentioned measures.
</P>
<P>
Wand said China hoped to see UNITA return to the track of unity
and cooperation and, under the unified leadership of the Angolan
Government of Unity and National Reconciliation, make its
contribution to the early realization of national reconciliation
and peace and to reconstruction and development in Angola.

<HEADLINE> UK Cot Deaths Rise 6 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The number of cot deaths in
Britain rose 6 percent last year, the first time in eight years
and reversing a downward trend of 61 percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to figures issued today by the Office for National
Statistics, a total of 499 babies, up from 470 the year before and
a rate of 70 out of every 100,000 live births, died unexpectedly
within a year of birth in Britain in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that cot death is still the most common killer
of babies between one and 12 months old and it accounts for the
death of almost 10 babies each week in Britain.
</P>
<P>
A total of 85 percent of the deaths occurred among babies under
six months and 61 percent involved boys.
</P>
<P>
The Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths said that it
hoped the rise in deaths was a blip rather than the start of a
trend.
</P>
<P>
Joyce Epstein, secretary-general of the foundation, said, "We
don't know exactly how this has occurred. What is clear is that
further research is still needed to shed light on why babies die."
</P>
<P>
However, the latest figures are still far below those of the
late 1980s, when there were more than 1,300 cot deaths a year in
the country.

<HEADLINE> UK Trade Deficit Rises to 1.5 Bln Dlrs in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain's world trade deficit
widened to 950 million pounds (1.5 billion US dollars) in June,
giving evidence that the strong pound is hurting exporters,
official figures showed today.
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the Office for National Statistics
(ONS), UK's global trade gap widened from 733 million pounds (1.2
billion US dollars) in May to 950 million pounds (1.5 billion US
dollars) in June as import growth, boosted by the consumer boom,
outstripped growth in exports.
</P>
<P>
The value of UK exports to the rest of the world in June rose
by 1.3 percent to 14,120 million pounds (22.7 billion US dollars),
while imports were up by 2.6 percent to 15,070 million pounds
(24.3 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UK trade deficit between the first and second
quarters of the year rose from 2,053 million pounds (3.3 billion
US dollars) to 2,596 million pounds (4.2 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the wider than expected global trade deficit
was mainly the result of a fall in the oil surplus which declined
to its lowest level for nearly four years and a surge in imports,
particularly cars and consumer goods.

<HEADLINE> Manhattan Hotels Gain in First Half of 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Occupancy rates at Manhattan
hotels stood at 81.5 percent for the first six months of 1997, a
4.7 percent increase over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The average daily room rate for the hotels was 171.39 U.S.
dollars in the first half of 1997, an 11 percent rise over the
154.43 dollars in the year-earlier period, according to Coopers &AMP;
Lybrand L.L.P., a leading U.S. professional services firm.
</P>
<P>
Four out of five hotel types on the 22 square mile island --
deluxe, first-class, convention and tourist-class -- experienced
occupancy growth in 1997, its research arm, the Lodging Research
Network reported today.
</P>
<P>
Tourist-class hotels enjoyed a 12.3 percent rise to 83.4
percent occupancy in the first half of 1997, the biggest gain
among all types of hotels.
</P>
<P>
Manhattan's luxury hotels saw a negligible occupancy drop, from
77.7 percent in the first half of 1996 to 77.5 percent in 1997,
but strong growth in the average room rate offset the occupancy
loss, the Network said.
</P>
<P>
Manhattan hotels' revenue per available room, an important
lodging industry measure, rose 16.2 percent from 120.29 dollars
for the first half of 1996 to 139.75 dollars for the same period
1997.
</P>
<P>
Hotel sources said commercial, leisure, transient and group
demand remains strong and they anticipate a modest occupancy rise
for the third quarter of this year.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Party Congress to Highlight Deng's Legacy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang once said that Deng's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics is "a great banner guiding the progress of
the socialist cause" and "a strong spiritual pillar for the
invigoration and development of the Chinese nation".
</P>
<P>
Since assuming full responsibility for the operations of the
Party and the nation, the third generation of collective
leadership with Jiang at the core has used every opportunity to
deepen reforms, expand the scope of opening-up, promote China's
development, and maintain the nation's stability.
</P>
<P>
Since the 14th National Party Congress in 1992, in particular,
they have held high the great banner of Deng's theory and
creatively advanced China's socialist cause. Their efforts have
injected vigor and vitality into the country's political, economic
and social life.
</P>
<P>
According to Pang Xianzhi, director of the Policy Research
Office of the CPC Central Committee, Deng's theory on building
socialism with Chinese characteristics is "a truth which has been
proved in the practice of China's reform and opening up drive".
</P>
<P>
He noted that Deng's theory summarized the fresh experience of
China's reforms, opening-up and socialist modernization drive over the
past two-odd decades, as well as historical experience in
building socialism since the founding of New China in 1949, and
the advanced experience of countries throughout the world.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
visiting French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said here today that
the two countries remained determined to hold on to the fiscal
criteria and the timetable for launching the planned single
European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
During their two-hour talks in Bonn, Kohl and Jospin agreed
that the introduction of a stable Euro on the planned start date
of January 1, 1999 and in strict adherence to the stability
criteria was vital for the future of Europe and its economic
competitiveness, German government spokesman Peter Hausmann said
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jospin arrived in Bonn earlier today on his first official
visit to Germany since the French Socialist government took office
in early June.

Jiang once said that Deng's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics is "a great banner guiding the progress of
the socialist cause" and "a strong spiritual pillar for the
invigoration and development of the Chinese nation".
</P>
<P>
Since assuming full responsibility for the operations of the
Party and the nation, the third generation of collective
leadership with Jiang at the core has used every opportunity to
deepen reforms, expand the scope of opening-up, promote China's
development, and maintain the nation's stability.
</P>
<P>
Since the 14th National Party Congress in 1992, in particular,
they have held high the great banner of Deng's theory and
creatively advanced China's socialist cause. Their efforts have
injected vigor and vitality into the country's political, economic
and social life.
</P>
<P>
According to Pang Xianzhi, director of the Policy Research
Office of the CPC Central Committee, Deng's theory on building
socialism with Chinese characteristics is "a truth which has been
proved in the practice of China's reform and opening up drive".
</P>
<P>
He noted that Deng's theory summarized the fresh experience of
China's reforms, opening-up and socialist modernization drive over the
past two-odd decades, as well as historical experience in
building socialism since the founding of New China in 1949, and
the advanced experience of countries throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The theory was the first to provide a relatively systematic
approach to a series of fundamental questions concerning building,
consolidating and developing socialism in countries like China, a
nation with a comparatively underdeveloped economy and education,

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Check Ships to Prevent Missile Delivery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will check carefully the
ships passing through the Turkish Straits to prevent the delivery
of Russian-made missiles to the Cypriot government, a senior
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The official with the Turkish Foreign Ministry, who asked not
to be identified, said that Turkey is closely following the
development on the issue, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The official said that so far no missile components have
reportedly been transported to the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that these surface-to-air S-300 missiles
can be transferred easily to the Cypriot government via Greece,
which is a firm supporter of the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Turkey expressed Wednesday its concern over the possible early
delivery of the Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles to the
Cypriot government, saying this issue will be an important
development to the region's security.
</P>
<P>
It has vowed to launch a military strike on the Greek Cypriots
if the Cypriot government goes ahead with the missile deal, which
was signed in January this year between the Cypriot government and
a Russian firm.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government's signing of the deal sparked a tension
on the island of Cyprus which is divided into the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot communities since 1974.
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming Turkey's strong opposition to the Russian-Cypriot
missile deal, the Foreign Ministry official warned that Turkey
will take necessary measures if the missile components are
transported into the island.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Turkish government have been maintaining
contacts with the United States, the European Union as well as
the United Nations with regard to the sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that an Egyptian ship was stopped and
searched by the Turkish security authorities because it was
suspected of carrying missiles components purchased by the
Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
However, nothing related to the suspected Russian missiles
were found in the ship.
</P>
<P>
Following the announcement of the Russian-Cypriot missile
deal, Turkey lodged a protest against the Russian government,
demanding Russia to stop this deal with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side said that as a sovereign state, the Cypriot
government has its right to purchase necessary weaponry, adding
that it had no intention to give up this arms deal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Cypriot government has repeatedly stated that
it buys these missiles from Russia for defense purpose.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when the Turkish
troops invaded and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally the founding of
"the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which is only
recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and the international community have made
efforts for decades in a bid to reunite the divided island
state, but no tangible results have been achieved so far.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Summit Opens in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, Nigeria, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The 20th summit of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) opened here
this afternoon to discuss peace and security as well as the
economic future of the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's newly-inaugurated President Charles Taylor and
ousted Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah were among the
heads of state and government of the 16 members attending the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Opening the summit, ECOWAS Chairman General Sani Abacha
extended a warm welcome on behalf of the sub-regional body to
Taylor's presence at the meeting as an elected president of
Liberia since 1990.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated Taylor's inauguration through "free and fair"
election with the help and recognition of the sub-region and the
entire international community.
</P>
<P>
General Abacha, who is also Nigerian president, strongly
condemned the May 25 coup in Sierra Leone that toppled the
legitimate government of Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that ECOWAS would stick to the three measures --
dialogue, sanctions and the use of force, to restore Kabbah's
government.
</P>
<P>
The chairman called on his counterparts to discuss the best
ways to solve the crisis in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Abacha also reviewed the economic achievements the
organization had made in the past year, warning that the progress
was slow, particularly in major issues such as the establishment
of a common customs union in the sub-region before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Ousted president Kabbah also condemned the coup in Sierra
Leone and urged the sub-regional leaders to help dislodge the
military junta without delay.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his gratitude to ECOWAS member states for their
assistance in bringing peace to Liberia, Taylor said he was
worried about the negative impact of the Sierra Leonean crisis on
the peace and security of his country.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the leaders of the member countries to
continue to support the efforts of the Liberian people in
reconstructing the country, which was devastated by the civil war
ignited by him seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
The summit is scheduled to close Friday and ECOWAS leaders are
expected to pass a final communique on peace, security and
economic integration of the sub-region.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Law Makers Agree on Reform Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's 110 law-makers from
both the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) and the
Opposition agreed today on forming a joint committee to spearhead
the constitutional reforms talks which are now in a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary members said in a joint statement that the
13-member inter-party committee will "play an executive role in
the dialogue and consultations" between the government and the
Opposition.
</P>
<P>
The decision is a severe blow to the Opposition umbrella body
National convention Executive Council (NCEC), which has claimed
full representation of the Opposition during talks with KANU.
</P>
<P>
The unregistered NCEC, set up in April by main Opposition
parties to coordinate their reform campaign, attempted to start
all-party talks Monday but was boycotted by KANU which insisted
talks be held only within legal framework.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the abortive talks, the NCEC announced it
would soon call mass action including a nationwide strike.
</P>
<P>
"This situation is driving the country to a political
precipice of calamity and catastrophe. The catastrophe must be
averted at all costs," said the law makers, vowing not to cede
their parliamentary authority to any lobby group, particularly
NCEC.
</P>
<P>
Several Opposition parliamentarians, including FORD-Asili
Secretary-General Martin Shikuku, today claimed that they are
willing to disband the NCEC to pave the way for a free and
genuine dialogue between them and their KANU counterparts.
</P>
<P>
From May to August, there have been fierce confrontations
between the government and the Opposition over constitutional
reforms before the general election.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are also trading charges on the responsibility
of the two-week violence which has killed at least 47 people in
the Coast Province including Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said today that thousands of residents there are
fleeing homes, fearing ethnic attacks by well-organized gunmen
and a police crackdown ordered by President Daniel arap Moi.

<HEADLINE> More Than 150,000 Suicides in Five Years in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- There were 154,444 suicideds,
12 per 100,000 people, in the United States between 1990 and 1994,
and guns were the most common suicide method, U.S. federal health
officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said 13
Western states have the highest rate of suicide, 14.1 per 100,000
people, followed by 13.1 in the South, 11.4 in the Midwest and 9.3
in the Northeast per 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Guns accounted for 69.8 percent of the methods in all the
suicides in the South, 58.3 percent in the West, 57.8 percent in
the Midwest and 44.9 percent in the Northeast, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
The adjusted rate of suicides involving firearms in the South
was 2.3 times the rate in the Northeast. The figures were adjusted
to account for demographic differences such as race, sex and age.
</P>
<P>
The three leading methods of suicide were firearms,
strangulation and overdose, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
The factors such as employment rates, economic opportunity and
social integration have been shown to affect suicide rates.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS to Seek UN Help on S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of west African countries
who are meeting in Abuja today are likely to appeal to the United
Nations for help in coping with the Sierra Leonean crisis.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministers meeting preparatory to the 20th summit of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has come
up with the recommendation that the assistance of the Security
Council is necessary, the Daily Times reported.
</P>
<P>
They proposed that ECOWAS leaders should enlist the U. N.
assistance to execute comprehensive arms and economic embargo on
the military junta in Sierra Leone which seized power in the May
25 coup.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit would also call on member countries to
"place immediately a general and total embargo on all supplies of
petroleum products, arms and military equipment to Sierra Leone
and abstain from doing business with that country."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministers suggested that the sub-regional
peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) employ "all necessary means" to
enforce a total land, sea and air blockade, and inspect, guard
and seize any ship, vehicle or aircraft violating the embargo.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers also recommended member states freeze
all funds in their territories owned by members of the illegal
regime of Major Johnny Paul Koroma, including military officers
and civilians directly or indirectly connected with the regime,
as well as their families.
</P>
<P>
The annual summit of the 16-member sub-regional economic bloc
has to deal with conflict in a member country each time since
1990, following the eruption of civil war in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
As peace has returned to Liberia, the crisis of Sierra Leone
will dominate the current summit.
</P>
<P>
To solve the crisis, which means to reinstate the ousted
legitimate government of Sierra Leone, ECOWAS has decided to take
three steps -- dialogue, sanctions and the use of force.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has said it would support any measures
taken by ECOWAS toward the restoration of Sierra Leone's
legitimate government of ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
With the failure in dialogue and sanctions, military action
has become the focus of debate among member states as the last
option.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is reported to be keen on the use of force while Ghana
opposes it. Both countries are key players in the peace process
in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Begho said Wednesday
his country will "cross" immediate use of force to flush out the
junta in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Even under the leadership of the Security Council, Ghana does
not hope "to be involved in an exercise that will lead to the
loss of lives in a fellow African country."
</P>
<P>
At present, some member countries still needed to be persuaded
to join the next line of action, he argued.
</P>
<P>
While final decision is to come at the end of the summit
Friday, it is time, as described by Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom
Ikimi, "to test the ability of our sub-region to fight to restore
peace to Sierra Leone."

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Imre Lengyel Wins 3-meter Springboard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MESSINA, Sicily, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Huangarian Imre Lengyel took
his second gold by winning the men's 3-meter diving event on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lengyel, who won the 1-meter springboard on Tuesday, staged a
superb performance on Thursday. His sixth dive, a backward three and
a half somersaults at pike position with a degree of difficulty at
3.4, earned him 86.70 points, the highest score of the night.
</P>
<P>
Lengyel entered the final as the 10th ranked qualifier. But he
gained such great an advantage in the final and finished with a total
of 651.63 points.
</P>
<P>
Runner-up Patrick Bogart of the United States collected 603.75 and
Dean Pullar of Australia won the bronze medal at 596.31 thanks for his
last dive which gave him 74.25 points.
</P>
<P>
Evan Stewart, world champion of 1-meter springboard and the most
famous diver in the 12 finalist, again failed to live to his
reputation. He finished fourth at 596.19.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the beginning of the diving tournament,
China failed to win a single medal in the 3-meter springbaord. Zhao
Xin ranked only sixth with a total of 584.13.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese diver Wang Tianling, who finished runner-up to
Lengyel in the 1-meter springboard competitions, withdrew from the
3-meter race due to injury.
</P>
<P>
The women's platform diving will be held on Friday while the men's
platform is scheduled on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> World Wheat Supply, Demand in 1997/98, IGC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- World wheat production is
forecast one million tons higher than last month at 586 million
tons, compared with 581 million tons in 1996/97, it was announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
The International Grains Council (IGC) said, however, the total
masks some major adjustments for individual countries. Increases
for China, India, Russia and the United States in aggregate offset
reductions for the EC, Central/Eastern Europe, Canada, Argentina
and Australia.
</P>
<P>
The IGC also said that changes to forecast import requirements
for several countries, including Russia, result in a reduction of
one million tons to 94 million tons for world trade.
</P>
<P>
Trade in wheat flour is likely to remain strong, reflecting
firm demand from Africa and Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
Based on current prospects for supplies of wheat and feed
grains, the IGC expected that world wheat consumption is forecast
at 582 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The availability of substantial amounts of poorer quality grain
in various countries could lead to an increase in feed use of
wheat depending on its price relative to maize and barley,
according to the IGC.
</P>
<P>
World stocks are forecast to rise by 4 million tons to 103
million tons with most of the increase in the United States, the
IGC said.

<HEADLINE> Moi Meets IMF over Suspended Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today held talks with representatives from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank in an attempt to persuade the
donors to resume and release their aid packages to the country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting lasted about two hours, after which Kenyan Finance
Minister Musalia Mudavadi and other senior officials went into
detailed talks with the two financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which are aimed at restoring a three-year loan
worth 215 million U.S. Dollars under IMF's Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and releasing World Bank funds, has
made certain progress and will continue tonight and tomorrow, a
well-informed source told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The donor agency will issue a statement on the talks Friday,
according to the IMF office based here.
</P>
<P>
The IMF halted the loan on July 31, citing high-level
corruption and poor governance in the east African country. The
suspension has caused panic on Kenya's stock and foreign exchange
markets.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, in its turn, has delayed releasing a
145-million-Dollar credit approved in June for boosting Kenya's
energy sector, saying the money will not be issued until Kenya
enacts a bill to set up an independent regulator in the
electricity industry.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has also delayed disbursing a loan of 71
million Dollars in its structural adjustment credit while
awaiting progress on the IMF-Kenya loan negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Today's talks, along with mounting incomes from the coffee and
tea industries, helped firm the weakened Shilling to close today
at a commercial mean of 65.91 against the Dollar, from 67.60
Shillings on Wednesday.

DAMASCUS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The 44th Damascus International
Fair opened here this evening, highlighting the Iraqi
participation.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, represented by a ministerial delegation, returned to the
fair after a gap of 17 years, or since the start of an eight-year
war with neighboring Iran.
</P>
<P>
This reflects an improvement in the economic relations between
Iraq and Syria, whose diplomatic ties were severed in 1980 due to
Damascus' support to Iran in the war, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, suffering a six-year-old U.N. sanctions for its invasion
of Kuwait, is seeking rapprochement with neighbors including
Syria which sided with western powers against it in the 1990 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Minister of Commerce Mohammed Mehdi Saleh attended
today's opening ceremony together with his counterparts from Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Lebanon, Jordan and Algeria as well host Syria.

<HEADLINE> Britain Backs German Proposal for EU Talks with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The British government indicated
here today that it will back any German proposal for European
Union (EU) talks with Iran in a bid to break a diplomatic impasse.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman expressed this afternoon the London
government's readiness to support such an initiative if it is
presented at next month's meeting of EU ministers.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman made it clear that Britain would insist
that the EU reject the Iranian proposal that all other EU
ambassadors return to Teheran before the German ambassador.
</P>
<P>
"We would be firmly in support of the Germans on this. The
return of the heads of mission to Tehran must be without
preconditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
All EU member states except Greece withdrew their ambassadors
from Tehran about four months ago when a German court ruled that
the Iranian government had ordered the murder of Iranian Kurdish
dissidents in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said earlier
this week that Bonn would like to re-establish contacts with Iran.
He also welcomed Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi's remarks
that he was ready to meet EU ministers.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources predict that EU and Iranian representatives
could hold talks during next month's UN General Assembly meeting
in New York.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The British and Argentine
representatives will stage a series of meetings in London next
month to discuss joint exploration licences off the disputed
Falkland (Malvinas) Islands.
</P>
<P>
Experts from both Britain and Argentina, including consultants
nominated by the Falkland (Malvinas) islanders, will meet in
London from September 15 to work on outstanding legislative,
environmental and safety issues, diplomatic sources are quoted by
press reports as saying today.
</P>
<P>
A British government official said today: "Our objective is to
launch (the exploration licences) by the end of the year and that
is what the Argentines are pressing for."
</P>
<P>
However, a source close to the talks cast deep doubts over the
year-end deadline, saying: "We consider that the depth of
technical work to be realised will make it very difficult to meet
the deadline."
</P>
<P>
The two countries, who fought a war in 1982 over the Falkland
(Malvinas) Islands and severed diplomatic ties, restored
diplomatic relations in 1989 and later agreed to jointly explore
the oil and gas resources off the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court to Hear Quebec Case in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada is
set to hear the case of Quebec separation in early December,
according to a draft agenda released today.
</P>
<P>
The court has set aside December 8, 9 and 10 to hear arguments
on whether the French-speaking province has the right to break
away the country.
</P>
<P>
The Quebec government said that it will not participate in the
case.
</P>
<P>
Canada's federal government has asked the court to rule on
three subjects:
</P>
<P>
-- Can Quebec unilaterally declare independence under domestic law?
</P>
<P>
-- Does International law give the province a right to secede?
</P>
<P>
-- If domestic and international law conflict, which take precedence?
</P>
<P>
Quebec cannot unilaterally declare independence though it could
leave lawfully through a constitutional amendment after discussing
with the federal government and other provinces, Ottawa argues.
</P>
<P>
But Quebec insists that any decision on independence must be
made only by the people of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
The case is viewed here as part of Ottawa's "Plan B" strategy,
which stresses "rules of secession".

<HEADLINE> Kabbah Wants Unconditional Restoration of Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, Nigeria, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Ousted Sierra Leonean
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah today called for complete and
unconditional restoration of his legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the 20th summit of heads of
states of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
here, Kabbah condemned the May 25 coup that overthrew his elected
government and the "rule of terror" by the military government
led by Major Johnny Kromah.
</P>
<P>
He spoke of the "massive looting, rapes and killing" that have
been committeed by the new regime, and asserted that there was a
"massacre of people" just on Wednesday night in a town near
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
In his words, the coup has "ushered the people of Sierra Leone
into a long night of darkness and barbarism" and is in the danger
of turning the country into "one vast killing field".
</P>
<P>
Kabbah stressed that his government emerged from a free and
fair election that was supervised and recognized by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
He refuted the military regime's accusation of his
government's failing to provide adequate financial support for
the national army, saying that his government was contributing 35
percent of the national budget to the military.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah denied his government had practised tribalism, saying
there was only one other member of his own tribe holding a
ministerial position or any other high ranking position in the
government.
</P>
<P>
For the purpose of national reconciliation, he said he had
appointed one of the defeated presidential candidates to be his
finance minister, and another as the minister of lands, housing
and environment.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah frowned on the military junta's claim that it has
restored peace to Sierra Leone by allying with the Revolutionary
United Front, saying the regime has actually introduced a "reign
of terror" on defenseless citizens by "letting loose daily
looting, rape and other brutalities".
</P>
<P>
While urging the on-going summit to put an immediate end to
the tragedy in Sierra Leone, he said, however, that he will leave
the choices to his colleagues to decide whether or not the time
is ripe for the use of force against the military junta.

ATHENS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos today discussed with his visiting Latvian counterpart,
Valdis Birkavs, the expansion of the European Union (EU) and the
bilateral relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after their talks, Pangalos said that
Greece backed the simultaneous commencement of negotiations of all
candidate countries for their entry into the European Union (EU),
Riga being one.
</P>
<P>
Latvia would play an important role in European affairs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
As for the EU enlargement, Pangalos stressed that it was
necessary to increase the resources, saying that it could not take
place simply by redistributing existing resources.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there was also a need for provisions in
general which would ensure transparency and democratic procedures
in common European institutions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Birkavs hoped that Athens' stance towards the EU
expansion should be adopted at the next EU meeting in Luxemburg.
</P>
<P>
He said that Latvian-Greek relations should be further
developed, particularly in the economic sector.

LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe all
failed to sustain Wednesday's recovery and ended sharply lower
Thursday, depressed by the Dow's opening plunge and the dollar's
weakening.
</P>
<P>
British shares on the London market ended 1.25 percent down
near its weakest point of the day, tracking a sharp fall in New
York.
</P>
<P>
A plunge of more than four percent on the Hang Seng in Hong

</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index closed at 4,845.4, down 61.5 points.
</P>
<P>
Stocks in Frankfurt also ended weaker despite strong gains
earlier as nervousness about interest rates led to a lack of
follow-through orders. The DAX-30 index fell below 4,000 to
3,973.65, down 22.01 points, or 0.55 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, share prices retreated in line with German

<HEADLINE> Sudan's Rebel Leader Refuses to Meet President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's rebel leader Johan
Garang will not meet his rival Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir
in Pretoria this weekend as was expected by South African
President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with Mandela in Cape Town today, Garang
said he would not attend the meeting this Sunday with Bashir,
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Mandela said he had hoped to host talks
between Bashir and Garang as part of an east African regional
initiative to resolve the 14-year civil war in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
But Mandela said Wednesday that Sunday's meeting would only
dwell on "relations between Uganda and Sudan".
</P>
<P>
The Kampala-Khartoum ties were soured by accusations that the
two are providing support for the other's rebel movements.
</P>
<P>
According to Mandela, the meeting has "nothing to do with
bringing about peace inside Sudan", which is the task of the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD).
</P>
<P>
IGAD, headed by Kenayn President Daniel arap Moi, also has
Uganda, Eritrea and Ethiopia as its members.
</P>
<P>
Although peace in Sudan and the diplomatic row between Sudan
and Uganda were two separate issues, Garang said he believed
Mandela had a "great role to play in the IGAD mediation".
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that a solution to Sudan's problems lay in a
"secular, plural and democratic state".
</P>
<P>
If that was unattainable, and Bashir's Islamic government
could not accept this, then "a peaceful, friendly and amicable
divorce based on incompatibility may be advisable", said the
rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
Garang, who heads the largest rebel movement in Sudan, has
been at war with Khartoum to free the Christian south from the
domination of the Islamic north.
</P>
<P>
Garang said he would not be averse to meeting Bashir, "if at
any time it becomes necessary".
</P>
<P>
But at present the issue does not arise, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Garang, who arrived in South Africa Wednesday night for the
meeting with Mandela, is due to leave tomorrow morning.

CANBERRA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- French star Felicia Ballanger
won the sprint gold medal on day three of the World Track Cycling
Championships in Perth, Australia, beating Australian Michelle
Ferris in the final.
</P>
<P>
It was Ballanger's third straight world championship. She also
beat Ferris, the 1994 junior world sprint champion, 2-0 in the
final of the event at last year's Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Ferris, 20, won the sprint silver medal tonight. Grichina beat
Faure 2-1 in the ride-off for the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
Officials spent several minutes viewing tape of the first heat,
where Ferris squeezed Ballanger down the track and out of
contention on the final bend.
</P>
<P>
Much to Ballanger's obvious disgust, Ferris was awarded the
win in 11.734 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The French star then convincingly beat Ferris in the second
heat with a time of 12.017 seconds for the last 200m.
</P>
<P>
It was the same in the deciding heat, with Ballanger turning on
the power to win in 11.726 and claim the world title again.
</P>
<P>
Ferris had reached the final with a 2-0 semi-final win over
another French rider, Migali Faure.
</P>
<P>
Also tonight, Italy, the United States, Ukraine and France won
their quarter-finals ahead of tomorrow's semis and final.

<HEADLINE> France Welcomes Albright's Mideast Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- France today wished the United
States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright "full success" on her
forthcoming first visit to the Mideast since taking office early
this year.
</P>
<P>
"France is happy that the United States takes the initiative
with the aim of reviving a peace process which is badly in need of
new perspectives," said a French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
On her first official visit to the region since she took office
in January, Albright will leave Washington around September 8 or 9
to visit Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said she hoped a joint U.S.-European initiative
in the Middle East will help the countries in the region resume
dialogue, which she said is necessary for providing security to
the people there and for continuing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state has avoided touring the region,
apparently fearing she could achieve little as relations between
Israel and the Palestinians have gone from bad to worse after
Israel decided in March to build 6,500 houses in the Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
But following a suicide bombing attack in Jerusalem last month
which killed 16 people including the two bombers, aides said
Albright was strongly in favor of making a Mideast trip.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine Thursday called on the
United States not to "remain passive as it has been in the past
few months" toward the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac Wednesday also proposed a joint
Franco-American initiative in the Mideast to save the peace
process from dying out completely.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The growth of both deposits
and loans in July moderated in Hong Kong, according to the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).
</P>
<P>
The rise of deposits decreased by 0.5 percent in July, from
1.1 percent in June. Deposits in HK dollars edged up 1.8 percent,
while foreign currency deposits slid 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The HK dollar time deposits rose by three percent partly
because local banks offered higher deposit rates to attract HK
dollar funds in response to higher interbank rates.
</P>
<P>
During the month, the HK dollar demand deposits surged by 4.1
percent, while saving deposits declined by 2.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Concerned about Italian FM's Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- President of Cyprus' House of
Representatives Spyros Kyprianou has expressed concern about
Italian foreign minister's statement that there are two republics
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In letters to his Italian counterparts - President of the
Chamber of Deputies Luciano Violante and President of the Senate
Nicola Mancino, Kyprianou sounded "astonishment" at Lamberto
Dini's statement last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dini had stated, after meeting with his Turkish counterpart
Ismail Cem in the capital of Rome, that "there are two republics
in Cyprus, there are two entities, there are two governments." He
went further to suggest that this fact should be recognized by the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said Dini's statement contravened international law
as well as U.N. Security Council resolutions on Cyprus and
contradicted the positions adopted by the EU at the highest level
with regard to the situation in Cyprus as well as the commencement
of Cyprus' accession negotiations with the EU early next year.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi has pledged that Italy
remains firm in its positions on Cyprus issue and reiterated that
a Cyprus solution should be based on relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on a peace settlement have been kicked off under
the U.N. auspices. Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash held two rounds of face-to-face
talks, in the U.S. in July and in Switzerland earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
But the process came to a halt after the Turkish Cypriot leader
refused to negotiate until the EU withholds or postpones accession
talks with Cyprus. The EU decided in March 1995 to discuss on
bringing Cyprus into the fold.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots then declared unilaterally a breakaway
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 1983, which was recognized
only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been continuing
efforts to reunite this east Mediterranean island nation as a
bi-communal, bi-zonal federation despite repeated failures in peace
talks over the past 23 years.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Finance Renovation of Lao She Residence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Lao She Research Institute
of Japan, which conducts research on the late well-known Chinese
writer, today presented an 11 million Yen donation for renovation
of Lao She's former residence in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Lao She, or Shu Sheyu, was a prolific writer who completed
works containing well over 8.5-million Chinese characters. Lao She

</P>
<P>
A group of 426 members of the nongovernmental research
institute, including university professors and ordinary citizens
exhibited their keen interest in the works of Lao She by
contributing funds needed to finance the renovation project.
</P>
<P>
Lao She purchased the residence, which is located in the Fengfu
Hutong (Lane) in Beijing's Dongcheng District, in 1949. Many of his
representative were completed in the residence which his family
donated to the government in July this year.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Bureau of Cultural Relics is currently surveying
and mapping the residence and renovation work is scheduled to
begin in the near future. The residence is scheduled to formally
open to the public February 3, 1999, to mark the 100th
anniversary of the birth of the great writer.
</P>
<P>
Lao She died in 1966.
</P>
<P>
Today, Japanese friends, Beijing Vice-Mayor Lin Wenyi, Beijing
Bureau of Cultural Relics officials and relatives of Lao She
attended the donation ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Canada's GDP Up 1.2 Percent in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Canada's gross domestic product
(GDP) grew 1.2 percent in the second quarter of this year and now
stands 3.7 percent higher than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth was fueled by a strong domestic demand due to a
boom in business investment and household spending, Statistics
Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, business investment in plant and
equipment grew a further 2.3 percent, which is almost 20 percent
higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Corporate profits grew 2 percent, following a 5.9 percent gain
in the first quarter, the federal statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Housing sales surged, resulting in a 10-year low in the
inventory of new completed homes for sale. Though housing starts
fell, they were still 17 percent higher than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Canada's exports of goods and services slowed
dramatically, mainly as a result of lower shipments of motor
vehicles and parts.
</P>
<P>
For the period, the country got an increased current account
deficit of 3.2 billion Canadian dollars (2.3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government sector as a whole recorded a surplus of over 4
billion Canadian dollars (2.8 billion U.S. dollars), as income
continued to rise.
</P>
<P>
In the case of the federal government, the deficit continued to
shrink and there was a reduction in outstanding debt, the agency
said.

KATHMANDU, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of people were detained
and a number of vehicles damaged in the nation-wide strike today,
a spokesman of the Nepali Home Ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Air Cuts Debts to 923 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The regional carrier Gulf Air
has cut its debts to 923 million U.S. dollars by the end of June
from 1.566 billion in December 1995, a statement reaching here
said today.
</P>
<P>
"A further reduction is anticipated before the end of 1997,"
said the statement issued by the Bahrain-based airlines jointly
owned by the governments of Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and Abu Dhabi
Emirates of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
This "confirms that Gulf Air is forging ahead on the right
track and right direction," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The owners did not announce the airways' 1996 results, but
informed sources estimated the total debts at 2 billion dollars by
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The debts, mostly in bank loans, resulted from a flurry of
purchase of new aircraft in the late 1980s and opening of
uneconomical routes, they said.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to cut losses, the airlines has cut jobs, sold
aircraft and closed unprofitable routes.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the debt-ridden carrier had sold six
Boeing 767 aircraft and closed routes from New York, Geneva and
Johannesburg to the other part of the world.

PARIS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The French navy's aircraft carrier
"Foch," which will replace another carrier "Clemenceau" when the
latter retires by the end of this year, will return to military
service by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted the Service of Information

<HEADLINE> Long Dry Period Expected in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Environment
Ministry warned today that the country may have to brace for a
long dry period which may last till the end of this year due to
the current El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also said the current haze in Singapore, which is
caused by forest fires in neighboring Indonesia, could become as
bad as it was in 1994 when air quality reached the unhealthy range
for 17 days.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said this year is expected to be a very dry year
in Indonesia due to the current El Nino effect which the ministry
expects to be the worst in this century.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary of the ministry, Tan Gee Paw, explained
that the El Nino effect is caused when winds from the Pacific
Ocean do not carry moisture to Southeast Asia. Instead, the rains
fall on the Pacific Ocean itself.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the haze problem, Singapore is working with Indonesia
to try to put out the forest fires. Efforts include training
Indonesia personnel to interpret satellite pictures of the fires.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has also been sending these pictures which show the
hotspots to Indonesia, and Indonesian authorities have used them
to successfully locate and extinguish the forest fires.
</P>
<P>
But due to their dynamic nature, the fires have revived. Tan
said Indonesia has deployed thousands of personnel from the
military, the community and regional government agencies to put
out the fires.
</P>
<P>
But the ministry said there is no cause for alarm yet. When
there is a reason for concern, the ministry will give advice for
precautionary measures, it added.

<HEADLINE> French Union Reaffirms Opposition to France Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The French trade union
Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT) today reaffirmed its
opposition to any plan by the government to privatize the
state-owned multi-billion franc France Telecom telecommunication
company.
</P>
<P>
"The expectations from the salary-owners are strong notably
concerning the respect of the engagement taken in the April 29
declaration by the Communist Party and Socialist Party to stop the
process of privatization," said the CGT in a communique today.
</P>
<P>
The CGT and the French Communist Party (PCF) held a meeting
today to coordinate their position on France Telecom, before a
government mission, headed by former Socialist minister Michel
Delebarre, will decide whether to partly privatize the company on
September 5.
</P>
<P>
The mission has been holding "profound social concertation" on
the future of the enterprise since mid-July, amid rumors that the
Socialist government could sell part of the stocks of France
Telecom to help meet the budget balance in order to join the
European single currency.
</P>
<P>
The PCF also said that it is opposed to "all privatization and
opening of (its) capital, and it expressed "its attachment to the
democratization" of the management of the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
"The PCF considers that France Telecom is one of the essential
levers to make run another economic and social logic... and that
the enterprise can play a piloting role in the public pole of
electronics and multimedia industries and develop cooperation,"
said the PCF in a communique.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Scholar Wins in Textbook Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Japan ruled
today that it was unlawful for the Japanese government to censor
the references in textbooks to a germ warfare group known as Unit
731 in World War Two.
</P>
<P>
In a three-to-one decision, the Court also ordered the Japanese
government to pay 400,000 yen (about 3,390 U.S. dollars) in
compensation for Japanese historian Saburo Ienaga, prosecutor of
the case.
</P>
<P>
Ienaga, emeritus professor at the now-defunct Tokyo University
of Education, predecessor of Tsukuba University, said after the
ruling that he has done all he can.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to change reality, but I believe I have helped
open a hole to let in fresh air," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his plaint, Ienaga, 83, had asked the court to rule on
whether the Education Ministry had the right to order him to
delete or revise eight passages in his school history textbooks,
including accounts of Unit 731, which conducted biological warfare
experiments on live prisoners in northern China.
</P>
<P>
This was the third lawsuit launched by Ienaga against the
textbook screening system since 1965, after his history textbook
was rejected by the Education Ministry Textbook Authorization
Research Council (EMTARC)in 1962 and 1963.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry had ordered Ienaga to revise numerous passages in
his "New History of Japan" which showed some Japanese atrocities
in World War Two.
</P>
<P>
However, Ienaga firmly held that the government's censorship of
school textbooks was unconstitutional and aimed at distorting
history and whitewashing Japanese war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Although the historian suffered a complete defeat in his first
legal challenge against the government, the Tokyo District Court
and the Tokyo High Court ruled in favor of Ienaga in his second
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
The current lawsuit, filed in 1984, focused on a history
textbook Ienaga wrote for high school students, which included
eight passages of accounts of Unit 731.
</P>
<P>
The EMTARC ordered Ienaga to delete or revise the eight
passages, claiming that it was premature to take up the issue in
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
Presiding Judge Masao Ono said in the ruling that there was a
mistake in the way the EMTARC reached its decision and the EMTARC
had acted illegally.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and visiting Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrocyan today signed a
friendship treaty to deepen cooperation in all fields between the
two countries, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>

interests of the two states," adding that the two countries have
entered "a new stage of bilateral relations, which have been
elevated to the level of strategic partnership."

<HEADLINE> Defect Blamed for Roller-Coaster Jam in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A defective propulsion device
was blamed today for yesterday's mid-air jamming of a
roller-coaster at the Walibi Park on the outskirts of Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Technical experts from the AIB Vincotte company sorted out the
defect from under the seven-ton wagons which were supposed to run
at 80 kilometers per hour during the one-minute ride.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the "loop-the-loop" amusement ride stopped midway
along its vertical figure-of-eight track, leaving 27 passagers
hanging upside down for an hour and a half. They were held only by
the safety bars over their shoulders and laps.
</P>
<P>
Nobody was injured in the incident, but some people had to be
treated for shock.
</P>
<P>
The park insisted that the incident was the first in the ride's
otherwise unblemished record stretching over 15 years.
</P>
<P>
But local authorities and the press called for stricter safety
measures and more stringent controls on similar amusement
attractions in the country.

<HEADLINE> HK Stock Prices Plummet Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Prices on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange plummeted sharply today, with the Hang Seng Index diving
741 points, or 4.98 percent, to close at 14,135.
</P>
<P>
This was the second consecutive day for the market to suffer
heavy losses. Thursday the Hang Seng Index fell 658 points, or
4.23 percent, to close at 1,4876 points.
</P>
<P>
Today's market turnover set a record high of 46.021 billion HK
dollars (about 5.90 billion U.S. dollars) due to investors'
dumping of shares to cut their losses.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts quoted the recent currency instability in
Southeast Asia as the primary reason for the fluctuations over the
past two days, compounding fears that higher interest rate might
be used as a defensive weapon.
</P>
<P>
Other major Asian markets, including Tokyo and Singapore,
continued to plunge today after suffering heavy casualties
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Among the major Hang Seng sub-indices today, properties dived
1,115 points to close at 24,426; finance dropped 868 points to
17,686; utilities down 564 points to 11,674; and commerce and
industries fell 607 points to 9,097.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index also suffered a loss of
38 points, or 2.52 percent, to close at 1,462; while the Hang Seng
China-Affiliated Corporations Index dropped 39 points to 3,960.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said that, when the market resumes trading after
a two-day weekend break, it is expected to be able to stop the
downturn trend, because the pegging system of the Hong Kong dollar
to the U.S. dollar is safe and the fundamentals of Hong Kong's
economy remain healthy.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Acting Financial Secretary K. C. Kwong said that
despite the volatility in the stock market in the past days, the
trading has been orderly and smooth. "Our economic fundamentals
are very good. We are expecting a 5.5 percent growth for the whole
of the year," he said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Urges More Transparency in Japan-U.S. Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong today urged Japan to make more transparent the ongoing review
of the 1978 guidelines for Japan-U.S. defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Goh made the plea during talks with his Japanese counterpart
Ryutaro Hashimoto, Kyodo news agency reported, quoting government
officials.
</P>
<P>
Expressing the hope that any ambiguity and misunderstanding
would be dissolved, Goh asked Hashimoto to make the review more
transparent.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore prime minister also expressed the hope that
Hashimoto would fully explain Tokyo's stance toward Taiwan in
talks with Chinese leaders when he visit China on September 4-7.
</P>
<P>
Goh arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday on a four-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
During talks with policy chiefs from Japan's three-party ruling
coalition Thursday, Goh raised concerns over a possible change in
Japan's military posture from its current emphasis on defense to a
more aggressive role under the proposed new Tokyo-Washington
defense cooperation guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Goh also said he opposed inclusion of the Taiwan Straits in the
geographical scope of the new defense guidelines because
Singapore considers Taiwan to be China's internal affair.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral issues, Goh and Hashimoto agreed to expand
bilateral cooperation in the promotion of study and research for
development of telecommunications and high value-added
industries.

NEW DELHI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The sensitive Index on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market today lost 87.07 points to
close at 3,876.08 as against Thursday's 3,963.15.
</P>
<P>
The national index also dipped by 38.02 points to close at
1,694.76 as against Thursday's close of 1,732.78.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 and U.S. dollar index were quoted sharply down at
380.04 and 174.02 compared with the previous close of 389.05 and
178.14 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Share prices continued their downslide with another sharp fall
of over 87 points to pierce through the 3,900-mark on the BSE
market today on sustained and heavy bull liquidation and fresh
selling by foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
The market was expecting some support at the 3,900-level but
the weak rupee had adversely affected the U.S. dollar returns of
the overseas operators, compelling them to press heavy sales in
almost all the blue chip companies leading to a free fall in the
index.

<P>
HONG KOMG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Airport Core Program
(ACP), which is composed of ten infrastructure projects centering
on the New Airport now under construction at Chek Lap Kok,
demonstrated Hong Kong's capability of building mammoth projects
in time and within budget.
</P>
<P>
Ronald Arculli, chairman of the Finance Committee of the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC), made the remarks today at
the opening ceremony of the Lantau Link Visitors Center, which
provides the public a vantage point to view the world's longest
suspension bridge carrying both road and rail traffic -- the Tsing
Ma Bridge.
</P>
<P>
He noted that eight of the ten ACP projects have been completed
on schedule and within budget, including a harbor crossing,
bridges, expressways and reclamation projects.
</P>
<P>
"The success in the ACP has made Hong Kong well acclaimed for
its capability in cost control and project management of great
infrastructure development," the legislator said.
</P>
<P>
The overall costs of the ACP were reduced twice, from the
original 164 billion HK dollars (21 billion U.S. dollars) to 158.2
billion HK dollars (20.3 billion U.S. dollars) in January 1994,
and further to 156.4 billion HK dollars (20 billion U.S. dollars)
in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
Now the ACP is entering its final stage, with the remaining two
projects -- the New Airport and Airport Railway to be finished
before April, 1998, when the first runway is scheduled to go into
operation.
</P>
<P>
Opened to traffic in April this year, the 3.5-km Lantau Link is
the first road link between Hong Kong and the outlying island of
Lantau. It comprises two bridges and a viaduct, including the
2.2-km Tsing Ma Bridge, which has a main span of 1,377 m, longer
than that of Golden Bridge in San Francisco, USA.

<HEADLINE> Asia Gets Biggest Share of 1998 German Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- German Development Aid Ministry
said today that Asia would get the biggest share of its 1998
bilateral aid, with 979 million marks (541 million U.S. dollars)
of a total of 7.6 billion marks (4.2 billion dollars), or nearly
13 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Asia is still home to the largest number of poor people in the
world -- this is often overlooked given the dynamic economy of the
region," said Development Aid Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Asian nations with larger populations have the biggest need for
development help, which included China, India, Pakistan, Indonesia
and Bangladesh, he added.
</P>
<P>
Coming second on Germany's foreign aid list is the Sub-Saharan
Africa, accounting for 856 million marks (473 million dollars). In
addition, Africa will also receive an extra 1.4 billion marks (774
million dollars) from Germany in multilateral aid.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East and Mediterranean region is due to be provided
with some 588 million marks (325 million dollars) in 1998, while
Latin America with 398 million marks (220 million dollars) and
Central and Eastern Europe 220 million marks (122 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to Spranger earlier this week, Bonn would from 1998
include recipients' anti-corruption pledge in aid accords, adding
to clauses set since 1991 on human rights, rule of law, existence
of a market economy and the participation of the population in
political decision-making.
</P>
<P>
The German Development Aid Ministry statement also declared 12
countries to be barred from receiving any aid from Bonn in 1998
for their "obvious negative (and) fully insufficient conditions."
</P>
<P>
The countries are Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Somalia,
Sudan, Burundi, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Moldova and Burma.

Jansher Khan scored a straight-game victory over 20th-ranked
Scot Martin Heath today, winning 15-10, 15-12, 15-11.
</P>
<P>
Seven-time winner Jansher Khan was stopped by Eyles in last
year's Hong Kong Open final. With the ousting of the Australian by
Marshall here on Thursday, Jansher looked set to win an eighth
title here.
</P>
<P>
Jansher had admitted hating to play at the center court at the
Hong Kong Squash Center due to an incident 10 years ago. He got
his knee injured when he slipped at the court during a semi-final
match against legendary former world champion and his compatriot
Jahangir Khan. Jansher won the match and the tournament which was
his first ever title in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In the semi-finals here on Saturday, Jansher Khan is to play
10th-ranked Australian Brett Martin, who won three games to one
over Briton Peter Marshall today.
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy to win as the world number one since 1993. It
needs very hard work," said Jansher Khan.
</P>
<P>
He declined to predict a win tomorrow. "I hope it will be a
good match," he added.
</P>
<P>
And the triumphant advance of the not-fully-recovered Briton
Marshall was brought to a halt as he lost to Astralian Brett
Martin in the quarter-finals today.
</P>
<P>
Marshall produced the event's biggest upset by downing
defending champion Rodney Eyles from Australia in straight games
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Marshall, 26, who had his world ranking sharply slipped from
the second down to the current 57th thanks to chronic fatigue
syndrome, made his comeback only in April this year at the British
Open. And he had to go through the earlier qualifying round of
the Hong Kong event.
</P>
<P>
But his confrontation with Martin today showed that he was
still not fit enough for games of such caliber.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first game 17-14, Marshall won the second game
back 15-11. But that magic did not last long as he lost two games
in a row, 15-9 and 15-7, and the match three games to one.
</P>
<P>
Second seeded Peter Nicol of Scotland won three straight games
to beat 34th-ranked Australian qualifier Byron Davis today.
Although 24-year-old Davis managed to level the score three times
in the opening game, Nicol proved to be stronger and more tricky,
winning the match 15-8, 15-7, 15-4.
</P>
<P>
Nicol is to take on fourth seeded Jonathon Power from Canada
inthe semi-finals on Saturday. Power, ranked fourth in the world,
downed eighth-ranked Briton Del Harris 15-10, 15-8, 15-14 today.
</P>
<P>
The semi-finals of the 74,000 U.S. dollars event are set for
Saturday afternoon and the final is slated for Sunday, also in the
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> EU Condemns Bosnian Serb Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Union today blamed
residents of two Bosnian towns for their riots against the
NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR), saying that they were an
insurrection against the presence of the international community.
</P>
<P>
The EU said in a press release issued by Luxembourg that the
violent acts against SFOR troops were intolerable. Luxembourg is
serving the rotating six-month presidency of the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The union said it would not accept such a provocation and urged
Bosnian Serbs to refrain from further provocative acts and to stop
the propaganda via certain local media that may provoke insecurity
and instability.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, hundreds of Bosnian Serbs attacked SFOR troops
with stones, forcing them to pull out from a police station in
Brcko. There were also reports that local residents at Bijeljina
blocked SFOR troops from taking over the police station and a
television transmitter.
</P>
<P>
Tensions rose sharply over the past few days in Bosnian Serb
areas between SFOR troops and local residents loyal to their
wartime leader Radovan Karadzic as his power struggle with
Western-backed Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic was fueled
up.
</P>
<P>
Those backing Plavsic and the Karadzic loyalists have been
vying for local television transmitters.
</P>
<P>
Brcko townspeople, roused from sleep by air raid sirens,
reportedly attacked dozens of American peacekeeping soldiers,
accusing the latter as behaving like the Nazi occupation force.
</P>
<P>
Angry residents trashed cars and other vehicles, including a
bus with license from Banja Luka, Plavsic's headquarters in the
northwest.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia Serb news media reported that at least six civilians
were injured, including five wounded by bullets that ricocheted
when an American soldier's rifle misfired.
</P>
<P>
In another development, residents in Bijeljina spent the night
on a square in front of the police station to prevent SFOR troops
from taking over the police station and a television transmitter.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 people remained there on Friday morning and planned to
stay until SFOR withdrew, reports said.

The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite a booming national economy and a soaring stock

<HEADLINE> Commissioner's Office on Ties between HKSAR and Asian Productivity Organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the
Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong
 said here today that as of July 1, the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) had to suspend its ties with the
Asian Productivity Organization (APO) to which Taiwan is an
affiliated member in the name of "the Republic of China".
</P>
<P>
In reply to media inquires on the matter, Wu Hongbo, the
spokesman of the Commissioner's Office, said it is very difficult
for the HKSAR to take part, in any form, in activities of the APO
which is a regional governmental organization before the Taiwan
issue is properly settled. "Because it is an issue of principle
involving state sovereignty," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all, Wu reiterated, there is only one China in
the world, that is, the People's Republic of China, and Taiwan is
an inalienable part of China. The Chinese government has always
opposed any attempt and act to create "Two Chinas" or "one China,
one Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, in order to properly handle the issue
concerning Taiwan's status in the APO so that the HKSAR can
continue to participate in its activities after July 1, the
Chinese government negotiated many times with the APO through
diplomatic channels and made proposals for solving the problem,
but to no avail.

<HEADLINE> Forecast of HK Economic Growth Remains at 5.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The forecast growth rate of
Hong Kong's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1997 is maintained at
5.5 percent, with growth "being driven mainly by continued robust
domestic demand, and to a lesser extent a gradual pick-up in
export performance".
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong government economist K. Y. Tang gave a press
conference this afternoon on the economic situation in the first
half of 1997 and updated GDP and price forecasts for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the economy accelerated further in the first half of
1997, he said. GDP is expected to have grown around 6 to 6.5 percent
in the second quarter. There was probably a further advance from
the 6.1 percent increase in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The respective growth rates were 4.0 percent, 4.6 percent, 5.2
percent and 5.7 percent in the preceding four quarters in 1996.
</P>
<P>
GDP growth could turn out to be better than the current
forecast if the momentum seen in the recent quarters can be
sustained, and particularly if export performance can continue to
improve, the economist pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Robust domestic demand is providing the main impetus to overall
economic growth, he said. Investment spending is forecast to grow
markedly, underpinned by a strong demand for machinery and
equipment and intensive building activity in both the public and
private sectors, while consumer spending is also forecast to
thrive.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, exports of goods, which had a relatively
moderate performance earlier, are expected to pick up somewhat in
the latter part of the year. In particular, exports to the
mainland and the United States, two major trading partners of Hong
Kong, should maintain a notable growth.
</P>
<P>
But Tang also admitted that overall export growth could still
be constrained by the continued strength of the U.S. dollar and
the adverse effect that may be brought about by the sharp
depreciation of several Southeast Asian currencies since early
July.
</P>
<P>
Total exports are forecast to grow 6.8 percent in real terms in
1997, down from the earlier forecast of 7.2 percent, while imports
of goods are forecast to increase 8.4 percent, better than the
earlier forecast of 8.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The forecast of consumer price inflation in 1997, as measured
by the Consumer Price Index (A), is revised downwards from 7.0
percent to 6.5 percent, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The actual out-turn in the first seven months of this year was
6.0 percent, he added. In 1996, the average increase in the CPI(A)
was also 6.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS to Monitor Ceasefire in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of west African
countries have made recommendations to an on-going sub-regional
summit on the setting up of a force to monitor ceasefire in
Sierra Leone, according to an official document reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
The ministers from the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) believed that the proposed west African Ceasefire
Monitoring Group, known as ECOMOG II, will "assist in bringing an
immediate return of the country's legitimate government."
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the ECOWAS foreign ministers' meeting
which ended on Thursday morning to prepare ground for the summit
beginning that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The proposed ECOMOG II will reinforce the tightened sanctions
and embargo against thitary junta which seized power in
Sierra Leone in the May 25 coup, the document said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministers, the new force will carry out the
mission of "maintaining and monitoring ceasefire in Sierra Leone"
for the final resolution of the crisis in the troubled country.
</P>
<P>
A ceasefire agreement was reached between the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG and soldiers loyal to the
junta on July 19 in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
But it was breached not long after repeated clashes were
reported.
</P>
<P>
Shelling was heard in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, even
when sub-regional leaders were to begin seeking ways to settle
the crisis at the 20th summit of ECOWAS scheduled to end today.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, which is provided by the ECOWAS
Executive Secretariat, the foreign ministers recommended that the
proposed force "be placed under the command of ECOMOG in
Liberia."
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG has been operating in Liberia since 1990 and its role
in bringing peace to that country has been widely recognized and
welcomed.
</P>
<P>
It was originally planned to stay in Liberia for six months
after the newly-elected government was inaugurated on August 2 in
order to help restructure and train the country's armed forces
and police force.
</P>
<P>
However, as the job has not yet begun, the tenure of ECOMOG is
expected to be extended.
</P>
<P>
Chiefs of army staff of ECOWAS countries have, at their
meeting prior to the summit, suggested the extension of ECOMOG
forces in Liberia before progressive withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The period of the extension is yet to be decided by the ECOWAS
leaders. But ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu
said on Thursday that it might be one year.

<P>
PARIS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 civilians were
killed Thursday night outside the Algerian capital Algiers in what
was the bloodiest massacre ever committed by Islamic extremists in
the five years of violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, the Algerian government immediately
deployed troops and police to the region of Sidi Moussa, where the
massacre took place, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted inhabitants of Sidi Moussa as saying that Islamic
extremists launched attack upon several villages Thursday night,
and one local villager said that up to 300 people could have been
shot dead or had their throats cut.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, two bombings also occurred in the country,
claiming an unspecified number of victims.
</P>
<P>
Islamic extremists seem to have intensified attacks after tens
of thousands of Algerians demonstrated on August 20 in a
nationwide protest against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a speech on the same day, President Liamine Zeroual promised
to put an end to terrorism soon.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Govt Agent Arrested for Funding Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Former government agent to
Jaffna Chelliah Pathmanathan was arrested Thursday night at his
residence here for allegedly channeling government funds to Tamil
rebels, sources of the Criminal Investigations Department (CID)
said today.
</P>
<P>
Chelliah served as a project officer between 1992 and 1995 and
was appointed as government agent to Jaffna on November 11, 1995,
after the government troops retook Jaffna city from the Tamil
rebels, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary CID investigations revealed that Chelliah, as a
project officer and government agent, had siphoned off more than
100 million rupees (about 1.7 million U.S. dollars) from the
government fund to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
over a period of five years by overpayment of lorry transport in
Jaffna peninsula, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Investigations also found that 50 of the 80 lorries which
transported essential goods from Point Pedro on the northeastern
coast of the peninsula to Jaffna city had been owned by the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
Chelliah was transferred to Colombo on February 2 this year,
when investigations against him commenced, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that Chelliah was also being interrogated
over other irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Jaffna city was once a stronghold of the LTTE rebels, who have
been fighting a guerrilla war for a separate state in the north
and east of the country since 1983.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met here today with Chao Kuang-piu, a member of the Selection
Committee for the First Government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, and his children as well.
</P>
<P>
Extending a warm welcome to the Hong Kong visitors, Jiang spoke
highly of Mr. Chao's love for the motherland and Hong Kong, and
his contribution to the economic, scientific and educational
development of the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his hope that Chao's children will carry forward the
glorious tradition of the Hong Kong industrialists of their elder
generation, and make more contributions to the prosperity and
stability of Hong Kong and the economic development of their
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Chao, who is also a former advisor on Hong Kong affairs and
chairman of Novel Enterprises Ltd. of Hong Kong, said China has
been developing very rapidly since the reform and opening-up to
the outside world, and everywhere is a scene of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He said he is confident that the country will become richer,
stronger and more prosperous in the future, and he also hopes his
younger generation will carry forward the tradition of loving the
motherland and Hong Kong, and continue to contribute to the
construction of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Chao Kuang-piu, a native of Ningbo in China's eastern province
of Zhejiang, is the first Hong Kong investor in the inland areas
after the reform and opening-up, and has donated more than 70
million HK dollars for the scientific and educational undertakings
 in the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
In response to the country's strategy of "invigorating the
country through science, technology and education" and President
Jiang Zemin's call on translating the scientific research results
into productive force, Chao invested 100 million HK dollars this
April for a hi-tech shareholding company in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Present on the occasion were Liao Hui, director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council, and Chen
Ziying, deputy director of the office.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Likely to Be Absorbed to Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The on-going summit of west
African leaders is expected to decide whether Liberia will be
included in a sub-regional group to explore ways of settling the
crisis in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made by foreign ministers of the sub-region
shortly before the 20th summit of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS), an official document said today.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the geographic situation of Liberia which shares
long border with Sierra Leone, the foreign ministers decided to
enlarge the monitoring group on Sierra Leone by including Foreign
Minister of Liberia, Murhi Captain," said the document.
</P>
<P>
An ECOWAS committee made up of foreign ministers of Nigeria,
Ghana, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire was established to seek ways to
reverse the May 25 coup that overthrew the legitimate government
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Some former factional fighters of Liberia are reported to be
involved in the fighting of Sierra Leone's militiamen against the
military junta in areas bordering Liberia.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, which is provided by the ECOWAS
Executive Secretary, the foreign ministers also believed that the
assistance of the United Nations would help execute comprehensive
arms and economic embargo against the junta in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that the summit of ECOWAS leaders should seek
the assistance of the United Nations Security Council to "render
any sanction adopted by ECOWAS mandatory and universal".
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has earlier expressed support to any
measure taken by ECOWAS to restore the legitimate government in
Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Quality of Life in China Now Much Better Than 1992 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, August 29 (Xinhua) -- When he returned from a
three-year visit to the US, Sun Fei could hardly believe his eyes
when he found that many people make long-distance calls directly
from their own homes, or even log on to the Internet with their
own computers.
</P>
<P>
Out on the street, the associate professor at Tianjin's Nankai
University says, he was caught by the number of mobile phones, and
the casual air of ordinary people hailing a taxi.
</P>
<P>
"These luxuries were only a dream for most Chinese," he notes,
"The living quality of the Chinese has improved substantially."
</P>
<P>
According to the State Statistics Bureau, food consumption
takes up 48.6 percent of total expenditures of urbanites, a 4.4
percentage point decrease from 1992. And a decade of consumption
centered on food and clothing began the transition, causing more
Chinese to look forward to a more diverse and better life.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, family televisions, refrigerators, and washing
machines could arouse the admiration of the whole neighborhood,
but today these appliances are prevalent in urban homes, and their
status has been challenged by new luxuries like air-conditioners,
telephones, computers, and cars - the favorites of wealthier
people.

<TEXT>
<P>
The improvement in life can mean many things, including the
individual's cultural and spiritual life and progress in society,
says the sociologist Wang Hui.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey in five major cities, 62 percent of the
people regard their free time as being just as important as their
job. The five-day work week that started two years ago, has given
Chinese the introduction to a more colorful part of life.
</P>
<P>
Even job quality has been called into question, as more Chinese
voluntarily keep changing jobs until a satisfactory one is found.
</P>
<P>
In Guangzhou, the country's economic frontier, many people have
gotten a new job in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
It could be said that the Chinese are actually adopting a
completely new mode of life to make themselves more comfortable,
more up-to-date, and more efficient. Classes on computers,
driving, and foreign languages are all the rage in China,
attesting to the desire of many Chinese to have a better chance to
develop themselves.
</P>
<P>
"The benefit brought by the opening up has raised people's
expectations for their lives," says Wang Hui. "Only sustainable
and stable economic and social development can satisfy the
increasingly more demanding Chinese."

<P>
Of the 1.8 million computers sold last year, 20 percent were in
private hands. This year, the long queues of people wanting to buy
air-conditioners began to appear in a number of cities as the
summer temperatures rose.
</P>
<P>
And that's not all. As the Chinese strive to improve their
standard of living, people in the countryside are trying to use
their incomes to make life more colorful.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, there were more than 630 million domestic tourists,
suggesting that a tourism fever had hit half the population.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people have gotten involved in
body-building in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
In China's largest industrial city, Shanghai, people never
hesitate in spending money on entertainment, culture, or education.
</P>
<P>
And, people are becoming more choosy, or perhaps developing
better taste. They stress nutrition in their food, style in their
clothing, and a better living environment. Beer has replaced
spirits to become the No.1 favorite of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the steady increase in incomes in 1.2 billion Chinese
pockets, a diverse pattern of consumption has appeared. The last
five years saw the fastest period of economic development, with
average incomes of urban citizens rising 41.6 percent, and 28.8
percent for rural dwellers.

<HEADLINE> Thais Invite Sports Officials to See Asiad Preparations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand invited Asian Games
officials to see that preparations were on track and Thailand was
capable of holding the 1998 Asiad next year.
</P>
<P>
According to a press report reaching here, the top officials of
the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) have been invited.
</P>
<P>
It came just days after the OCA head sent a letter to Thai
officials saying it was holding a special meeting of its executive
board on September 23 to review Games preparations and vote
whether to let Bangkok host the event.
</P>
<P>
"Reacting with surprise to a letter received from the
president of the (OCA) yesterday, the Bangkok Asian Games
Organising Committee (BAGOC) today said it was ready to invite OCA
President Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahah Al-Sabah and other members of the
OCA to visit Thailand at their earlier convenience 'to see with
their own eyes' that all preparations for the 13th Asian
Games...were on schedule," BAGOC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said BAGOC was very concerned that the OCA
president had been "misinformed" concerning the state of progress
of BAGOC's work.
</P>
<P>
It said none of the OCA officials who have been regularly
visiting Bangkok to review preparations had ever expressed any
dissatisfaction with the progress.
</P>
<P>
OCA Director General Muttaleb Ahmad said:"We are definitely
heading for a catastrophe and we should make sure to avoid that,"
he said in an interview from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
BAGOC's statement said it was dedicated to working with the
Olympic Committee of Thailand in preparations for the Games.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to reassure Sheikh Al-Sabah and other OCA
members that BAGOC has the greatest respect for the OCA's ultimate
authority and control over the Asian Games and that we will
continue to cooperate with and work closely with Thailand's
National Olympic Committee," BAGOC chairman, Deputy Prime Minister
Sukavit Rangsitphol said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Sukavit is considered one of the major problems of the Asian
Games organisation. Two senior sports officials resigned from top
BAGOC posts last month following disputes with Sukavit.
</P>
<P>
Although the executive board has no power to strip Thailand of
the Games, its recommendation is likely to be endorsed by a
general assembly which can take the Games from Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The 7,500-athlete Asian Games is the biggest sporting event in
the region and second largest in the world after the Summer
Olympics. It is scheduled to take place in December next year.

<HEADLINE> World's Biggest Perfume Maker in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The world's biggest maker of
essence and perfume, Givaudan Roure Roche Group, has started a
joint venture in the Zhangjiang High-Tech Park of the Pudong New
Area in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Givaudan Roure Roche Co. is a joint venture
between the Switzerland-based Givaudan Roure Roche Group and the
Shanghai Sun-Ve Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Co.
</P>
<P>
It has a total investment of 7.5 million U.S. dollars and will
combine essence development, research and production.
</P>
<P>
Jeam Amic, president of Givaudan Roure Roche Group, told
reporters that his company had chosen Shanghai because of its
confidence in Shanghai's personnel and technology advantages.
</P>
<P>
The Roure Roche Pharmaceuticals Group has put 130 million
U.S. dollars into six businesses in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Annual sales of essence and perfumes in China are estimated at
over 300 million U.S. dollars and are expected to grow.
</P>
<P>
Amic says that China has enormous market potential and the
presence of the joint venture proves his company's determination
to explore the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture now has an annual production capacity of
1,000 tons of essence and perfume and is expected to increase its
output to 3,000 tons a year after its second-phase of construction
is completed.
</P>
<P>
Givaudan Roure Roche Group, which had 1.4 billion Swiss francs
in sales last year, has established marketing agencies in
Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou, and will soon open a
representative office in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Issues Decree Dissolving Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan today
issued a royal decree dissolving the Lower House of Parliament,
which will become effective next Monday, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Article 34 of the Constitution, the Lower
House of Parliament will be dissolved on September 1 in
preparation for upcoming parliamentary elections, the royal
decree said.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the preparations for the elections scheduled
for November 4, amid persistent planned boycott from six
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Last month, six opposition parties declared to boycott the
elections, citing the Press and Publication Law, the one-person-
one-vote election system, the normalization of ties with Israel
and the government`s measures to marginalize political parties
as the main reasons behind their boycott.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has held two rounds of talks with the
opposition parties and conducted several dialogues with other
political parties.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition parties have not reversed their stand
and accused the government of "trying to give the impression"
that it "was engaging in a dialogue."
</P>
<P>
The six opposition parties are the Muslim Brotherhood, the
Islamic Action Front (IAF), Jordan Democratic People's Party, the
Jordan Arab Constitutional Front, National Action Front Party and
the Al Ansar.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have 23 seats in the 80-member Lower House
of Parliament. The IAF has 16 seats, making it the largest
opposition group in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Multi-party system was revived in the country in 1989 as part
of the political reforms launched after widespread riots set
off by economic hardships. The protesters then called for wider
public participation in decision making.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China established two special
councils today to help standardize the country's environmental
controls and to increase people's awareness of the need to protect
the environment.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Management Council of China Registration
Board for Auditors (EMCCRBA) was put in charge of examining
qualifications, registration, and training of environmental
overseers.
</P>
<P>
The China Accreditation Council for Environmental Management
System Certification Bodies (CACEB) will be responsible for
certifying groups in the field.
</P>
<P>
CACEB also can authorize groups to appraise organizations, to
determine whether they can set up environmental control systems in
line with the "ISO14000 environmental control standards" of the
International Standardization Organization (ISO) of 1996, which
was adopted by China in the same year.
</P>
<P>
China will develop a set of preferential policies to encourage
businesses, societies, units, or other organizations to establish
environmental control systems in keeping with international
standards.
</P>
<P>
The two councils have 19 members of the National Environmental
Protection Agency and the State Bureau of Technological
Supervision, and 17 other departments and units.
</P>
<P>
They are both under the China Steering Committee for
Environmental Management System Certification, which was founded
in May, 1997.

KATHMANDU, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Lokendra
Bahadur Chand expanded his cabinet again today by inducting a new
face, promoting two and changing the portfolio of one, all from
his own party, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
Balaram Gharti Magar, who sides with President of the National
Democratic Party (RPP) Surya Bahadur Thapa, took over the Ministry
for Housing and Physical Planning from Kamal Thapa, who is also
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
While Rajiv Parajuli and Prem Bahadur Bhandari, both from the
Chand faction, were promoted from ministers of state to minister
without portfolio and minister for science and technology
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The post Prem Bahadur Bhandari took over was concurrently held
by Prime Minister Chand.
</P>
<P>
And Sarbendra Nath Shukla, also from the Chand faction, was
transferred from minister without portfolio to minister for
commerce, a post which was concurrently held by another RPP
member, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time Prime Minister Chand expanded his
cabinet since his three-party coalition government took office in
March.
</P>
<P>
The first expansion was conducted after foreign minister
Prakash Chandra Lohani resigned in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the expansion aims at strengthening RPP's hold
on power.
</P>
<P>
The RPP now has 19 seats in Parliament, while its ruling
partners the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist and
Leninist, CPN-UML) and Nepal Sadbhavana (Goodwill) Party have 90
seats and 3 seats respectively.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Not to Withdrawal from Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu declared today that Israel will not withdraw
from south Lebanon anyway in spite of Thursday's heavy
casualties, reported the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the statement when he was speaking to
reporters aboard his special plane on his way back home from a
Far East trip.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a fierce fighting with Lebanese guerrillas
Thursday morning, an Israeli elite Golani Unit was surrounded by
a huge bush fire. Four soldiers were killed and six others
wounded, two of them in serious conditions.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu claimed that the basic problem has not changed,
that is, if Israel withdraws from Lebanon, the Lebanese will be
able to reach the border between Lebanon and the Galilee
district in the north.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We are far from finding a stable solution that
would allow an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) pullout from south
Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The rightwing Likud premier admitted that Israel is paying a
heavy price in Lebanon. But he again said that that is to
prevent harm to the residents of the north, and what he called
the emptying of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu returned to Israel this morning from an official
visit to Japan and South Korea. Upon his return, he was briefed
by Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on the disaster in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel now occupies an area of 1,000 square kilometers of the
Lebanese territory, which it self-styled as "security zone."
Under U.N. Resolution 425, Israel must withdraw unconditionally
from all the territory it occupies in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
More and more Israelis have called for withdrawal from
Lebanon. Yossi Belin, Member of Knesset (Parliament) and former
minister of the Labor-led government, commented Thursday night
that Israel has no reason to be in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's GDP Growth at 8.4 Percent in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's State Bank said
today the country sustained its real gross domestic product (GDP)
at an annual rate of 8.4 percent in the second quarter of this
year, the same level as in the corresponding period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth was however lower than that of 8.5 percent in
the preceding quarter, which has been revised to 8.2 percent due
to an upward revision of the manufacturing production index, the
central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the growth momentum in the second quarter
was supported by the continued expansion in the manufacturing
sector of 13.4 percent, construction 12 percent, services 8.1
percent and agriculture five percent.
</P>
<P>
In the manufacturing sector, the sustained growth reflected the
strong expansion in both the domestic and export-oriented
industries, particularly electronics and chemical subsectors.
</P>
<P>
Higher growth in the electronic sector reflected the increased
export demand for other electronic equipment and parts which
comprised mainly automatic data processing machines.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector recorded a strong growth due to higher
production of palm oil and saw logs.
</P>
<P>
The bank said on the demand side, private consumption
indicators showed a mixed performance during the period under
review while private investment remained strong.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said that in the external sector, the trade
account recorded a deficit of 4.8 billion ringgit (1.71 billion
U.S. dollars) while the international reserves declined to 70.7
billion ringgit (25.25 billion dollars), remaining sufficient to
finance 4.4 months of retained imports.

<HEADLINE> New High Mountain Discovered in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese glaciologists say that a
"new" mountain about 8,000 meters high, the 15th in the world, has
been found in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The 8,011-m-high mountain is in Kashi Prefecture, 8.35 km from
the World's second tallest, Mt. Qogir (8,611 meters).
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important geological discovery, and a new
challenge for mountain climbers," said Shi Yafeng, a glaciologist
and academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
The mountain, named "Zhongyang", is locates at 35 degrees, 49
minutes north latitude, 76 degrees, 34 minutes east longitude.
</P>
<P>
The mountain remained unnoticed because it lies behind the
glaciers of the Karakorum, Shi explained. Scientists with CAS's
Lanzhou Glacier and Frozen Earth Research Institute found it while
mapping the Mt. Qogir region.
</P>
<P>
The mountain was first detected in 1976, but was considered a
twin of Mt. Broad (8051 meters), only a kilometer away. But it was
recently discovered that the two were clearly separated by a
saddle 7,830 meters above sea level. This means that Mt. Zhongyang
is a separate mountain, Shi explained.
</P>
<P>
It has long been known that there are 14 mountains more than
8,000 meters above sea level, nine of them in China.

CAIRO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- One of the biggest sanitary drainage stations in the
Middle East will be opened Sunday in Qalag, north of Cairo,
Egyptian press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Housing and Utilities Mohammed Ibrahim
Suleiman will inaugurate the sewage station which will serve
eastern Nile areas.
</P>
<P>
The station includes 10 pumps and three electric engines.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- A sum of 150 million U.S. dollars are to arrive in
Egypt at the end of September, as a compensation for Gulf War
victims, local newspaper Al Akhbar reported today.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 50,000 people in Egypt are entitled to get their
compensations, said Ahmed Al-Amawi, Egyptian Minister of Manpower
and Immigration.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt has banned selling imported textiles and
ready-made clothes in free shops and limited that only to the
transit zone, local newspaper Al Gomhuria reported today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Mohieddin Al-Gharib issued a decree
Thursday to ban selling these products at the free markets in
airports and harbors as well as exporting banned commodities.
</P>
<P>
An official source said the decision will inflict losses on the
free markets as selling imported clothes will be confined to
transit halls to leaving passengers.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The Cypriot stock market is witnessing a
better-than-expected performance in the traditionally sluggish
trading season in August thanks to an improving political climate.
</P>
<P>
The CISCO All-Share Index closed Thursday at 386 points,
marking a weekly rise of 4.3 points or 1.1 percent, said a report
issued by the Cyprus Investment and Securities Corporation Limited
(CISCO) today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the total weekly volume of
transactions this week was at 1.8 million Cyprus pounds (about
3.6 million U.S. dollars) compared with 1.4 million pounds (about
2.8 million dollars) the week before.
</P>
<P>
The monthly gains of the stock market are estimated at 2.7
percent, whereas the losses since the beginning of the current
year are contained at 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although trading remained at very low levels in the holiday
season this month, a gradual ascend in prices was observed, which
resulted in a capital appreciation of almost 3 percent within
August, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The CISCO attributed the moderate development to the betterment
in political atmosphere for solving the Cyprus issue as a key
reason.
</P>
<P>
The past two months saw a series of direct talks between the
leaders of the rival Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities
on solution to the 23-year-old division of the Mediterranean
Island.
</P>
<P>
Investors are still awaiting more political development in this
regard before they can do more, the report said.

<HEADLINE> US Congressman's Remarks on Tibet Criticized (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Tibetan studies experts
say that Congressman Frank Wolf's remarks about what he allegedly
saw and heard in Tibet are absolutely groundless and have
countered with facts.
</P>
<P>
Dainzhub Angbun, vice-president of Central University for
Nationalities and a scholar of Tibetan culture and religious
studies, told Xinhua that Wolf is taking a hostile anti-China
stance and looking through colored spectacles, confusing black and
white, and disregarding the enormous progress that has been made
in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Wolf's secret visit to Tibet and the people
he talked with there were arranged in advance. Wolf himself
participated in the fabrication of this farce.
</P>
<P>
Dainzhub Angbun said the what Wolf allegedly saw and heard in
Tibet could not be and is not true. Wolf recently claimed that
"there is no religious freedom for Tibetans." The fact is the
Chinese people enjoy full freedom in religious belief.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, the central government has provided a
large amount of funds and precious metals like gold and silver for
the renovation and conservation of monasteries and other religious
sites in Tibet each year. It has spent some 300 million yuan (32
million US dollars) for those projects.
</P>
<P>
The five-year large-scale renovation of the Potala Palace has
taken 55 million yuan in central government funds.
</P>
<P>
Tibet now has 1,787 religious sites (or monasteries) and 46,380
monks and nuns. Nearly every Buddhist family has a worship hall or
a niche for a statue of Buddha, and more than 100 million Tibetan
Buddhists make a pilgrimage to Lhasa temples each year.
</P>
<P>
In Tibet, Buddhist activities can be seen here and there, with
prayer flags waving in the breeze.

<HEADLINE> US Congressman's Remarks on Tibet Criticized  (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li Guoqing, deputy director of the National Center for Tibetan
Studies, notes that Wolf said that the Chinese government pursued a
policy of "Cultural Genocide" in Tibet, but in fact the country
has paid a great deal of attention to protecting Tibetan culture
and that Chinese laws and regulations state that Tibetan is the
main language of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 50 institutes with Tibetan studies across
China, with 2,000 staff members, 240 of whom have senior
professional title, and 85 percent of those are Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more than 300 research projects have been
completed and over 400 books have been or are being
published. Some 60 national or international symposiums on Tibetan
history, language, or religion have been held.
</P>
<P>
There are over 30 troupes in the region that perform Tibetan
music, dances, and plays, with more than 5,000 personnel, 90
percent of whom are Tibetan. Tibetan troupes also perform
overseas.
</P>
<P>
By 1996, the State Council approved 72 historic sites for
regional protection. The country spent a great deal of money
protecting cultural relics, an important part of the heritage of
national minorities.
</P>
<P>
This was not the first time for Wolf to make trouble by
standing facts on their heads, Li says, pointing to the "Sock
Incident" of 1993, when he asked to see the Beijing Jail during
his China visit.
</P>
<P>
While he was visiting the jail, a relevant government
department gave him two pairs of socks as a souvenir. He later
held these up in a Congressional hearing, claiming he had bought
them and offering them as the proof that China exports products
made by prisoners, and called for sanctions against China.
</P>
<P>
So, Wolf was up to his old tricks again, Li notes. "He
attempted to deceive the people of the world by making up lies
about Tibet to impede the progress of Sino-U.S. relationship."
</P>
<P>
"It is ignoble and it is in vain," Li says, "We would like to
ask Mr. Wolf to change his manner of doing things and not wear
colored glasses to fool himself and others."

<HEADLINE> US Congressman's Remarks on Tibet Criticized (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Johkang Temple and other temples are often crowded with
worshipers. They do obeisance, holding prayer wheels there.
</P>
<P>
Dainzhub Angbun said thousands of foreign tourists and many
foreign journalists have visited Tibet. They could easily see the
religious activities everywhere. Wolf, however, chose to turn a
blind eye to these facts and his "travel notes" do not reflect the
true situation.
</P>
<P>
Dainzhub said that Wolf asserted that the Tibetans live
miserable lives and do not have freedom and rights, and that the
people of the Han nationality now outnumber Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dalai Lama, a brutal system of feudal serfdom
combining political and religious power was practised in
Tibet. The lives of a vast number of serfs there were a "tragic
condition that could hardly be described in words."
</P>
<P>
With the abolishment of serfdom and rapid economic growth in
Tibet, people have seen great changes in their lives. Previously,
the life expectancy of Tibetans was only 36 years, but it has
risen to 65 years now.
</P>
<P>
Wolf not only lacks a knowledge of history, he said, but also
ignores facts. The Tibet he describes is a world of the
imagination.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Dainzhub Angbun added, Wolf did not provide any
concrete figures to prove his thesis that the number of Han people
is greater than Tibetans. The fact is that the Tibetan population
has grown from one million in 1953 to 2.4 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
That growth rate is much higher that for inland areas. The
proportion of Tibetans in Tibet has stayed above 95 percent, while
the Han people only account for about 3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Van Den Broek on EU-Russia Relations in Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Commissioner Hans van den Broek
today hailed the cooperation between the European Union and Russia
as a vital contribution to the maintenance of peace and stability
in Europe in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner, responsible for EU's external relations with
central and eastern Europe, said that the EU has reserved part of
its energy for the determination to strengthen and deepen the
relationship with Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The challenges on the eve of the 21st century are not only to
stimulate a further development of trade and economic links," he
told an audience at the Moscow School of Political Studies, "but
also to diversify the relations between EU and Russia and renew
our traditional political and cultural ties which are a major
component for building a new Europe."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, of which copies were available here, van den
Broek said that the time was ripe to broaden the base of EU-Russia
relations as the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement will enter
into force later this year.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement is the centerpiece of our future cooperation in
a wide range of areas and we have a common interest in ensuing its
rapid implementation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek added that new avenues of cooperation can be
explored in such sectors as transport, energy, science and
technology, space and industry.
</P>
<P>
Russia is an important trade partner with the 15-nation union.
Forty percent of its total foreign trade is with EU countries.
</P>
<P>
It is also the largest recipient of EU assistance in projects
worth a total of over 1.2 billion ECU (1.31 billion
U.S. dollars). These projects range from privatization of
enterprises to improvement of nuclear safety.
</P>
<P>
The European commissioner is paying a four-day visit in return
for Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to the
union in July.
</P>
<P>
He assured the audience at the Moscow School of Political
Studies that EU enlargement is designed to strengthen stability
and security.
</P>
<P>
He briefed the audience that the union is considering
commencing accession negotiations next year with Poland, Hungary,
the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner is also scheduled to visit St. Petersburg
before winding up his trip to Russia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets With Yugoslavian Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng, meeting with
Milan Milutinovic, foreign minister of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia today, said that China is ready to push forward
long-term and stable development in Sino-Yugoslavian relations
through joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government places great emphasis on relations with
Yugoslavia and respects its pursuit of an independent domestic and
foreign policy, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that traditional co-operation between the two
countries has withstood the test of history, and that further
expansion of bilateral ties is in the fundamental interests of the
two peoples.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government also emphasizes economic and trade ties
with Yugoslavia and hopes to promote economic and trade
cooperation with Yugoslavia in accordance with the principle of
equality and mutual benefit, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that bilateral economic and trade
cooperative relations will develop steadily.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic said that Yugoslavia and China have maintained
sound political relations and that there exists enormous potential
in bilateral co-operation in the economic and trade sector.
</P>
<P>
The two countries share identical or similar views on many
important international issues, and Yugoslavia appreciates China's
principled stand on regional affairs in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his appreciation for the policy of peace
Yugoslavia has pursued in settling the crisis in the former
Yugoslavian region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese government has always held that
disputes within or between the countries of that region should
only be solved by peaceful means and that China hopes that all
countries in that region will become good neighbors, and devote
themselves to the cause of peace, stability and
development.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Invited to Join Talks on Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- British government announced on
Friday to formally invite Sinn Fein, the political arm of the
Irish Republic Army (IRA), to join the multi-party talks on
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"I know the road ahead won't be easy and there will be
differing views around the table," Secretary of State for Northern
Ireland Marjorie Mowlam said when she announced the invitation.
</P>
<P>
Marjorie said she has been satisfied that the IRA ceasefire was
genuine.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came less than six weeks after the IRA
declared the latest ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of the information that I have at present, I
believe it to be an unequivocal ceasefire. Active targeting has
stopped," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that Sinn Fein met the requirements for participation
in the talks, which are due to resume on September 15.
</P>
<P>
The British government has not regarded Sinn Fein as an equal
partner in political talks since 1921 when the rest of Ireland
became independent.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam's announcement followed talks with her security advisers
and the Irish government.

<HEADLINE> France Gains Big Trade Surplus in 1st Half of 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- France gained 80.6 billion francs
(about 13 billion U.S. dollars) of trade surplus in the first half
of 1997, more than double that of the same period in 1996, the
French Customs said today.
</P>
<P>
In June alone, France registered a 18.78 billion francs (3.1
billion U.S. dollar) of trade surplus, a record high for monthly
overseas trade of the country.
</P>
<P>
Half of the trade surplus came from the sale of French products
in European Union member countries, mainly Britain, Spain and
Italy, which bought many French cars in the period.
</P>
<P>
French exports in the first half of 1997 grew by 6 percent over
the second half of 1996, and by 10.7 percent over the first half
of 1996, said the French Customs.
</P>
<P>
French automobile sales abroad increased 18 percent in the
first half of 1997 as compared with the same period of last year,
and competitiveness of French products grew with the rise of the
U.S. dollar and the British pound.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports grew only 2.5 percent in the period as
compared with the second half of 1996, and by 5 percent as
compared with the same period of last year, due to weak
consumption at home.
</P>
<P>
Apart from its automobile sales abroad which amounted to 16
billion francs (2.6 billion U.S. dollars) in the first six months
of 1997, France also increased its export of professional
equipment in the period.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) today announced that the official foreign
exchange reserves of Hong Kong stood at 81.7 billion U.S. dollars
at the end of July, placing Hong Kong at fifth in the world
rankings.
</P>
<P>
The figure included the reserves held in Hong Kong's Land Fund,
the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of July, the foreign reserves held in the Exchange
Fund were 66.1 billion U.S. dollars and those in the Land Fund
were 15.6 billion U.S. dollars, while the comparable end-June
figures were 67.6 billion U.S. dollars and 15.3 billion U.S.
dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
It said the slight fall in the Exchange Fund foreign reserves
was due to seasonal factors.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the HKMA said: "U.S. dollars were used to
redeem currency notes in July as currency in circulation returned
to normal levels after the relatively high level over the long
weekend at the end of June. July was also one of the drier months
of the year when the government had to draw down its fiscal
reserves placed with the Exchange Fund."

<HEADLINE> Political Thaw Enlivens Stock Market in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot stock market is
witnessing a better-than-expected performance in the traditionally
sluggish trading season in August thanks to an improving political
climate.
</P>
<P>
The CISCO All-Share Index closed on Thursday at 386 points,
marking a weekly rise of 4.3 points or 1.1 percent, said a report
issued by the Cyprus Investment and Securities Corporation Limited
(CISCO) today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the total weekly volume of
transactions this week was at 1.8 million Cyprus pounds (about
3.6 million U.S. dollars) compared to 1.4 million pounds (about
2.8 million dollars) the week before.
</P>
<P>
The monthly gains of the stock market are estimated at 2.7
percent, whereas the losses since the beginning of the current
year are contained at 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although trading remained at very low levels in the holiday
season this month, a gradual ascend in prices was observed, which
resulted in a capital appreciation of almost 3 percent within
August, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The CISCO attributed the moderate development to the betterment
in political atmosphere for solving the Cyprus issue as a key
reason.
</P>
<P>
The past two months saw a series of direct talks between the
leaders of the rival Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities
on solution to the 23-year-old division of the Mediterranean
Island.
</P>
<P>
Investors are still awaiting more political development in this
regard before they can do more, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Trailer Collision Kills 11 in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- At least 11 persons, including a
mother and a baby, were burnt to death when a trailer loaded with
petrol hit a stationary car and burst into flames in west
Nigeria's Oyo state.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place at about 4:00 a.m. Thursday at the
Ojoo end of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, the scene of similar
accidents in the past, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy occurred when the trailer driver lost control and
rammed his vehicle into a waiting Mazda car and exploded in a
ball of fire.
</P>
<P>
Also affected in the tragic were five trailer tankers, over 50
market stalls, 16 houses and a nearby power transformer which
were razed completely.
</P>
<P>
Eye witnesses said the victims were mostly "trailer boys" who
usually sleep under various trailers parked at the Ojoo trailer
garage and were caught unaware by the fire incident while they
were still sleeping.
</P>
<P>
The woman was breast-breeding her baby in one of the nearby
shops when the collided trailer rammed into it and was said to
have been burnt along with the child beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
Fire service men were on hand at about 4:30 a.m. and their
rescue operation only succeeded in saving from death seven people
who had earlier been trapped in the fire and were rushed to
hospitals immediately.
</P>
<P>
Oyo State Administrator Col. Ahmed Usman visited the scene at
about 10:00 a.m. and expressed sympathy for the victims'
relatives as he viewed several burnt bodies laid on the ground.
</P>
<P>
He ordered that no trailer must be parked henceforth along the
Ojoo road, along with the removal of those still there.
</P>
<P>
He warned that any trailer parked on the expressway would be
confiscated.
</P>
<P>
The place became a trailer park several years ago and usually
causing traffic hold-ups despite several warnings by the Federal
Road Safety Commission.

<HEADLINE> PNA: Israeli Closure Not for Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Minister of Local Government Saeb Erekat today demanded an
end to the month-long closure Israel has clamped on Palestinian
territories, which he said has no relation to security.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government has designed these punitive measures to
exercise pressure on the Palestinians and divert world attention
from the main issue, namely peace," Erekat told Voice of Arabs
radio in an interview monitored here.
</P>
<P>
Israel clamped the closure on the West Bank and Gaza and sealed
off Palestinian-ruled cities in the West Bank after the Jerusalem
suicide attack that killed 16 people on July 30.
</P>
<P>
This month Israel gradually lifted "internal closures" on the
cities. On Wednesday, it lifted the one on Bethlehem, the last
enclave under siege.
</P>
<P>
However, it maintains the total closure on the Palestinian
territories, saying that its lifting was conditional on the PNA's
actions to crack down on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this siege, the Palestinian people are suffering
daily losses of up to 8.5 million U.S. dollars, Erekat told the
radio.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian minister said that a complete closure on the
West Bank and Gaza remains intact and Israel continues to tear
down Palestinians' homes.
</P>
<P>
A total of 372 homes were bulldozed during the rule of Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and over 700 demolition warnings
were sent out to Palestinians, he added.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat has stated that the security
relations between the two sides had been improved to enable the
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to conduct her first
visit to the region next month. He is expecting Albright to
pressure Israel to end all the Israeli sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Israel-PNA peace talks stalled since Israel started the
construction of a new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem in March
and a promised resumption of talks was disrupted by the July 30
bombing attacks.

<HEADLINE> French Minister Recognizes "Losing Ground" in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The French State Secretary of
Cooperation Charles Josselin admitted today France is losing
ground in Africa while the United States is becoming more and more
active in the black continent.
</P>
<P>
However, Josselin said that the situation is "reversible" in
Africa to allow France maintain its stand there.
</P>
<P>
"Concerning the French-speaking African countries... in several
of them, our image is blurred. In a couple of them, not many, it
is degraded," said Josselin at a conference of 169 French envoys
meeting at home.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches addressed to the conference earlier this
week, both President Jacques Chirac and Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine called for the strengthening of the European Union as a
counter-weight against the United States in the world politics.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine warned Thursday against what he called "American
hegemonism", suggesting the building of a European federation
covering foreign policy and defense, but starting from the launch
of the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
"Here and there, we have lost ground," said Josselin in today's
session of the ambassadors, adding that the United States is again
taking action in Africa after "having abandoned for several years"
the continent after the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Americans are "selective" in deciding which
African countries to cooperate with, and focused their attention
on those with oil and mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
"The United States will not drive France out of Africa. France
will not vanish when they approach," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
plunged 1.5 percent to close at its lowest level since May,
spooked by steep falls on Asian and U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
Some bargain-hunting towards the end of the session pulled the
local bourse off its lows.

<P>
The all ordinaries index finished 38.3 points lower at 2593.0,
having fallen as much as 63.5 points during the day.
</P>

The sell-off came after the Dow's 92.9 point overnight fall to
7,694.43 was followed up by a 740.85 point loss in Hong Kong and a
1.2 percent fall in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said some disappointed profit results out today
contributed to the negative sentiment in the local bourse, which
was sold off across the board.
</P>
<P>
ANZ, one of the major banks in Australia, was responsible for
3.7 points of the all ordinaries' fall, while Coca-Cola Amatil

9.78 Australian dollars, NAB was down 16 cents to 18.90 Australian
dollars, Westpac eased 17 cents to 7.89 Australian dollars and CBA
shed 21 cents to 15.04 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Paper and packaging group Amcor, which reported a year net loss
of 80.1 million Australian dollars (59.27 million U.S. dollars)
compared with a profit the previous year of 338.8 million
Australian dollars (250.7 million U.S. dollars), was 6.1 cents
weaker at 8.24 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index finished 23.2 points weaker at 1357.2,
with BHP dropping 17 cents to 17.08 Australian dollars, Rio Tinto
losing 23 cents to 20.11 Australian dollars and WMC off 22 cents
to 6.90 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold marker closed 29 points down at 1305.2, with gold
bullion in Sydney closing at 324.70 U.S. dollars an ounce from
325.55 U.S. dollars there last.
</P>
<P>
National turnover totaled 483.05 million shares valued at 1.61
billion Australian dollars (1.19 billion U.S. dollars), boosted by
Thursday's expiry of options.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Lower After U.S. Selling, Asia Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. banking selling, weak
Asian currencies, and position squaring ahead of a long weekend in
the U.S. have caused the Australian dollar to lose nearly 3/4 of a
U.S. cent today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished trading in Sydney at 73.44 U.S.
cents, compared with Thursday's finish of 74.15, after it spent
today trading between 73.30 and 73.75 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Andrew McGill, senior dealer with Chase Manhattan, said weaker
Asian markets had raised concerns for Australian companies with
business interests in the countries concerned and the effect that
their weakness would have on Australian exports.
</P>
<P>
Mark McCloskey, senior manager with Rothschild Australia,
attributed this afternoon's domestic weakness to position squaring
ahead of the long weekend in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The markets there are closed next Monday for a labor day
holiday and market participants in Sydney are predicting trading
in the U.S. markets tonight will be quite volatile with new home
sales for June among the data to be released.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 87.37 Japanese yen, from 87.94
yen and against the German mark, it was at 1.3188, from 1.3471.

KUWAIT CITY, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The first scheduled flight

Tehran is to start operation Saturday, Kuwait News Agency reported

</P>
<P>
Iranian officials in Saudi western coast city of Jeddah were

<P>
The new flight service was stipulated in a Saudi-Iranian
agreement signed last March.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Rate Drops in July in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate dropped by
0.6 percent in July in France, which means that 17,900 more people
have jobs that month than June, the Ministry of Employment and
Solidarity said today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,113,000 people were jobless in France in July,
representing 12.5 percent of the country's working age population,
against 12.6 percent in June, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
But the unemployment rate rose by 1.7 percent over the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
After two consecutive months of rise of unemployment rate in
May and June, the improvement of the labor market mainly benefited
youth under 25 years old, more particularly the male population of
that age group, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
However, the official National Agency for Employment said that
the number of people seeking jobs increased by 0.5 percent in July
as compared with June, and by 9.5 percent as compared with the
same month of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The number of chronically unemployed people stood at 1.1
million in July.
</P>
<P>
According to an old way of calculating unemployment, which
takes into the people who work less than 78 hours a month as
jobless, the unemployment rate dropped by 0.1 percent in July as
compared with June, and increased by 4.2 percent over the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The French economy and exports were stimulated by the
continuous rise of the U.S. dollar over the past few months, and
the French government has predicted a 2.9-3 percent of economic
growth rate in 1998.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Leader to Co-operate With Angolan Gvt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The leader of Angola's former
rebelsr Jonas Savimbi has promised to have an all-round
cooperation with the government and United Nations, according to
a visiting US presidential envoy.
</P>
<P>
Paul Hare, special envoy of US President Bill Clinton, said
here Thursday evening that Savimbi, leader of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), told him that he
agreed to reinstate government power institutions in areas under
UNITA's control.
</P>
<P>
Hare said after his meeting with Savimbi, the UNITA leader has
promised to hand over a report of the number of his
organization's personnel and arms to the joint committee of the
Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hare, who came to the country on August 22, said that his
meetings with Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos and the
UNITA leader Savimbi indicate that both leaders in the country
have promised a peaceful solution to the crisis in the country,
despite all the problems.
</P>
<P>
Hare said that his talk with Savimbi was "detailed, frank
and constructive."
</P>
<P>
On the same day that Savimbi made the above promises, the UN
Security Council passed a resolution to impose sanction over
UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, to come into effect as of September 30,
stipulates that no visa will be issued to UNITA leaders and their
relatives within UN member countries, if UNITA refuses to
implement the Lusaka Peace Protocol singed in November 1994.

<HEADLINE> Fall of Share Prices Temporary in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The fall of local stock prices
was temporary even if the country's economy is feeling the pinch
of the currency crisis sweeping the region, the Philippine
Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) said today.
</P>
<P>
PIDS spokesman Ponciano Intal traced the downsides of the local
stock market to the fall of the Malaysian ringgit and the
Singaporean dollar, which in turn affected the exchange rate of
the peso.
</P>
<P>
Intal said the Philippine Stock Exchange is likely to bounce
back. However, he added that it could take a while before the
market returns to its peak level.
</P>
<P>
There are reports attributing the plunge of the stock market to
the slowdown of the economy in the first half of the year and
political uncertainty aggravated by Charter change movement in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Amid the fears, the local bourses market plummeted by 50.45
more points after falling 212.06 points, the highest loss in a
single day in 10 years, to close at 2,071.97 points on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Intal viewed the negative development in the local stock market
as nothing but the impact of the region-wide currency crisis, in
which fund managers have shifted their investments into stable
issues like government securities.

<HEADLINE> National Party Chief Should be a Black: Former S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
foreign minister Pick Botha has suggested that the new national
party leader should be a black.
</P>
<P>
"I would have preferred, if it were at all possible, for a
black leader to be elected right now as the leader the party,"
Botha told a press conference on Thursday when he was referring
to the vacancy of presidency of national party left by F.W. De
Klerk.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, former South African president, announced on Tuesday
that he would quit politics after 25 years of service, saying the
announcement would be effective when a new party leader is
elected on September 5.
</P>
<P>
Botha said he had agreed to stand in the succession race on
condition that the party went back into the government of
national unity that it left last year.
</P>
<P>
"The (national) party had to become part of a larger political
alliance and gain the support of the black majority," Botha said.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that his party was trying to adapt to the
non-racial politics of South Africa, but were having trouble
persuading blacks, who for decades suffered the humiliation and
injustice of apartheid, that they should support them.
</P>
<P>
Many blacks agreed with the national party on various policies
and were in the same political school, he said, "but we are
prevented from...joining each other because of the party's
structures of the past."
</P>
<P>
Botha, 64, had been South African foreign minister for 17
years until the first non-racial general elections was held in
1994.
</P>
<P>
He quit politics in June last year when the national party
left the government, in which he served as minister of energy and
mineral affairs.
</P>
<P>
He has challenged for the party leadership twice before. He
lost in 1978 against P.W. Botha, and in 1989 to De Klerk.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today paid tribute to outgoing National Party
leader F.W De Klerk, saying the relatively peaceful transition in
the country was thanks in part to the former state president's
contribution.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the national council of provinces, Mandela said he
had worked with De Klerk for eight years, and had been impressed
by his "boldness to acknowledge the march of history and to take
steps that few in his position would dare".
</P>
<P>
"In doing so, he put his political career and life in danger,
and became one of the eminent midwives of the new democratic
order."
</P>
<P>
He said even though De Klerk had committed many mistakes, "we
shall always acknowledge the contribution that he made to the
country and its people."
</P>
<P>
De Klerk announced Tuesday that he would retire after engaging
in 25 years of political activities. He said his announcement
would be effective on September 5 when a news party leader is
elected.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Peace panels from both the
government and the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have
agreed to hold their next round of low-level talks on September 2
in the southern Philippines, the Philippine News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF deputy chief for political affairs, said
the two panels are expected to come up with positive results on
the basic rules for the implementation of a general ceasefire
agreement they signed on July 18.
</P>
<P>
In their previous meetings, both panels set aside the laying of
the ground rules for the general ceasefire, giving way to
recommendations on the situation of families displaced by recent
clashes between the rebels and government troops.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF), the mainstream rebel group which signed a final
peace agreement with the government last year.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MNLF will celebrate the first
anniversary of their peace agreement in Sulu province on September
2. President Fidel Ramos and Nur Misuari, MNLF chairman and
governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, will attend
the celebrations.

LUSAKA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaria remains number one
killer disease in tropical and sub-tropical African countries
including Zambia while AIDS related diseases have also continued

The newspaper quoted Dr Emmanuel Kafwembe, head of department

<HEADLINE> 4 Israeli Soldiers Die in Brush Fire (UPDATE) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Four Israeli soldiers were
burned to death and six others wounded when caught in the middle
of a fierce brush fire Thursday following a gunbattle in south
Lebanon, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The wounded were treated in the field once the flames died down
and later evacuated to hospitals. One soldier was reported in
critical condition and two others were said to have sustained
serious injuries. Three were moderately hurt.
</P>
<P>
The event occurred in the afternoon after a clash between
Israeli troops and a squad from the Amal Shi'ite movement. The
troops had been on ambush duty in a thickly vegetated valley known
as Wadi Hujuar west of Kanatra village on the border of "the
security zone" in the eastern sector.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Beirut said two Amal squad members were killed in
the clash.
</P>
<P>
There were no casualties among Israeli soldiers, but they
stayed in place and called support units to pound the area with
mortars and artillery fire, the Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, also claimed in a statement issued
in Beirut that its fighters joined the battle later and opened
fire with machine guns.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoted Lebanese security sources as
saying the fighting raged for at least five hours, setting a large
swathe of the scrubland on fire which resulted in the death of the
Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the brush fire was caused by the
"friendly fire" or by rounds fired by anti-Israeli militants.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources believed the blaze was caused by
Israeli artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Israeli army spokesman said that "In the
area of the clash a brush fire erupted as a result of the shooting
and heavy winds propelled the fire towards the IDF (Israel Defense
Forces) force."
</P>
<P>
"The soldiers detected the approaching fire and tried to
extricate themselves but the fire caught up with them and caused
the death of four soldiers, and six were injured," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, the heaviest ground clash for months, followed
three weeks of escalating violence in south Lebanon in which more
than 30 people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,000-kilometer-square border zone in south
Lebanon in 1985. And anti-Israeli guerrillas are fighting to oust
Israeli troops and their local militia allies from this
area.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia not Interested in Staging 1998 Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is not interested
in staging the 1998 Asian Games even though Thailand is to give up
its hosting right to the biggest event in the region, the
Secretary of the Olympic Council of Malaysia said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) Wednesday called an emergency
meeting to discuss the issue of stripping Thailand of its right to
hold the Asian Games in December next year.
</P>
<P>
Report released at Bangkok said Thailand might not host the
region's biggest sporting event because of sponsorship contracts
and political meddling in the run-up of the Games.
</P>
<P>
But Sieh Kok Chi said: "the Thai Olympic Council is very good
and I think they can manage it very well. There may be some
interference from the politicians, but the Olympic Council can
manage it."
</P>
<P>
Sieh also said that Malaysia could afford to host the Asian
Games since it will host the Commonwealth Games in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
He also added that as far as he was concerned Thailand was
still very interested in hosting the Games.

<HEADLINE> 4 Israeli Soldiers Die in Brush Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Four Israeli soldiers were
burned to death and six others wounded when caught in the middle
of a fierce brush fire Thursday following a gunbattle in south
Lebanon, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The wounded were treated in the field once the flames died down
and later evacuated to hospitals. One soldier was reported in
critical condition and two others were said to have sustained
serious injuries. Three were moderately hurt.
</P>
<P>
The event occurred in the afternoon after a clash between
Israeli troops and a squad from the Amal Shi'ite movement. The
troops had been on ambush duty in a thickly vegetated valley known
as Wadi Hujuar west of Kanatra village on the border of "the
security zone" in the eastern sector.
</P>
<P>
In the clash, four Amal squad members were killed. There were
no casualties among Israeli soldiers, but they stayed in place and
called support units to pound the area with mortars and artillery
fire.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, also claimed in a statement from
Beirut that its fighters joined the battle later and opened fire
with machine guns.
</P>
<P>
Then, a blaze broke out in the area and quickly spread. It is
not clear whether the brush fire was caused by the "friendly fire"
or by rounds fired by anti-Israeli militants.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Israeli army spokesman said that "In
the area of the clash a brush fire erupted as a result
of the shooting and heavy winds propelled the fire towards
the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) force."
</P>
<P>
"The soldiers detected the approaching fire and tried to
extricate themselves but the fire caught up with them and caused
the death of four soldiers, and six were injured," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,000-kilometer-square border zone in south
Lebanon in 1985. And anti-Israeli guerrillas are fighting to oust
Israeli troops and their local militia allies from this
area.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Automotive-Related Exports Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli companies are
expected to sell over 500 million U.S. dollars in automotive
components by the year 2000, according to a report of the Tel
Aviv-based Israel Export Institute (IEI) published here today.
</P>
<P>
The companies exported some 300 million dollars in 1996 and
is expected to grow about 20 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
"Many Israeli companies have identified the automotive
industry as a niche where there is potential for growth," Asher
Amato, director of the IEI's metal and machinery department, was
quoted as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that many military companies have succeeded in
applying their technologies to the car industry.
</P>
<P>
Israel Aircraft Industries, the country's giant military
company, is a partner in a firm that develops collision avoidance
systems for cars.
</P>
<P>
As more and more high-tech developments drive the way
automobile manufacturers design, develop and manufacture cars, a
growing number of Israeli companies are entering the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
Companies like Technomatix, a supplier of
automobile-manufacturing software, Baran, the developer of the
"Red Alert" automatic braking system, and Azimut Technologies, a
maker of global positioning systems that allow companies to
electronically track their automotive fleets, are selling to
big name car companies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago the only thing electronic in a car was a
spark plug or blinker. Eventually all the things in a car will
become electronic and Israeli companies excel in developing
electronic parts and components," said Seth Vogelman,
international media consultant for the Ministry of Industry and
Trade.
</P>
<P>
While Israeli companies are exporting components and
development tools to companies such as Mercedes-Benz, General
Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Peugeot-Citroen, Honda and
Mazda, Foreign automotive companies are also realizing Israel's
local potential, said the IEI report.

BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 22.4 million Chinese have
learned to read and write in the past five years, with the
illiteracy rate dropping from 15.8 percent in 1990 to 12.01
percent, according to the State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
China has improved education, environmental protection,
cultural development, and public health in the past five years. A
nine-year education program has been in place in half of China,
and for every 100 Chinese 36 have an education above the middle
school level.
</P>
<P>
China treated 17.4 percent of its solid waste and 90 percent of
its waste gas in 1996, and recycled 81.6 percent of its waste
water, 18 percentage points higher than in 1991. It spent 250
million yuan on 28 national-level pollution control projects and
has shut down 60,700 heavily polluting mills.
</P>
<P>
The SSB says that there were 15,000 hospitals above the county
level in 1996, an increase of 1,400 from 1991. It attributed the
social development to increased involvement and government
spending since the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party
of China in 1992.
</P>
<P>
China adopted a number of new laws on education, environmental
protection and public health, and established a number of special
committees to enforce the laws.
</P>
<P>
Rapid economic growth has also boosted social undertakings and
resulted in an increase in spending on education, public health,
and science and culture. State spending in these sectors shot up
from 70.8 billion yuan in 1991 to 146.7 billion yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
China has also accumulated over five billion yuan for 200,000
social security funds in the five years.

DAR ES SALAAM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The infant mortality in
Tanzania has declined from 92 to 88 deaths per 1,000 live births,
according to the country's 1996 demographic and health Survey.
</P>
<P>
The mortality of the babies under five years of age has
dropped from 141 to 137 per 1,000, with two thirds of the deaths
occurring during the first year of life.
</P>
<P>
The report launched Thursday, said that 71 percent of children
between 12 and 23 months have received all the recommended
vaccinations while only 3 percent have not received any.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 26 percent of children are partially vaccinated,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Immunization coverage improves substantially as mother's level
of education increases, from 58 percent for those whose mothers
have no formal education to 77 percent for those with educationed
mothers.
</P>
<P>
The report said that diarrhoea and respiratory illness are the
common cause of child deaths, citing two weeks before the survey
when 14 percent of children had diarrhoea and 13 percent had
acute respiratory infections.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Wool prices fell sharply this
week although the quantity of wool on offer dropped to the lowest
this season in Australia, the Australian Council of Wool Exporters
said in its weekly market review released today.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator closed at 671 Australian cents
(4.96 U.S. dollars) a clean kilogram, down 18 Australian cents (13
U.S. cents), after sales at Newcastle and Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
The western market indicator dropped 27 Australian cents (20
U.S. cents) to close at 620 Australian cents (4.58 dollars )
clean/kg.
</P>
<P>
"Exporters advise that the downward movement in prices over
recent weeks essentially reflects too much wool coming to auction
too early in the season," the council said.
</P>
<P>
Auction clearances were already 100,000 bales, or 30 percent,
above the corresponding level last season.
</P>
<P>
"The significant weakening in prices over recent weeks
unfortunately has also triggered an increase in reported delays in
the opening of letters of credit and in requests for renegotiation
prices by customers in China."
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 bales are rostered for sale next week in Sydney,
Melbourne and Fremantle.

JINAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Some of the charm returned to
Shandong Province's capital city of Jinan, known as the "city of

numerous travelers and scholars and are still a source of tourism
income.

However, modern construction and urban development in addition
to natural disasters buried 16 of them and damaged 21 of most

called for the restoration of all the springs that could be
repaired, within three years.

ROME, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Italian Interior Minister Giorgio
Napolitano met his French counterpart Jean Pierre Chevenement here
today to make arrangements for the two countries' two-day summit
beginning October 2.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi and French
President Jacques Chirac will not only discuss bilateral
relations, but also important international issues such as the
future of European Commission and NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
It was commonly deemed that the summit is not only of great
importance to France and Italy, but will also have impact on
Europe and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed removing Italian border
control on October 26 when the Schengen accords take affect in
Italy. The Schengen accords, which now have seven signatory
countries, allow free movement across borders in Europe except
Britain and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two ministers vowed to cooperate thoroughly to
relieve Italy of pressure of mass immigration and prevent further
illegal immigration into the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The issue of illegal immigration has become a headache in Italy
this summer. It was reported that there are now as many as 10,000
refugees from Albania because of the troubles there earlier this
year and they are now reluctant to be repatriated.

SARAJEVO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- NATO-led troops fired tear gas
from helicopters at agitated Bosnian Serb crowds in Brcko this
afternoon, leading to a tense clash.
</P>
<P>
The troops also fired warning shots at protesters besieging NATO

NEW DELHI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bombay Stock Exchange
(BSE), the biggest and oldest bourse in India, will soon be going

</P>
<P>
The country's Department of Telecommunication has finally
cleared the proposal of the Bombay bourse for setting up terminals
outside Mumbai (Bombay).
</P>
<P>
"We will be expanding our trading terminals to 99 specified
centers soon in the whole country," said BSE President M.G.
Damani.
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had cleared
the Bombay online trading system (BOLT) last month allowing the
BSE to expand at centers other than the stock exchange ones.
</P>
<P>
The services to the clients of these centers would be provided
by BSE brokers by either directly opening a branch there or
through sub-brokers, duly authorized and registered with SEBI. All
the contracts would be executed at Mumbai and investors'
grievances would be resolved by the bourse.
</P>
<P>
The BSE would ensure that there is adequate monitoring and
surveillance mechanism for these outstation terminals in order to
oversee the trades, the SEBI sources said.

DHAKA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE),
the main bourse of Bangladesh, ended an extremely bearish week on
Thursday with its price index declining to a two-year low of
814.97 points.
</P>
<P>
It was the second week the DSE index closed down more than 50
points after it ended the previous week down 54.22 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed the ongoing slide to a host of factors
including credit squeeze, lack of confidence and a dual system of
settlement of deals followed by the Dhaka bourse and its
counterpart Chittagong Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The week had only three trading days instead of five as trading
could not take place on Sunday and Monday due to a strike and
Janmastami holiday respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the last trading day Thursday, a total of 311,992 shares and
debentures worth 48.46 million taka (about 1.09 million U.S.
dollars) were traded. Out of the 137 traded issues, only 37
advanced while 98 incurred losses and two remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that unless the fund flow improves through the
entry of institutional buyers or foreign investors there appears
no immediate hope of arresting the declining trend on the share
market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Finance Minister S.A.M.S. Kibria said Thursday that
the government had already taken various steps to boost the stock
market. He mentioned the recent assistance given by the Asian
Development Bank to develop the capital market.

railways during the Eighth Five-Year Plan. And the
Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway Joint-Stock Company Ltd has been listed
on the New York and Hong Kong stock exchanges. This can be an
example for other railway enterprises, Han said.
</P>
<P>
The Minister also said that the problem of a falling transport
capacity is getting better, and that China's railway departments
are trying to improve service, simplify transport procedures, and
improve the ticketing system. Moreover, the speed of trains has
been increased as of April 1 of this year.
</P>
<P>
A unified transport system of railways, highways, aviation and
water transport should be built taking fullest advantage of every
means of transport, the Minister says.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, railways have a larger carrying capacity,
travel long distances, operate at lower costs, and are not so
bothered by weather, not to mention the safety, energy-saving, and
low pollution advantages, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Railways should play a major part," Han concludes, predicting
that the cargo volume of railways will reach 1.5 trillion ton/km
by the year 2000, and the passenger volume, 470 billion
person/km.

</P>
<P>
Thursday's matches were delayed for five hours because of the

<P>
Sampras will next meet 81st-ranked Alex Radulescu of Germany,

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Making Progress in Protecting Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Forest covered areas expanded
from 136,000 to 140,000 hectares in the central volcanic range of
Costa Rica from 1986 to 1996, the Environment Ministry announced
today.
</P>
<P>
Changes, mainly deforestation, which occurred in the past, have
been under close supervision via satellite photography and
geographic information systems for the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The growth and enlargement of the forest covered areas is due
in part to the forest law which was promulgated in 1990. The law
prohibits cutting trees, according to environmental sources.
</P>
<P>
The Environment Ministry has also drawn up a series of measures
directed to protect, manage and help forests recover.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures is the creation of a tax system to promote
re-planting and afforestation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a forest protection certificate established in
1995 provides land owners with a powerful weapon to protect their
forests. This has resulted in the conservation of some 21,000
hectares, the Environment Ministry estimated.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Push ASEAN to Protect Agricultural Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will push ASEAN into
adopting a new role in protecting ASEAN agricultural products
against non-tariff barriers advocated by its trading partners and
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
The proposal will be set forth at the 19th meeting of ASEAN
agriculture and forestry ministers in Bangkok next month, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Pitipong Pungbun, deputy permanent secretary of the Thai
Agriculture and Cooperatives Ministry was quoted as saying that
his ministry would put forth a proposal to cooperate against
barriers which are considered a treat to ASEAN agricultural
products.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand would propose the establishment of the ASEAN
Shrimp Industry Task Force (ASITF) to counter environmental
groups' allegations that shrimp farming is destructive to mangrove
forests and the coastal environment.
</P>
<P>
Pitipong said ASEAN envisaged that farmed shrimps would
increase supplies in an environmentally friendly manner and thus
enhance world food supplies. He added: "the allegations are unfair
to ASEAN which is the biggest shrimp producer and exporter."
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN may have to join forces in countering these allegations
and adopting a common stand against unfair environmental practices
imposed by its trading partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Pitipong, the ministers would also sign a
memorandum of understanding on ASEAN Sea Turtle Conservation and
Protection (ASTCP) during the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Kilmarnock Maintain First-Leg Advantage to Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Jim McIntyre's goal secured a
slender 2-1 first leg lead for Scotland's Kilmarnock in their
preliminary round second leg clash with Shelbourne of Dublin on
Thursday at the European Cup Winners' Cup.
</P>
<P>
McIntyre bulleted home a 25-meter-drive in the 21st minute,
perfectly fed by Billy Findlay, to give the Scots the breakthrough
on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
The Dublin side seemed to equalise on the 33rd minute when
Dessie Baker dived into the Kilmarnock defence to supply a pass
for Mark Rutherford, whose header narrowly slid off the pole.
</P>
<P>
However, the hosts capitulated on a dreadful error committed by
Yugoslav goalkeeper Drago Lekovic six minutes later to boost their
morale.
</P>
<P>
Baker intercepted Lekovic's pass to defender Ray Montgomerie,
blasting the equaliser to make it 1-1.
</P>
<P>
As the second half saw neither side to score any more goals,
Kilmarnock succeeded in ensuring the narrow first leg advantage to
book their passage to the Cup Winners' Cup.
</P>
<P>
Other highlights saw Legia Warsaw of Poland thrashed Northern
Ireland's Glenavon 4-0 to advance with 5-1 on aggregate, all goals
coming in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Glenavon's hope was kept alive until the break since they had a
1-0 first leg win over the giant killers, who have beaten
Manchester United and Blackburn in the past seasons.
</P>
<P>
But two goals from Tomasz Sokolowski and one apiece from Jacek
Kacprzak and Pawel Skrzypek smashed the dream of Glenavon.
</P>
<P>
Welsh side Cwmbran were slaughtered 7-0 by Romanian team
National Bucharest to lose 12-2 on aggregate.

WUHAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Yichang city in Hubei
province has been looking for overseas investment and hoping to
take advantage of the Three Gorges Dam project.
</P>
<P>
Yichang is the closest city to the gigantic dam project, now
under construction on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and
has organized three investment promotions since the beginning of
the year. Two were in Hong Kong and Singapore and resulted in
eight contracts of 200 million U.S. dollars in overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Yichang has 53 kinds of mineral ores and 14 large mineral
deposits. Phosphorus ore reserves are estimated at 1.2 billion
tons, accounting for 17 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
There are also big reserves of other minerals like manganese,
graphite, barite, granite, gold, silver, aluminium, copper and
tungsten.
</P>
<P>
The city has 485 overseas-backed businesses, 20 of them
established this year.
</P>
<P>
Yichang will try to improve its investment environment and will
hold two more investment fairs this fall in Beijing and Yichang.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Wants No Strings Attached on Arms Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government would
not buy armaments from Britain if that nation puts human rights as
conditions for weapons sales, sources at the Foreign Ministry here
said today.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, quoted by the sources,
said: "We would have to look at other sources and these I can tell
you are very much available."
</P>
<P>
Alatas made the comments on Thursday just hours before British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook was due to arrive here for a two-day
visit during which the issues of defense equipment sales and human
rights are expected to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Alatas made it clear that Indonesia would have no problem
meeting its own defense equipment needs if British or other
Western governments placed human rights as conditions for arms
sales.
</P>
<P>
On July 28, Britain's Labor government announced stringent new
rules on the export of defense equipment to what it called
"oppressive regimes," but exempted contracts with Indonesia made
under the previous Conservative government.
</P>
<P>
These included the sale of 16 Hawk fighter aircraft worth 260
million U.S. dollars, as well as 100 Saracen light tanks worth 250
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said Indonesia would have to see how Britain implemented
its new policy on arms sales.

<HEADLINE> China's Industrial Heartland Set to Enliven Major State Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SHENYANG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China's biggest industrial
base, Liaoning province, in the northeast, has started a
"breakthrough" program to revive its lumbering state-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
The three-year program involves the issuing of shares, greater
use of overseas capital, and more mergers, bankruptcies, and
lay-offs to try to get nearly 600 major companies in better health
by the end of the century, Governor Wen Shizhen told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
This follows hard on the heels of a recent visit by
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, where Zhu explained that it would take
three years to solve the problems of most of the big money-losers.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has about 1,000 large and medium-sized state-owned
firms, a tenth of the country's total, two-thirds of which are
burdened with poor management, low efficiency, heavy debts, and
bloated labor forces.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the immense difficulties involved, we are confident
of being able to complete the task, " Wen said, explaining that
there will be breakthroughs in the reforms, specifically in the
issuing of shares.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning will experiment with public ownership and turn most
of its major state enterprises into publicly-held firms or
corporations, with only a small number of larger firms fundamental
to the nation's interests to remain under state control.
</P>
<P>
By listing them on the stock market, Liaoning hopes to cut
debts by 100 billion yuan in three years and to lay off 800,000
people, attract 10 billion yuan in overseas investment for
renovation of 100 state firms, and further separate them from
government, with the aim to basically establishing a modern
enterprise system by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rupiah, Stock Prices Plunge Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Despite tight money policy, the
Indonesian rupiah continued to weaken Thursday, almost touching
the 3,000 level against the U.S. dollar, and the stock market
dropped 4.5 percent, dealers and brokers said today.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah, which opened at 2,900/2,915, weakened in the
afternoon and closed at 2,960/2,970.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said regional pressure appeared to be driving the
rupiah into a weaker zone and the traders have little idea what
the fair value of the rupiah should be.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian currencies crumbled Thursday as the Malaysian
ringgit threw off all remnants of poise and slumped to historic
lows.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, share prices on the Jakarta Stock Exchange tumbled
again Thursday by 4.5 percent, with the composite index falling
25.096 points to close at 530.366.
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts attributed the fall to weakening of the
rupiah and high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah fell to a historic low of 3,045 against the
greenback after the central bank floated the rupiah on August 14
in the wake of sustained speculative attacks on regional
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The currency started recovering following the central bank's
increase of interest rate on August 19.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the government will soon hold a meeting
to attended by all cabinet ministers to discuss the rupiah crisis.

<P>
CARACAS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-nine prisoners were
hacked and stabbed to death in a Venezuelan prison riot today,
authorities say.
</P>
<P>
There were also 13 prisoners seriously injured in the El Dorado
jail, 700 kilometers southeast of Caracas, the Justice Ministry

</P>
<P>
The attackers used machetes and knives, decapitating several
victims while others were badly burned.
</P>
<P>
The 20-minute fight started soon after dawn when many prisoners
were asleep. The disturbance broke out between longtime inmates at
the jail and Guajiro Indians who were transferred last November
from La Sabaneta in Maracaibo, near the northwest border with
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The motive for the fight was control of the prison, an official

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Soccer star Diego Maradona
failed a drug test after the first game of the Argentine league on
Sunday, the Argentine Football Association said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
AFA spokesman Washington Rivera said Maradona tested positive
for "prohibited substances", but gave no further details as the
latter has three days to demand a second test.
</P>
<P>
Maradona, 36, was picked up for the test after his number was
randomly singled out of a bag following Boca Junior's 4-2 victory
over Argentinos Juniors where he scored the penalty.

<P>
Maradona, who paced Argentina to World Cup success in 1986, has
twice failed drug tests in his career.

In 1991, he was banned for 15 months while playing for Napoli
in Italy. In 1994 he was kicked out of the World Cup finals in the

<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China will have 68,000
kilometers of railway lines by the year 2000, with the number in
use increasing by 3,000 km from the end of last year, Minister of
Railways Han Zhubin says.
</P>
<P>
Han told Xinhua that the railway bottleneck and its effects on
the national economy will be eased by the end of the century and
an effort will be made to improve old rail lines and the capacity
of existing railways.
</P>
<P>
A symbol of railway modernization is the amount of electrified
railways in use. That is expected to reach 27 percent, up nine
percentage points from the end of last year. The use of
double-deck lines will also increase to 34 percent from 32.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
"The past five years have seen the fastest railway growth since
1949," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period beginning in 1996, China
will build more than 6,000 km of railway lines, add more than
3,000 km of double-deck lines, and electrify more than 4,000 km,
according to Ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry has 11 key projects for the five-year period,
including the Nanning-Kunming railway, a rail line in the southern
part of Xinjiang in northwest China, and the Shuoxian to Huanghua
port railway.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican Health Ministry
decreed a national alert today following Wednesday's death of the
first victim of hemorrhagic dengue in the Puntarenas province, on
the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister German Weinstock predicted today there will be
more deaths caused by this illness.
</P>
<P>
The sickness is transmitted by the bite of an Andes mosquito,
which causes high fever and pain in the body, head, and joints.
</P>
<P>
A person infected a second time runs the risk of suffering the
hemorrhagic version of the sickness, frequently fatal.
</P>
<P>
There is no cure for dengue, an endemic illness in the region,
that had seemingly been controlled at the start of the decade.
However, it reemerged stronger in recent years. It is estimated
that about 30,000 people have been infected in the past five
years.

PANAMA CITY, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-two percent of
Panamanian employees lack training and 72 percent did not receive
an adequate education, according to a study by the Interamerican

</P>
<P>
The government's lack of concern and attention for education in

president of Panamanian Exporters Association, said today.
</P>
<P>
More education and training for workers in Panama would
increase productivity, said Selles, who is also vice president of

</P>
<P>
The government must strive to solve the social and educational
problems which are inhibiting productivity and slowing growth of
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The problems, if not corrected, will continue to make it more
difficult for Panama to participate and share in the dynamic
development of the world's economy. The government must encourage
education, which is fundamental for the development of the
economy, the Panamanian official added.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Stone Axe Discovered in North China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists
believe an ancient stone axe recently discovered in the city of
Chengde in north China's Hebei Province was made during the Spring
and Autumn Period (770-476 B.C.) of the Zhou Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The axe, 15 centimeters long and weighing 795.5 grams, was
found on April 9 by a Chengde city official during tree-planting
near a lamasery, one kilometer from an imperial summer resort in
the city.
</P>
<P>
He handed the axe over to the city's cultural relics bureau,
believing that the weapon was of historic value.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said the discovery of the axe provides useful
information for research of the economic development in that
period and suggests that human beings inhabited in the Chengde
area some 4,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The local government has praised the official for giving the
axe to the relics authorities.

<P>
SHANGHAI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The more than 5,000 foreign
experts currently working in Shanghai, China's leading
manufacturing center, are contributing greatly to the city's rural
development.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of technical and management experts working in
Shanghai's suburban foreign-funded enterprises continue to
introduce advanced techniques and management expertise which has
helped to raise the rural industrial output to account for 33.3
percent of the municipality's total.
</P>
<P>
Suburban Shanghai has attracted more foreign investors and
experts than the city proper over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese management expert by the name of Kogawa often
praises the suburban Songjiang industrial zone for its good
investment environment and highly proficient employees.
</P>
<P>
Experts from over 10 countries, including Japan, the Republic
of Korea, and the United States, are also playing an active role
in the development of Shanghai's suburban agriculture. Foreign
experts currently work in agricultural fields, such as the
cultivation of vegetables, flowers and fruits, the breeding of
domestic animals and birds, and the processing of agricultural
by-products.
</P>
<P>
Children of farmers in Shanghai suburbs also have the
opportunity to study under foreign teachers. A female Japanese
teacher named Yimatsu teaches Japanese in the Academy of
Professional Techniques. In addition, an American couple teaching
in a suburban middle school have received high praise from their
students.

the first half of next year.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>

<P>
The Age

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Against Attacks on Bosnia Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States will not
tolerate attacks on the peacekeeping troops led by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Bosnia, a White House
spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
The warning was issued by White House spokesman Joe Lockhart on
the island of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, where President
Bill Clinton is vacationing.
</P>
<P>
The warning was "a serious message that should be heeded," the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. troops were attacked earlier Thursday by demonstrators
in the Bosnian Serb-controlled town of Brcko after the soldiers
ousted Serb hardliners from command of a police station.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators threw bottles of flaming gasoline at U.S.
armored personnel carriers and that American troops fired warning
shots in the air and tear gas cannisters to make demonstrators
back away.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is more calm in Brcko than it was earlier
although it is still tense," Pentagon spokesman Mike Doubleday
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. soldiers were injured in the conflict. A U.S. Army
sergeant, whose eyes were injured, was evacuated to a U.S.
military facility at Tuzla. A second sergeant was treated on the
scene for head injuries and returned to duty.
</P>
<P>
"It's important that all of the parties there (in Bosnia)
understand that they should not challenge SFOR, and that we will
hold the leadership responsible for keeping their people under
control," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., which has more than 8,000 troops in Bosnia, has
indicated that it will continue to get involved in the
peacekeeping operation in Bosnia after the so-called Stabilization
Force (SFOR) withdraw next June.

<HEADLINE> Defending Champion Out of Cathay Pacific Open Squash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A second round match at the
Cathay Pacific Squash Open here on Thursday produced the biggest
setup so far in the event when defending champion Rodney Eyles
from Australia was eliminated by England's lowly-ranked Peter
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
Marshall, ranked 57th in the world after almost one year away
from the court for illness, outplayed the third-ranked Australian
15-10, 15-10, 15-6 in 43 minutes.
</P>
<P>
And world number one and top seed Jansher Khan from Pakistan
entered the top eight by winning 40th-ranked Nicholas Taylor of
England in straight games 15-8, 15-8, 15-8.
</P>
<P>
Seven-time winner Jansher Khan was stopped by Eyles in last
year's Hong Kong Open final. With the Australian arch rival out
of the title race here, the path to an eighth title is now wide
open to the legendary Pakistani.
</P>
<P>
Second seeded Peter Nicol of Scotland won over Mark Cairns of
England 15-11, 15-9, 15-5, also qualifying for the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
And fourth seed Jonathon Power from Canada downed Alex Gough
from Wales, ranked 15th in the world, 17-14, 15-9, 15-10.
</P>
<P>
Others who obtained spots in the top eight on Thursday were
20th-ranked Martin Heath of Scotland, 10th-ranked Australian,
eighth-ranked Del Harris from England and Australia's Byron Davis,
ranked 34th in the world.
</P>
<P>
In the quarter-finals on Friday, Jansher Khan clashes against
Heath, Marshall meets Martin, Harris faces Power and Nicol takes

<HEADLINE> World Bank Assists Water Supply Project in Paraguay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today okayed a
40 million U.S. dollar loan to assist Paraguay in its efforts to
upgrade water supply and sanitation coverage in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is the fourth of its kind, will provide
water supply services to about 330 communities and expand existing
systems in 10 other communities.
</P>
<P>
The project is also aimed to provide water supply and
sanitation to a group of 35 indigenous communities, helping
contribute to the poverty reduction through improved productivity
and health, particularly of women and children.
</P>
<P>
Water supply service will reach 340,000 inhabitants, while
another 140,000 people will benefit from sewage disposal systems.
Water supply coverage would increase from 20 percent of the rural
population in 1997 to about 30 percent in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The total project cost is some 55.7 million dollars. Apart from
the World Bank's loan, beneficiaries will cover 11.6 million
dollars and the Paraguay government is to contribute some 4.1
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Experts Say Half of Primate Species Face Extinction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Almost Half of all the 233
non-human primate species, the closest relatives to humans, face
extinction in the near future, the Worldwatch Institute reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, John Tuxill, a researcher of the institute,
indicated that that is mainly because they are losing their rain
forest habitats.
</P>
<P>
The habitat loss, along with hunting and the illegal pet trade,
make the non-human primates the most endangered group of mammals
on the planet, Tuxill said.
</P>
<P>
Primates include humans, gorillas and monkeys as well as
smaller creatures such as lemurs. Most of the non-human primates
live in deep forests.
</P>
<P>
"We already knew that birds, freshwater fish, reptiles,
amphibians and mammals in general are declining in number and
diversity, a warning that the Earth's biological diversity, which
supports our economic wealth, is in trouble," Tuxill said.
</P>
<P>
"The fate of forests will largely determine the fate of most
primates," said Tuxill. "And more and more forests are losing
their ecological integrity as they are logged, colonized, and
cleared for agriculture."
</P>
<P>
Forest habitat loss due to logging, mining, and encroaching
human settlements is the biggest problem facing threatened
primates, Tuxill stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the "hot-spots" where primates are most in danger
include the Atlantic coast of Brazil, West Africa, the Indian
Ocean island of Madagascar and much of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
In Madagascar, where all no-human primates are lemurs, some 80
percent of the island's old-growth forests have been lost since
the arrival of humans about 1,000 years ago. This helped drive
some 15 species to extinction and 20 of the 30 remaining are
imperiled.
</P>
<P>
Orangutans in Indonesia, for example, have lost 80 percent of
their habitat in 20 years and there are only 30,000 of these large
apes left, Tuxill told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Macaques in Japan are in danger from farmers who war with them
over crops, while apes and monkeys fall victim to hungry people in
Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, according to the researcher.
</P>
<P>
He urged the world community to scale up efforts to protect the
non-human primates.
</P>
<P>
"This will include better managing protected areas that already
shelter primates," he said. "It will also include expanding public
education about primates, and increasing the economic benefits
live primates can bring through carefully designed ecotourism
programs."
</P>
<P>
"Only a close link between nature conservation and sustainable
development will ensure healthy primate numbers into the future,"
he affirmed.

<HEADLINE> Abacha Does not Want Another Liberia in Sierra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, Nigeria, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian head of state,
General Sani Abacha said today he hoped that the prolonged peace
efforts in Liberia will not repeat in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the summit of the heads of
states of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
in Abuja, the out-going ECOWAS chairman regretted that while the
sub-region is celebrating the triumph of its peace efforts in
Liberia, the May 25 coup in Sierra Leone has posed another danger
to the sub-regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
"None of us, " he said to his west African counterparts,
"would want us to have the experience that we have just passed in
Liberia."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the on-going summit "must consider and
adopt appropriate measures for the speedy and peaceful resolution
of the crisis".
</P>
<P>
He urged the member countries to explore for prompt resolution
of the crisis in Sierra Leone, as there is no doubt that the
threat to peace in Sierra Leone obviously endangers the peace and
stability of the sub-region.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks on Congolese Conflict to Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- After a one-week suspension,
the peace talks aimed at ending the Congolese conflict is
expected to resume tomorrow in the Gabonese capital Libreville,
sources monitored here said today.
</P>
<P>
Gabonese President Omar Bongo, who is also Chairman of the
international mediation committee on the Congolese conflict, will
preside over the talks.
</P>
<P>
Victor Tamba Tamba, head of the Congolese government
delegation, is expected to arrive in Libreville this evening
while representatives from the former President Sassou Nguesso
are already there.
</P>
<P>
Sources said, the two sides will held discussions on the draft
peace plan put forward by Bongo last week and a final resolution
to the conflict is also expected.
</P>
<P>
So far four peace plans have been drafted by Bongo since
fightings erupted in Brazzaville between forces loyal to
Congolese President Pascal Lissouba and the rival militiamen of
Nguesso.
</P>
<P>
The fourth draft peace plan to be discussed at the negotiation
table suggests that the position of prime minister of the
government be assumed by the rival force.
</P>
<P>
The new premier will be in charge of the army and state

<HEADLINE> Take-off Fund Urged by ECOWAS Ministers to Combat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Ministers responsible for drug
control in west Africa have called on the sub-regional leaders to
provide an initial grant of 150,000 U.S. dollars for the take-off
of a regional plan of action to curb drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The proposal has been submitted for deliberation at the
current 20th summit of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
Donor agencies would be encouraged to contribute to the
regional fund, said the ministers, who gathered in Abuja, capital
of Nigeria, to make preparations for the summit.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS executive secretariat are also expected to seek for
funds to sustain the plan which allocates responsibilities to
member countries and stipulates the mechanism for its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministers, the on-going regional cooperation
in this regard should be intensified through upgrading the
structures for policy and program implementation, the adoption of
uniform laws, human resource development, staff exchange programs
and organization of prisoner transfer between member states.
</P>
<P>
The consequence of illegal drug trafficking were beginning to
be felt, they said, adding that this was reflected by the
increasing drug abuse in cities with the potential negative
political, economic, cultural and security implications for the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
This tragic situation, coupled with the lack of the necessary
human, financial and material resources required to cope with
this scourge, should compel member states to demonstrate the
political will necessary to combat drug abuse and illicit
trafficking effectively.
</P>
<P>
The plan of action emerged from the ministers' May meeting in
Cape Verde, where they also adopted the Praia political
declaration, a political commitment to address the illicit drug
problem within ECOWAS member states.
</P>
<P>
At last year's summit, also in Abuja, sub-regional leaders
agreed to wage a more determined war against the drug problem
within the community.

<HEADLINE> US Economy Grows at 3.6 Percent Rate in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy grew at a
robust 3.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter, scarcely
slackening from the torrid pace set early this year, U.S. Commerce
Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
Today's report on the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), the
sum of all goods and services produced within U.S. borders, marks
a substantial upward revision from an estimate which showed the
economy expanded at 2.2 percent rate in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The revision nearly wiped out what economists had viewed as a
welcome, inflation-calming respite from the rapid 4.9 percent
growth rate in the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the GDP revision was attributed to faster growth in
exports as well as an inventory buildup at wholesalers. But
consumer spending, production of housing and business investment
in new equipment all looked slightly stronger as well.
</P>
<P>
Even with the revisions, the report still shows an abrupt
downshift in the growth rate of consumer spending -- about
two-thirds of U.S. economic output. The report said that real
personal consumption increased 1.0 percent in the second quarter,
compared with an increase of 5.3 percent in the first quarter.
That's a bit stronger than the previous estimate of 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nonresidential fixed investment increased 15.4 percent in the
second quarter, compared with an increase of 4.1 percent in the
first. Business investment in equipment zoomed at a 23.8 percent
annual rate, the best in 14 years
</P>
<P>
Government consumption expenditure increased 6.8 percent in the
quarter, in contrast of a decrease of 5.8 percent in the first
quarter.rst quarter..
</P>
<P>
The report showed that an inflation measure tied to GDP rose at
a scant 1.5 percent annual rate, the mildest in five years.
</P>
<P>
The various changes put the economy's output in the second
quarter at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted annual rate of 7.16
trillion U.S. dollars.
